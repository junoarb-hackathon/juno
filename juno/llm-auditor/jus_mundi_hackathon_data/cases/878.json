PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. REGISTRATION OF THE REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 7, 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") received a request for arbitration (\"the Request\") submitted by Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. (\"**DEI Bermuda**\", or the \"Claimant\", interchangeably), a company organized under the laws of Bermuda. DEI Bermuda is owned by Duke Energy International Latin America Ltd., another Bermudan company, and indirectly, by Duke Energy International LLC (\"**Duke Energy**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Request was submitted in regard to a dispute with the Republic of Peru (\"**Peru**\" and/or the \"**Respondent**\") concerning a legal stability agreement concluded between Peru and DEI Bermuda (the \"**DEI Bermuda LSA**\"). According to DEI Bermuda, Peru has imposed a tax assessment in violation of certain guarantees in the DEI Bermuda LSA. The Request invokes the arbitration provision of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n3.\n\nThe Centre, on October 9, 2003, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Institution Rules**\") acknowledged receipt of the Request and, on the same day, transmitted a copy to Peru and to the Embassy of Peru in Washington, D.C.\n\n4.\n\nThe Request was registered by the Centre on October 24, 2003, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and, on the same day, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**B. CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL AND COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCEEDING**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn January 23, 2004, the parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case was to consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the parties and the third arbitrator who would be the President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the parties. In the event that the parties were to fail to appoint an arbitrator or fail to agree on the President of the Tribunal, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the Centre was to appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed.\n\n6.\n\nClaimant, by a letter of January 23, 2004, appointed Dr. Hector A. Mairal, a national of Argentina, as its arbitrator. Following Dr. Mairal's decision to recuse himself, communicated to the Centre by letter of March 9, 2004, which further communicated the recusal to the parties by letter of March 11, 2004, Claimant, by a letter of March 19, 2004, appointed Dr. Guido S. Tawil, a national of Argentina, as its arbitrator. Respondent, by letter dated February 20, 2004, appointed Dr. Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela, as its arbitrator. By agreement communicated to the Centre by letter of May 12, 2004, the parties appointed Mr. L-Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., a national of Canada, as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointment, the Centre, by a letter of June 3, 2004, informed the parties of the constitution of the Tribunal consisting of Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., Dr. Pedro Nikken and Dr. Guido S. Tawil, and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1). In the same letter the Centre informed the parties that Ms. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Senior Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. WRITTEN AND ORAL PROCEEDINGS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal scheduled a first session for July 28, 2004. The parties, by letter from Claimant (with attachment) of July 26, 2004 and letter from Respondent of the same date, communicated to the Tribunal their agreement on procedural matters identified in the provisional agenda for the first session, which had been sent to them by the Tribunal's Secretary.\n\n9.\n\nIn its letter of July 26, 2004, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it intended to raise objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims, that the parties were unable to agree on the procedure for the jurisdictional phase and that Claimant withheld its agreement to a separate phase on jurisdiction and admissibility. In the same letter, Respondent invoked ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3), according to which the proceedings on the merits are suspended upon the formal raising of an objection that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and proposed a schedule for written submissions and a hearing on the issues of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held as scheduled on July 28, 2004 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The parties reiterated their agreement on the points communicated to the Tribunal in their respective letters of July 26, 2004. In light of Respondent's letter of July 26, 2004, indicating its intention to raise objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims, the President invited the parties to present briefly their views on these issues and on the issue of possible bifurcation of the proceedings. Having considered the views of the parties and the relevant rules and, after having deliberated, the Tribunal decided to suspend the proceedings on the merits pursuant to Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules and to bifurcate the proceedings. It was decided that each party would submit its observations on objections to jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims and that the Tribunal would decide at a later stage whether it would deal with these objections as a preliminary question or join them to the merits of the dispute. The remainder of the procedural issues on the agenda for the session, including the time limits for the jurisdictional submissions, were discussed and agreed. All the conclusions were reflected in the written minutes of the session, signed by the President and Secretary of the Tribunal, and provided to the parties as well as all members of the Tribunal.\n\n**1. Written Submissions on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on October 4, 2004, Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on December 6, 2004, and Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on January 24, 2005.\n\n12.\n\nOn February 3, 2005, Claimant requested the Tribunal to grant Claimant an extension until March 11, 2005 to submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. Claimant cited as the reason for this request the fact that the extension would give Claimant approximately the same amount of time to file its Rejoinder as Respondent had to file its Reply. Respondent, in a letter of February 4, 2005, objected to Claimant's request, stating that the extension would unfairly burden Respondent and prejudice its preparation for the pre-hearing conference (which had been scheduled for March 14, 2005) and the hearing itself.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing a further letter from Claimant dated February 5, 2005 and a further letter from Respondent dated February 7, 2005, the Tribunal, by its Secretary's letter of February 7, 2005, communicated to the parties its decision to grant Claimant an extension until March 9, 2005 to file its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. By the same letter, the Tribunal indicated that the date for the pre-hearing conference (*i.e.*, March 14, 2005) remained unchanged.\n\n14.\n\nIn compliance with the Tribunal's decision, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on March 9, 2005.\n\n**2. Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn November 24, 2004, Respondent filed with the Tribunal a Request for Provisional Measures, which had been raised initially by Respondent at the first session with the Tribunal on July 28, 2004 and recorded in paragraph 20 of the minutes of that session. Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures asked the Tribunal to recommend that Duke Energy withdraw a petition it had filed before the United States Trade Representative (\"**USTR**\") to revoke or suspend Peru's beneficiary status under the *Andean Trade Preference Act* (\"**ATPA**\"). Respondent also requested that the Tribunal recommend that Duke Energy seek no new remedy in any non-ICSID proceeding and that the Tribunal suspend all ICSID proceedings concerning this dispute until Duke Energy complied with the Tribunal's recommendations.\n\n16.\n\nAs a first step, following further submissions from the parties on Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures, the Tribunal, through its Secretary's letter of December 22, 2004, requested the parties to file additional submissions on the following question:\n\nCan a party claim lack of consent on the one hand (for purposes of Articles 25 and 41 of the ICSID Convention) and, on the other, its right to the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings (including preclusion of the other party's right to seek diplomatic protection) based on the existence of consent (for purposes of Articles 26, 27 and 47 of the ICSID Convention)?\n\nAt the Tribunal's request, the parties exchanged a first round of submissions on this single issue on January 6, 2005, and a second round of submissions on January 12, 2005.\n\n17.\n\nHaving been informed by letter from Claimant of January 19, 2005, that the results of the preliminary review of the petition to the USTR in respect of Peru had been postponed to May 31, 2005, the Tribunal, through its Secretary's letter of January 27, 2005, informed the parties that it had decided to defer its decision on Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures until such time as both parties had had a full opportunity to present their respective positions. In the same letter, the Tribunal invited Claimant to respond to the Request for Provisional Measures within two weeks and invited Respondent to reply to Claimant within a further two weeks. The Tribunal also indicated in that letter that it would hear the parties' oral arguments on this issue at the start of the hearing on jurisdiction on March 29, 2005. Finally, the Tribunal invited the parties to communicate to the USTR the existence and current status of the ICSID arbitration, noting that Section 3202(c)(2)(C)(iii) of the ATPA appeared to offer some protection to countries whose ATPA beneficiary status was threatened if a dispute over the expropriation alleged in the petition to the office of the USTR had been submitted to arbitration under the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n18.\n\nIn compliance with the Tribunal's directions, the parties sent a joint letter to the USTR on February 1, 2005, together with copies of the submissions filed with the Tribunal in this proceeding. Following the receipt of the parties' submissions, the USTR informed the parties on February 24, 2005 that it had decided to suspend its review of Duke Energy's petition for the withdrawal or suspension of Peru's beneficiary status under the ATPA during the pendency of this proceeding. In light of the USTR's decision, Respondent, by letter of February 24, 2005, withdrew its Request for Provisional Measures without prejudice to refiling such a request if the USTR were subsequently to revisit its decision.\n\n**3. Respondent's Request under Arbitration Rule 34(2)**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of October 21, 2004, Claimant asked the *Superintendencia Nacional de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria* (\"**SUNAT**\") to provide Claimant with documentation contained in SUNAT's files regarding Claimant's subsidiary DEI Egenor (as defined in paragraph 43, below). By letter of November 4, 2004, Respondent, citing this request, accused Claimant of attempting to conduct unauthorized discovery and requested the Tribunal to direct Claimant to desist from seeking information without the permission of the Tribunal under Arbitration Rule 34(2). By letter of November 22, 2004, Claimant cited what it considered to be its entitlement to seek information under Peru's Transparency Law1 and informed the Tribunal that on November 5, 2004, SUNAT had made available to Claimant the requested file. This was confirmed by Respondent's letter of December 3, 2004. By its Secretary's letter of December 14, 2004, the Tribunal informed the parties that inasmuch as the file containing the requested documents had already been produced, it considered the specific issue raised by Respondent's November 4, 2004 letter to be moot and reminded both parties to respect the terms of Arbitration Rule 34(2).\n\nUnified Text of the Law of Transparency and Access to Public Information, approved by Supreme Decree 43-2003-PCM.\n\n**4. The Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nFollowing the pre-hearing call with the parties of March 14, 2005, at which the parties had indicated that they were not intending to call any witnesses at the hearing, the Tribunal, through its Secretary's letter of March 15, 2005, requested each party to call one witness of its choice to address the history of the negotiations between Peru and Duke Energy in connection with the issues relevant to jurisdiction. By letter of March 17, 2005, Respondent nominated as its witness Mr. Carlos Herrera. By letter of same date, Claimant nominated as its witness Dr. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Amado. During the pre-hearing call, the parties confirmed their agreement to the appointment of Martin J. Valasek, an associate of the Chairman, as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule agreed on July 28, 2004, the hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on March 29-30, 2005. The parties were represented at the hearing by their respective counsel, who made presentations to the Tribunal and examined the witnesses. Members of the Tribunal also questioned witnesses. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal* : Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., President; Dr. Guido S. Tawil and Dr. Pedro Nikken.\n\n*Secretary to the Tribunal* : Ms. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, ICSID Secretariat.\n\n*Assistant to the Tribunal:* Mr. Martin J. Valasek, Ogilvy Renault LLP.\n\n*Attending on behalf of the Claimant* : Messrs. C. Mark Baker, Arif H. Ali and Baiju S. Vasani, from Fulbright & Jaworski LLP; Mr. Dean M. Moesser and Ms. Dora Avenda\u00f1o, from Duke Energy; and Dr. Luis G. Miranda and Dr. Italo Carrano from Miranda & Amado Abogados.\n\n*Attending on behalf of the Respondent* : H.E. Eduardo Ferrero, Ambassador of Peru in Washington, D.C.; Dra. Cecilia Blume, Chief of Staff, Ministry of Economy; Dr. Aurelio Loret de Mola, Advisor, Ministry of Economy; Messrs. Alejandro Riveros, Italo Acha and Renzo Villa, Embassy of Peru in Washington, D.C.; Dr. Jorge Santistevan, of Santistevan de Noriega & Gutierrez, Counsel for Respondent; from Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP: Messrs. Daniel M. Price, Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Alan Charles Raul, Nicol\u00e1s Lloreda, Patricio Gran\u00e9 and Cassidy Pinegar.\n\n22.\n\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the Tribunal considered Claimant's letters of March 25 and March 28, 2005, and Respondent's letters in reply thereto dated March 28, 2005. The Tribunal decided to admit the additional exhibits which were attached to the parties' letters, inasmuch as these were considered to be helpful to the Tribunal's consideration of the jurisdictional issues, but decided to exclude the content of Claimant's March 28, 2005 letter on the basis that it was an unsolicited and irregular pleading.\n\n23.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of communication, including a meeting for deliberations in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 2005.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. PERU'S INVESTMENT PROTECTION SCHEME**\n------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe current scheme for the promotion and protection of foreign investment in Peru originated in the early 1990s. At that time, Peru began efforts to attract and promote investment in the country, reversing the policies pursued by previous administrations.\n\n25.\n\nIt was in this context that Law No. 25327 was adopted, authorizing the Executive Branch to legislate on matters of investment and investment protection. Pursuant to it, Legislative Decree No. 662 (Foreign Investment Law), Legislative Decree No. 674 (Privatization Law) and Legislative Decree No. 757 (Private Investment Law) were promulgated, as were the Regulations of the Regime to Guarantee Private Investment, approved by Supreme Decree No. 162-92-EF (\"**Investment Regulations**\").\n\n26.\n\nThese instruments provide various guarantees to foreign investors in Peru. In connection with a specific investment, the various guarantees may be implemented through binding contracts referred to as \"legal stability agreements\" (\"**LSA**\"), entered into by Peru and the foreign investor. The authorization to enter into LSAs is contained in the Foreign Investment Law and the Private Investment Law. Relevant provisions of both laws are typically incorporated by reference into such agreements.\n\n27.\n\nThe standard text for all LSAs is incorporated as an annex to the Investment Regulations. The standard text refers in general terms to the stabilization of legal regimes applicable to various fundamental rights of foreign investors, including: (i) the right to equal treatment and non-discrimination; (ii) the right to free convertibility of foreign currency; (iii) the right to free repatriation of invested capital, profits and royalties; (iv) the right to income tax stabilization; and (v) the right to resolve disputes arising out of or in connection with the agreement by international arbitration in accordance with Peru's international treaty obligations, or other agreed method.\n\n28.\n\nUnder Peruvian law, the *Civil Code* provisions governing private contracts in general are also applicable to LSAs and, as such, these agreements are subject to the principle of *Contrato-Ley*, as set forth in Article 1357 of the 1984 *Civil Code*. That Article states as follows:\n\n**Garant\u00eda y seguridad del Estado.** Por ley, sustentada en razones de inter\u00e9s social, nacional o p\u00fablico, pueden establecerse garant\u00edas y seguridades otorgadas por el Estado mediante contrato.2\n\nUnofficial Translation : By law, supported by reasons of social, national or public interest, the State may establish guarantees and assurances by means of a contract.\n\n29.\n\nArticle 39 of the Private Investment Law confirms the foregoing:\n\nLos convenios de estabilidad jur\u00eddica se celebran al amparo del art\u00edculo 1357 del C\u00f3digo Civil y tienen la calidad de contratos con fuerza de ley, de manera que no pueden ser modificados o dejados sin efecto unilateralmente por el Estado. Tales contratos tienen car\u00e1cter civil y no administrativo, y solo podr\u00e1n modificarse o dejarse sin efecto por acuerdo entre las partes.3\n\nUnofficial Translation : Legal stability investment agreements shall be concluded subject to Article 1357 of the Civil Code and shall have the [legal] effect of contracts enforceable as law, such that they may not be modified or terminated unilaterally by the State. Such contracts shall have a private rather than administrative character, and shall only be modified or terminated by agreement between the parties.\n\n30.\n\nFurthermore, as set forth in the last paragraph of Article 62 of the Constitution of Peru, the investment protections provided for by LSAs are guaranteed by the Constitution: :\n\nLa libertad de contratar garantiza que las partes pueden pactar v\u00e1lidamente seg\u00fan las normas vigentes al tiempo del contrato. Los t\u00e9rminos contractuales no pueden ser modificados por leyes u otras disposiciones de cualquier clase. Los conflictos derivados de la relaci\u00f3n contractual s\u00f3lo se solucionan en la via arbitral o en la judicial, seg\u00fan los mecanismos de protecci\u00f3n previstos en el contrato o contemplados en la ley.\n\nMediante Contratos-ley, el Estado puede establecer garant\u00edas y otorgar seguridades. No pueden ser modificados legislativamente, sin perjuicio de la protecci\u00f3n a que se refiere el p\u00e1rrafo precedente.4\n\nUnofficial Translation : Liberty to contract guarantees that parties may validly agree according to the legal norms in force at the time of the contract. Contract terms may not be modified by law or other dispositions of any type. Conflicts that arise from contractual relations may only be resolved by arbitration or judicial decree, according to the mechanisms of protection set forth in the contract or contemplated by law.  \nThrough contracts-law [special investment-related private contracts of an obligatory character], the State may establish guarantees and grant securities. These may not be modified by legislation, without prejudice to the protection referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n\n31.\n\nThus, pursuant to the investment laws of Peru, the main features of LSAs are that (i) the stabilized legal regimes cannot be changed unilaterally by the State, and (ii) the agreements are subject to private or civil law and not administrative law. As private-law contracts, the negotiation, execution, interpretation and enforcement of the provisions set forth in LSAs are subject to the general principles applicable to contracts between private parties under the Peruvian *Civil Code.* As such, the fundamental rights granted by Peru pursuant to an LSA are private contractual rights that are enforceable against the State as if it were a private party.\n\n**B. THE PRIVATIZATION OF EGENOR**\n----------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nIn 1991, Peru began to pursue a far-reaching privatization program designed to attract the participation, in particular, of international investors. For this purpose, the Privatization Law established the *Comisi\u00f3n para la Promoci\u00f3n de la Inversi\u00f3n Privada* (\"**COPRI**\"), a Peruvian inter-ministerial body charged with overall supervision of the privatization process.\n\n33.\n\nIn implementing its privatization mandate, COPRI selected the largest state-owned electricity generation company in the country, Electricidad del Per\u00fa S.A. or Electroper\u00fa S.A. (\"**Electroper\u00fa**\"), to be restructured into distinct, smaller electricity companies for privatization. In September 1994, as part of the privatization process, COPRI authorized the creation of a company named Empresa de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Nor Per\u00fa S.A. (\"**Egenor**\"), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electroper\u00fa. Thereafter, assets were transferred to Egenor from three state-owned companies, including Electroper\u00fa.\n\n34.\n\nCOPRI adopted the following privatization model for Egenor: a controlling 60 percent of the shares of Egenor, representing the company's Class \"A\" shares, would be sold to a private investor through an international tender process (the \"**60 Percent Tranche**\"); 30 percent of the shares, these being Class \"B\" shares, would be retained by Electroper\u00fa for a subsequent public offering or share auction (the \"**30 Percent Tranche**\"); and the remaining 10 percent of the shares (also Class \"B\" shares) would be held for sale to Electroper\u00fa's employees.\n\n35.\n\nFor each state-owned company being privatized, COPRI established a special committee, known as *Comit\u00e9 Especial de Privatizaci\u00f3n* (\"**CEPRI**\"), responsible for managing and implementing the privatization process, based on guidelines, objectives and policies approved by COPRI. The privatization program for Electroper\u00fa was administered by the *Comit\u00e9 Especial de Promoci\u00f3n de la Inversion Privada en Electroper\u00fa S.A.* (\"**CEPRI-ELP**\"). By February 1996, CEPRI-ELP had approved the *Bases del Concurso P\u00fablico Internacional para la Venta de Egenor* (the \"**Bidding Rules\"**) for the privatization of Egenor, setting out the rules governing the relationship between Peru and the investor with regard to the tender bid. On February 28, 1996, CEPRI-ELP issued its privatization tender for Egenor.\n\n36.\n\nThe winning bidder for the 60 Percent Tranche was Dominion Energy, Inc. (\"**Dominion**\") of the United States of America, which presented its bid through a locally incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary, Inversiones Dominion Per\u00fa S.A. (\"**IDP**\"). On August 9, 1996, a privatization agreement, governing the purchase of the 60 Percent Tranche, was executed between Electroper\u00fa and IDP, with Dominion and Egenor as intervening parties (the \"**Privatization Agreement**\"). Under the Privatization Agreement, Dominion (as \"Operator\" and \"Holder of the Committed Interest\") was required to maintain control of Egenor with a minimum stake totaling 51 percent of IDP.\n\n37.\n\nOn November 27, 1996, the majority shareholders of Egenor, *i.e.*, IDP (60 percent) and Electroper\u00fa (39.98 percent), approved the merger of Egenor and Power North S.A., a shell corporation established by IDP. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, Egenor S.A., the resulting corporation, assumed all of the assets and debts of Egenor and Power North S.A. The merger of Egenor and the shell corporation, Power North S.A., was consummated on December 31, 1996 by IDP (60 percent), Electroper\u00fa (39.98 percent), and Electrolima S.A. (0.02 percent).\n\n38.\n\nIn 1997, Dominion sold 49 percent of IDP to Gener S.A., a Chilean company. On March 31, 1998, Dominion transferred its remaining 51 percent of IDP to Dominion Holdings Peru S.A. (\"**DHP**\"), a wholly-owned Peruvian subsidiary. Toward the end of 1998, Duke Energy learned of Dominion's interest in selling its assets in Central and South America, including Peru. Duke Energy was focusing on a coordinated acquisition of a full 90 percent of Egenor (then named Egenor S.A.), representing its total outstanding or available stock (*i.e.*, the 60 Percent Tranche owned by IDP and the 30 Percent Tranche owned by Peru).\n\n39.\n\nDuke Energy acquired Egenor through a series of transactions in late 1999. To comply with Peru's \"two shareholders\" rule, the acquisitions were completed through two Delaware-based Duke Energy subsidiaries: Duke Energy International Peru Holdings No. 1 LLC (\"**DEI Holdings No. 1**\") and Duke Energy International Peru Holdings No. 2 LLC (\"**DEI Holdings No. 2**\", and together with DEI Holdings No. 1, \"**DEI Holdings USA**\"). On October 7, 1999, DEI Holdings USA acquired the 30 Percent Tranche of Egenor S.A.A.5 On October 12, 1999, DEI Holdings USA also acquired 49 percent of IDP from Gener S.A. (and hence Gener S.A.'s indirect 29.4 percent ownership interest in Egenor S.A.A.). Finally, on November 11, 1999, DEI Holdings USA acquired the remaining 51 percent of IDP by purchasing 100 percent of DHP from Dominion.\n\nOn April 16, 1999, Egenor S.A. amended its bylaws and changed its name to Egenor S.A.A. in accordance with the new *Ley General de Sociedades*.\n\n40.\n\nAs of the end of 1999, Duke Energy had become (through DEI Holdings USA) the 90 percent owner of Egenor S.A.A. for which it had paid approximately US$ 288 million.6\n\nDuke Energy later increased its interest in Egenor S.A.A. (by that time named Duke Energy International Egenor S.A.A., which we have defined below as DEI Egenor) from 90 percent to 99.7 percent by a tender offer initiated in July 2001 by DEI Egenor.\n\n41.\n\nDominion's sale of DHP (*i.e.*, of its 51 percent interest in IDP) to DEI Holdings USA was subject to the approval of COPRI pursuant to the terms of the Privatization Agreement. Under the Privatization Agreement, Dominion (as Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest) was obligated to maintain its 51 percent interest in IDP for five years from the date of the Agreement (*i.e.*, until August 2001), unless another entity (to which the interest was being transferred) could meet the requirements specified in the Bidding Rules for the Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest. COPRI approved the sale of DHP, and thus Dominion's ownership interest in Egenor, to Duke Energy (through DEI Holdings USA) on September 22, 1999. On October 5, 1999, Dominion obtained and provided Duke Energy with a Guarantee Agreement between IDP and Peru (\"**Guarantee Agreement**\") pursuant to which Peru guaranteed, in connection with the 60 Percent Tranche, that all of the original obligations assumed, representations and warranties made, and liabilities of Electroper\u00fa remained effective and enforceable against Peru.\n\n42.\n\nDuke Energy's acquisition of Dominion's Latin American assets had a number of international tax implications which Duke Energy intended to account for in a corporate reorganization. At the same time, Duke Energy needed to implement an ownership structure for Egenor S.A.A. generally mirroring the structure reflected in the Privatization Agreement. It was against this backdrop that DEI Bermuda was incorporated in August 1999. Subsequently, in May 2000, Duke Energy International Peru Holdings SRL (\"**DEI Peru Holdings**\") was established as a holding company wholly-owned by DEI Bermuda.\n\n43.\n\nOn July 26, 2000, Egenor S.A.A. changed its name to Duke Energy International Egenor S.A.A. (\"**DEI Egenor**\"). This entity changed its name to Duke Energy International Egenor S.A. in February 2001 and on June 26, 2003, to Duke Energy International Egenor S en C por A, evidencing a change in its corporate form.\n\n44.\n\nOn October 29, 2002, DEI Bermuda acquired 99 percent of DHP from DEI Holdings USA (and hence 51 percent of IDP), and the remaining 49 percent of IDP from DEI Holdings USA. On December 1, 2002, DHP and IDP merged to form Duke Energy International Peru Inversiones No. 1 SRL (\"**DEI Investments SRL**\"), as a result of which DEI Bermuda became the 99 percent owner of DEI Investments SRL, through which it owned 60 percent of DEI Egenor. The remaining 30 percent of DEI Egenor continued to be held by DEI Holdings USA.\n\n45.\n\nOn December 18, 2002, Duke Energy made a capital contribution of US$ 200 million to DEI Peru Holdings, through DEI Bermuda. DEI Peru Holdings used these funds to acquire 90 percent of the capital stock of DEI Egenor from DEI Investments SRL and DEI Holdings USA.7\n\n*See* Independent Auditors' Report dated April 3, 2003, Claimant's Exhibit 58.\n\n**C. THE INVESTMENT PROTECTION GRANTED BY PERU**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investment Protection Granted to Dominion**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAs an integral part of the Egenor privatization program and Dominion's investment in Peru, Peru approved LSAs for Dominion, IDP and Egenor.\n\n47.\n\nSpecifically, shortly after Electroper\u00fa executed the Privatization Agreement, Peru entered into two LSAs on July 24, 1996: one with IDP, as an investor in Egenor (the \"**IDP Domestic Investor LSA**\"); the other with Egenor, as a recipient of the investment from IDP (the \"**Egenor LSA**\"). Under the former, IDP undertook to pay US$ 228.2 million for 60 percent of the capital stock of Egenor. Under the latter, Egenor agreed to issue shares representing 60 percent of its capital stock in favor of IDP.\n\n48.\n\nOn August 9, 1996, Peru entered into two additional LSAs: one with Dominion, as a US$ 228.2 million foreign investor in IDP (the \"**Dominion LSA**\"); the other with IDP, as a US$ 228.2 million investment recipient from Dominion (the \"**IDP Recipient LSA**\").\n\n49.\n\nPeru agreed to guarantee legal stability, in accordance with the terms of these LSAs and the foreign investment laws of Peru, for a period of 10 years, from the effective date of the respective LSAs. The Dominion LSA provided for ICSID arbitration, in the following terms:\n\n**TEN**.- It being the intention of both parties that problems arising in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement be resolved as expeditiously as possible, the parties agree hereinafter that any dispute, controversy or claim between them, relative to the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement, shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to be resolved by de jure international arbitration, pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Rules set forth in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States which was approved by Peru pursuant to Legislative Resolution N. 26210.\n\nThe costs incurred in connection with the application of this clause shall be shared by both parties in equal parts.\n\n**2. The Investment Protection Granted to Duke Energy**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn connection with its investment in Peru, Duke Energy sought to obtain the same investment protection, through LSAs, as Dominion had obtained. Duke Energy and its outside counsel worked with Peru on different structures by which Duke Energy would obtain protection for its investment. The possibility of transferring or assigning to Duke Energy at least some of the LSAs that had been entered into by Dominion was seriously and actively considered. These discussions took place while Duke Energy was taking steps to acquire the various direct and indirect interests in Egenor S.A.A.\n\n51.\n\nIn the event, the Dominion LSA was not assigned due to concerns regarding its effectiveness due to a possible incurable default by Dominion under the LSA. As of the closing date for DEI Holdings USA's acquisition of the 30 Percent Tranche (*i.e.*, October 7, 1999), the first step in Duke Energy's indirect acquisition of Egenor S.A.A., no mutually acceptable solution had been identified to implement the investment protection regime for Duke Energy. It was thus agreed that DEI Holdings USA would be given an interim LSA, based on the express understanding that it would complete its acquisition of the 60 Percent Tranche of Egenor S.A.A. within 60 days of the date of this interim LSA. Peru and DEI Holdings USA thus executed a foreign investor LSA relating to the 30 Percent Tranche (the \"**DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA**\") on October 13, 1999.\n\n52.\n\nOn October 14, 1999, the Egenor LSA was assigned to Egenor S.A.A. This assignment was performed in order \"to extend the rights granted by the Legal Stability Agreement dated July 24, 1996, signed by Empresa de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Nor Per\u00fa S.A. - E.G.E.N.O.R. to Egenor S.A.A.\"8 By the end of 1999, Duke Energy had become the owner of 90 percent of Egenor S.A.A. However, a solution regarding the assignment of the Dominion LSA had not yet been found.\n\n*See Resoluci\u00f3n Ministerial* No. 566-99-EM/VME, dated October 6, 1999, Respondent's Exhibit 45.\n\n53.\n\nAs explained earlier, as part of Duke Energy's corporate reorganization, DEI Bermuda was incorporated in August 1999 and DEI Peru Holdings, wholly-owned by DEI Bermuda, was established in May 2000. With reference to the Privatization Agreement, DEI Bermuda was designated as the Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest and DEI Peru Holdings was designated as the bidder and owner of DEI Egenor. Thus, following an application by Duke Energy that was accepted by Peru, DEI Bermuda took the place of Dominion, and DEI Peru Holdings took the place of IDP, under the Privatization Agreement.\n\n54.\n\nIn February 2000, Duke Energy presented Peru with a proposal to obtain the same foreign investor protections that it would have obtained under the Dominion LSA, if the latter had been assignable. The proposal was premised on the requirements of the Privatization Agreement, Duke Energy's corporate and tax-related reorganization strategy as well as the need to maintain the effectiveness of the LSAs that were already in place (*i.e.*, the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, the IDP Domestic Investor LSA, and the Egenor LSA).\n\n55.\n\nThe proposal presented by Duke Energy was implemented as follows:\n\n1. application for a foreign investor LSA by DEI Bermuda;\n\n2. application for a recipient company LSA by DEI Peru Holdings;\n\n3. the assignment of the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, as modified, in favor of DEI Peru Holdings; and\n\n4. the assignment of the IDP Domestic Investor LSA in favor of DEI Peru Holdings.\n\n56.\n\nOn June 20, 2000, Duke Energy filed its request for a foreign investor LSA, through DEI Bermuda, with Peru (previously defined as the DEI Bermuda LSA). A second application for a recipient company LSA was filed that same day through DEI Peru Holdings (the \"**DEI Peru Holdings LSA**\").\n\n57.\n\nOn April 3, 2001, Peru provided drafts of the DEI Bermuda LSA and the DEI Peru Holdings LSA to Duke Energy's outside counsel for review. With respect to the former, Duke Energy reverted to Peru to request that the draft LSA be modified to provide for ICSID arbitration:\n\nWe hereby advise you that, with the exception of the suggestion contained in the following paragraph, we agree with the text of the draft Legal Stability Agreement you submitted.\n\nWithout prejudice of the above, we hereby request that Clause Nine of the draft agreement submitted be amended so that in case it is necessary to resolve any conflict or controversy among the parties, it is done by means of international de jure arbitration, in accordance with Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, and not by means of national arbitration, because the investor is established abroad.\n\nThe substantial delay of almost 10 months between Duke Energy's application for the DEI Bermuda and DEI Peru Holdings LSAs and Peru's response can be attributed to a strong backlash against legal stability agreements in Peru.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, on July 24, 2001, Peru executed the DEI Bermuda LSA and the DEI Peru Holdings LSA. By their terms, the LSAs were effective immediately. The final version of the DEI Bermuda LSA executed by the parties contained an ICSID arbitration clause, in precisely the same terms as the clause that had been included in the Dominion LSA.9\n\n*See* above, para. 49.\n\n59.\n\nThe DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA and the IDP Domestic Investor LSA were assigned to DEI Peru Holdings on April 3 and March 14, 2003, respectively.\n\n**D. THE TAX ASSESSMENT AND TAX AMNESTY**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nIn the midst of Duke Energy's corporate restructuring of its Peruvian holdings, on November 24, 2000, SUNAT initiated a tax audit of DEI Egenor for tax year 1999 (*i.e.*, the tax compliance of Egenor S.A.A.). SUNAT expanded the scope of the audit to include tax years 1996, 1997, and 1998 (*i.e.* the tax compliance of Egenor and Egenor S.A.) on May 9, 2001.\n\n61.\n\nOn November 22, 2001, SUNAT assessed a tax liability of approximately US$ 48 million against DEI Egenor for what SUNAT determined were tax underpayments in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, including interest and penalties (the \"**Tax Assessment**\").\n\n62.\n\nThe Tax Assessment had two main components. The first component was based on SUNAT's view, under its interpretation of Rule VIII of the Peruvian Tax Code, that the 1996 merger between Egenor and Power North S.A. (\"**Power North**\"), resulting in the creation of Egenor S.A. was a sham transaction concluded solely to take improper advantage of tax benefits provided for under Merger Revaluation Law No. 26283 (the \"**Merger Revaluation Assessment**\"). Under its interpretation of Rule VIII, SUNAT determined that it had the authority to disregard the merger on the grounds that it was concluded to circumvent the payment of taxes.\n\n63.\n\nThe second component was based on SUNAT's view that Egenor should have depreciated the assets that Electroper\u00fa had transferred to it during the privatization process using a special decelerated depreciation rate that had been provided by SUNAT to Electroper\u00fa in December 1995, rather than the general statutory depreciation rate set forth in the income tax regulations (the \"**Depreciation Assessment**\").\n\n64.\n\nDEI Egenor decided to apply for amnesty, under an explicit reservation of rights, for a portion of the assessment, and appealed the balance of the assessment to the Peruvian Tax Court.\n\n65.\n\nOn December 24, 2001, DEI Egenor applied for tax amnesty in connection with the Merger Revaluation Assessment. On March 21, 2002, SUNAT accepted DEI Egenor's amnesty application. The amnesty payment, totalling approximately US$ 12 million, was made through the relinquishment of various loss carry-overs, using advance income tax overpayment credits, and a small cash payment.\n\n66.\n\nWith respect to the Depreciation Assessment, DEI Egenor initiated an administrative complaint with SUNAT. In September 2002, SUNAT notified DEI Egenor that its complaint had been rejected. SUNAT restated its demand for collection of the Depreciation Assessment, with additional interest and penalties for non-payment. On September 23, 2002, DEI Egenor appealed SUNAT's denial of its claim to the Tax Court.\n\n67.\n\nAs we noted earlier, on October 6, 2003, Claimant filed for ICSID arbitration under the DEI Bermuda LSA. On April 23, 2004, the Tax Court issued its decision, finding mainly in favor of SUNAT and against DEI Egenor. On July 27, 2004, SUNAT issued a revised tax assessment against DEI Egenor, in accordance with the Tax Court's decision, for approximately US$ 26 million.\n\n68.\n\nOn August 27, 2004, DEI Egenor applied for amnesty in connection with the Depreciation Assessment. On August 27, 2004, SUNAT accepted DEI Egenor's amnesty application. On the same date, DEI Egenor paid the amnesty amount, in cash, in the sum of S/. 43,721,786.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n69.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention is the touchstone for determining the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Article 25 provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n70.\n\nRespondent has raised objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis*. In the alternative, Respondent has raised objections to the admissibility of Claimant's claims. The Tribunal considers each of Respondent's objections in turn.\n\n**A. JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE MATERIAE***\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n71.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention restricts the subject-matter jurisdiction of this Tribunal to a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment... which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\n72.\n\nRespondent argues that the only legally relevant investment for purposes of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is the US$ 200 million capital contribution by DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings. Respondent takes the position that the claims in this arbitration, which relate to Duke Energy's indirect investment in DEI Egenor, cannot arise out of the DEI Bermuda LSA and are not covered by the parties' consent to arbitration in the arbitration agreement contained in Clause Nine thereof.\n\n73.\n\nClaimant takes the position that the contemporaneous documentary evidence, and the testimony of its witnesses, provide the necessary context for understanding the DEI Bermuda LSA and demonstrate that Peru understood and accepted the broad scope of the parties' consent to ICSID arbitration in Clause Nine thereof. According to Claimant, Peru's consent to ICSID arbitration was provided in connection with Duke Energy's multimillion-dollar acquisition of DEI Egenor in the context of its privatization. Thus, Claimant argues that Peru, when it approved the DEI Bermuda LSA, fully understood and accepted that it was consenting to resolve any disputes \"relative to\" Duke Energy's investment in DEI Egenor through ICSID arbitration.\n\n**2. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nTo evaluate the parties' arguments, the Tribunal analyzes (a) the scope of the arbitration agreement (which contains the parties' written consent to ICSID arbitration), (b) the nature of the dispute in question, and (c) the proper characterization of the relevant investment.\n\n**(a) The Arbitration Agreement**\n---------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nClaimant asserts that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is derived from the consent to ICSID arbitration contained in Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA. Clause Nine reads as follows:\n\nIt being the intention of both parties that problems arising in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement be resolved as expeditiously as possible, the parties agree hereinafter that any dispute, controversy or claim between them, concerning the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement, shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to be resolved by de jure international arbitration, pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Rules set forth in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States which was approved by Peru pursuant to Legislative Resolution N. 26210.\n\nThe costs incurred in connection with the application of this clause shall be shared by both parties in equal parts.\n\n76.\n\nICSID jurisprudence, cited by both parties, confirms that an arbitration agreement should be interpreted with due respect for the principle of good faith, should not follow an *a priori* strict or broad construction, and should be construed to achieve an objectively fair and functional solution that is consistent with the underlying facts.\n\n77.\n\nFor example, in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest-Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI) v. the Republic of Senegal*, a case relied upon by both Claimant and Respondent, the Tribunal held that:\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal an arbitration agreement, like any agreement, must be interpreted with due respect for the principle of good faith, that is to say, taking account of the consequences of their commitments which the parties must be considered to have reasonably and legitimately contemplated. It is this course, rather than that of an *a priori* strict or, on the contrary, broad or liberal interpretation, which the Tribunal has followed.10\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest-Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI) v. the Republic of Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, Award of February 25, 1988, published in Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XVII (1992), pp. 42-72, at para. 4.10\n\n78.\n\nSimilarly, in *Amco Asia Corp. et al v. The Republic of Indonesia*, also relied upon by both parties, the Tribunal found that:\n\n[A] convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common indeed, to all legal systems of internal law and to international law. Moreover - and this is again a general principle of law - any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.11\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. et al v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/8, Decision on Jurisdiction of September 25, 1983, published in 1 ICSID Reports, p. 394 at para. 14; cited with approval in *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka A.S. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of May 24, 1999, at footnote 5. See also *Cable TV v. St. Kitts and Nevis*, ICSID Case ARB/95/2, Award of January 13, 1997, 13 ICSID Review - FILJ 328, 386 (1998).\n\n79.\n\nFor the purpose of construing Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, the Tribunal will focus in particular on the following sentence: the parties agree hereinafter that any dispute, controversy or claim between them, concerning the interpretation, performance or validity of this agreement, shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\"\n\n80.\n\nOn the one hand, the Tribunal notes that the consent to ICSID arbitration contained in Clause Nine is expressed as being restricted to \"this Agreement\" (i.e., the DEI Bermuda LSA), and thus does not expressly extend to the other LSAs entered into by Respondent in connection with the investment protection granted to Duke Energy, namely the DEI Peru Holdings LSA, the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, the IDP Domestic Investor LSA and the Egenor LSA.12\n\n*See* Section II.C.2, above.\n\n81.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal also notes that in relation to the DEI Bermuda LSA, the parties consented to ICSID jurisdiction in the broadest terms, covering \"any dispute, controversy or claim between them, concerning the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement.\" In respect of disputes under the DEI Bermuda LSA, it appears to the Tribunal that the parties intended to submit to ICSID arbitration any dispute, controversy or claim arising between them if it concerned the interpretation, performance or validity of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore determine whether the dispute before it concerns the interpretation, performance or validity of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**(b) The Nature of the Dispute**\n---------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe dispute at issue in this arbitration is defined by the claims submitted to the Centre by Claimant. These are stated in the Request for Arbitration, and are formulated as follows:\n\n1. breach of the guarantee of non-discrimination and equal treatment of DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, in violation of Clause Three, Section 5 of the DEI Bermuda LSA;13\n\n2. breach of the guarantee of tax stabilization with respect to DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, in violation of Clause Three, Section 1 of the DEI Bermuda LSA;14\n\n3. breach of the guarantee regarding the free repatriation of DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, in violation of Clause Three, Section 3 of the DEI Bermuda LSA;15 and\n\n4. breach of the obligations of good faith and fair dealing and the *Doctrina de los actos propios* in connection with DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, obligations that are implied under the Peruvian *Civil Code* in all contracts, and here specifically in the DEI Bermuda LSA.16\n\n*See* Request for Arbitration, paras. 42-44.\n\n*See* Request for Arbitration, paras. 45-49.\n\n*See* Request for Arbitration, paras. 50-51.\n\n*See* Request for Arbitration, paras. 52-56.\n\n84.\n\nClause Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA contains the \"contractual\" obligations (except those implied under the Peruvian *Civil Code*) that Claimant alleges Respondent has failed to perform. Clause Three sets out, in five sections, the specific terms according to which Respondent guarantees legal stability for Claimant \"in connection with the investment referred in Clause Two.\"\n\n85.\n\nClauses Two and Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA will be reproduced here since they are crucial to the Tribunal's analysis:\n\nTWO - By virtue of this Agreement DUKE ENERGY\n\nINTERNATIONAL agrees to the following:\n\n1. To make contributions to the capital stock of the company DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL PERU HOLDINGS, S.R.L., incorporated in the city of Lima, registered in Entry No. 1184295 of the Registry of Companies of the Office of Registration of Lima and Callao, in the amount of U.S. $ 200,000,000 (Two hundred million Dollars of the United States of America) within a term of no more than two (2) years, from the date of execution of this Agreement.\n\n2. To channel the foreign capital contribution referred to in section 1 above, through the National Financial System, as evidenced in the certification to be issued by the bank involved in such transaction.\n\n3. To register its foreign investment referred to in section 1 above, and valued in freely convertible currency, with CONITE.\n\nTHREE - By virtue of this Agreement, the STATE, and as long as it remains in effect, in connection with the investment referred in CLAUSE TWO, the STATE guarantees legal stability for DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL, according to the following terms:\n\n1. Stability of the tax regime with respect to the Income Tax, as stipulated in subsection a) of Article 10\u00b0 of Legislative Decree No. 662, in effect at the time this Agreement was executed, according to which dividends and any other form of distribution of profits, are not taxed, in accordance with the stipulations of subsection a) of article 25 of the Amendment Text of the Income Tax Law, approved by the Supreme Decree No. 054-99-EF in effect at the time this Agreement was executed. Neither the remittances sent abroad of amounts corresponding the DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL for any of the items contemplated in this subsection are taxed pursuant to the aforementioned law.\n\n2. Stability of the regime of unrestricted availability of foreign currency as set forth in subsection b) of Article 10\u00b0 of Legislative Decree No. 662, which entails that DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL may freely access foreign currency in the exchange markets at the most favorable exchange rate, and in connection with the investment referred in CLAUSE TWO, the STATE may not apply thereto any exchange market regulations or mechanism that limits or restricts this right or which entails a less favorable treatment to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL than the one applied to any individual or company in the execution of any type of currency exchange transaction.\n\n3. Stability of the right to freely remit its dividends and capitals pursuant to Article 10(b) of Legislative decree No. 662, which implies that DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL may transfer abroad in freely convertible currency, without requiring prior authorization from any entity of the Central, Regional or Local Government as long as the investment was registered before the Competent National Organism and all corresponding tax obligations have been complied with, and without the STATE being allowed any restriction or limitation to this right, the following:\n\na) All its capitals brought from abroad, including the capital from the transfer of its shares, interests or rights over companies, of the reduction of the capital equity and partial or total liquidation, which come from the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO.\n\nb) All the dividends and the actually obtained net profits obtained from the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO, as well as the profits obtained as consideration for the use and enjoy the assets physically located in the country used for such investment; and\n\nc) All the royalties and considerations for the use and transfer of technology; trademarks and patents; and any other industrial property element authorized by the Competent National Organism.\n\n4. Stability of the right to use the most favorable exchange rate as stipulated in subsection b) of Article 10\u00b0 of Legislative decree No. 662, which entails that DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL may access foreign currency on the exchange market at the most favorable exchange rate it can obtain, and the STATE may not require it to carry out its exchange to operations under any regime or mechanism that grants a less favorable treatment that the one applied to any individual or company in the execution of any exchange operation according to the following:\n\na) In the case of conversion of foreign currency into local currency: DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL may sell it to any individual or legal entity at the most favorable exchange rate it finds on the exchange market at the time the exchange transaction is carried out; and,\n\nb) In the case of conversion of local currency into foreign currency: DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL may buy it from any individual or legal entity at the most favorable exchange rate it finds on the exchange market at the time the exchange transaction is carried out:\n\n5. Stability of the right to non-discrimination as stipulated in subsection\n\nc) of Article 10\u00b0 of Legislative decree No. 662, which implies that STATE at none of its levels, whether entities of companies of the Central Government, or Regional or Local Governments, may apply to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL a different treatment by virtues of its nationality, the sectors or types of economic activity in which it engages, or the geographic location of the company in which it invests, or in the following matters:\n\na) Foreign exchange, such that with respect to the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO, the STATE may not apply to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL a currency exchange regime that entails a less favorable treatment that the one applied to any individual or legal entity in the execution of any type of foreign exchange transaction.\n\nb) Prices, tariffs or non-customs duties, such that the STATE may not apply differential amounts or rates to DUKE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY with respect to the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO.\n\nc) The form of corporate organization, such that the STATE may not require that DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL organizes DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL PERU HOLDINGS, S.R.L., in which it is going to invest, as a certain type of company;\n\nd) its status as an individual or legal entity, such that the STATE, may not apply differentiated treatment to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL because of this status; and,\n\ne) Any other cause with equivalent effects, such as may be arise from application of discriminatory treatment to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL resulting from any combination of the various paragraphs of this section.\n\nThis sub-section applies without prejudice to the limitations set forth in Article 3 of the REGULATIONS.\n\n86.\n\nIn this jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, the sole issue before the Tribunal is whether it has jurisdiction over the dispute. The Tribunal must not in any way prejudge the merits of the case, but simply examine whether the merits dispute, as stated by Claimant, is within its jurisdiction.\n\n87.\n\nWe agree with the Tribunal in the Amco case, which held, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, that:\n\n[...] the Tribunal must not attempt at this stage to examine the claim itself in any detail, but the Tribunal must only be satisfied that prima facie the claim, as stated by the Claimants when initiating this arbitration, is within the jurisdictional mandate of ICSID arbitration, and consequently of this Tribunal.17\n\nThis principle has been followed and endorsed, in one form or another, by several international arbitration tribunals deciding jurisdictional challenges.18\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on jurisdiction of September 25, 1983, 23 *ILM* 351 at 376 (1984). (Emphasis added) The decision of the Ad Hoc Committee that annulled (in part) the award on the merits of the Tribunal in the original proceeding left untouched the Tribunal's Award on Jurisdiction (see E. Gaillard, Introductory Note to Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee, 25 *ILM* 1439 at 1439 (1986)).\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, *Methanex* v. *USA*, *SGS* v. *Philippines*, *Salini* v. *Jordan*, and, most recently, *PCL* v. *Bulgaria*.\n\n88.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has failed to establish a *prima facie* case against Respondent:\n\nThe Tribunal should also decline to hear this case because it is apparent that Claimant has utterly failed to establish a *prima facie* case of violation of the DEI Bermuda Legal Stability Agreement. As demonstrated by the compelling evidence submitted by Peru, the claims asserted by Claimant are incapable of constituting a breach of the DEI Bermuda Legal Stability Agreement.19\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply, paragraph 153\n\n89.\n\nThe crux of the issue is whether the literal reading of Clause Two, which would seem to restrict the definition of \"investment\" to DEI Bermuda's capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings, excludes the possibility that the Tax Assessment (against DEI Egenor) could violate the protections granted to DEI Bermuda in Clause Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA, which are expressed as being granted \"in connection with the investment.\" If that were the case, with the possible exception of the claim alleging breach of the implied duties under Peruvian law, the claims could not be said to concern the interpretation or performance of the DEI Bermuda LSA, and thus would not be covered by the consent to ICSID arbitration contained in Clause Nine.\n\n90.\n\nFor the reasons set out in the next section, the Tribunal cannot accept that the wording of Clause Two limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider the merits of Claimant's claims under Clause Three (and Peruvian law generally). As will be explained later in this Decision, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has made a *prima facie* case that the dispute falls within its jurisdiction, in the sense that the claims stated in the Request for Arbitration are capable of constituting a breach of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**(c) The Investment**\n----------------------\n\n91.\n\nIt is true that Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA, by its express terms, refers only to DEI Bermuda's US$ 200 million capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings. The Tribunal cannot accept, however, Respondent's argument that such capital contribution is \"the only legally relevant investment\" for purposes of determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n92.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal finds, for the following reasons, that the meaning of \"investment\" in the heading of Clause Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA, and for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, cannot be restricted to DEI Bermuda's US$ 200 million capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings:\n\n1. the capital contribution, without more, would not appear to satisfy the requirement, under Peruvian law, that an \"investment\" in relation to which an LSA is granted contribute to economically productive activity (i.e., that it be an \"active\" investment);\n\n2. the capital contribution was not an isolated transaction, but was rather one of many transactions deliberately concluded as part of the privatization of Egenor;\n\n3. a narrow focus on the wording of Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA as an indication of the \"investment\" elevates form over substance, by ignoring the purpose of the capital contribution, which was described in the application DEI Bermuda submitted for the DEI Bermuda LSA referred to in Clause One thereof; and\n\n4. in determining their jurisdiction, ICSID tribunals have recognized the unity of an investment even when that investment involves complex arrangements expressed in a number of successive and legally distinct agreements.\n\n93.\n\nEach of these reasons is discussed in greater depth in the sections that follow.\n\n**(i) Peru's Requirement that an Investment Contribute to Economically Productive Activity**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nArticle 1 of the Foreign Investment Law provides that \"foreign investments will be considered to be any investments coming from abroad in any income-generating activities.\" Article 1357 of the Peruvian *Civil Code* provides that a law-contract (i.e., an LSA) can be established only when \"supported by reasons of social, national or public interest.\" It is difficult to see how the Peruvian authorities could have concluded that a mere contribution of funds from DEI Bermuda to its holding-company subsidiary (DEI Peru Holdings), considered in isolation of the context of the transaction, meets the requirements of this regime.\n\n95.\n\nRespondent takes the following position:\n\nIt is important to note that the Legal Stability Agreement does not explicitly or implicitly cover DEI Bermuda's indirect interest in DEI Egenor. The fact that DEI Egenor is not addressed in the DEI Bermuda Legal Stability Agreement is no oversight - it was simply not, in the language of Peru's foreign investment law, the relevant \"company that is the recipient of invested funds.\"20\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial, paragraph 33, citing Article 10(a) of Legislative Decree No. 662.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent's argument is unconvincing, however, because the Foreign Investment Law in Peru does not contemplate a holding-company structure. The investment-protection regime in Peru does not specifically contemplate the three-tiered structure of the kind that was used for Duke Energy's investment in Peru (and that mirrored the structure that was used for Dominion's investment in the initial privatization). The investment-protection regime instead contemplates the basic structure of an investor and the target of the investment. The preamble to the Investment Regulations states that LSAs provide guarantees to \"the investors and enterprises in which they participate.\" The two-tiered structure of \"investor\" and \"enterprise\" is reflected throughout the Investment Regulations, notably in Articles 1, 19 and 25-27 thereof.\n\n97.\n\nUnder Peruvian law, an investment is a capital contribution that seeks the development of the Peruvian economy. A capital contribution to a holding company must therefore be analyzed in its broader context. It is an operation carried out by a foreign investor in order to have interests and participate in a productive national enterprise.21 Similarly, any associated LSA must be analyzed in such broader context. Indeed, according to Claimant's expert, it would have been against the law for Respondent to have issued the DEI Bermuda LSA under Respondent's narrow view of the investment covered by the agreement.22\n\n*See* Supplementary Expert Report of Fernando de Trazegnies Granda, dated 22 February 2005, at paragraph 1.6 (at page 4).\n\n*See* Trazegnies Second Expert Report at para. 81. Respondent did not offer any expert evidence to challenge Professor Trazegnies' conclusions.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal does not, and indeed cannot, decide at this stage what specific impact the segmentation of the stability agreements has on the segmentation of the protection for the investment. It will be at the merits stage for the Tribunal to decide whether the guarantees in the DEI Bermuda LSA have in fact been violated by Respondent. For jurisdictional purposes, however, the Tribunal finds that the integrity of the investmentprotection regime in Peru requires that the Tribunal look beyond the formalities of the holding-company structure of Duke Energy's investment in the country.\n\n99.\n\nConsidering all of the relevant circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Respondent granted its approval for the DEI Bermuda LSA because it was part and parcel of the investment being made by Duke Energy in DEI Egenor, an operating company generating wealth, jobs and providing public services in Peru (*i.e.*, an active investment).\n\n**(ii) The Privatization**\n--------------------------\n\n100.\n\nAs summarized above, the privatization of Egenor was a complex process.23 Claimant has presented compelling evidence that both parties understood that the transaction underlying the DEI Bermuda LSA (*i.e.*, the US$ 200 million capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings) was made in connection with Duke Energy's overall investment in Peru, namely in the operating company DEI Egenor.\n\n*See* Section II.B, above.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent argues that the DEI Bermuda LSA did not require Claimant to invest a single dollar in DEI Egenor, and that indeed, no new investment was made in DEI Egenor as a result of the US$ 200 million capital contribution made by DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings:\n\nThe fact that DEI Bermuda's subsidiary, DEI Holdings SRL, acquired shares of DEI Egenor from other affiliates of Claimant is of no legal significance under the DEI Bermuda Legal Stability Agreement. The Agreement did not compel or direct DEI Holdings SRL to invest in DEI Egenor. And, thus, the DEI Bermuda Legal Stability Agreement provided no guarantees whatever with respect to DEI Holdings SRL's interest in DEI Egenor S.A. Simply stated, Respondent did not undertake any obligations to DEI Bermuda or DEI Holdings SRL in respect of DEI Egenor, and DEI Bermuda and DEI Holdings SRL did not undertake any obligations to Peru regarding DEI Egenor.24\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial, paragraph 80.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's argument. The evidence demonstrates that Duke Energy, through various subsidiaries, entered into various LSAs as part of a single, concerted effort (the Tribunal leaves for the merits phase the question of whether the effort was successful) to obtain complete protection for its investment in Egenor, S.A.A. The Tribunal notes, in particular, the following relevant facts:\n\n\u25a0 In connection with its investment in Peru, Duke Energy sought to obtain the same investment protection, through LSAs, as Dominion had obtained. The September 13, 1999, communication from Duke Energy's Peruvian outside counsel to COPRI and CEPRI stated that if the LSAs provided to Dominion could not be assigned to Duke Energy \"*before the closing date and based on the investment to be made by Duke in Egenor S.A., a new legal stability structure be arranged*...\".25\n\n\u25a0 As of the closing date for DEI Holdings USA's acquisition of the 30 Percent Tranche (*i.e.*, October 7, 1999), the first step in Duke Energy's indirect acquisition of Egenor S.A.A., no mutually acceptable solution had been identified to implement the investment protection regime for Duke Energy.\n\n\u25a0 By the end of 1999, Duke Energy owned 90 percent of Egenor S.A.A. (the 60 Percent Tranche and the 30 Percent Tranche) through two Delaware holding companies (earlier defined as DEI Holdings USA). This holding structure was considered too cumbersome from a corporate and tax planning standpoint. It also did not reflect the structure that Dominion had used under the Privatization Agreement. Accordingly, Duke Energy decided to restructure its holdings in Peru by consolidating its ownership interest in Egenor S.A.A. in a Peruvian holding company (*i.e.*, DEI Peru Holdings), which in turn would be wholly owned by a Bermudan holding company (*i.e.*, DEI Bermuda).\n\n\u25a0 DEI Bermuda was incorporated in August 1999 and DEI Peru Holdings, wholly-owned by DEI Bermuda, was established in May 2000.\n\n\u25a0 In February 2000, Duke Energy presented Peru with a proposal to obtain the same foreign investor protections that it would have obtained under the Dominion LSA, if the latter had been assignable.\n\n\u25a0 The proposal presented by Duke Energy was implemented as follows:\n\n1. application for a foreign investor LSA by DEI Bermuda;\n\n2. application for a recipient company LSA by DEI Peru Holdings;\n\n3. the assignment of the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, as modified, in favor of DEI Peru Holdings; and\n\n4. the assignment of the IDP Domestic Investor LSA in favor of DEI Peru Holdings.\n\n\u25a0 On July 24, 2001, Peru executed the DEI Bermuda LSA and the DEI Peru Holdings LSA. The DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA and the IDP Domestic Investor LSA were assigned to DEI Peru Holdings on April 3 and March 14, 2003, respectively.\n\n*See* Claimant's Exhibit 44.\n\n103.\n\nThe terms of the DEI Bermuda and DEI Peru Holdings LSAs required that the capital contribution be completed within a 24-month period from July 24, 2001 in order for the LSAs to remain in effect. DEI Bermuda's capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings was made on December 16, 2002, in return for which DEI Peru Holdings issued capital stock to DEI Bermuda. The evidence shows that the capital contribution was used for its intended purpose, and that there was never any question of using it for any other purpose. In particular:\n\n\u25a0 On December 16 and 18, 2002, DEI Peru Holdings used the capital contribution to acquire 90 percent of the capital stock of DEI Egenor from DEI Investments SRL and DEI Holdings USA.\n\n\u25a0 Duke Energy's internal corporate documentation confirmed that the purpose of the capital contribution from DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings was the transfer of the shares of DEI Egenor held by DEI Investments SRL and DEI Holdings USA to DEI Peru Holdings.\n\n\u25a0 On July 23, 2003, in order to maintain the effectiveness of the DEI Bermuda and DEI Peru Holdings LSAs, DEI Peru Holdings provided Peru with a Deloitte & Touche report, confirming that the cash contribution received from DEI Bermuda was applied by DEI Peru Holdings to acquire DEI Egenor's shares from DEI Investments SRL and DEI Holdings USA.26\n\n*See* Claimant's Exhibit 58.\n\n104.\n\nThe specific terms and conditions of the Bidding Rules and Privatization Agreement also reveal the true nature of the investment, namely an investment by a foreign conglomerate with expertise and experience in power generation (Dominion, and subsequently Duke Energy) in a power-generation company in Peru (Egenor). The nature of the investment did not change when Duke Energy stepped into Dominion's shoes.\n\n105.\n\nUnder the Privatization Agreement, IDP was the \"Buyer\" of the shares of Egenor, and Electroperu was the \"Seller\". Under Clause 7.1.1 of the Privatization Agreement, IDP (Dominion's subsidiary, at the time wholly-owned by Dominion) - as the Buyer -assumed the obligation to ensure that Egenor carried out the power generation project referred to in the Bidding Rules, and to increase Egenor's effective capacity to 100 megawatts. It was made very clear that IDP - a Peruvian holding company - had to have the full and committed backing of Dominion - its parent - in order to be able to satisfy this obligation. Indeed, Dominion's financial and technical backing was indispensable to the transaction, and accordingly, Dominion was designated the \"Operator\" and the \"Holder of the Committed Interest,\" as these terms were defined in the Bidding Rules.\n\n106.\n\nThe term \"Operator\" is defined in the Bidding Rules (at page 5) as follows:\n\nThe shareholder or member of a Bidder which is dedicated, directly or through a Related Company, to the generation of electricity; and which meets the characteristics indicated in sub-point 5.4.3 and satisfies the commitment to participate in the Bidder indicated in sub-point 5.7.2.\n\n107.\n\nArticle 5.4.3 of the Bidding Rules identifies the following characteristics that have to be satisfied by the Operator: a) at least five years' experience operating a hydroelectric or thermoelectric power generation project; and b) operation for at least two years as of the date of issuance of the bid specifications: a hydroelectric or thermoelectric power generation plant whose operating power is over 400 MW; or several plants that, combined, total more than 600 MW in operation. Article 5.7.2 provides that the Operator has to hold an interest equal to at least 25 percent of the capital equity of the Buyer (IDP) for a period of at least five years from the closing date of the Privatization Agreement. The term \"Committed Interest\" is defined in Article 5.7.3 of the Bidding Rules as \"The minimum participation of twenty six percent (26%) of the capital stock of the Buyer that must maintain one or more of its shareholders for a term of five (5) years, counted as of the Closing Date.\"\n\n108.\n\nAs both the Operator and the Holder of the Committed Interest, Dominion was required to maintain ownership of a minimum of 51 percent of IDP's equity shares of Egenor for a period of at least five years. Pursuant to article 12.3.2 of the Privatization Agreement, any sale by Dominion of more than 49 percent of IDP's equity shares had to be explicitly authorized by Peru to ensure that the new buyer met the same qualification criteria as Dominion had been required to meet when it originally made its tender bid. Article 12.3.2 provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n[\u2026] during the above-mentioned five (5) year period, class \"A\" Shares may be transferred by [IDP] solely to another person that complies with the same requirements with which it complied at the time to qualify as a Bidder in the Tender, provided: (a) the new purchaser has the prior qualification granted by the competent entity or authority regarding the fact that it does in fact comply with such requirements and (b) the mechanism proposed to effect the transfer does not result in failure to comply with any of the obligations assumed by the Buyer, the Operator or the Holder(s) of the Committed Interest.\n\nThe foregoing competent entity or authority will be the CEPRI-ELP, so long as said body is operating. Once the CEPRI-ELP stops operating, the prior qualification in question shall be granted by the COPRI. If in turn the COPRI should stop operating, such qualification shall be granted by the body that succeeds it or that itself decides on and, in the absence of the foregoing, by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.\n\n109.\n\nAccordingly, before acquiring Dominion's interests in Egenor, Duke Energy had to submit the application form contained in the Bidding Rules (Form 2),27 the very same form that Dominion had submitted some three years earlier. The application was accepted. Eventually, DEI Bermuda was designated as the Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest and DEI Peru Holdings was designated as the Bidder and Owner of DEI Egenor. Thus, following an application by Duke Energy that was accepted by Peru, DEI Bermuda replaced Dominion, and DEI Peru Holdings replaced IDP, under the Privatization Agreement.\n\n*See* Claimant's Exhibit 43.\n\n110.\n\nBecause the underlying investment by Dominion (and later Duke Energy) in the Peruvian electricity generator - Egenor - underpinned all of these transactions, including the capital contribution from DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings,28 the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's argument on the characterization of the investment as defined in Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\nIn its letter to Duke Energy dated 22 September 1999 (Claimant's Exhibit C-46), Peru's competition agency (Indecopi) refers to \"the investment of your company in the Peruvian electricity generator Egenor.\"\n\n**(iii) The Relevance of the Application for the LSA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe wording of the application referred to in Clause One of the DEI Bermuda LSA is another evidentiary element which assists the Tribunal in concluding that the investment contemplated by the parties when they entered into the DEI Bermuda LSA included DEI Bermuda's indirect ownership of DEI Egenor.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent argues that the applications filed by Duke Energy for the DEI Bermuda and DEI Peru Holdings LSAs have no bearing on the question of what investment was intended to be protected by those instruments. For the following reasons, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's position.\n\n113.\n\nPursuant to Article 13 of the Foreign Investment Law, an LSA can only be granted on the basis of the filing of an application by the investor with the Peruvian authorities.29 The application must contain specific information relevant to the investment on the territory of Peru. This information includes the name, legal status, domicile and nationality of the investor, details regarding the investor's legal representative, the amount of the investment, the target of the investment, and a description of the project in which the investment is being made.\n\n*See* Article 13 of the Foreign Investment Law (\"In order to benefit from the stability regime referred to in Article 10\u00b0 hereof, foreign investors must file an application with the National Competent Authority in respect of any of the forms stipulated in Article 11\u00b0 hereof.\") *See also* Investment Regulations, Article 29 (\"In order to be entitled to the legal stability regime referred to in this title, an application for the execution of the respective agreement should be filed before the Competent National Authority pursuant to the format indicated in Annex II, which is an integral part of this Supreme Decree.\").\n\n114.\n\nThe importance of the formalities that must be observed to obtain an LSA is underscored by the fact that specific reference is made to the LSA application in the body of the corresponding LSA. Thus, Clause One in each of the DEI Bermuda LSA and DEI Peru Holdings LSA refers specifically to the fact that each LSA was issued pursuant to the application which had been submitted.\n\n115.\n\nThe Preamble and Clause One of the DEI Bermuda LSA provide as follows:\n\nWitnesseth hereby the Legal Stability Agreement entered into by and between **THE PERUVIAN STATE**, on the one part; and, on the other, **DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL PERU INVESTMENT NO. 1, LTD.** hereinafter referred to as **DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL**, under the following terms and conditions*:*\n\n**ONE. - DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL** has submitted a request to the National Foreign Investment and Technology Commission to execute a Legal Stability Agreement in accordance with [the Foreign Investment Law, the Private Investment Law and the Investment Regulations].30\n\n(underlined emphasis added)\n\nPreamble and Clause One, DEI Bermuda LSA, Claimant's Exhibit 1.\n\n116.\n\nThe Preamble and Clause One of the DEI Peru Holdings LSA provide as follows:\n\nWitnesseth hereby the Legal Stability Agreement entered into by and between, on the one part, the **PERUVIAN STATE**, and, on the other, **DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL PERU HOLDINGS SRL**, hereinafter referred to as **DUKE ENERGY PERU**, under the following terms and conditions :\n\n**ONE.** - **DUKE ENERGY PERU** has submitted a request to the National Commission of Foreign Investments and Technologies, hereinafter referred to as **CONITE**, in order to execute a Legal Stability Agreement in accordance with [the Foreign Investment Law, the Private Investment Law and the Investment Regulations].31\n\n(underlined emphasis added)\n\nPreamble and Clause One, DEI Peru Holdings LSA, Claimant's Exhibit 20.\n\n117.\n\nThe application for each of the DEI Bermuda and DEI Peru Holdings LSAs confirms that the purpose of the capital contribution from DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings was to permit the consolidation of Duke Energy's ownership interest in Egenor S.A.A. under DEI Peru Holdings (*i.e.*, the company that would ultimately serve, with Respondent's consent, as the Bidder and Buyer for the purposes of the Privatization Agreement). Relevant parts of the applications are:\n\nDEI Bermuda LSA Application\n\nTarget of the Investment\n\n3.1 Economic Sector: DUKE's capital contribution shall be made to [DEI PERU HOLDINGS], which shall act as a holding company (controlling company) for the investments that the Duke Energy International Group currently has in Peru.\n\n3.2 Brief Description of the Project: Duke's capital contribution shall be made to [DEI PERU HOLDINGS] for the acquisition of 90% of the representative shares of the social capital of EGENOR S.A.A., as part of the corporate reorganization process of the investments that Duke Energy International Group has currently in Peru.\n\nDEI Peru Holdings LSA Application\n\nAmount of the Investment: US$ 263,430,000\n\n2.1 Economic Sector: Holding company (company holding the instruments representing the social capital).\n\n2.2 Brief Description of the Project: The capital contribution that [DEI Bermuda] shall make to [DEI Peru Holdings] shall be utilized by the latter to acquire 90% of the representative shares of the social capital of EGENOR S.A.A., as part of the corporate reorganization process of the investments that the Duke Energy International Group has currently in Peru.\n\n118.\n\nThe plain terms of these two applications make it abundantly clear that the sole and exclusive purpose of the capital contribution by DEI Bermuda in DEI Peru Holdings was to permit the latter to acquire the shares of Egenor S.A.A. (renamed DEI Egenor at the time of acquisition) held by DEI Investments SRL and DEI Holdings USA.\n\n**(iv) Unity of the Investment**\n--------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nFinally, in deciding on the nature of the investment, the Tribunal agrees with the position adopted by other ICSID tribunals involving situations in which the parties' consent to ICSID arbitration was included in one of several successive agreements connected to an investment. This is the case in the present arbitration.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent has raised the concern that the Tribunal might import into this proceeding, inappropriately, a broad definition of investment of the kind typically found in Bilateral Investment Treaties (\"**BITs**\") on this subject. Respondent states:\n\nInstead of calling on the Tribunal to interpret the Agreement, normally and naturally, as a contract between specified parties, and establishing specified rights and obligations, Claimant would have the Tribunal mistakenly import into this proceeding the general definition of \"investment\" from bilateral investment treaties (\"BITs\"), together with inapposite BIT jurisprudence. Because the instrument of consent before this Tribunal contains a narrowly focused definition of investment, and not the broad definition found in BITs, Claimant's arguments are wholly misdirected, and should be ignored. In the case at hand, the relevant investment is precisely delineated in the DEI Bermuda Legal Stability Agreement, and it is not that investment on which Claimant predicates its claims.32\n\n*See* Respondent's Reply, paragraph 3.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal is not importing into this proceeding a general definition of \"investment\" from BITs together with inapposite BIT jurisprudence. In the relevant cases, which are discussed below, ICSID tribunals have applied the principle of the \"unity of the investment\" in situations where consent to ICSID arbitration is found in individual investment agreements or contracts, not in an umbrella instrument such as a BIT. The Tribunal is of the view that the principles derived from those cases are directly applicable to its determination of the investment in relation to which the parties consented to ICSID arbitration in Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n122.\n\nIn *Holiday Inns* v. *Morocco*, an ICSID arbitration agreement was included in a \"Basic Agreement\" for the establishment and operation of hotels. Government financing for the hotels was secured by means of separate loan agreements involving parties affiliated with (but different from) those who signed the Basic Agreement. The loan agreements contained choice of forum clauses in favor of the Moroccan courts.33 Claimants sought to bring a financing dispute within the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal constituted under the dispute-resolution provision of the Basic Agreement.\n\n*Lalive*, The First 'World Bank' Arbitration, p. 156.\n\n123.\n\nMorocco objected to the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal, arguing that the dispute related to separate transactions, between separate parties, for which other disputesettlement procedures had been agreed.34 The tribunal rejected these contentions and asserted its jurisdiction over the loan agreements. In doing so, it emphasized \"the general unity of an investment operation.\" The tribunal held:\n\nIt is well known, and it is being particularly shown in the present case, that investment is accomplished by a number of juridical acts of all sorts. It would not be consonant either with economic reality or with the intention of the parties to consider each of these acts in complete isolation from the others. It is particularly important to ascertain which is the act which is the basis of the investment and which entails as measures of execution the other acts which have been concluded in order to carry it out.35\n\n*Lalive*, The First 'World Bank' Arbitration, pp. 156-159.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, 12 May 1974, *Lalive*, The First 'World Bank' Arbitration, p. 159. it was to be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and the BIT between the Czech and Slovak Republics.\n\n124.\n\nIn *CSOB v. Slovakia*, a Consolidation Agreement between the claimant, a former state-owned bank, and the Ministries of Finance of the Czech and Slovak Republics provided for the assignment by CSOB of certain non-performing receivables to two \"Collection Companies,\" one in each Republic, created for this purpose. Each Collection Company was to pay CSOB for the assigned receivables. To enable them to do so, each Collection Company was to receive loans from CSOB, which were to be repaid according to an agreed repayment schedule. The Consolidation Agreement included a clause stating that\n\n125.\n\nAfter the Slovak Collection Company (\"**SCC**\") was established, it concluded Loan Agreements with CSOB. Under the terms of both the Consolidation Agreement and the Loan Agreements, the loan was secured by a guarantee of the Slovak Ministry of Finance. When SCC defaulted in its payment, CSOB instituted ICSID proceedings. Slovakia argued that the claims against it did not arise directly out of the loan and were, therefore, outside of the tribunal's jurisdiction, which was based on the arbitration agreement contained in the separate Consolidation Agreement.36 The tribunal rejected this argument. It held that\n\n[a]n investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe foregoing analysis indicates that the term 'directly', as used in Article 25(1) of the Convention, should not be interpreted restrictively to compel the conclusion that CSOB's claim is outside the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunals' competence merely because it is based on an obligation of the Slovak Republic which, standing alone, does not qualify as an investment.\n\nHence, in deciding whether the obligation referred to in CSOB's requested relief forms part of an investment, the Tribunal has to determine whether the purported obligation of the Slovak Republic forms an integral part of a transaction which qualifies as an investment.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe contractual scheme embodied in the Consolidation Agreement shows, however, that the CSOB loan to the [SCC] is closely related to and cannot be disassociated from all other transactions involving the restructuring of CSOB....\n\n[...]\n\nThe Slovak Republic's undertaking and the loan form an integrated whole in the process defined in the Consolidation Agreement. Hence, individual transactions comprising it may still meet the requirements of an investment under the Convention, provided the overall operation for the consolidation of CSOB, to which it is closely connected, qualifies as37 an investment.\n\nAs such, the BIT here played only an indirect role, in that it contained the ICSID arbitration agreement that was incorporated by reference in the Consolidation Agreement. The claim itself was not brought under the BIT.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka A.S. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of May 24, 1999, at *paras*. 72, 74-75, 80 & 82. (Emphasis added)\n\n126.\n\nThe CSOB case is particularly instructive for the issue facing this Tribunal. In CSOB, as is the case here, it was necessary to consider contracts and transactions outside the scope of the single agreement that contained the ICSID arbitration agreement in order to find, as the tribunal did in that case, that the dispute before it arose directly out of an investment.\n\n127.\n\nAt the same time, the tribunal confirmed, in a supplementary decision on jurisdiction, that the application of the concept of the unity of the investment (the \"overall operation\") did not mean that the Tribunal \"automatically acquires jurisdiction with regard to each agreement concluded to implement the wider investment operation.\"38 As such, the CSOB decision was more restrictive than the decision reached by another ICSID tribunal in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest-Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI)* v *. The Republic of Senegal*, a case also involving an ICSID arbitration agreement contained in one of several successive agreements.\n\nSupplementary Decision of 1 December 2000, para. 28.\n\n128.\n\nIn *SOABI*,39 three successive agreements were entered into by the parties in connection with the construction of low-cost dwellings in Senegal. Only the last agreement to be signed (the \"Establishment Agreement\"), which related to the establishment of a plant for the pre-fabrication of reinforced concrete for the planned dwellings, contained an ICSID arbitration agreement, which by its express terms was limited to disputes between the parties relating to the Establishment Agreement.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest-Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI) v. the Republic of Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, Award of February 25, 1988, published in Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XVII (1992), pp. 42-72, at *para*. 4.10.\n\n129.\n\nThe majority of the tribunal held that \"the agreements between the parties other than the Establishment Agreement, with respect to the construction of the plant as well as the construction of the 15,000 dwelling units, are implicitly encompassed by the Establishment Agreement.\"40 The majority reasoned that \"one could not dissociate the two parts of the operation,\"41 and accused the dissent of \"hid[ing] behind hypotheses that are refuted by... reality...\"42\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 4.13.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 4.17.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n130.\n\nProfessor Schreuer summarizes these and other cases as follows:\n\nThese cases suggest that ICSID tribunals are inclined to take a broad view of consent clauses where the agreement between the parties is reflected in several successive instruments. Expressions of consent are not applied narrowly to the specific document in which they appear but are read in the context of the parties' overall relationship. Therefore, a series of interrelated contracts may be regarded, in functional terms, as representing the legal framework for one investment operation. ICSID clauses contained in some, though not all, of the different contracts may be interpreted to apply to the entire operation.43\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, at p. 245 (2001).\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in applying the unity-of-the-investment principle44 to refute Respondent's argument that the narrow description of the transaction in Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA necessarily determines the scope of the \"investment\" for purposes of the DEI Bermuda LSA. The reality of the overall investment, which is clear from the record, overcomes Respondent's objection that it could never have consented to arbitration of a dispute related to the broader investment by Duke Energy in DEI Egenor.\n\nWe are guided here principally by the reasoning adopted by the CSOB tribunal in reaching its balanced decision.\n\n132.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also acknowledges the corollary finding in the CSOB case, namely that Claimant will need to substantiate its claims, during the merits phase, by reference solely to the guarantees contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and not those contained in any of the other LSAs. This is a function of the specific wording of Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, and of the legal basis of Claimant's claims as formulated in the Request for Arbitration, namely the alleged breach of the protections contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, not in any of the other LSAs.\n\n133.\n\nWhile the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction over the other LSAs will not prevent it from taking them into consideration for the purposes of the interpretation and application of the DEI Bermuda LSA (indeed, that is \"perfectly possible, normal and called for\"),45 it will not be in a position to \"give effect\" to the protections in those LSAs.46 In other words, in the peculiar circumstances of this case (successive agreements *for the protection* of the investment), the unity of the investment does not necessarily imply the unity of the protection of the investment.\n\n*Klockner v. United Republic of Cameroon,* Ad Hoc Committee Decision, para. 164.\n\n*See ibid.*\n\n134.\n\nFinally, by focusing on the guarantees included in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and excluding the application of the guarantees included in the other LSAs, the Tribunal is not limiting Claimant strictly to the text of the DEI Bermuda LSA. First, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees that are implied in the DEI Bermuda LSA by Peruvian law.47 Second, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees provided by such rules of international law as may be held by the Tribunal to be applicable to the merits of the dispute by virtue of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that one of the claims put forward by Claimants is for breach of the obligations implied under the Peruvian *Civil Code* in all contracts, and here specifically in the DEI Bermuda LSA. *See* Request for Arbitration, paras. 52-56.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that Claimant's claims are *ratione materiae*, within the jurisdiction of ICSID and of the present Tribunal in accordance with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE PERSONAE***\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n136.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae*. Respondent argues that while DEI Bermuda may currently be the indirect, beneficial owner of all or most of DEI Egenor, such alleged ownership is indirect, and that the parties who could claim for alleged violations arising from the Tax Assessment (*viz.*, DEI Peru Holdings and DEI Egenor) are not before this Tribunal since Peru consented to ICSID arbitration only in respect of DEI Bermuda's specified investment in DEI Peru Holdings.\n\n137.\n\nClaimant argues that the only *ratione personae* requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is that the dispute be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.\n\n138.\n\nClaimant avers that its claims are for injuries that it has suffered in its own right under the DEI Bermuda LSA. It stresses that even if these claims are based on actions taken by Peru against DEI Egenor, this does not in any way vitiate Claimant's standing to assert claims against Peru for breaches by Peru of obligations that it independently owed to DEI Bermuda. The question of whether there has been a breach or not, adds Claimant, is one for the merits.\n\n**2. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that the dispute before the Tribunal be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. There can be no controversy that these basic requirements are satisfied in the present case.\n\n140.\n\nBy virtue of its nationality as a Bermudan company, the Claimant is a national of a Contracting State. Bermuda is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, which has been a party to the ICSID Convention since January 18, 1967. The United Kingdom extended the application of the ICSID Convention to Bermuda through the Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1966 (Application to Colonies, etc.), Order 1967 (Statutory Instruments, 1967, No. 159, February 10, 1967). The ICSID Convention was ratified by the United Kingdom to the same effect on December 9, 1966.\n\n141.\n\nRespondent is a Contracting State. Peru signed the ICSID Convention on September 4, 1991. The ICSID Convention entered into force in Peru on September 8, 1993.\n\n142.\n\nRespondent does not contest these facts.\n\n143.\n\nThe arguments raised by Respondent as objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* are, in reality, subject-matter objections in relation to the claims brought before this Tribunal by DEI Bermuda, dressed up as objections to the Tribunal's personal jurisdiction over putative claims by entities (such as DEI Peru Holdings and DEI Egenor) that are not claimants before the Tribunal.\n\n144.\n\nAs has been established in the previous section of this Decision, it is evident that the claims brought by Claimant are claims brought only by DEI Bermuda, and only in respect of alleged violations of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* in this proceeding.\n\n**C. JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE TEMPORIS***\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n146.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the claims are outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione temporis* because they are addressed to matters arising before the DEI Bermuda LSA entered into force (*i.e.*, July 24, 2001). In particular, Respondent stresses that:\n\n\u25a0 SUNAT's tax audit of DEI Egenor was initiated on November 24, 2000;\n\n\u25a0 the tax liability at issue in SUNAT's tax audit was incurred by DEI Egenor with respect to tax years 1996 to 1999; and\n\n\u25a0 SUNAT applied tax laws that were already in force prior to the date the DEI Bermuda LSA was signed.\n\n147.\n\nClaimant argues that under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, it is the point in time at which the parties' legal dispute arose that is decisive of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The investment dispute with Peru is within the temporal parameters of the parties' consent, Claimant argues, because it arose on November 22, 2001, the day on which SUNAT imposed the Tax Assessment, which is after 24 July 2001, the effective date of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**2. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nWhat is decisive of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is the point in time at which the instant legal dispute between the parties arose, not the point in time during which the factual matters on which the dispute is based took place. As discussed in *Maffezini v. Spain*, while the parties may have disagreed on matters prior to the entry into force of the relevant instrument containing the legal guarantees, \"this does not mean that a legal dispute... can be said to have existed at the time.\"48\n\n*Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction of January 25, 2000, at para. 95.\n\n149.\n\nHere, the legal dispute arose only after Respondent imposed the Tax Assessment on DEI Egenor, on November 22, 2001, several months after the effective date of the DEI Bermuda LSA. It was in the Tax Assessment, and not before, that SUNAT decreed a tax liability of approximately US$ 48 million against DEI Egenor for what SUNAT determined, at that time, were tax underpayments in 1996 through 1999.\n\n150.\n\nNaturally, during the merits phase, the Tribunal will have full jurisdiction to consider all of the factual matters related to the dispute, including those that preceded the effective date of the DEI Bermuda LSA, for the purposes of determining whether Respondent violated the DEI Bermuda LSA through conduct which took place or reached its \"consummation point\" after its entry into force (*i.e.*, the Tax Assessment).49\n\n*See* *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award of May 29, 2003, at para. 66.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* in this arbitration.\n\n**D. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMS**\n----------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n152.\n\nFinally, Respondent takes the position that should the Tribunal decide that it has jurisdiction to hear this dispute and that the claims are within the scope of the DEI Bermuda LSA, it should nevertheless decline to exercise its jurisdiction and, instead, find that the claim is inadmissible because the key issues in dispute have already been fully resolved within the Peruvian tax system by operation of the Peruvian Tax Court and Peru's Tax Amnesty Law.\n\n153.\n\nClaimant replies that the concept of admissibility is misplaced in the context of an objection to ICSID jurisdiction. Claimant argues that Respondent's arguments under the heading of admissibility are nothing more than a presentation of a facet of Respondent's likely defenses on the merits.\n\n154.\n\nClaimant argues that DEI Egenor's applications for tax amnesty do not preclude Claimant's claims in this arbitration. According to the tax amnesty regulations, a tax debt subject to an amnesty arrangement may not be subject to appeal. Claimant argues that this arbitration was not filed as an appeal of the Tax Court's substantive rulings but, rather, to protect and enforce the protections promised by Peru in the DEI Bermuda LSA. In addition, Claimant takes the position that DEI Egenor's tax amnesty applications bind only DEI Egenor but not its affiliate, DEI Bermuda. Accordingly, says Claimant, the obligation not to appeal a tax debt may not be extended to entities other than the tax debtor itself, DEI Egenor.\n\n155.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant argues that DEI Egenor clearly reserved its rights in each of its applications for tax amnesty, and that these reservations of rights are consistent with the concept under Peruvian law that a taxpayer can acknowledge the debt but may reject the underlying obligation or arguments raised by the taxing authority. Moreover, submits Claimant, Peru's acceptance of DEI Egenor's reservations should be reviewed under international law.\n\n156.\n\nFinally, Claimant points out that, under the circumstances, DEI Egenor had no reasonable alternative but to avail itself of Peru's amnesty program since its failure to have done so could have meant a huge increase in the size of its tax liability, including default, interest, penalties and fines. DEI Egenor's application for amnesty was therefore consistent with a party's duty, recognized as a universal principle of law, to mitigate or minimize its damage or losses.\n\n**2. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) Objection based on the Finality of the Decision of the Peruvian Tax Court**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal should decline to sit as an Appellate Body for the Peruvian Tax Court, and not hear an appeal of the April 23, 2004 decision of the Peruvian Tax Court, which found mainly in favor of SUNAT in connection with the Depreciation Assessment.50\n\n*See* Section II.D, above.\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's argument.\n\n159.\n\nFirst, the issues raised in the present ICSID proceedings are different from those that were at issue in the proceedings before the Tax Court. The issue before the Tribunal is not a dispute about taxes but, rather, an investment dispute arising out of the imposition of taxes. Furthermore:\n\n\u25a0 there is no commonality of parties (the parties to the Tax Court proceedings were DEI Egenor and SUNAT, while the parties to this arbitration are DEI Bermuda and Peru);\n\n\u25a0 none of the issues in this arbitration *(i.e.,* the claims for breaches by Peru of the guarantees contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA) was, or could have been, within the purview or jurisdiction of the Tax Court;\n\n\u25a0 the Tax Court did not determine, nor could it determine, the tax regime that was stabilized for Claimant's investment under the DEI Bermuda LSA;\n\n\u25a0 the causes of action under the proceedings arise from different laws and under different obligations;\n\n\u25a0 distinct relief is sought under each of the proceedings; and\n\n\u25a0 for the purposes of adjudicating DEI Bermuda's claims, what the Tribunal must determine is not whether the decision of the Tax Court is right or wrong as a matter of Peruvian Tax Law, but whether that interpretation of the law in 2004, confirming SUNAT's opinion of November 2001, is consistent with the rights stabilized for DEI Bermuda under its LSA.\n\n160.\n\nIn addition, by agreeing to international arbitration in the DEI Bermuda LSA, Respondent affirmed Claimant's right to a review by an ICSID tribunal of the matters considered by the Peruvian administration and court system, to the extent those matters fall within the guarantees contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA. As noted by the Tribunal in *Azinian v. United Mexican States* :\n\nThe Claimants have cited a number of cases where international tribunals did not consider themselves bound by decisions of national courts. Professor Dodge stressed the following sentence from the well-known ICSID case of *Amco v. Indonesia* : \"An international tribunal is not bound to follow the result of a national court.\" As the Claimants argued persuasively, it would be unfortunate if potential claimants under NAFTA were dissuaded from seeking relief under domestic law from national courts, because such actions might have the salutary effect of resolving the dispute without resorting to investor-state arbitration under NAFTA.51\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award of November 1, 1999, at para. 86.\n\n161.\n\nOf course, the same argument applies under the ICSID system more broadly, and the Tribunal finds that it is particularly persuasive in this case, where the Peruvian Tax Court is not a part of the Peruvian judiciary, but rather an autonomous governmental body existing under the Peruvian Ministry of Finance and Economy.\n\n162.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal must apply Peruvian law to resolve this dispute. In fact, the question of the applicable law to the merits of this case is somewhat more complicated. The DEI Bermuda LSA contains no specific provision regarding the applicable substantive law. In such circumstances, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to apply \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflicts of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" Furthermore, even if the law of Peru were held to apply to the interpretation of the DEI Bermuda LSA, this Tribunal has the authority and duty to subject Peruvian law to the supervening control of international law.52\n\n*See* Schreuer, at pp. 585-90, paras. 62-70 (and the cases cited therein).\n\n**(b) Objection based on the Finality of the Tax Amnesty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nRespondent argues that DEI Bermuda's effort to re-open a matter that DEI Egenor had already settled with Peru, through the application for tax amnesty (which Respondent accepted), should be barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel: \"DEI Bermuda seeks to be indemnified in this arbitration for the very tax liability that DEI Egenor conceded and promised not to challenge further.\"53\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para. 133.\n\n164.\n\nIt is the Tribunal's view that the effect of the amnesty is a matter for the merits phase of these proceedings. Similarly, Respondent's points in relation to Respondent's right to enforce its tax laws,54 the change in the applicable depreciation rate,55 and non-discrimination,56 are all matters for the merits phase.\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras. 86 *et seq.*\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras. 97 *et seq.*\n\n*See* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, paras. 102 *et seq.*\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that its jurisdiction is not affected by the April 23, 2004, decision of the Peruvian Tax Court. To the contrary, that decision is part of the factual matrix the Tribunal must consider in evaluating the merits of Claimant's claims against Respondent.\n\n166.\n\nRespondent's remaining objections under the broad heading of admissibility are also closely intertwined with the merits of the dispute. In the circumstances, the Tribunal prefers to resolve all of these issues after a full hearing on the merits, and not at this stage of the proceedings. In other words, even if it were open to the Tribunal to dismiss some or all of the claims on grounds of admissibility, the Tribunal would exercise its discretion not to do so.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal need not and does not decide whether, in appropriate circumstances, as a matter of ICSID law and practice, preliminary objections based on the concept of \"admissibility\" could be sustained.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n168.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides that:\n\n1. The dispute submitted by DEI Bermuda is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n2. Respondent's objections to the admissibility of the dispute based on the finality of the decision of the Peruvian Tax Court are rejected. Respondent's remaining objections to the admissibility of the dispute are joined to the merits.\n\n3. The costs of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration are reserved.\n\nSo decided."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2008-08-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI\n-\n\n1.\n\nI have concurred with my distinguished colleagues and fellow arbitrators in most of the issues discussed in the Award. Unfortunately, I am unable to join in their conclusions on two issues: (i) the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to construe Peruvian law and to review the correctness of SUNAT\u2019s decisions and assessments or of the Tax Court\u2019s decisions; and (ii) whether the Depreciation Assessment (as defined in paragraph 130 of the Award) constitutes a breach of the DEI Bermuda LSA. I feel obliged to briefly set down my opinion in relation to these two issues.\n\nII\n--\n\n2.\n\nThe Award takes the position that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction does not include the power to review the correctness of SUNAT\u2019s decisions and assessments or of the Tax Court\u2019s decisions.1\n\nAward, at para. 216.\n\n3.\n\nWhile I have agreed that the Tribunal does not sit as the appellate division of the Tax Court, I respectfully dissent on the issue of the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n4.\n\nAs the Tribunal stated in its Decision on Jurisdiction,2 it is not for the Tribunal to determine whether any particular decision of the Tax Court is right or wrong as a matter of Peruvian tax law, but whether such interpretation is consistent with the rights stabilized for DEI Bermuda under its LSA. While the Tribunal does not exercise any authority over SUNAT\u2019s or the Tax Court\u2019s powers, it has been constituted to determine whether SUNAT\u2019s or the Tax Court\u2019s decisions in the present case represent a change from the stabilized regime under the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\nAt para. 159, *in fine.*\n\n5.\n\nWhile a comparative exercise is reasonably straightforward for legislation and regulations and could suffice where a change is objectively demonstrable, the Award reflects the view that in the absence of proof of a stable pre-existing application or interpretation against which the Tribunal can judge subsequent developments, the Tribunal can only evaluate the decision or assessment that is challenged by Claimant against a reasonableness standard.3\n\nAward, at para. 223.\n\n6.\n\nI am unable to agree with this conclusion. In my opinion, in such cases the Tribunal is entitled to depart from a strictly comparative analysis and determine the precise scope of the stabilized regime.\n\n7.\n\nWhile Peruvian courts are the only forum empowered to interpret domestic law and to review administrative decisions in order to reverse or annul them, the Tribunal constitutes the proper contractually-agreed forum to construe Peruvian law in order to determine the scope of the stabilized regime under the DEI Bermuda LSA. In performing such function, the Tribunal\u2019s powers to interpret Peruvian law must be construed broadly and, in doing so, it is empowered to depart from the Peruvian courts\u2019 view if, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, such view does not reflect adequately the status of domestic law.\n\n8.\n\nThe parties have voluntarily decided to entrust that task to the Tribunal, not to Peruvian courts. Thus, in order to determine if the DEI Bermuda LSA has been breached, the actions of SUNAT and the Tax Court subsequent to the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA must be evaluated against the Tribunal\u2019s own determination of the meaning and scope of the stabilized regime at the relevant time. The Tribunal\u2019s powers in such respect do not differ from those that would have been held by a local court called upon to decide whether the LSA has been breached if such court and not this ICSID Tribunal had been the forum contractually designated to settle the present dispute.\n\n9.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, in applying Peruvian domestic law pursuant to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is not limited to an analysis merely of the reasonability of the interpretation or application made by Peru of its own laws and regulations. Much less can the determination of the stabilized regime be made by reference to the reasonability of the interpretation of laws and regulations adopted by Respondent\u2019s local courts after execution of the Egenor LSA -i.e. the Tax Court\u2019s decision of May 25, 2001-or to constructions elaborated subsequent to SUNAT's tax assessments, such as the Tax Court\u2019s decision of April 23, 2004.\n\n10.\n\nAs stated above, this does not mean that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide this dispute includes the authority to reverse the decisions of the Peruvian courts or administrative agencies. Whatever finding the Tribunal reaches, it cannot exceed the boundaries of its jurisdiction, which is limited to determining whether a violation of the DEI Bermuda LSA has occurred.\n\n11.\n\nThe jurisdiction of local courts is, thus, distinct from the specific jurisdiction attributed to this Tribunal by the parties\u2019 agreement. Each is a distinct venue that serves a particular object and purpose.\n\n12.\n\nAs it happens in other fields of law, such interaction can give place to some particular but not totally unusual situations. It could well happen (as it has been increasingly recognized in the domain of Administrative Law in certain cases of State liability)4, for example, that while an administrative decision remains extant in a legal system,5 it still generates State responsibility and the duty to compensate.\n\n*See* G. S. Tawil, \"La Responsabilidad del Estado y de los Magistrados y Funcionarios Judiciales por el Mal Funcionamiento de la Administraci\u00f3n de Justicia\", Buenos Aires, 1993 (2nd. ed.) at pp. 137/146 concerning State responsibility for judicial errors in cases of decisions that have acquired the status of *res judicata.*\n\nDue, as an example, to the impossibility of reversing it based on the lack of remedies available, standing or other limitations. This situation only arises in cases in which, as in the DEI Bermuda LSA, Claimant has an autonomous remedy available to claim State liability.\n\nIII\n---\n\n13.\n\nI must also respectfully disagree with my distinguished colleagues on the decision adopted concerning the Depreciation Assessment.\n\n14.\n\nThe continuity rule was not in force at the time of the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor and of the execution of both the Egenor LSA and the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n15.\n\nWhile Article 105 of Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law - prior to its 1998 amendment - provided for the application of the continuity rule to asset transfers resulting from corporate reorganizations, Article 106 limited the concept of \"reorganization\" to corporate mergers and divisions, whose precise meaning was to be defined in the implementing regulations. As those implementing regulations had not been issued at the time of the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor, Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law was not enforceable.6\n\nThe parties to the present dispute agree that the Tax Court considered that Chapter XIII was not in force at the time the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor took place. *See* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 194.\n\n16.\n\nIn the absence of a legal provision - i.e. the continuity rule or some other provision with similar effect - establishing a specific rate that Egenor was obliged to apply, Egenor was required to apply - as it did - the general depreciation rate provided for in the tax regime. By establishing that Egenor should have applied the special depreciation rate, Peru breached the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n17.\n\nEven applying the reasonability test referred to at paragraph 302 of the Award -the application of which I do not agree with for the reasons stated in Section II above- I come to the conclusion that the Depreciation Assessment was based on an arbitrary interpretation of Peruvian tax laws.\n\n18.\n\nIt is an established principle in tax law -to which Peruvian tax law is not foreign- that governmental powers can only be exercised pursuant to certain conditions and limitations. One such limitation is given by the principle *nullum tributum sine lege.* A tax obligation can only arise from a legal provision. Taxpayers cannot be deemed to be responsible for any tax obligation not stated in the law.\n\n19.\n\nThis legality principle is at the core of the Peruvian legal system. Article 74 of the Peruvian Constitution establishes such principle as follows: \"Taxes are created, modified and abrogated, or exoneration is established, exclusively by law or legislative decree in case of delegation of powers, except for fees and rates that are regulated by supreme decree (...)\".\n\n20.\n\nThe constitutional principle of legality has also been codified in the Peruvian Tax Code and in the Private Investment Law.\n\n21.\n\nRule IV of the Peruvian Tax Code provides that \"Only by law or legislative decree in case of delegation it is possible to a) create, modify and suppress taxes; indicate the fact giving rise to the tax obligation, its calculation base and percentage; the tax creditor; the tax debtor (...)\".7\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-256.\n\n22.\n\nThe Private Investment Law confirms the principle by stating in its Article 14 that \"The constitutional principle of legality in relation to tax issues implies that the creation, modification or elimination of taxes, as well as the granting of exemptions and other tax benefits, determination of taxable matter, persons subject to taxation, tax collectors and tax withholding agents, the applicable rates and the taxable base, should be made by means of a law voted by the Congress of the Republic, in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.\"8\n\n*See* Claimant's Exhibit C-9.\n\n23.\n\nThe depreciation rate applicable to a company\u2019s assets is an essential component of the taxable income, i.e. the tax calculation base under the Income Tax Law. Determination of the tax base depends on the applicable depreciation rate. The lower the depreciation rate is, the higher is the tax base, and *vice versa.* Therefore, the way to determine the depreciation rate cannot be legitimately established by any means other than by the law and its implementing regulations.\n\n24.\n\nIf the continuity rule was not applicable due to the lack of specific tax legislation (the implementing regulations), it cannot be inferred from principles or legal doctrine. Otherwise, Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law and the condition therein established in order for such Chapter to enter into force (the issuance of the absent implementing regulations) would be meaningless.9\n\nIn its majority opinion, the Tribunal has acknowledged that the Tax Court found that Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law was not enforceable due to the absence of implementing regulations. However, it finds that conclusion not sound since its Article 106 *\"affords the executive branch the opportunity to define limitations applicable to the concept of merger and division through regulations, but does not require such regulations for the general concepts to apply.\"* For the majority opinion, a more explicit language would have been required in order to make the enforcement of the rule contingent on the promulgation of regulations (Award, at para. 304). I respectfully disagree with such conclusion. First, article 106 provides: *\"The reorganization of companies or corporations occurs only in cases of merger and division, with limitations, and in accordance with the stipulations stated in the regulations\".* While it is true that the implementing regulations could have established limitations, the use of \"and\" following \"limitations\" indicates that those regulations were not restricted to such purpose. Second, even assuming that the implementing regulations could have just provided for limitations to the general concept, it seems unreasonable to deem a tax rule enforceable without having its precise limits established. Third, following the reasoning explained in para. 24 above, when a certain rule subjects its application *\"in accordance with the stipulations stated in its regulations,\"* its actual application should be considered contingent on those regulations without need of an express qualification exclusively conditioning its enforcement to their issuance.\n\n25.\n\nDue to the constitutional limitation imposed by the legality principle, legal doctrine cannot be held as an autonomous source of tax obligations nor can it step into the shoes of the body in charge of issuing the implementing regulations required under Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law.10 As established by Rule VIII, third paragraph, of the Peruvian Tax Code: \"In the process of interpretation, no taxes may be created, no sanctions may be established, no exemptions may be granted and no tax provisions may be issued to be applied to entities or situations different from those specified in the law\".\n\nAs a tax law source, legal doctrine may serve as a source of interpretation, but never to enforce a regime that shall be established by law or to define a concept that shall be defined by the implementing regulations. I share the view expressed in the Award that it would be reasonable that depreciation over the useful life of assets should not be changed by the mere fact that ownership thereof has been transferred (Award, para. 302). However, in my view, the issue is not whether the continuity rule is reasonable, but whether such rule existed and was enforceable at the relevant time. If such rule was not established and enforceable when the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor took place it could never have been applied by SUNAT, irrespective of how reasonable or logical such a rule would have been if legally enacted.\n\n26.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tax Court decision of April 23, 2004, which confirmed that the continuity rule was part of the tax regime at the time that Electroper\u00fa transferred assets to Egenor, and on the date of the Egenor LSA (on the basis that it was recognized by legal doctrine -, a source of tax law according to Rule III of the Peruvian Tax Code) violates the constitutional principle of legality stabilized under the DEI Bermuda LSA and does not meet the threshold established by the reasonability test applied by the Tribunal in the Award.\n\n27.\n\nHaving decided that the continuity rule was neither in force at the relevant time nor stabilized under the Egenor and the DEI Bermuda LSA, it is unnecessary to decide whether the constitution of Egenor qualified as a corporate division for tax purposes.11\n\nNotwithstanding so, it should be noted that, pursuant to Article 106 of the Income Tax Law, the Executive was the one empowered to establish the meaning of \"division\" through the implementing regulations and not the Tax Court. In its April 23, 2004 decision, the Tax Court first held that Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law was not in force *(see* p. 5 of the Tax Court decision, Spanish original). However, it then filled that gap by applying its own criteria. Through this reasoning, the Tax Court actually enforced the very same Chapter XIII that it had held before was not in force.\n\n28.\n\nDue to the majority\u2019s finding on liability concerning the Depreciation Rate Assessment claim, it is also unnecessary to enter into further damages considerations in connection with such claim."}, {"Title": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Dr. Pedro Nikken", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Dr. Pedro Nikken\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Award signed is the result of a careful and exhaustive discussion by the Tribunal on the different factual and legal issues raised by the Parties. The legal issues, already sufficiently complex in and of themselves, had to be analyzed by the Tribunal in an unusual context since the guarantee of legal stability was granted not through an international instrument, but through a private contract, executed under the framework of the Peruvian Civil Code. I should first of all convey my respectful acknowledgment of my colleagues' efforts in considering with intelligence, accuracy, professionalism and sense of justice all the pleas from the parties as well as all the legal problems that we identified.\n\n2.\n\nI concur with my colleagues in the conclusion that the guarantee of legal stability was breached because SUNAT\u2019s assessment of the merger between Norper\u00fa Egenor and Power North (\"the merger\") involved a substantial change in the interpretation and application of the Merger-Revaluation Law (MRL) that prevailed at the time the guarantee was granted to the investor and at the time of the merger itself. The evidence furnished and the circumstances within which the merger was decided show that, according to the uncontested interpretation of the MRL at that time, the only requirement for invoking the tax benefits of the MRL was a formal corporate merger, without regard to the economic significance of the operation.\n\n3.\n\nWhile I therefore agree with my colleagues on the breach of the guarantee of legal stability in respect of the merger, I respectfully dissent on the estoppel issue related to the merger. It is uncontested that the assessment imposed by SUNAT on the tax benefits obtained through the merger was in contradiction with the favorable vote for the same merger by the representatives of Electroper\u00fa (a State enterprise) at the board meeting and at the shareholders\u2019 meeting of Norper\u00fa Egenor. It is also true that several state agencies with mandates related to the privatization (particularly CEPRI-ELP) were informed about the merger, and that they did not object to it. Nevertheless, it is my view that such a contradiction does not, by itself, constitute a breach of a rule of law resulting in the responsibility of the State vis-\u00e0-vis the investor.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that the vote of the representatives of Electroper\u00fa in Norper\u00fa Egenor, one of whom was Mr. Sanchez Gamarra, President of CEPRI-ELP, concurrently with the knowledge of the merger and its tax benefits on the part of CEPRI-ELP itself and other Peruvian agencies, created a situation of estoppel with respect to SUNAT's ability to object later to the merger. In the analysis of the Tribunal, the approval by those State agents of the merger must be understood as the approval by the State itself, so that it was estopped from objecting to the merger afterwards, and could not invoke the independence and the exclusive competence of SUNAT in tax matters in order to justify its assessment of Egenor. The Tribunal has emphasized that, *\"(i)n international law, it is possible for entities and agencies other than the national tax service to bind the State to a particular position concerning transactions with tax implications*.\"(Para. 432)\n\n5.\n\n*Estoppel,* as a rule of international law, and the doctrine of *actos propios,* in the context of Peruvian law, are, beyond any doubt, applicable law for the Tribunal. The rule of law by virtue of which *Venire contra factum proprium non valet* prevents any person, and particularly the State, from taking action or making representations that would contradict acts or representations adopted in the past, in detriment to another party. As Vice-president Alfaro observed in his separate opinion in the case of *Temple of Preha Vihear, \"a State party to an international litigation is bound by its previous acts or attitude when they are in contradiction with its claims in the litigation.\"*\n\n6.\n\n*Estoppel,* as well as the doctrine of *actos propios,* compels consistency in the behavior of every person in its relations with third parties. The State, in particular, must act in a consistent manner. Nevertheless, consistency cannot be understood either as the inexorable command of past over future or as creating an absolute duty not to challenge in the future any act by a State's agent. As the Tribunal recognizes, by virtue of estoppel, \"the State assumes the risk for the acts of its organs or officials which, *by their nature,* may reasonably *induce reliance* in third parties. As such, what is relevant for estoppel is that there has been a declaration, representation, or conduct which has in fact induced ***reasonable reliance*** by a third party, which means that the State, even if only implicitly, has committed not to change its course.\" (Para. 246; italics from the Award, emphasis added).\n\n7.\n\nA decisive component of estoppel is the reliance induced in the other party by the reasonable appearance created by an agent of the State. As stated in the award, at issue is \"the reasonable appearance that the representation binds the State\". (Para. 247) The appearance is \"reasonable\" when, within the specific circumstances of the case, the act or representation creates confidence in the other party that it expresses a position that will not be contradicted in the future. \"Reasonableness\" also refers to confidence: circumstances should be such that any third party, in the same position, could rely on the act or representation as expressing a position that is binding on the State. \"Reasonableness\", as any other standard, does not operate in a void, but in light of the particular circumstances of each case. The analysis must take into account what the concerned parties knew or are deemed to have known.\n\n8.\n\nAs recognized in the Award, \"the competence, or rather, *the manifest lack of competence,* of a State organ is relevant, given that no one can reasonably have confidence in representations or statements coming from an organ which manifestly lacks the competence to make them.\" (Para. 247). Incompetence is *manifest* when it cannot be unknown to the other party. Borrowing the language of Article 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (also mentioned in the Award) and the principle underlying that provision, for the conduct or representation of an organ of the State to give rise to estoppel, it must be *unambiguous,* i.e. *in accordance with normal practice and in good faith,* it should be perceived by third parties as the expression of a position of the State that is incompatible with the possibility of being contradicted in the future. In the same sense, it must be understood that an agent or organ of the State that acts outside the sphere of its competence does not bind the State when its lack of competence should be objectively evident for any third party acting in conformity with usual practice and in good faith.\n\n9.\n\nIn relationships between States, the degree of incompetence of the agent of the State required in order to exclude estoppel has the highest threshold: the incompetence must affect a norm of fundamental importance in domestic law, which cannot be unknown to any State. It is normal that, *in accordance with normal practice and in good faith,* a State need not know the legal order of another State beyond the level of fundamentals, and that it should be able to trust other States to respect their own domestic law.\n\n10.\n\nThe relationship between a State and an investor, however, is not identical to the relationship between two States. An investor must know the legal order of the State within whose jurisdiction he has invested, at least in respect of the fundamental issues connected with his economic activity. The tax law is one of them. This does not mean that an investor must have exhaustive knowledge of the tax regime and the interpretation of the tax laws. But there are certain fundamental rules that an investor has to know, among them the rules that determine which organ can approve or object to tax accounting and within what delays it must exercise its powers. If an agent of the State that is manifestly incompetent in tax matters has approved a taxable act, every investor must know that the tax authority remains entitled to object to it within the prescribed period. The only facts creating a reasonable appearance that a taxable act will not be challenged in the future are either its approval by the tax authority or the expiration of the term within which it can be challenged. In other words, the approval of a taxable act by an official or an agency manifestly incompetent in tax matters cannot, by itself, create a *reasonable appearance* inducing an investor (national or foreign) to rely on the invulnerability of that act, in the sense that it could not be objected to by the tax authority within the prescribed period. Every investor knows or must be deemed to know that the approval by an incompetent organ is not legally incompatible with the possibility that the competent tax authority will assess a taxable act in the future.\n\n11.\n\nThe International Court of Justice has opined several times on the general requirements that must be met in order to invoke estoppel. One of them consists in *a conduct, declarations and the like made by a State which clearly and consistently (d\u2019une mani\u00e8re claire et constante) evinced acceptance by that State of a particular r\u00e9gime.*1 In my view, an investor cannot reasonably conclude that a tax matter has been approved in a *clear and consistent way (d\u2019une mani\u00e8re claire et constante)* by the State if the tax authority has not intervened at all in the so-called approval and if the period prescribed for assessment is still open.\n\nNorth Sea Continental Shelf: Judgment, I.

Reports 1998, p. 275, para. 57.\n\n12.\n\nThis view is consistent with normal practice in privatizations. When the seller of the privatized company\u2019s shares is a State enterprise, it is understood that all tax operations and the financial statements of the privatized company have been approved by its owner (that is to say, by a State enterprise). However, normally the sale and purchase agreement includes a clause by which the selling company assumes responsibility for any hidden tax liabilities. This means that the tax authority continues to be entitled to assess the privatized company, even if its operations and their tax effect have been approved by the prior shareholders (agents of the State) and by the agencies in charge of the privatization. Consequently, there is no guarantee that the tax authority will not object to the tax operations approved by the seller. In case of assessment by the tax authority, however, the liability is assumed by the seller. That was the case for Egenor\u2019s privatization in 1996. The sale and purchase agreement between Electroper\u00fa and Dominion (Inversiones Dominion Per\u00fa S.A.) included a clause according to which the seller (Electroper\u00fa) assumed liability for *\"any tax, interest, surcharge, or fine, without exception, resulting from any formal or material failure to comply with tax obligations\"*2 by Egenor up to the closing date (clause 11.9.1).\n\n*... \"cualquier tributo, inter\u00e9s, recargo o multa, sin excepci\u00f3n, que resulte de cualquier incumplimiento formal o material de obligaciones tributarias\".*\n\n13.\n\nEvery foreign investor knows or must be deemed to know that the approval by the State shareholders, or the agencies in charge of privatization, of the tax accounts of a company that is privatized does not extinguish contingent tax liabilities nor precludes audit and/or assessment by the tax authority. Moreover, it is a general principle of law that the seller is responsible for hidden liabilities and/or defects *(\"vicios ocultos\")* in what is sold, as established in articles 1503 and following of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal was presented no evidence relating to how hidden liabilities (whether or not tax related) were addressed in the share transfer agreement between Dominion and Duke. The relationship between those companies was not a matter for this arbitration; moreover, what they may have agreed on this issue was not relevant in determining the breach of the guarantee of legal stability by Peru, as the Tribunal has concluded. Nevertheless, as regards estoppel, any agreement on hidden liabilities between Dominion and Duke could have been relevant in determining the extent to which Duke relied on the approval of some of Egenor\u2019s practices by Electroper\u00fa and other agencies as \"immunization\" of Egenor against the objections that SUNAT could later make against those practices.\n\n15.\n\nIn my opinion, the favorable vote for the merger by the representatives of Electroper\u00fa on the board and at the shareholders\u2019 meeting of Egenor cannot be construed as representing the State\u2019s position on the legality of the merger or as creating a reasonable expectation that SUNAT would not object to it. Electroper\u00fa was a minority shareholder in Egenor. Its representatives at the shareholders\u2019 meeting and on the board did not contribute to designing the merger proposal, which came from Egenor\u2019s management. The company\u2019s legal adviser indicated, ***only verbally,*** that the merger would generate certain tax benefits. This legal opinion, certainly provided in good faith, did not present any possible controversial aspect, nor did it include reference to or examination of different interpretations of the MRL; accordingly, it was also accepted in good faith, and did not imply approval of one particular interpretation of the law over possible alternative interpretations. The transaction was presented by the legal adviser as something absolutely clear and undisputable, and therefore no particular conclusion should be drawn from the regular and unanimous approval by the shareholders and directors, including minority shareholders, to which the proposal was presented.\n\n16.\n\nThe representatives of Electroper\u00fa must be permitted to commit the same mistake that the other shareholders and directors made. Their status does not give particular weight to such mistake (they did not \"have to know\" that the application of the MRL was questionable) and they did not have the authority to prevent future taxation consequences, since that would be clearly beyond their area of competence. In this context, it is difficult to attribute particular significance to the vote of Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives, much less that of being an unequivocal act through which the Peruvian State approved the fiscal legality of the merger, in such a way that not even SUNAT, the only competent organ of the State in tax matters, could assess or examine it.\n\n17.\n\nThe uncontested context of the merger approval, including its tax benefits, is understandable because the practice and the interpretation of the MRL prevailing at that time did not raise particular doubts about the legality of the tax benefits. That was probably the reason the legal adviser did not raise the issue, and why the members of the board and the shareholders did not require any explanation about the MRL mechanism. That was the \"stabilized\" interpretation that was ignored by SUNAT\u2019s assessment, resulting in the breach of the guarantee of legal stability. But that is not a matter involving estoppel; it is a different ground of State responsibility under the LSA, as identified in the Award. The absence of any objection to the merger from State agencies, and the favourable vote of the members of the board and the shareholders of Egenor, may be explained by the fact that the issue was not controversial. In other words, the basis of the investor\u2019s *legitimate expectations* was the MRL's interpretation prevailing at that time, and not the other State\u2019s agents\u2019 behavior, which was no more than the expression and the confirmation of such interpretation.\n\n18.\n\nIn my opinion, if such general practice and such interpretation of the MRL had not existed, the approval of the merger by the representatives of Electropeni and the absence of objections from other Peruvian agencies would not have been sufficient to establish the responsibility of the State on the sole ground of estoppel. Had SUNAT\u2019s position before the merger been contrary to the interpretation of the MRL relied on by Egenor, it could have legitimately objected to the tax benefits of the merger; in that case, neither the approval of the merger by the members of the board and the shareholders representing Electropeni, nor the absence of objection to the merger by agencies related to the privatization, could have validated the violation of the tax law, as interpreted by SUNAT.\n\n19.\n\nConsequently, in my view, no particular consequences flow from the conduct of the State actors concerning the merger, at least none that would go beyond what is emphasized in paragraph 380 of the Award: such conduct confirms that, at the time of the merger, and up to Duke\u2019s investment in Egenor, the prevailing interpretation of the MRL was that all that was required in order to enjoy its tax benefits was a formal merger. The legal stabilization agreement was breached because SUNAT\u2019s assessment disregarded the earlier prevailing interpretation, not because the State\u2019s agents\u2019 behavior concerning the merger, by itself, created a situation of estoppel. Consequently, respectfully I dissent from the conclusions of the Tribunal\u2019s majority on this point."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 7 October 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(ICSID** or the **\"Centre\")** received a request for arbitration (the **\"Request\")** submitted by Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. **(\"DEI Bermuda\"** or the **\"Claimant\"),** a company organized under the laws of Bermuda. DEI Bermuda is owned by Duke Energy International Latin America Ltd., another Bermudan company, and indirectly, by Duke Energy International LLC **(\"Duke Energy\").**\n\n2.\n\nThe Request was submitted in regard to a dispute with the Republic of Peru **(\"Peru\"** or the **\"Respondent\")** concerning a legal stability agreement concluded between Peru and DEI Bermuda (the **\"DEI Bermuda LSA\").** According to DEI Bermuda, Peru has imposed a tax assessment in violation of certain guarantees in the DEI Bermuda LSA. The Request invokes the arbitration provision of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n3.\n\nThe Centre, on October 9, 2003, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings **(\"Institution Rules\")** acknowledged receipt of the Request and, on the same day, transmitted a copy to Peru and to the Embassy of Peru in Washington, D.C.\n\n4.\n\nThe Request was registered by the Centre on October 24, 2003, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and, on the same day, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn January 23, 2004, the parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case was to consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the parties and the third arbitrator who would be the President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the parties. In the event that the parties were to fail to appoint an arbitrator or fail to agree on the President of the Tribunal, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the Centre was to appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed.\n\n6.\n\nClaimant, by a letter of January 23, 2004, appointed Dr. H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal, a national of Argentina, as its arbitrator. Following Dr. Mairal\u2019s decision to recuse himself, communicated to the Centre by letter of March 9, 2004, which then communicated the recusal to the parties by letter of March 11, 2004, Claimant, by a letter of March 19, 2004, appointed Dr. Guido S. Tawil, a national of Argentina, as its arbitrator. Respondent, by letter dated February 20, 2004, appointed Dr. Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela, as its arbitrator. By agreement communicated to the Centre by letter of May 12, 2004, the parties appointed Mr. L.Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., a national of Canada, as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointment, the Centre, by a letter of June 3, 2004, informed the parties of the constitution of the Tribunal consisting of Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., Dr. Pedro Nikken and Dr. Guido S. Tawil, and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1). In the same letter the Centre informed the parties that Ms. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Senior Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. The Centre informed the Tribunal and the parties, by letter dated August 27, 2007, that Ms. Alvarez Avila would be on leave as of that date, and would be replaced during her absence by Ms. Natali Sequeira.\n\n8.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal scheduled a first session for July 28, 2004. The parties, by letter from Claimant (with attachment) of July 26, 2004 and letter from Respondent of the same date, communicated to the Tribunal their agreement on procedural matters identified in the provisional agenda for the first session, which had been sent to them by the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary.\n\n9.\n\nIn its letter of July 26, 2004, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it intended to raise objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims, that the parties were unable to agree on the procedure for the jurisdictional phase and that Claimant withheld its agreement to a separate phase on jurisdiction and admissibility. In the same letter, Respondent invoked ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3), according to which the proceedings on the merits are suspended upon the formal raising of an objection that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and proposed a schedule for written submissions and a hearing on the issues of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held as scheduled on July 28, 2004 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The parties reiterated their agreement on the points communicated to the Tribunal in their respective letters of July 26, 2004. In light of Respondent\u2019s letter of July 26, 2004, indicating its intention to raise objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims, the President invited the parties to present briefly their views on these issues and on the issue of possible bifurcation of the proceedings. Having considered the views of the parties and the relevant rules and, after having deliberated, the Tribunal decided to suspend the proceedings on the merits pursuant to Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules and to bifurcate the proceedings. It was decided that each party would submit its observations on objections to jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims and that the Tribunal would decide at a later stage whether it would deal with these objections as a preliminary question or join them to the merits of the dispute. The remainder of the procedural issues on the agenda for the session, including the time limits for the jurisdictional submissions, were discussed and agreed. All the conclusions were reflected in the written minutes of the session, signed by the President and Secretary of the Tribunal, and provided to the parties as well as to all members of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Jurisdictional Phase of the Proceeding**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on October 4, 2004, Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on December 6, 2004, and Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on January 24, 2005.\n\n12.\n\nOn February 3, 2005, Claimant requested the Tribunal to grant Claimant an extension until March 11, 2005 to submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. Claimant cited as the reason for this request the fact that the extension would give Claimant approximately the same amount of time to file its Rejoinder as Respondent had to file its Reply. Respondent, in a letter of February 4, 2005, objected to Claimant\u2019s request, stating that the extension would unfairly burden Respondent and prejudice its preparation for the pre-hearing conference (which had been scheduled for March 14, 2005) and the hearing itself.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing a further letter from Claimant dated February 5, 2005 and a further letter from Respondent dated February 7, 2005, the Tribunal, by its Secretary\u2019s letter of February 7, 2005, communicated to the parties its decision to grant Claimant an extension until March 9, 2005 to file its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. By the same letter, the Tribunal indicated that the date for the pre-hearing conference (i.e., March 14, 2005) remained unchanged.\n\n14.\n\nIn compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on March 9, 2005.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the pre-hearing call with the parties of March 14, 2005, at which the parties had indicated that they were not intending to call any witnesses at the hearing, the Tribunal, through its Secretary\u2019s letter of March 15, 2005, requested each party to call one witness of its choice to address the history of the negotiations between Peru and Duke Energy in connection with the issues relevant to jurisdiction. By letter of March 17, 2005, Respondent nominated as its witness Mr. Carlos Herrera. By letter of same date, Claimant nominated as its witness Dr. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Amado. During the pre-hearing call, the parties confirmed their agreement to the appointment of Mr. Martin J. Valasek, an associate of the Chairman, as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule agreed on July 28, 2004, the hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on March 29-30, 2005. The parties were represented at the hearing by their respective counsel, who made presentations to the Tribunal and examined the witnesses. Members of the Tribunal also questioned witnesses. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal:* Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., President; Dr. Guido S. Tawil and Dr. Pedro Nikken.\n\n*Secretary to the Tribunal:* Ms. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, ICSID Secretariat.\n\n*Assistant to the Tribunal:* Mr. Martin J. Valasek, Ogilvy Renault LLP.\n\n*Attending on behalf of the Claimant:*\n\nMessrs. C. Mark Baker, Arif H. Ali and Baiju S. Vasani, from Fulbright & Jaworski LLP; Mr. Dean M. Moesser and Ms. Dora Avendano, from Duke Energy; and Dr. Luis G. Miranda and Dr. Italo Carrano from Miranda & Amado Abogados.\n\n*Attending on behalf of the Respondent:*\n\nH.E. Eduardo Ferrero, Ambassador of Peru in Washington, D.C.; Dra. Cecilia Blume, Chief of Staff, Ministry of Economy; Dr. Aurelio Loret de Mola, Advisor, Ministry of Economy; Messrs. Alejandro Riveros, Italo Acha and Renzo Villa, Embassy of Peru in Washington, D.C.; Dr. Jorge Santistevan, of Santistevan de Noriega & Guti\u00e9rrez, Counsel for Respondent; from Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP: Messrs. Daniel M. Price, Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Alan Charles Raul, Nicolas Lloreda, Patricio Grand and Cassidy Pinegar.\n\n17.\n\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the Tribunal considered Claimant\u2019s letters of March 25 and March 28, 2005, and Respondent\u2019s letters in reply thereto dated March 28, 2005. The Tribunal decided to admit the additional exhibits which were attached to the parties\u2019 letters, inasmuch as these were considered to be helpful to the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the jurisdictional issues, but decided to exclude the content of Claimant\u2019s March 28, 2005 letter on the basis that it was an unsolicited and irregular pleading.\n\n18.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of communication, including a meeting for deliberations in Washington, D.C. on March 30, 2005.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, dated February 1, 2006, was communicated to the parties on February 2, 2006. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided that:\n\n1. The dispute submitted by DEI Bermuda was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n2. Respondent\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the dispute based on the finality of the decision of the Peruvian Tax Court were rejected. Respondent\u2019s remaining objections to the admissibility of the dispute were joined to the merits.\n\n3. The costs of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration were reserved.\n\n20.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional phase, and as is more fully documented at paragraphs 15-18 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, Respondent filed with the Tribunal a Request for Provisional Measures that was subsequently withdrawn. A request by the Respondent for directions under Arbitration Rule 34(2), also made during the jurisdictional phase, was determined by the Tribunal to be moot, as is more fully documented at paragraph 19 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n**D. Merits Phase of the Proceeding**\n-------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn March 2, 2006, the parties submitted an agreed procedural calendar for the merits phase of the proceeding, pursuant to which Claimant\u2019s Memorial was due on June 16, 2006, Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial was due on September 29, 2006, Claimant\u2019s Reply was due on December 22, 2006 and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder was due on March 30, 2007. On June 15, 2006, the parties informed the Centre that the parties had agreed to an extension for the filing of Claimant\u2019s Memorial until June 19, 2006. The parties also agreed that Respondent would benefit from six additional days, to be used at its discretion, in connection with its forthcoming filings. Respondent agreed to confirm at a later date how it wished to allocate the additional days.\n\n22.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar, Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits, together with supporting witness statements and expert reports, on June 19, 2006. On September 27, 2006, counsel for the Respondent informed the Centre that - with the agreement of the Claimant - it would file its Counter-Memorial on October 5, 2006, and that such extension would not affect the rest of the schedule as agreed by the parties and confirmed by the Tribunal. Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial, together with supporting witness statements and expert reports, on October 5, 2006. Claimant submitted its Reply, together with supplemental witness statements and expert reports, on December 22, 2006. Respondent submitted its Rejoinder, together with supporting witness statements and expert reports, on March 30, 2007.\n\n23.\n\nClaimant submitted witness statements from the following individuals: Dr. Javier Nunez Carvallo, Mr. John T. Sickman, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Amado, Ms. Julie A. Dill, Mr. Mickey J. Peters, Mr. Mark T. Cox IV and Pastor William Gary Narron.\n\n24.\n\nClaimant submitted expert reports from the following individuals: Prof. C\u00e9sar Talledo Maz\u00fc, Prof. Fernando de Trazegnies Granda, Mr. Fritz Du Bois, Prof. Jorge Avendano, Prof. Rudolf Dolzer, Prof. Thomas W\u00e0lde and Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek.\n\n25.\n\nRespondent submitted witness statements from the following individuals: Mr. Alejandro Manuel Alfageme Rodriguez Larrain, Mr. Luis Alberto Arias Minaya, Mr. Gustavo Caillaux Zazzali, Mr. Nelly Natividad del Aguila Sanchez, Mr. Carlos Herrera, Mr. Daniel Hokama Tokashiki, Dr. Manuel A.

V\u00e2squez Marin, Mr. Pedro Jos\u00e9 Velarde Bragagnini, Mr. Pablo Manuel Cueto Saco, Mr. Jean Delboy, Mr. Antero Flores-Ar\u00e1oz Esparza and Mr. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard.\n\n26.\n\nRespondent submitted expert reports from the following individuals: Prof. Alfredo Bullard, Mr. Pablo Bustamante, Dr. Luis Hern\u00e1ndez Berenguel, Dr. C\u00e9sar Luna-Victoria, Prof. Marcial Rubio Correa, and Prof. Shoschana Zusman Tinman.\n\n27.\n\nThe parties submitted a joint letter dated April 4, 2007 to the Centre, for transmission to the Tribunal, containing the parties\u2019 preliminary views on the conduct of the hearing scheduled for May 8 to 18, 2007. On behalf of the Tribunal, the President held a pre-hearing conference call with lead counsel for each party on April 5, 2007. Among other things, the parties confirmed during that call that they would exchange a list of witnesses and experts that they intended to call at the hearing.\n\n28.\n\nThe parties submitted a letter to the Centre dated April 13, 2007, for transmittal to the Tribunal, in which they agreed on the list of witnesses and experts that they intended to call at the merits hearing scheduled for May 8 to 18, 2007. According to the parties\u2019 agreement, the following witnesses and experts were identified for examination and cross-examination at the hearing: Dr. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Amado, Mr. Mark T. Cox IV, Prof. Rudolf Dolzer, Mr. Fritz Du Bois, Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, Pastor William Gary Narron, Dr. Javier N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carvallo, Mr. John T. Sickman, Prof. C\u00e9sar Talledo Maz\u00fa, Prof. Fernando de Trazegnies Granda, Prof. Thomas W\u00e4lde, Prof. Alfredo Bullard and Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez Gamarra.\n\n29.\n\nOn April 26, 2007, on behalf of the Tribunal, the President sent a letter to the parties stating, in relevant part:\n\nIn preparation for the hearing on the merits in this matter, to be held in Washington D.C. on 8 to 18 May 2007, each party has notified the other party and the Tribunal as to the witnesses it intends to call for examination and cross-examination. Those that have not been called are Ms. Julie Ann Dill, Mr. Mickey J. Peters (Claimant\u2019s witnesses), Prof. Jorge Avenda\u00f1o (Claimant\u2019s expert) as well as all of Respondent\u2019s witnesses and experts except for Prof Alfredo Bullard and Mr. Pedro Sanchez Gamarra.\n\nParagraph 3 of Section 19 of the Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal held on 28 July 2004 provides as follows:\n\nA party shall produce at the hearing for examination and cross-examination any witness whose written testimony has been advanced with the written submissions. The Tribunal shall disregard the testimony of any such witness who does not appear at the hearing for examination and cross-examination.\n\nOn 18 April 2007, the ICSID Secretariat communicated to the parties the Tribunal\u2019s request for clarification as to the effect the Tribunal should give to the declarations of the witnesses and experts that have not been called by the parties, considering the language of paragraph 3 of Section 19 of the Minutes of the First Session. Respondent submitted its comments by letter dated 19 April 2007, and Claimant submitted its comments by letter dated 23 April 2007.\n\nIn accordance with the parties\u2019 shared understanding, as expressed in the letters referred to above, the Tribunal will consider the written statements of those witnesses and experts who have not been called to testify at the hearing as part of the evidentiary record and evaluate those statements in light of the record as well as the oral testimony of the witnesses and experts called to testify at the hearing.\n\n30.\n\nThe merits hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. between May 8 and May 16, 2007. During the hearing, the parties agreed to close the hearing two days in advance. As Prof. Alfredo Bullard and Mr. Pedro Sanchez Gamarra were not available to present testimony prior to such date, Claimant agreed to waive its right to examine them. Therefore, the Tribunal did not hear live testimony from any of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses or experts.1\n\nThe hearing was conducted in English with simultaneous interpretation and transcription into Spanish. Some of the witnesses testified in Spanish, and their testimony was simultaneously interpreted and transcribed into English. Due to the practical limitations on the accuracy of simultaneous interpretation and transcription, in some cases there are minor discrepancies between the English and Spanish versions of the transcript. This explains the differences that can be discerned, in some cases, between the quotations to the transcript in the English and Spanish versions of this Award.\n\n31.\n\nThe parties were represented at the hearing by their respective counsel, who made presentations to the Tribunal and examined the witnesses. Members of the Tribunal also questioned witnesses. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal:* Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., President; Dr. Guido S. Tawil and Dr. Pedro Nikken.\n\n*Secretary to the Tribunal:* Ms. Natali Sequeira, ICSID Secretariat.\n\n*Assistant to the Tribunal:* Mr. Martin J. Valasek, Ogilvy Renault LLP.\n\n*Attending on behalf of the Claimant:*\n\nMessrs. C. Mark Baker, Kevin O\u2019Gorman, Jonathan Sutcliffe, An\u00edbal Sabater, and David Chung and Ms. Sandra March, from Fulbright & Jaworski LLP; Messrs. Arif H. Ali and Baiju S. Vasani, Ms. Kassi Tallent and Ms. Lynnea Vanasek, from Crowell & Moring; Dr. Luis G. Miranda and Dr. Italo Carrano from Miranda & Amado Abogados; and Messrs. Dean M. Moesser, Marc Manly and John Enloe, Ms. Dora Avenda\u00f1o and Ms. Catherine Stempien, from Duke Energy; and\n\n*Attending on behalf of the Respondent:*\n\nMessrs. Manuel Talavera, Renzo Villa, Percy Velarde and Carlos Ramirez, from the Government of Peru; Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, counsel; Messrs. Daniel M. Price, Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Nicol\u00e1s Lloreda, Patricio Gran\u00e9 and Michael J. Smart and Ms. Sharon H. Yuan, from Sidley Austin LLP; Mr. Jorge Santistevan, counsel from Santistevan de Noriega & Asociados; Ms. Vilma Belen-Pettorino, Ms. Janet Deane, Ms. Dara Levinson, Messrs. Ryan Brutger and Gus Kryder, from Sidley Austin LLP.\n\n32.\n\nAt the hearing, during his direct examination, Mr. Kaczmarek produced updated calculations for his damages assessment. Respondent sought leave to comment on this new evidence and, with the Tribunal\u2019s permission and by agreement with Claimant, submitted such comments on June 1, 2007.\n\n33.\n\nDuring the hearing, it was agreed that the parties would submit Post-hearing Briefs by June 29, 2007, and that the Tribunal would provide the parties with a list of questions to address in those briefs by the end of May.\n\n34.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Tribunal submitted the following questions to the parties on May 31, 2007:\n\n1. What is the status of international law in the Peruvian legal system? Please specify if any distinction should be made as between treaties and other sources of international law.\n\n2. What is the substantive difference between, on the one hand, the concepts of good faith and *actos propios* under Peruvian law and, on the other hand, the concepts of good faith and estoppel under international law? If there is a difference, what is the significance of that difference applied to this case to the extent that those concepts apply?\n\n3. What should be the rule of attribution of conduct to the State in the context of estoppel?\n\n4. The Egenor LSA was effective from 24 July 1996 until 24 July 2006; the DEI Bermuda LSA is effective from 24 July 2001 until 24 July 2011. The intersection of the two LSAs creates three distinct five-year periods: (i) 24 July 1996 until 24 July 2001 (during which only the Egenor LSA was effective); (ii) 24 July 2001 until 24 July 2006 (during which both LSAs were effective); and 24 July 2006 until 24 July 2011 (during which only the DEI Bermuda LSA is effective). How do the two LSAs interact in each of these three periods, and with what effect for purposes of the guarantees provided to Claimant in the DEI Bermuda LSA? How does the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, dated 13 October 1999, and assigned to DEI Peru Holdings on 3 April 2003, fit into the analysis, if at all?\n\n5. Does any change in the interpretation of the tax regime stabilized for an investor/company violate its LSA, or does the change need to be wholly or manifestly inconsistent with the prior interpretation? In other words, at what point does a change in interpretation become actionable under an LSA?\n\n6. Also, what constitutes an \"interpretation\" of the tax regime? Is it sufficient to look to representations made by any state actors to the investor/taxpayer, or is it necessary to look to actual judicial or administrative pronouncements by the relevant tax authorities?\n\n7. Even if the approval of various acts by Electroperu, as shareholder of Egenor, is considered a governmental act generally, can such approval bind SUNAT on tax matters? Is there a difference in how this question is answered under Peruvian law vs. applicable international law?\n\n8. Did the Government of Peru take into account the general \"statutory\" depreciation rate and/or the benefits of the Merger Revaluation Law in establishing the minimum bid price for the 30 Percent Tranche?\n\n9. If Egenor were an entirely private company, i.e. without any Electropeni representatives either on the board or at the shareholders\u2019 meeting, owned by Dominion since 1996 to the present date, could a claim for breach of the Dominion LSA be sustained in the same way as is argued in this case for the DEI Bermuda LSA, assuming the other facts remained the same?\n\n35.\n\nEach of the parties submitted its Post-hearing Brief on June 29, 2007, including its answers to the Tribunal\u2019s questions. The parties each submitted their respective Submission on Costs on July 25, 2007. On August 30, 2007 the Claimant submitted a Suplement to its Submission on Costs.\n\n36.\n\nFollowing the submission of Post-hearing Briefs, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of communication, including meetings for deliberations in Montreal on July 23-24, 2007, in Washington, D.C. on December 10, 2007, in New York on February 3, 2008, and by conference call on February 22, 2008. On June 19, 2008, the proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Peru\u2019s Investment Protection Scheme**\n------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe current scheme for the promotion and protection of foreign investment in Peru originated in the early 1990s. At that time, Peru began efforts to attract and promote investment in the country, reversing the policies pursued by previous administrations.\n\n38.\n\nIt was in this context that Law No. 25327 was adopted, authorizing the Executive Branch to legislate on matters of investment and investment protection. Pursuant to it, Legislative Decree No. 662 (Foreign Investment Law), Legislative Decree No. 674 (Privatization Law) and Legislative Decree No. 757 (Private Investment Law) were promulgated, as were the Regulations of the Regime to Guarantee Private Investment, approved by Supreme Decree No. 162-92-EF **(\"Investment Regulations\").**\n\n39.\n\nThese instruments provide various guarantees to foreign investors in Peru. In connection with a specific investment, the guarantees may be implemented through binding contracts referred to as \"legal stability agreements\" **(\"LSAs\"),** entered into by Peru and the foreign investor. The authorization to enter into LSAs is contained in the Foreign Investment Law and the Private Investment Law. Relevant provisions of both laws are typically incorporated by reference into such agreements.\n\n40.\n\nThe standard text for all LSAs is incorporated as an annex to the Investment Regulations. The text refers in general terms to the stabilization of legal regimes applicable to various fundamental rights of foreign investors, including: (i) the right to equal treatment and non-discrimination; (ii) the right to free convertibility of foreign currency; (iii) the right to free repatriation of invested capital, profits and royalties; (iv) the right to income tax stabilization; and (v) the right to resolve disputes arising out of or in connection with the agreement by arbitration or other agreed method.\n\n41.\n\nUnder Peruvian law, the *Civil Code* provisions governing private contracts in general are also applicable to LSAs and, as such, these agreements are subject to the principle of *Contrato-Ley,* as set forth in Article 1357 of the 1984 *Civil Code.* That Article states as follows:\n\n**Garant\u00eda y seguridad del Estado.** Por ley, sustentada en razones de inter\u00e9s social, nacional o p\u00fablico, pueden establecerse garant\u00edas y seguridades otorgadas por el Estado mediante contrato.2\n\nUnofficial Translation : By law, supported by reasons of social, national or public interest, the State may establish guarantees and assurances by means of a contract.\n\n42.\n\nArticle 39 of the Private Investment Law confirms the foregoing:\n\nLos convenios de estabilidad jur\u00eddica se celebran al amparo del art\u00edculo 1357 del C\u00f3digo Civil y tienen la calidad de contratos con fuerza de ley, de manera que no pueden ser modificados o dejados sin efecto unilateralmente por el Estado. Tales contratos tienen car\u00e1cter civil y no administrativo, y solo podr\u00e1n modificarse o dejarse sin efecto por acuerdo entre las partes.3\n\nUnofficial Translation : Legal stability investment agreements shall be concluded subject to Article 1357 of the Civil Code and shall have the [legal] effect of contracts enforceable as law, such that they may not be modified or terminated unilaterally by the State. Such contracts shall have a private rather than administrative character, and shall only be modified or terminated by agreement between the parties.\n\n43.\n\nFurthermore, as set forth in the last paragraph of Article 62 of the Constitution of Peru, the investment protections provided for by LSAs are guaranteed by the Constitution:\n\nLa libertad de contratar garantiza que las partes pueden pactar v\u00e1lidamente seg\u00fan las normas vigentes al tiempo del contrato. Los t\u00e9rminos contractuales no pueden ser modificados por leyes u otras disposiciones de cualquier clase. Los conflictos derivados de la relaci\u00f3n contractual s\u00f3lo se solucionan en la via arbitral o en la judicial, seg\u00fan los mecanismos de protecci\u00f3n previstos en el contrato o contemplados en la ley.\n\nMediante Contratos-ley, el Estado puede establecer garant\u00edas y otorgar seguridades. No pueden ser modificados legislativamente, sin peijuicio de la protecci\u00f3n a que se refiere el p\u00e1rrafo precedente.4\n\nUnofficial Translation : Liberty to contract guarantees that parties may validly agree according to the legal norms in force at the time of the contract. Contract terms may not be modified by law or other dispositions of any type. Conflicts that arise from contractual relations may only be resolved by arbitration or judicial decree, according to the mechanisms of protection set forth in the contract or contemplated by law.  \n Through contracts-law [special investment-related private contracts of an obligatory character], the State may establish guarantees and grant securities. These may not be modified by legislation, without prejudice to the protection referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n\n44.\n\nThus, pursuant to the investment laws of Peru, the main features of LSAs are that (i) the stabilized legal regimes cannot be changed unilaterally by the State, and (ii) the agreements are subject to private or civil law and not administrative law. As private-law contracts, the negotiation, execution, interpretation and enforcement of the provisions set forth in LSAs are subject to the general principles applicable to contracts between private parties under the Peruvian *Civil Code.* As such, the rights granted by Peru pursuant to an LSA are private contractual rights that are enforceable against the State as if it were a private party.\n\n**B. The Privatization of Egenor**\n----------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn 1991, Peru began to pursue a far-reaching privatization program designed to attract the participation, in particular, of international investors. For this purpose, the Privatization Law established the *Comisi\u00f3n para la Promoci\u00f3n de la Inversion Privada* **(\"COPRI\"),** a Peruvian inter-ministerial body charged with overall supervision of the privatization process.\n\n46.\n\nIn implementing its privatization mandate, COPRI selected the largest state-owned electricity generation company in the country, Electricidad del Per\u00fa S.A. or Electropeni S.A. **(\"Electroper\u00fa\"),** to be restructured into distinct, smaller electricity companies for privatization. In September 1994, as part of the privatization process, COPRI authorized the creation of a company named Empresa de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Nor Per\u00fa S.A. **(\"Egenor\"),** as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electroper\u00fa. Thereafter, assets were transferred to Egenor from three state-owned companies, including Electropeni. Electropeni contributed fixed assets (in addition to cash and inventory) to Egenor consisting of six thermoelectric plants (Chiclayo, Piura, Paita, Suriana, Chimbote and Trujillo) and two hydroelectric plants (Carhuaquero and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato).\n\n47.\n\nCOPRI adopted the following privatization model for Egenor: a controlling 60 percent of the shares of Egenor, representing the company\u2019s Class \"A\" shares, would be sold to a private investor through an international tender process (the **\"60 Percent Tranche\");** 30 percent of the shares, these being Class \"B\" shares, would be retained by Electropeni for a subsequent public offering or share auction (the **\"30 Percent Tranche\");** and the remaining 10 percent of the shares (also Class \"B\" shares) would be held for sale to Electropeni\u2019s employees.\n\n48.\n\nFor each state-owned company being privatized, COPRI established a special committee, known as *Comit\u00e9 Especial de Privatizaci\u00f3n* **(\"CEPRI\"),** responsible for managing and implementing the privatization process, based on guidelines, objectives and policies approved by COPRI. The privatization program for Electropeni was administered by the *Comit\u00e9 Especial de Promoci\u00f3n de la Inversion Privada en Electroper\u00fa S.A.* **(\"CEPRI-ELP\").** By February 1996, CEPRI-ELP had approved the *Bases del Concurso P\u00fablico Internacional para la Venta de Egenor* (the **\"Bidding Rules\")** for the privatization of Egenor, setting out the rules governing the relationship between Peru and the investor with regard to the tender bid. On February 28, 1996, CEPRI-ELP issued its privatization tender for Egenor.\n\n49.\n\nThe winning bidder for the 60 Percent Tranche was Dominion Energy, Inc. **(\"Dominion\")** of the United States of America, which presented its bid through a locally incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary, Inversiones Dominion Per\u00fa S.A. **(\"IDP\").** Between June 25 and August 9, 1996, a privatization agreement (itself dated June 20, 1996), governing the purchase of the 60 Percent Tranche, was executed between Electroper\u00fa and IDP, with Dominion and Egenor as intervening parties (the **\"Privatization Agreement\").** Under the Privatization Agreement, Dominion (as \"Operator\" and \"Holder of the Committed Interest\") was required to maintain control of Egenor with a minimum stake totalling 51 percent of IDP.\n\n50.\n\nOn November 27, 1996, the majority shareholders of Egenor, i.e., IDP (60 percent) and Electroper\u00fa (39.98 percent), approved the merger of Egenor and Power North S.A. **(\"Power North\"),** a corporation established by IDP. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, Egenor S.A., the resulting corporation, assumed all of the assets and debts of Egenor and Power North. The merger of Egenor and Power North was consummated on December 31, 1996 by IDP (60 percent), Electroper\u00fa (39.98 percent), and Electrolima S.A. (0.02 percent).\n\n51.\n\nIn the context of the December 31, 1996 merger, particular assets of Egenor (namely Carhuaquero, Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato, Chimbote and Trujillo) were revalued. Specifically, the book value of these assets was increased to reflect their higher market value, as determined in a September 1996 report prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.\n\n52.\n\nIn 1997, Dominion sold 49 percent of IDP to Gener S.A., a Chilean company. On March 31, 1998, Dominion transferred its remaining 51 percent of IDP to Dominion Holdings Peru S.A. **(\"DHP\"),** a wholly-owned Peruvian subsidiary. Toward the end of 1998, Duke Energy learned of Dominion\u2019s interest in selling its assets in Central and South America, including Peru. Duke Energy was focusing on a coordinated acquisition of a full 90 percent of Egenor (then named Egenor S.A.), representing its total outstanding or available stock (i.e., the 60 Percent Tranche owned by IDP and the 30 Percent Tranche owned by Peru).\n\n53.\n\nDuke Energy acquired Egenor through a series of transactions in late 1999. To comply with Peru\u2019s \"two shareholders\" rule, the acquisitions were completed through two Delaware-based Duke Energy subsidiaries: Duke Energy International Peru Holdings No. 1 LLC **(\"DEI Holdings No. 1\")** and Duke Energy International Peru Holdings No. 2 LLC **(\"DEI Holdings No. 2\",** and together with DEI Holdings No. 1, **\"DEI Holdings USA\").** On October 7, 1999, DEI Holdings USA acquired the 30 Percent Tranche of Egenor S.A.A.5 On October 12, 1999, DEI Holdings USA also acquired 49 percent of IDP from Gener S.A. (and hence Gener S.A.\u2019s indirect 29.4 percent ownership interest in Egenor S.A.A.). Finally, on November 11, 1999, DEI Holdings USA acquired the remaining 51 percent of IDP by purchasing 100 percent of DHP from Dominion.\n\nOn April 16, 1999, Egenor S.A. amended its by-laws and changed its name to Egenor S.A.A. in accordance with the new General Law of Corporations *(Ley General de Sociedades).*\n\n54.\n\nAs of the end of 1999, Duke Energy had become (through DEI Holdings USA) the 90 percent owner of Egenor S.A.A. for which it had paid approximately US$288 million.6\n\nDuke Energy later increased its interest in Egenor S.A.A. (by that time named Duke Energy International Egenor S.A.A., which we have defined below as DEI Egenor) from 90 percent to 99.7 percent by a tender offer initiated in July 2001 by DEI Egenor.\n\n55.\n\nDominion\u2019s sale of DHP *(i.e.,* of its 51 percent interest in IDP) to DEI Holdings USA was subject to the approval of COPRI pursuant to the terms of the Privatization Agreement. Under the Privatization Agreement, Dominion (as Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest) was obligated to maintain its 51 percent interest in IDP for five years from the date of the Agreement *(i.e.,* until August 2001), unless another entity (to which the interest was being transferred) could meet the requirements specified in the Bidding Rules for the Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest. COPRI approved the sale of DHP, and thus Dominion\u2019s ownership interest in Egenor, to Duke Energy (through DEI Holdings USA) on September 22, 1999. On October 5, 1999, Dominion obtained and provided Duke Energy with a Guarantee Agreement between IDP and Peru **(\"Guarantee Agreement\")** pursuant to which Peru guaranteed, in connection with the 60 Percent Tranche, that all of the original obligations assumed, representations and warranties made, and liabilities of Electroper\u00fa remained effective and enforceable against Peru.\n\n56.\n\nDuke Energy\u2019s acquisition of Dominion\u2019s Latin American assets had a number of international tax implications which Duke Energy intended to account for in a corporate reorganization. At the same time, Duke Energy needed to implement an ownership structure for Egenor S.A.A. generally mirroring the structure reflected in the Privatization Agreement. It was against this backdrop that DEI Bermuda was incorporated in August 1999. Subsequently, in May 2000, Duke Energy International Peru Holdings SRL **(\"DEI Peru Holdings\")** was established as a holding company wholly-owned by DEI Bermuda.\n\n57.\n\nOn July 26, 2000, Egenor S.A.A. changed its name to Duke Energy International Egenor S A A **(\"DEI Egenor\")** This entity changed its name to Duke Energy International Egenor S.A. in February 2001 and on June 26, 2003, to Duke Energy International Egenor S en **C** por A, evidencing a change in its corporate form.\n\n58.\n\nOn October 29, 2002, DEI Bermuda acquired 99 percent of DHP from DEI Holdings USA (and hence 51 percent of IDP), and the remaining 49 percent of IDP from DEI Holdings USA. On December 1, 2002, DHP and IDP merged to form Duke Energy International Peru Inversiones No. 1 SRL **(\"DEI Investments SRL\"),** as a result of which DEI Bermuda became the 99 percent owner of DEI Investments SRL, through which it owned 60 percent of DEI Egenor. The remaining 30 percent of DEI Egenor continued to be held by DEI Holdings USA.\n\n59.\n\nOn December 18, 2002, Duke Energy made a capital contribution of US$200 million to DEI Peru Holdings, through DEI Bermuda. DEI Peru Holdings used these funds to acquire 90 percent of the capital stock of DEI Egenor from DEI Investments SRL and DEI Holdings USA.7\n\nSee Independent Auditors\u2019 Report dated April 3, 2003, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 58 (from jurisdictional phase).\n\n**C. The Investment Protection Granted by Peru**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investment Protection Granted to Dominion**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nAs an integral part of the Egenor privatization program and Dominion\u2019s investment in Peru, Peru approved LSAs for Dominion, IDP and Egenor.\n\n61.\n\nSpecifically, shortly after Electroper\u00fa executed the Privatization Agreement, Peru entered into two LSAs on July 24, 1996: one with IDP, as an investor in Egenor (the **\"IDP Domestic Investor LSA\");** the other with Egenor, as a recipient of the investment from IDP (the **\"Egenor LSA\").** Under the former, IDP undertook to pay US$228.2 million for 60 percent of the capital stock of Egenor. Under the latter, Egenor agreed to issue shares representing 60 percent of its capital stock in favour of IDP.\n\n62.\n\nOn August 9, 1996, Peru entered into two additional LSAs: one with Dominion, as a US$228.2 million foreign investor in IDP (the **\"Dominion LSA\");** the other with IDP, as a US$228.2 million investment recipient from Dominion (the **\"IDP Recipient LSA\").**\n\n63.\n\nPeru agreed to guarantee legal stability, in accordance with the terms of these LSAs and the foreign investment laws of Peru, for a period of 10 years, from the effective date of the respective LSAs. The Dominion LSA provided for ICSID arbitration, in the following terms:\n\nTEN.- It being the intention of both parties that problems arising in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement be resolved as expeditiously as possible, the parties agree hereinafter that any dispute, controversy or claim between them, relative to the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement, shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to be resolved by de jure international arbitration, pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Rules set forth in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States which was approved by Peru pursuant to Legislative Resolution N. 26210. The costs incurred in connection with the application of this clause shall be shared by both parties in equal parts.\n\n**2. The Investment Protection Granted to Duke Energy**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn connection with its investment in Peru, Duke Energy sought to obtain the same investment protection, through LSAs, as Dominion had obtained. Duke Energy and its outside counsel worked with Peru on different structures by which Duke Energy would obtain protection for its investment. The possibility of transferring or assigning to Duke Energy at least some of the LSAs that had been entered into by Dominion was seriously and actively considered. These discussions took place while Duke Energy was taking steps to acquire the various direct and indirect interests in Egenor S.A.A.\n\n65.\n\nIn the event, the Dominion LSA was not assigned because of concerns regarding its effectiveness due to a possible incurable default by Dominion under the LSA. As of the closing date for DEI Holdings USA\u2019s acquisition of the 30 Percent Tranche *(i.e.,* October 7, 1999), the first step in Duke Energy\u2019s indirect acquisition of Egenor S.A.A., no mutually acceptable solution had been identified to implement the investment protection regime for Duke Energy. It was thus agreed that DEI Holdings USA would be given an interim LSA, based on the express understanding that it would complete its acquisition of the 60 Percent Tranche of Egenor S.A.A. within 60 days of the date of this interim LSA. Peru and DEI Holdings USA thus executed a foreign investor LSA relating to the 30 Percent Tranche (the **\"DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA\")** on October 13, 1999.\n\n66.\n\nOn October 14, 1999, the Egenor LSA was assigned to Egenor S.A.A. This assignment was performed in order \"(...) to extend the rights granted by the Legal Stability Agreement dated July 24, 1996, signed by Empresa de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Nor Per\u00fa S.A. - E.G.E.N.O.R. to Egenor S.A.A (,..).\"8 By the end of 1999, Duke Energy had become the owner of 90 percent of Egenor S.A.A. However, a solution regarding the assignment of the Dominion LSA had not yet been found.\n\n*See Resoluci\u00f3n Ministerial-No.* 566-99-EM/VME, dated October 6, 1999, Exhibit C-066.\n\n67.\n\nAs explained earlier, as part of Duke Energy\u2019s corporate reorganization, DEI Bermuda was incorporated in August 1999 and DEI Peru Holdings, wholly-owned by DEI Bermuda, was established in May 2000. With reference to the Privatization Agreement, DEI Bermuda was designated as the Operator and Holder of the Committed Interest and DEI Peru Holdings was designated as the bidder and owner of DEI Egenor. Thus, following an application by Duke Energy that was accepted by Peru, DEI Bermuda took the place of Dominion, and DEI Peru Holdings took the place of IDP, under the Privatization Agreement.\n\n68.\n\nIn February 2000, Duke Energy presented Peru with a proposal to obtain the same foreign investor protections that it would have obtained under the Dominion LSA, if the latter had been assignable. The proposal was premised on the requirements of the Privatization Agreement, Duke Energy\u2019s corporate and tax-related reorganization strategy as well as the need to maintain the effectiveness of the LSAs that were already in place (i.e., the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, the IDP Domestic Investor LSA, and the Egenor LSA).\n\n69.\n\nThe proposal presented by Duke Energy was implemented as follows:\n\n1. application for a foreign investor LSA by DEI Bermuda;\n\n2. application for a recipient company LSA by DEI Peru Holdings;\n\n3. the assignment of the DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA, as modified, in favour of DEI Peru Holdings; and\n\n4. the assignment of the IDP Domestic Investor LSA in favor of DEI Peru Holdings.\n\n70.\n\nOn June 20, 2000, Duke Energy filed its request for a foreign investor LSA, through DEI Bermuda, with Peru (previously defined as the DEI Bermuda LSA). A second application for a recipient company LSA was filed that same day through DEI Peru Holdings (the **\"DEI Peru Holdings LSA\")**\n\n71.\n\nOn April 3, 2001, Peru provided drafts of the DEI Bermuda LSA and the DEI Peru Holdings LSA to Duke Energy\u2019s outside counsel for review. With respect to the former, Duke Energy reverted to Peru to request that the draft LSA be modified to provide for ICSID arbitration.\n\n72.\n\nFinally, on July 24, 2001, Peru executed the DEI Bermuda LSA and the DEI Peru Holdings LSA. By their terms, the LSAs were effective immediately. The final version of the DEI Bermuda LSA executed by the parties contained an ICSID arbitration clause, in precisely the same terms as the clause that had been included in the Dominion LSA.9\n\n*See* above, para. 49.\n\n73.\n\nThe DEI Holdings USA 30 Percent Tranche LSA and the IDP Domestic Investor LSA were assigned to DEI Peru Holdings on April 3 and March 14, 2003, respectively.\n\n**D. Egenor\u2019s Tax Practices and Tax Reteirns**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Legislative and Regulatory Background**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nIn the context of the re-orientation of Peru\u2019s economy in the early 1990s, on January 1, 1994, the Government passed Legislative Decree No. 782, which granted State-owned entities the right to reorganize without tax consequences.\n\n75.\n\nSoon after, on January 10, 1994, Congress granted tax-free reorganization benefits to all companies through the Merger Revaluation Law (Law No. 26283). The sole substantive article of the Merger Revaluation Law **(\"MRL\")** provided as follows:\n\nThe formation, and other acts, contracts and transfer of equity, arising from merger or division agreements of any type of legal entity, whether mercantile, civil or cooperatives, shall be exempt from all taxes, including the Income Tax and fees for registration in the Public Registries until December 31, 1994.10\n\n*Art\u00edculo 1\u00b0-Exon\u00e9rese de todo tributo, incluido el Impuesto a la Rentoy los derechos de Inscripci\u00f3n en los Registros P\u00fablicos, la formaci\u00f3n y otros actos, contratos y transferencias partimoniales, derivados de acuerdos de fusi\u00f3n o divisi\u00f3n de toda clase de personas jur\u00eddicas, ya sean mercantiles, civiles o cooperativas, hasta el 31 de diciembre de 1994.* (Exhibit C-14).\n\n76.\n\nOn September 19, 1994, the Government issued Supreme Decree 120-94-EF (Supreme Decree 120) to provide implementing regulations for the Merger Revaluation Law.\n\n77.\n\nThe tax benefits of the MRL were successively extended for annual periods until 1998.11\n\nIn 1994 (Law No. 26416), 1995 (Law No. 26561)and 1996 (Law No. 26733).\n\n78.\n\nOn December 29, 1998, Congress passed Law No. 27034, which provided that companies that had revalued their assets and merged while the MRL was in force could not continue to claim the MRL\u2019s benefits beyond fiscal year 1998.\n\n79.\n\nAs described earlier, Electroper\u00fa contributed fixed assets, namely eight power plants, to Egenor. Theses contributions were made between April 1995 and May 1996. Chi clay o, Piura, Paita and Sullana power plants were transferred at revalued market rates, while the Carhauquero, Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato and Chimbote-Trujillo power plants were contributed at values that equalled historical cost less accumulated depreciation, adjusted for inflation.\n\n80.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, the National Commission on Rates *(Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Tarifas)* issued Resolution No. 013-87P/CTE, establishing the useful life and the depreciation percentage (the depreciation rate) for the fixed assets of the Electric Public Utility Companies. As of 1996, Electroper\u00fa started applying those depreciation rates to the fixed assets owned by Egenor.\n\n81.\n\nOn September 19, 1994, Supreme Decree No. 122-94-EF (the Income Tax Law Regulations) entered into force, setting forth in its Article 22 the provisions and percentages (rates) to be applied for the calculation of depreciation. Subparagraph (d) of Article 22 stipulates that SUNAT may authorize depreciation percentages different from the general ones provided the interested party demonstrates that, due to the nature and characteristics of the exploitation or use given to the good, its useful life is different to that assigned by subparagraph (b), which corresponds to annual depreciation percentages.\n\n82.\n\nOn April 4, 1995, Electroper\u00fa applied by letter to SUNAT for authorization to apply \"the depreciation percentages for the items of the Fixed Assets listed in the table approved by Resolution No. 013-P/CTE issued by the *Comisi\u00f3n de Tarifas* (Commission on Rates), dated April 30, 1987.\" The letter specified that Electroper\u00fa had already been applying such rates \"for corporate operative and tax purposes.\"\n\n83.\n\nOn December 28, 1995, Electroper\u00fa received SUNAT\u2019s permission to continue to apply the special decelerated rate contained in Resolution No. 013-87P/CTE of April 30, 1987 of the Electricity Rate Commission to its assets, commencing in 1996.\n\n84.\n\nA comparison of the general statutory rates and the special decelerated rates is set out in the following table:\n\n**General General Special Special**\n\n**Useful Life Depreciation Rate Useful Life Depreciation Rate**\n\n5 20.00% Various Various\n\n10 10.00% 10, 12, 16 6.25%, 8.33%, 10.00%\n\n**2. Relevant Developments during the Privatization of Egenor**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Bidding Rules issued by CEPRI-ELP in February 1996 contained no specific information about what depreciation rate then applied to Egenor, or what depreciation rate would or should apply to Egenor after it was privatized.\n\n86.\n\nOn May 14, 1996, Dominion, through IDP, submitted an official query to CEPRI-ELP as to the applicable asset depreciation rates, as follows:\n\nWhat is the depreciable value and useful life for tax purposes applicable to each plant? What is the annual depreciation rate for the plant, real property and equipment and in which year do they enter into service?\n\n87.\n\nThe next day, CEPRI-ELP issued Circular No. 15 **(\"Circular 15\")** in response to a similar inquiry from another investor. Circular 15 reads as follows:\n\n**Question 21**\n\nAccording to section 1.5.1 of the Bidding Conditions, ELECTROPER\u00da S.A. shall transfer to EGENOR, before the Closing Date, the assets that are part of the Thermoelectric Power Plants, power lines and hydroelectric plants.\n\nOur question has to do with the valuation of those fixed assets to EGENOR and whether said value shall be treated as the accounting cost basis for depreciation purposes on the Income Tax Returns. Likewise, are those assets to be depreciated at the general rates or can they have a special accelerated treatment.\n\n**Answer 21**\n\nPursuant to section 1.5.1 of the Bidding Conditions prior to the Closing Date, ELECTROPER\u00da S.A. shall transfer to EGENOR the aforementioned assets; and it will be at the very moment of transfer that the value of those assets shall be determined.\n\nThe depreciation rate is the one that corresponds according to the Income Tax Legislation.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n88.\n\nOn June 7, 1996, Electroper\u00fa\u2019s accountants at Egenor contracted outside auditors to prepare financial statements for the company as of June 30, 1996.\n\n89.\n\nOn June 10, 1996, Dominion, through IDP, submitted another query to CEPRI-ELP, inquiring if Egenor itself had received a special depreciation rate from SUNAT (referring to the December 31, 1995 financial statements of Electroper\u00fa). CEPRI-ELP never replied to IDP\u2019s inquiry.\n\n90.\n\nAs stated earlier, on June 20, 1996, IDP was declared the winning bidder of the 60 percent tranche of Egenor, prevailing over a consortium which included Duke Energy by US$5 million.\n\n91.\n\nBetween June 25 and August 9, 1996, Electroper\u00fa, IDP, Dominion and Egenor signed the Privatization Agreement (itself dated June 20, 1996) governing the purchase of the 60 Percent Tranche.\n\n92.\n\nOn June 30, 1996, Villa Naranjo & Associados sent Egenor the company\u2019s latest audited financials as of June 30, 1996.\n\n**3. Relevant Developments during Dominion\u2019s Management of Egenor**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nIDP officially became the 60 per cent shareholder of Egenor and commenced management of the company in conjunction with Electroper\u00fa in August 1996.\n\n94.\n\nOn September 9, 1996, Egenor sent a letter to both Deloitte & Touche and Luna Victoria-V\u00e1squez, requesting information as to the correct depreciation rate for the company. Egenor received contradictory answers from the two firms:\n\n\u2022 On September 25, 1996, Luna Victoria-V\u00e1squez responded to Egenor\u2019s question by concluding that, based on Article 105 of the Income Tax Law, Egenor must apply the special rate granted to Electroper\u00fa in 1995.\n\n\u2022 On October 1, 1996, Deloitte & Touche responded to Egenor\u2019s question by warning Egenor that it could not use the special rate granted to Electroper\u00fa because the rate was specific to the taxpayer that had requested it, namely Electroper\u00fa.\n\n95.\n\nOn October 24, 1996, IDP incorporated Power North at the Lima Commercial Registry and registered it with SUNAT. It had a stated capital of 100,000 shares of one Nuevo Sol par value stock, and owned fixed assets valued at approximately US$1.4 million. It was the legal and beneficial owner of valuable real estate which it leased to Egenor at fair market value for October, November and December 1996, prior to their merger.\n\n96.\n\nIn November 1996, Egenor retained Price Waterhouse to produce a valuation report to establish the market value of Carhauquero, Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato and Chimbote-Trujillo. The Board of Egenor was interested in restating the value of these plants through a merger between Egenor and Power North.\n\n97.\n\nEgenor\u2019s Board of Directors approved the merger of Egenor with Power North on November 25, 1996. Two days later, on November 27, 1996, the merger also received a favourable vote at the general meeting of Egenor\u2019s shareholders.\n\n98.\n\nOn December 10, 1996, Egenor\u2019s accountant sent the Luna Victoria-V\u00e1squez opinion to Deloitte & Touche, asking it to review its analysis in light of that opinion. A week later, on December 17, Deloitte & Touche reconfirmed their original advice, stating that unless Egenor sought authorization from SUNAT for its own special rate, it had to apply the general statutory rate since Egenor would be a company \"created by a simultaneous incorporation\" and not as a consequence of Electroper\u00fa's split.\n\n99.\n\nThe merger between Egenor and Power North was completed by December 31, 1996, resulting in Egenor S.A.\n\n100.\n\nOn January 6, 1997, Deloitte & Touche issued its advice for the third time, reconfirming its two earlier opinions.\n\n101.\n\nIn the first quarter of 1997, Egenor filed its taxes with SUNAT, for the very first time as a partially privatized entity. Following the advice of Deloitte & Touche, Egenor recorded tax depreciation using the general statutory rate.\n\n102.\n\nOn April 8, 1997, Electroper\u00fa voted its shares in Egenor to approve the company\u2019s 1996 Financial Statements, dividend distributions and annual reports reflecting (a) application of the general statutory depreciation rate for tax purposes and (b) the asset revaluations on account of the merger between Egenor and Power North. Similarly, Electroper\u00fa approved the 1997 Financial Statements of Egenor on March 23, 1998.\n\n103.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, on December 30, 1998, Congress repealed the Merger Revaluation Law via Law No. 27034.\n\n104.\n\nIn early 1999, SUNAT began to compile a registry of companies that had reorganized and taken advantage of tax benefits during the period the Merger Revaluation Law was in effect.\n\n105.\n\nOn January 25, 1999, SUNAT requested one of Peru\u2019s leading tax experts, Dr. Enrique C\u00e1rdenas, to provide a legal opinion regarding the effect of Law No. 27034 (which repealed the Merger Revaluation Law) on companies with LSAs.\n\n106.\n\nOn January 29, 1999, Dr. Cardenas sent SUNAT the requested legal opinion, in which he concluded that Law 27034 was not applicable to companies with LSAs that had availed themselves of the Merger Revaluation Law and its Regulations.\n\n107.\n\nOn February 25, 1999, Electroper\u00fa sent letters to the Minister of Economy and Finance and to SUNAT requesting their opinion on the effect of Law No. 27034 with respect to privatized companies in the electric sector that had LSAs. Electroper\u00fa\u2019s letter attached the legal opinion of major Lima law firms concluding that the repeal of the Merger Revaluation Law should not affect companies with valid LSAs.\n\n108.\n\nOn March 16, 1999, Electroper\u00fa voted its shares in Egenor to approve the company\u2019s 1998 Financial Statements, dividend distributions and annual reports reflecting (a) application of the general statutory depreciation rates for tax purposes, and (b) the asset revaluations on account of the merger between Egenor and Power North.\n\n**4. Relevant Developments during Duke\u2019s Acquisition of Egenor**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAs stated earlier, in 1999, Duke Energy embarked on a coordinated acquisition of 90 percent of Egenor, representing its total outstanding or available stock (i.e., the 60 Percent Tranche owned by IDP and the 30 Percent Tranche owned by Per\u00fa).\n\n110.\n\nThe 30 Percent Tranche was sold through an auction process coordinated by CEPRI- *Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana* (\"CEPRI-PC\"). In July 1999, Banco de Cr\u00e9dito, which was hired by CEPRI-PC to oversee the sale of the 30 Percent Tranche, requested Estudio Grau Abogados - external counsel to Egenor - to provide a due diligence report on Egenor, including its tax compliance, as part of the data room to be provided for investors interested in purchasing the 30 Percent Tranche.\n\n111.\n\nEstudio Grau had already prepared a legal opinion for Egenor on January 5, 1999, in which it stated that the benefits of the Merger Revaluation Law had been stabilized for Egenor. Estudio Grau reconfirmed its view in the due diligence report it prepared for the sale of the 30 Percent Tranche.\n\n112.\n\nThe auction of the 30 Percent Tranche was governed by *Bases de la Subasta de Egenor S.A.A.* (\"Bidding Rules for the Egenor S.A.A. Auction\"), dated August 17, 1999. According to Section 6.1 of these Bidding Rules, the date and time of the auction would be disclosed at least three working days in advance by notice published in the Bulletin of the Lima Stock Exchange. Following discussions with Duke Energy concerning its strategy for acquiring 90 percent of Egenor, CEPRI-PC agreed to postpone the auction for the 30 Percent Tranche until September 7, 1999. In late August 1999, following further discussions with Duke Energy, CEPRI-PC further postponed the auction until October 7, 1999.\n\n113.\n\nOn September 20, 1999, Miranda & Amado Abogados provided a legal opinion to Duke Energy, in which it was stated that the Merger Revaluation Law was stabilized for Egenor as part of the Egenor LSA.\n\n114.\n\nAt the end of September 1999, COPRI approved the transfer by Dominion of its ownership interest in Egenor to Duke Energy, and announced a base price of US$60 million for the 30 Percent Tranche of Egenor (this being some 15-20% higher than the average price of Egenor\u2019s shares listed on the Lima Stock Exchange).\n\n115.\n\nAs set out earlier, in October 1999, Duke Energy, as the sole bidder, won the auction for the sale of the 30 Percent Tranche. By mid-November 1999, it had also acquired the 60 Percent Tranche through DEI Holdings USA.\n\n116.\n\nWithin weeks of Duke Energy\u2019s acquisition of Egenor, SUNAT submitted its official opinion on the Merger Revaluation Law to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. In its opinion, SUNAT concluded that the Merger Revaluation Law was not part of the stabilized regime under the various outstanding LSAs. The Ministry took no action on the basis of that opinion.\n\n**5. Relevant Developments during Duke\u2019s Management of Egenor**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nIn July 2000, President Fujimori began a controversial third term in office, following allegations that the third term was unconstitutional and the result of electoral rigging. His third term came to an end on November 18, 2000, amidst allegations of corruption.\n\n118.\n\nAn interim Government under Mr. Valentin Paniagua, acting as interim President of the country, was established immediately thereafter. Congress and the new interim Government launched investigations into Mr. Fujimori\u2019s policies, including foreign investments, privatization and LSAs.\n\n119.\n\nIt was in this context that, on November 24, 2000, SUNAT initiated a tax audit of DEI Egenor for tax year 1999 *(i.e.,* the tax compliance of Egenor S.A.A.). Upon being notified, DEI Egenor requested an extension of the term to initiate the audit, which was granted.\n\n120.\n\nOn January 22, 2001, Auditors V\u00edctor Garcia Quesada and Jorge Pinedo Zelaya made the first visit to the company. Two additional auditors were included during the tax inspection stage due to the complexity of the audit. SUNAT expanded the scope of the audit to include tax years 1996, 1997, and 1998 *(i.e.* the tax compliance of Egenor and Egenor S.A.) on May 9, 2001.\n\n121.\n\nSUNAT\u2019s position that the benefits of the MRL were not stabilized by the LSAs, outlined since late 1999, was maintained and ratified on July 2001 by means of Memorandum No. 370-2001-K00000 from the National Legal Department *(Intendencia Nacional Jur\u00eddica)* to the Department of Major Taxpayers, which enclosed an aide memoir from the same Department with the corresponding legal analysis.\n\n122.\n\nOn July 19, 2001, SUNAT assessed Edelnor and Luz del Sur (two other privatized companies in the electricity sector) for tax assessments on the basis that the Merger Revaluation Law was not stabilized under those companies\u2019 respective LSAs.\n\n123.\n\nOn July 28, 2001, Mr. Alejandro Toledo was inaugurated as President. On his first day in office, President Toledo replaced the head of SUNAT, Mr. Luis Alberto Arias, with Ms. Beatriz Merino.\n\n124.\n\nEdelnor filed a local arbitration against the Ministry of Energy and Mines in relation to SUNAT\u2019s tax assessment on August 9, 2001. Luz del Sur filed a local arbitration against the *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Inversiones y Tecnolog\u00edas Extranjeras* (\"CONITE\") - today PROINVERSION - in relation to SUNAT\u2019s tax assessment on September 25, 2001.\n\n125.\n\nOn August 17, 2001, CONITE issued its own official position on the Merger Revaluation Law. Contrary to SUNAT\u2019s position, CONITE took the view that the Merger Revaluation Law was a part of the stabilized tax regime for companies with LSAs.\n\n126.\n\nOn November 7, 2001, the report of a Congressional Commission on the Constitution issued two minority reports, concluding that, regardless of the outcome of the Edelnor and Luz del Sur arbitrations, SUNAT should apply Rule VIII of the Peruvian Tax Code in cases of companies with LSAs. Rule VIII, as amended on September 22, 1996, reads as follows:\n\nWhen applying the tax norms, all interpretation methods admitted by Law may be used.\n\nTo determine the true nature of the taxable act, the National Tax Administration Superintendency (SUNAT) will deal with the business relations, situations and acts that are actually performed, pursued or established by tax debtors.\n\nIn the process of interpretation, no taxes may be created, no sanctions may be established, no exemptions may be granted and no tax provisions may be issued to be applied to entities or situations different from those specified in the law.\n\n127.\n\nThe awards in both the Edelnor local arbitration (issued on November 22, 2001) and the Luz del Sur local arbitration (issued on December 7, 2001) concluded that the Merger Revaluation Law was part of the stabilized tax regime for each company. The same conclusion was reached on April 22, 2002 in a local arbitration commenced by Edegel (another privatized electricity company).\n\n**E. The Tax Assessment and Tax Amnesty**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nOn November 26, 2001, SUNAT assessed a tax liability of approximately US$12.4 million against DEI Egenor for what SUNAT determined were tax underpayments in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, plus just over US$35.9 million in interest and penalties (the **\"Tax Assessment\").**\n\n129.\n\nThe Tax Assessment had two main components. The first component was based on SUNAT\u2019s view, under its interpretation of Rule VIII of the Peruvian Tax Code, that the 1996 merger between Egenor and Power North, resulting in the creation of Egenor S.A., was a sham transaction concluded solely to take improper advantage of tax benefits provided for under the Merger Revaluation Law (the **\"Merger Revaluation Assessment\").** Under its interpretation of Rule VIII, SUNAT determined that it had the authority to disregard the merger on the grounds that it was concluded to circumvent the payment of taxes.\n\n130.\n\nThe second component was based on SUNAT\u2019s view that Egenor should have depreciated the assets that Electroper\u00fa had transferred to it during the privatization process using the special decelerated rate that had been provided to Electroper\u00fa by SUNAT in December 1995, rather than the general statutory rate set forth in the income tax regulations (the **\"Depreciation Assessment\").**\n\n131.\n\nOn December 24, 2001, DEI Egenor applied for tax amnesty in connection with the Merger Revaluation Assessment under reservation of rights to seek compensation for the losses incurred.12 On March 21, 2002, SUNAT accepted DEI Egenor\u2019s amnesty application. The amnesty payment, totalling approximately US$6 million, was made through the relinquishment of various tax loss carry-overs and the use of advance income tax overpayment credits.\n\nSee Exhibit C-116, \"Third Accessory Petition.\"\n\n132.\n\nWith respect to the Depreciation Assessment, DEI Egenor initiated an administrative complaint with SUNAT on December 21, 2001. In September 2002, SUNAT notified DEI Egenor that its complaint had been rejected. SUNAT restated its demand for collection of the Depreciation Assessment, with additional interest and penalties for nonpayment. On September 23, 2002, DEI Egenor appealed SUNAT\u2019s denial of its claim to the Tax Court.\n\n133.\n\nOn December 27, 2002, SUNAT used Rule VIII to assess Barrick Misquichilca, a company that was also continuing to avail itself of the Merger Revaluation Benefits under its LSA. On July 9, 2003, SUNAT reassessed Edelnor, Luz del Sur and Edegel, this time also under Rule VIII.\n\n134.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted earlier, on October 6, 2003, Claimant filed for ICSID arbitration under the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tax Court issued its decision on DEI Egenor\u2019s appeal of SUNAT\u2019s decision on April 23, 2004. The Court found mainly in favour of SUNAT and against DEI Egenor. On July 27, 2004, SUNAT issued a revised tax assessment against DEI Egenor, in accordance with the Tax Court\u2019s decision, for approximately US$27.6 million.\n\n136.\n\nOn August 27, 2004, DEI Egenor applied for amnesty in connection with the Depreciation Assessment stating that, nonetheless, its application was filed \"under protest\" and that it did not imply in any way an acknowledgement by DEI Egenor of the validity of the legal arguments on which SUNAT based its assessment.13 On August 27, 2004, SUNAT accepted DEI Egenor\u2019s amnesty application. On the same date, DEI Egenor paid the amnesty amount, in cash, in the sum of approximately US$15.9 million.\n\nSee Exhibit C-121.\n\n137.\n\nOn September 8, 2004, the Tax Court issued Resolution No. 06686/4/2004, holding that SUNAT exceeded its jurisdiction against Edegel in levying tax assessments based on alleged fraudulent mergers under Rule VIII of the Tax Code.\n\n**III. OVERVIEW OF THE AWARD**\n------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Claimant asserted the following claims against Respondent arising from the Tax Assessment:\n\n1. breach of the guarantee of tax stabilization in the DEI Bermuda LSA;\n\n2. breach of the guarantee of non-discrimination in the DEI Bermuda LSA;\n\n3. breach of the guarantee of free remittance of capital in the DEI Bermuda LSA; and\n\n4. breach of the implied duty of good faith and the Peruvian doctrine of *actos propios.*\n\n139.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, in which the Tribunal stated that \"Claimant is entitled to the guarantees provided by such rules of international law as may be held by the Tribunal to be applicable to the merits of the dispute by virtue of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention\" (at para. 134), Claimant added a fifth claim:\n\n5. breach of the minimum standard under customary international law.\n\n140.\n\nIn Part IV of the present Award, the Tribunal addresses, as preliminary issues, (a) the applicable law, (b) the effect of Duke/DEI Egenor\u2019s decision to take advantage of Peru\u2019s amnesty programme, and (c) the scope of protection provided to Claimant by the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n141.\n\nIn Part V, based on the framework provided in Part IV, the Tribunal addresses the issue of Respondent\u2019s liability for each component of the Tax Assessment. For the Depreciation Assessment, the principal guarantees at issue are tax stabilization and the doctrine of *actos propios* (good faith/estoppel). For the Merger Revaluation Assessment, the principal guarantees at issue are tax stabilization, the doctrine of *actos propios* and the guarantee against discrimination.\n\n142.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal has concluded, by majority, that Respondent is not liable for the Depreciation Assessment under any of the theories advanced by Claimant.14 With respect to the Merger Revaluation Assessment, the Tribunal finds Respondent liable for breach of the guarantee of tax stabilization under the DEI Bermuda LSA. The Tribunal, by majority, also considers the Merger Revaluation Assessment to be a violation of the implied duty of good faith.15 Having concluded that the stabilization guarantee was breached, the Tribunal has found it unnecessary to decide whether the guarantee of non-discrimination was breached by the Merger Revaluation Assessment.\n\nOn this point, Dr. Guido S. Tawil has written a dissenting opinion.\n\nOn this point, Dr. Pedro Nikken has written a dissenting opinion.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision on damages is set out in Part VI, and its decision on costs in Part VII.\n\n**IV. PRELIMINARY ISSUES**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe issue of applicable law was raised during the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings, in the context of the debate over the admissibility of the claims. In that context, the Tribunal decided as follows in its Decision on Jurisdiction (at para. 162):\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal must apply Peruvian law to resolve this dispute. In fact, the question of the applicable law to the merits of this case is somewhat more complicated. The DEI Bermuda LSA contains no specific provision regarding the applicable substantive law. In such circumstances, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to apply \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflicts of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" Furthermore, even if the law of Peru were held to apply to the interpretation of the DEI Bermuda LSA, this Tribunal has the authority and duty to subject Peruvian law to the supervening control of international law.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n145.\n\nIn the merits phase, each party advanced its own interpretation of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and its own views on the significance of the Tribunal\u2019s observations about applicable law in its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s position that the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of the present dispute must ultimately be based on the \"supervening control\" of international law.\n\n147.\n\nDuring his opening statement at the merits hearing, Claimant\u2019s counsel explained that international law should play a \"triple role\" in this dispute: (1) superseding Peruvian law where the two systems of law are inconsistent; (2) filling gaps in Peruvian law; and (3) establishing certain independent and autonomous rights for Claimant, notably the right to a minimum standard of treatment under customary international law and general principles of law.\n\n148.\n\nWith respect to points (1) and (2), relating to the role of international law where inconsistencies or gaps may exist, Claimant has identified at least three areas in which, in its submission, international principles may well conflict with the local norms of Peruvian law: (i) unity of the State vs. separate existence and authority of State agencies; (ii) effect of amnesty; and (iii) the application of the concept of estoppel to the Government. In each case, Claimant submits, it is international law that should take priority over any inconsistent principles of local law.\n\n149.\n\nFinally, with respect to point (3), Claimant submits that Respondent\u2019s breaches are also actionable under independent and autonomous guarantees of international law, which are imported via Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n150.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention gives the law of the host State primacy in the absence of an agreement on governing law.\n\n151.\n\nInasmuch as the DEI Bermuda LSA does not have a choice of law clause, Respondent submits that, in accordance with Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the law of the host State, i.e., Peru, applies in the first instance.\n\n152.\n\nRespondent has referred the Tribunal to other ICSID tribunals that have considered contracts without a choice of law clause and that have found them to be governed by domestic law, without any need to refer to international law. See *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI) v. Senegal,* ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, Award, February 25, 1988, 6 ICSID Rev. - FILJ 125, 159-64 (1991)\u00a0(Broches, President) (applying Senegalese law); *S.A.R.L. Benvenuti and Bonfant v. People's Republic of the Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2, Award, August 8, 1980, 1 ICSID Reports 330, 349 (1993)\u00a0(applying Congolese law).\n\n153.\n\nRespondent notes, as was confirmed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction, that, under Peruvian law, LSAs are treated as private contracts and, thus, are subject to relevant Peruvian Civil Code provisions. Thus, the negotiation, execution, interpretation, and enforcement of the LSA are all governed by Peruvian civil law.\n\n154.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a tribunal should refer to international law under Article 42(1) in these circumstances only if (i) a gap in the law of the host State prevents resolution of the dispute *(i.e.,* \"the conduct at issue is not covered by Peruvian law\"); or (ii) the resolution reached by applying the law of the host State is inconsistent with international law.\n\n155.\n\nRespondent submits that, in this case, Claimant has failed to demonstrate that either a lacuna exists in the applicable Peruvian law or that Peruvian law is inconsistent with or does not conform to international law.\n\n156.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that the Tribunal\u2019s finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction does not accord Claimant an open-ended expansive entitlement to submit claims based on any and all protections that may be attributed to the sources of international law set out in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, namely treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe issue of applicable law raises two distinct issues for the Tribunal.\n\n158.\n\nFirst, are there any gaps in Peruvian law, or inconsistencies between Peruvian law and international law? To the extent that there are, Respondent does not dispute that international law should take priority. Respondent does, however, take issue with the premise of the existence of gaps or inconsistencies.\n\n159.\n\nSecond, does Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention entitle Claimant, in the circumstances of this dispute, to bring independent and autonomous claims based on recognized sources of international law, namely customary international law and general principles of law?\n\n160.\n\nOn the first issue, and as explained in greater detail below, the Tribunal finds that there is no inconsistency between local law and international law in respect of the effect the Tribunal should give to the amnesty that was granted to Egenor for both components of the Tax Assessment (see Section IV.B). On the other hand, the Tribunal finds that principles of international law must be given effect in determining the extent to which the division of the State into separate entities and agencies can insulate the State from liability for certain actions and representations (i.e., the analysis of good faith and the doctrine of *actos propios)* (see Section IV.C.2).\n\n161.\n\nOn the second issue, the Tribunal first notes that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not provide an *a priori* hierarchy or preference as between national and international law. However, as explained in greater detail below, the Tribunal has considered the independent international-law principles that Claimant has suggested should be implied from the LSA (namely good faith, and fair and equitable treatment), and has determined that they are redundant in light of the protections provided to Claimant under the DEI Bermuda LSA and Peruvian law. Therefore, inasmuch as those principles are contained in both the DEI Bermuda LSA and Peruvian Law, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to enter into a separate analysis of Claimant\u2019s claim on these grounds.\n\n**B. Effect of Amnesty**\n------------------------\n\n162.\n\nDEI Egenor voluntarily availed itself of Peru\u2019s Tax Amnesty Law, *Sistema Especial de Actualizaci\u00f3n y Pago de Deudas Tributarias* **(\"SEAP\")** under reservation of its rights. In the case of the Merger Revaluation Assessment, DEI Egenor applied for amnesty immediately after having been assessed by SUNAT. In the case of the Depreciation Assessment, DEI Egenor applied for amnesty only after it lost its challenge to SUNAT\u2019s assessment before the Tax Court.\n\n163.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional phase, Respondent argued that Claimant\u2019s claims arising from the Tax Assessment were inadmissible because the matters had already been settled in accordance with the Amnesty Law. In the Decision on Jurisdiction (at para. 164), the Tribunal dismissed the admissibility objection and ruled that it would consider the effect of the amnesty during the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Contentions**\n---------------------------\n\n**a) Scope of Renunciation**\n----------------------------\n\n164.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a taxpayer\u2019s request to receive the benefits of the Tax Amnesty Law entails the recognition and acceptance of the tax obligations specified in the request, since payment made in accordance with the Tax Amnesty Law constitutes renunciation of any ongoing or future challenge of the tax obligation in question, whether through administrative or judicial proceedings.\n\n165.\n\nRelying on Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez, one of its experts, Respondent submits that when a taxpayer renounces its right to challenge a tax debt by applying for amnesty, this renunciation applies not only to proceedings before domestic tribunals but to proceedings in any jurisdiction whatsoever, provided that the taxpayer had the option to adhere to the SEAP. Therefore, according to Respondent, DEI Egenor\u2019s reliance on the Tax Amnesty Law constitutes DEI Egenor\u2019s categorical renunciation of any ongoing or future challenge of the tax obligation at issue in any forum, including international arbitration under an LSA.\n\n166.\n\nIn response, Claimant submits that the only effect of DEI Egenor\u2019s acceptance of amnesty was the waiver of its right to challenge the amnesty payments through the procedural mechanisms available under Peruvian tax law. In fact, as Prof. Jorge Avenda\u00f1o, one of Claimant\u2019s experts, points out, SEAP does not even mandate that a taxpayer accept SUNAT\u2019s underlying reasons for imposing its assessment when availing itself of amnesty. Rather, the taxpayer merely has to: (a) acknowledge that it is paying a debt, whether validly established or not; and (b) renounce its ability to challenge that debt under tax law procedures.\n\n167.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s argument that DEI Egenor\u2019s renunciation of rights should be viewed as broadly as precluding DEI Bermuda\u2019s ICSID arbitration claims conflicts with the assertion of Respondent\u2019s other expert, Prof. Alfredo Bullard, that \"special system[s]... for tax matters... should be [interpreted] restrictive[ly].\" Professor Bullard\u2019s view regarding the restrictive application of tax laws is consistent with that expressed by Claimant\u2019s expert, Professor Avenda\u00f1o.\n\n**b) Effect on DEI Bermuda**\n----------------------------\n\n168.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez, \"once EGENOR accepts amnesty under SEAP, its parent company [DEI Bermuda] may not file a complaint relative to the debt subject to the amnesty.\" Respondent submits that, contrary to the position Claimant took in the jurisdictional phase, Claimant is now seeking improperly to take advantage of a corporate shell game to avoid the effects of the amnesty.\n\n169.\n\nIn response, Claimant argues that Respondent\u2019s accusation that Claimant is \"attempting to \u2018hide behind corporate forms to evade\u2019 the legal consequence of DEI Egenor availing itself of the Tax Amnesty Law\" is nothing more than a \"straw man\" argument.\n\n170.\n\nAccording to Claimant, DEI Egenor\u2019s amnesty payments had no effect whatsoever on *either* DEI Egenor\u2019s rights under the Egenor LSA or DEI Bermuda\u2019s rights under the DEI Bermuda LSA. Because Claimant has never taken the position that DEI Bermuda\u2019s LSA rights persist despite relinquishment of DEI Egenor\u2019s LSA rights, Respondent\u2019s position that Claimant is \"hiding behind corporate formalities\" is based on an entirely false premise.\n\n**c) Reservation of Rights**\n----------------------------\n\n171.\n\nRespondent submits that the reservation of rights that DEI Egenor included in its application for amnesty is ineffective under Peruvian law.\n\n172.\n\nClaimant responds that DEI Bermuda is not arguing that it retained the right to assert its claims in this arbitration only because DEI Egenor reserved its rights when applying for SEAP. Rather, Claimant\u2019s position is that the limited waiver of DEI Egenor\u2019s procedural rights under SEAP\u2019s own terms had absolutely no effect on the civil and international law relationships established by the Egenor and DEI Bermuda LSAs. The purpose of the reservation of rights was simply to clarify, beyond doubt, above and beyond what Peruvian law already provided, that DEI Egenor and DEI Bermuda were continuing to evaluate all other avenues for redress apart from the Peruvian tax law dispute resolution mechanisms foreseen in the SEAP itself.\n\n173.\n\nClaimant adds that DEI Bermuda cannot be equitably estopped from bringing the claims in this arbitration because the Government did not rely, and would not have been justified in relying, upon DEI Egenor\u2019s SEAP payments in light of the reservation of rights that Claimant included with its amnesty applications.\n\n**d) Mitigation of Damages**\n----------------------------\n\n174.\n\nClaimant argues that DEI Egenor sought amnesty in order to mitigate damages, because otherwise penalties and interest on the Tax Assessment would have continued to accrue.\n\n175.\n\nRespondent submits that a claimant is not required to take action to mitigate where domestic law does not permit such action or where such action would foreclose claimant\u2019s other means of redress. Thus, in the present case, international law would not require Claimant to avail itself of the Tax Amnesty Law, given that the benefit of that law *(i.e.,* the damages to be mitigated) is expressly conditioned on Claimant\u2019s renunciation of any challenge to the tax debt in any proceeding and in any jurisdiction.\n\n176.\n\nFurther, Respondent submits that, under Peruvian law, Claimant had an alternative means of mitigating damages that would not have required Claimant to relinquish its right to challenge SUNAT\u2019s assessment. As Dr. Luna-Victoria explained in his expert report, a taxpayer in Peru may invoke the \"payment under protest\" procedure. This procedure\u2014 and only this procedure\u2014permits a taxpayer to pay an assessment, without acknowledging the obligation, and to challenge that assessment through administrative or judicial proceedings. In addition, making payment under protest has the effect of mitigating damages by halting the accrual of interest on the underlying assessment.\n\n177.\n\nClaimant answers that Respondent\u2019s argument presupposes as its underlying premise that mitigation of damages by virtue of DEI Egenor\u2019s SEAP payments did in fact foreclose DEI Bermuda\u2019s claims in this arbitration under the DEI Bermuda LSA, which Claimant denies.\n\n178.\n\nAs a result, says Claimant, Respondent\u2019s reference to other possible means of mitigation, such as a \"payment under protest,\" are of little relevance in this arbitration. According to Claimant, DEI Egenor\u2019s mitigation of damages, through payment under the amnesty programme, was clearly the most efficient and effective way of \"stopping the bleeding\" in this case, while at the same time preserving all of DEI Bermuda\u2019s rights to initiate arbitration for all its claims under its LSA *(see* Navigant Second Expert Report at paras. 64-68, calculating the amount that would have been required to pay under protest. Had the Claimant paid under protest the damages \"would be approximately US$43.1 million higher than the US$37.5 million presently claimed.\").\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the LSA rights of both DEI Egenor and of DEI Bermuda are separate and distinct from the rights to which the SEAP renunciation applies, quite apart from the fact that DEI Egenor may have reserved certain rights in its amnesty applications.16 In order to benefit from the Tax Amnesty Law, the taxpayer must desist from challenges before \"administrative or judicial authorities.\"17 Under each LSA, it was agreed that disputes over the scope of protection provided by the LSA would be referred to arbitration (national or international arbitration, in the case of the Egenor LSA, and ICSID arbitration, in the case of the DEI Bermuda LSA) and not to administrative or judicial authorities.18\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, strictly speaking, there was no \"reservation of rights\" in the amnesty applications. DEI Egenor simply paid and underlined in its application that the payment \"[did] not imply in any way an acknowledgement by DEI Egenor of the validity of the legal arguments on which SUNAT based the Resolutions\" (Exhibit C-121).\n\nLegislative Decree No. 914, Article 9.3 (Exhibit C-144).\n\nIn his Second Expert Report, Professor de Trazegnies comments on the situation where claims under an LSA are submitted exclusively to arbitration. He notes that \"the Tax Court has made it clear that, in these situations, there is a tax proceeding and an arbitration proceeding, and it has indicated that these two proceedings have their respective functions, and must not be confused.\" (Report dated February 22, 2005 at paragraph 11.) He cites as authority for this proposition the Edelgel case (Tax Court Resolution No. 06619-4-2002), the Edelnor case (Tax Court Resolution No. 06604-5-2002) and the Luz del Sur case (Tax Court Resolution No. 06628-1-2002). *(Ibid,* at paragraphs 12-18.) In this case, he writes, \"DEI Bermuda has not attempted to challenge the SUNAT\u2019s assessment resolutions, nor does it wish to invalidate the Tax Court\u2019s resolutions.\" *(Ibid,* at paragraph 5.)\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, since neither administrative nor judicial authorities in Peru had jurisdiction to hear claims or challenges based on the LSAs, renunciation of all challenges to the tax obligation through \"administrative or judicial authorities\", as provided under the Tax Amnesty Law, could not have resulted in the waiver of the rights of DEI Egenor or DEI Bermuda under the respective LSAs.\n\n181.\n\nIn addition, the DEI Bermuda LSA contains no specific provision regarding the applicable substantive law. In such circumstances, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to apply \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflicts of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n182.\n\nConsequently, even if payment under the Tax Amnesty Law did, as a matter of Peruvian law, result in the renunciation of rights under the LSAs (which in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion it did not do), Peruvian law (\"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute\"), and in particular the Tax Amnesty Law, would be inconsistent with applicable principles of international law. One such principle is that waiver of ICSID rights must be explicit *(see* Professor Dolzer Second Expert Report at paras. 28-29). As discussed in the previous Section, Respondent does not dispute that, in the case of such conflict, it is international law that must prevail over the local law.\n\n183.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal also relies, subsidiarily, on the principle, supported by Respondent\u2019s own expert, Prof. Alfredo Bullard, that \"special system[s]... for tax matters... should be [interpreted] rectrictive[ly].\" This principle should apply to the interpretation of DEI Egenor\u2019s waiver of its rights to challenge the Assessments.\n\n**C. Scope of Protection Provided by DEI Bermuda LSA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nClaimant\u2019s case on liability must, as the Tribunal ruled in its Decision on Jurisdiction, be grounded in the DEI Bermuda LSA. The relevant paragraphs of its Decision on Jurisdiction are set out below:\n\n131. The Tribunal has no hesitation in applying the unity-of-the-investment principle to refute Respondent\u2019s argument that the narrow description of the transaction in Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA necessarily determines the scope of the \"investment\" for purposes of the DEI Bermuda LSA. The reality of the overall investment, which is clear from the record, overcomes Respondent\u2019s objection that it could never have consented to arbitration of a dispute related to the broader investment by Duke Energy in DEI Egenor.\n\n132. However, the Tribunal also acknowledges the corollary finding in the CSOB case, namely that Claimant will need to substantiate its claims, during the merits phase, by reference solely to the guarantees contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA. and not those contained in any of the other LSAs. This is a function of the specific wording of Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA. and of the legal basis of Claimant\u2019s claims as formulated in the Request for Arbitration, namely the alleged breach of the protections contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, not in any of the other LSAs.\n\n133. While the Tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over the other LSAs will not prevent it from taking them into consideration for the purposes of the interpretation and application of the DEI Bermuda LSA (indeed, that is \"perfectly possible, normal and called for\"), it will not be in a position to \"give effect\" to the protections in those LSAs. In other words, in the peculiar circumstances of this case (successive agreements *for the protection* of the investment), the unity of the investment does not necessarily imply the unity of the protection of the investment.\n\n134. Finally, by focusing on the guarantees included in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and excluding the application of the guarantees included in the other LSAs, the Tribunal is not limiting Claimant strictly to the text of the DEI Bermuda LSA. First, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees that are implied in the DEI Bermuda LSA by Peruvian law. Second, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees provided by such rules of international law as may be held by the Tribunal to be applicable to the merits of the dispute by virtue of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n185.\n\nIn this Section, before addressing Respondent\u2019s liability under each component of the Tax Assessment, the Tribunal will examine the scope of the protections included or implied in the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**1. Tax Stabilization**\n------------------------\n\n**a) Relevant Provisions of the DEI Bermuda LSA**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nTax Stabilization is guaranteed in Clause Three, Section 1 of the DEI Bermuda LSA, which reads as follows:\n\nTHREE - By virtue of this Agreement, the STATE, and as long as it remains in effect, in connection with the investment referred in CLAUSE TWO, the STATE guarantees legal stability for DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL, according to the following terms:\n\n1. Stability of the tax regime with respect to the Income Tax, as stipulated in subsection a) of Article 10\u00b0 of Legislative Decree No. 662, in effect at the time this Agreement was executed, according to which dividends and any other form of distribution of profits, are not taxed, in accordance with the stipulations of subsection a) of article 25 of the Amendment Text of the Income Tax Law, approved by the Supreme Decree No. 054-99-EF in effect at the time this Agreement was executed. Neither the remittances sent abroad of amounts corresponding to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL for any of the items contemplated in this subsection are taxed pursuant to the aforementioned law.\n\n187.\n\nClause Five of the DEI Bermuda LSA provides as follows:\n\nThis Legal Stability Agreement shall have an effective term of ten (10) years as from the date of its execution. As a consequence, it may not be amended unilaterally by any of the parties during this period, even in the event that Peruvian law is amended, or if the amendments are more beneficial or detrimental to any of the parties than those set forth in this Agreement.\n\n[...]\n\n**b) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**i) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n188.\n\nIn addition to the relevant provisions of the DEI Bermuda LSA, Claimant relies on the particular language of several other legal instruments.\n\n189.\n\nFirstly, Claimant relies on Article 10(a) of the Foreign Investment Law, cited in the DEI Bermuda LSA, which provides as follows:\n\n**Article 10.** The National Competent Authority, on behalf of the State, prior to making the investment and the appropriate registration, may enter into agreements with foreign investors in order to guarantee the following rights:\n\na. Stability of the tax regime in force on the date of execution of the agreement.\n\nBy virtue of the guaranteed stability of the tax regime, the foreign investor shall not be subject to a rate higher than the one established in the appropriate agreement for the purposes of the income tax payable by the company receiving the investment, and the tax assessing the profits attributed thereto and/or the dividends distributed in favor thereof; therefore, if the income tax payable by the company is increased, the rate applied to the foreign investor shall be reduced by the required amount so that the company\u2019s profits freely available thereto are at least equal to the guaranteed profits.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n190.\n\nClaimant also relies on Article 23 of the Investment Regulations, which is cited below, in relevant part:\n\nArticle 23.- The stability of the tax regime implies the following:\n\na) For investors : It guaranties [sic] that while the stability agreement is in force, the income tax which results in a greater tax burden than the one effective as from the date of execution of the agreement will not be imposed on the amounts they are entitled to, in such a manner that they will be entitled to receive effectively such amounts in the same proportion for the following concepts:\n\na. 1. The dividends agreed upon in their favor;\n\na.2. The profits they are entitled to;\n\na.3. The profits available thereto; or\n\na.4. The remittance of sums pertaining thereto for any of the concepts regulated in the various items of this section.\n\nThe stability system granted to investors as provided for by section a of Article 10\u00b0 of Legislative Decree N\u00b0 662 implies that in case the income tax were amended during the effective term of the Stability Agreement results in a variation of the tax base or the aliquots imposed on the profit generating company, or new taxes were created and imposed on the company's income, or in the percentage reduction of the investor's available profit or dividends with regard to the profit before income as compared to the one subject to allocation or available at the time of setting the guarantied tax system due to any other cause with equivalent effects, under the stability granted by the agreement, the tax aliquot (s) with regard to the profits or dividends the investor is entitled to will be reduced in order to allow that the profits or dividends finally available or subject to allocation are equal to the ones guarantied [sic] up to the possible limit as to the tax imposed on profits or dividends.\n\nb) For investment-receiving companies included in sections a and b of Article 17\u00b0 hereof: it is hereby guaranteed that while the Stability Agreement is effective, the income tax applicable thereto will not be modified. The same terms, as well as the same aliquots [portions], deductions and scales for the calculation of the taxable income as the one effective at the time of the agreement\u2019s execution will be applicable.\n\nThe tax stability system granted to companies under the provisions of Article 40\u00b0 of Legislative Decree N\u00b0 757 implies that in case the income tax were modified during the term of the Stability Agreement, such modifications will not affect the investment-receiving companies which tax stability is protected by the appropriate agreement whether the aliquots increase or decrease or the taxable base is modified by being extended or reduced, or by any other cause with equivalent effects.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n191.\n\nClaimant refers to the above provisions (among others) as the \"Tax Stabilization Regime\" that applies to foreign investments in Peru. Claimant submits that the Tax Stabilization Regime assures the foreign investor that neither the dividends agreed in its favour, nor the profits generated by the local company for its disposal, will be altered either by reason of modification of the tax system or the manner in which that tax system is applied.\n\n192.\n\nAs for the particular Tax Stabilization Regime that applied to DEI Bermuda\u2019s investments in Peru, Claimant submits that pursuant to the terms of the Egenor LSA, the DEI Bermuda LSA and the Tax Stabilization Regime, Duke Energy was essentially the beneficiary of the tax regime originally granted to Dominion by the Government of Peru. This tax regime included the laws and regulations stabilized *at the time the Egenor LSA was executed in 1996.* At that time, the Merger Revaluation Law was effective, and thus became stabilized for Egenor (which later became DEI Egenor). The same is true, according to Claimant, regarding the depreciation rate that was applied by Egenor following the privatization of the 60 Percent Tranche, namely the general statutory rate.\n\n193.\n\nThus, according to Claimant, by virtue of the interlinked nature of the LSAs as set forth in the Foreign Investment Law and the Investment Regulations, Duke Energy was effectively the beneficiary of (a) an exemption of the tax on dividends, and (b) a stabilized tax regime on profits generated by DEI Egenor and made available to DEI Bermuda, which included the general statutory depreciation rate and the Merger Revaluation Benefits.\n\n194.\n\nIn order to link the DEI Bermuda LSA and the Egenor LSA, but remain within the confines established by the Tribunal in paras. 132 and 133 of its Decision on Jurisdiction (cited earlier), Claimant has relied in particular on Article 23 of the Investment Regulations. Its argument was set out succinctly in its Memorial (at para. 155):\n\nBroken down into its constituent parts, Article 23(a) confirms that: (i) if, in fact, the tax regime that is applied to DEI Egenor (ii) during the effective term of the DEI Bermuda LSA (iii) is different from the tax regime that was stabilized for DEI Egenor under the DEI Egenor LSA, then (iv) reparation for such variation of the tax regime will be made to DEI Bermuda (v) under the DEI Bermuda LSA. In essence, therefore, whereas Article 23(b) confirms that the income tax regime for DEI Egenor will be frozen for the next ten years, Article 23(a) establishes that it is DEI Bermuda that may claim for damages caused by the State\u2019s breach of that tax regime. More specifically, Article 23(a) provides that: (i) the DEI Bermuda LSA guarantees DEI Bermuda that (ii) the profits available or dividends distributable to it (iii) will *equal* the amount resulting from the application of the stabilized tax regime to DEI Egenor\u2019s taxable earnings (iv) in effect during the effective term of the DEI Bermuda and DEI Egenor LSAs. In other words, DEI Bermuda is accorded the right to claim back from the Government the difference between the amount it expected to receive under its stabilized regime and the amount it actually received (or could receive) as a result of the Government\u2019s breach of that regime.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, according to Claimant, modification by Peru of the tax law itself was not the only manner in which the Tax Stabilization Regime could be breached. The specifics of this argument by Claimant have evolved over the course of the proceedings.\n\n196.\n\nClaimant first argued, in its Memorial (at para. 169), that Respondent would impermissibly modify the regime that had been stabilized for DEI Bermuda by \"(a) *applying* existing laws or regulations in a manner *wholly inconsistent* with previous applications of those law (sic) or regulations; or (b) *applying* an existing law *illegitimately.\"* (Emphasis in original.) In support of Claimant\u2019s case, Professor de Trazegnies submitted in his Second Expert Report (at para. 54) that \"legal stability can be thwarted if, without making changes to the text of the law itself, it is interpreted in a way that is radically different from the way it was understood and applied before.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n197.\n\nIn its Reply (at paras. 220-23), Claimant modified the emphasis of its argument on this point, and averred that the conduct which could constitute a breach of the guarantee of tax stabilization included \"any changes to the interpretation or application\" of existing tax laws and regulations. (Emphasis added.) Similarly, in its Post-hearing Brief, in response to one of the questions posed by the Tribunal, Claimant submitted that \"any change by the State in the application (interpretation) of the tax regime stabilized for an investor or the investment-receiving company that results in a greater tax burden than the one in effect at the time of the execution of the LSA constitutes a breach of the LSA and therefore becomes actionable.\"\n\n**ii) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nRespondent submits that Peru complied fully with its tax stabilization promise to Claimant under Clause Three, Paragraph 1, of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n199.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant - DEI Bermuda - can only invoke the guarantees under its own LSA, and therefore Claimant\u2019s attempt to fuse the DEI Bermuda LSA and the Egenor LSA (by way of Article 23 of the Investment Regulations or otherwise) is impermissible. Respondent submits that Claimant\u2019s interpretation cannot succeed because it fails to give the segmentation of LSAs any meaning.\n\n200.\n\nFurthermore, according to Respondent, LSAs stabilize tax legislation, but not a specific interpretation or application of that legislation. Respondent argues that under an LSA (including the DEI Bermuda LSA), the tax authorities are not bound to a specific application or interpretation of the tax legislation, but rather can interpret and apply the legislation freely, provided that they do so within the bounds of law and reason. Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to meet its own standard, articulated initially in its Memorial, to demonstrate that Peru\u2019s application or interpretation of the tax laws or regulations was \"wholly inconsistent,\" \"illegitimate,\" or \"radically different\" compared to the prior application or interpretation.\n\n**c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**i) Interpretation of Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe parties agree that the linkage between the Egenor LSA and the DEI Bermuda LSA is provided by Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations. They disagree, however, on the effect of its \"offset\" provision in those cases where, as in the case for DEI Bermuda, the withholding tax rate on dividends happens to be zero percent for the investor. According to Respondent, the result is that DEI Bermuda has no claim under its LSA if the tax stability of Egenor is affected, because there is nothing against which to offset. Claimant replies that where there is a right, there must be a remedy, and that Peru must accordingly compensate Claimant with the payment of damages.\n\n202.\n\nThe offset provision in Article 23(a) is the mechanism by which the investor's interests are met by avoiding a decrease in its revenues as a result of tax increases imposed on the recipient company, while the State's interest is met by ensuring that LSAs do not \"subtract resources from the National Treasury\",19 as stated in the Preamble to the Regulation.\n\n*\"...no resta recursos a la Caja Fiscal\".*\n\n203.\n\nThis mechanism is therefore used to balance increased taxes on the recipient company against lowered taxes on the dividends of the investor in order to \"allow the profits and dividends finally available or subject to allocation [to be] equal to the ones that were guarantied, up to the possible limit [of] the tax imposed on profits and dividends.\" (Claimant\u2019s translation; emphasis added).\n\n204.\n\nThe wording of Article 23(a), at first blush, appears to favour Respondent\u2019s line of argument. According to the express terms of Article 23(a), where, as in the present case, the investor\u2019s dividends are not taxed at all, it would appear that the \"possible limit\" of the offset available to cure increases in the tax burden on the recipient company is zero.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine, however, whether the literal meaning of Article 23(a) is a sufficient basis on which to establish a limitation of liability in cases where Respondent has violated the DEI Bermuda LSA by impermissibly modifying the tax regime stabilized for Egenor. The Tribunal considers that the case against the express language limitation was made compellingly by two of Claimant\u2019s experts on Peruvian law, Professor de Trazegnies and Professor Talledo.\n\n206.\n\nAt the hearing, Professor de Trazegnies opined that the express limitation should not be given effect by the Tribunal because: (i) Article 1322 of the Civil Code provides that whoever breaches an obligation must pay damages; and (ii) giving effect to the limitation would undermine the very purpose of the LSA, which is to protect the investor against modifications to the tax regime *(see* Hearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, pp. 1148:13-1151:22).\n\n207.\n\nFor his part, Professor Talledo opined that the offset mechanism described in Article 23(a) was merely the \"compensation mechanism\" provided for in the stability regime (Hearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, at p. 1205:4-5). He submitted that since, in the case where the tax on dividends is already zero, such compensation mechanism \"... is not operative, it is only logical to understand, in keeping with the purposes of the agreement, that [assuming] that same allegation *[i.e.,* a zero-rated tax on dividends] - then the State should indemnify the investor for the reduction in the amount of profit to be distributed and which results from the increase in the tax burden.\" (Hearing Transcript May 14, 2007, at p. 1205:3-10).\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the view that Article 23(a) operates as a particular means of compensation. In the case where it cannot actually be applied, the investor should still be able to resort to the subsidiary means of compensation - payment of damages - available under Peruvian law. In this regard, Article 1321 of the Peruvian Civil Code sets forth that the party who does not comply with its obligations must pay damages.20 This provision is mirrored by Article 1428 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which provides that upon a party\u2019s failure to comply with a bilateral agreement, the other party can request payment of damages.21\n\nArticle 1321: *\"Queda sujeto a la indemnizaci\u00f3n de da\u00f1os y perjuicios quien no ejecuta sus obligaciones por dolo, culpa inexcusable o culpa leve. El resarcimiento por la inejecuci\u00f3n de la obligaci\u00f3n por su cumplimiento parcial, tard\u00edo o defectuoso, comprende tanto el da\u00f1o emergente como el lucro cesante, en cuanto sean consecuencia inmediata y directa de tal inejecuci\u00f3n. Si la inejecuci\u00f3n o el cumplimiento parcial, tard\u00edo o defectuoso de la obligaci\u00f3n, obedecieran a culpa leve, el resarcimiento se limita al da\u00f1o que pod\u00eda preverse al tiempo en que ella fue contra\u00edda\".*\n\nArticle 1428: *\"En los contratos con prestaciones rec\u00edprocas, cuando alguna de las partes falta al cumplimiento de su prestaci\u00f3n, la otra parte puede solicitar el cumplimiento o la resoluci\u00f3n del contrato y, en uno u otro caso, la indemnizaci\u00f3n de da\u00f1os y perjuicios. A partir de la fecha de la citaci\u00f3n con la demanda de resoluci\u00f3n, la parte demandada queda impedida de cumplir su prestaci\u00f3n\".*\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal, having considered all of the evidence and the applicable legal principles, concludes, notwithstanding the limitation wording in Article 23(a), that Claimant has a claim, under the DEI Bermuda LSA, if the tax stabilization guaranteed to Egenor (later DEI Egenor) in the Egenor LSA in 1996 was violated after July 24, 2001, the date on which the DEI Bermuda LSA came into force.\n\n**ii) The Meaning of Tax Stabilization under the LSAs**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nLegal stability, as set out in the Preamble to the Foreign Investment Law, guarantees foreign investors the \"continuity of the existing rules.\"22 The Tribunal must now determine whether legal stability covers not only the formal text of the laws and regulations that were in place at the time the Egenor LSA was executed, but also their specific interpretation and application at that time.\n\nForeign Investment Law - Preamble (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-8)\n\n211.\n\nArticle 23, on which Claimant has relied in order to demonstrate the linkage between the Egenor LSA and the DEI Bermuda LSA, says, in terms, that the income tax may not be \"amended\" nor \"modified\" while the LSA is effective.\n\n212.\n\nSimilarly, the Preamble to the Investment Regulations provides that LSAs \"only guarantee the investors and enterprises in which they participate, that the laws in force at the time of their subscription will not be modified, for a certain period...\" [emphasis added]\n\n213.\n\nIn the same vein, Article 24 of the Investment Regulations provides as follows:\n\nArticle 24. Pursuant to the provisions of the regulations referred to in Article 1\u00b0 of this Supreme Decree, legal stability agreements exceptionally granted stability to the legal system in force at the time of execution of the agreement, and as long as such is in effect, on matters to which the stability is granted.\n\nThe stability referred to in the foregoing paragraph implies that will continue to be applied the same legislation in force at the time of the agreement\u2019s execution, without being affected by the amendments thereto on the matters and during the term foreseen in such agreements, including the derogation of legal rules, even in the case of more or less favourable provisions.\n\n214.\n\nClaimant argues that a guarantee of tax stability that protects the investor strictly only against amendments or modifications to legislation and regulations would weaken the ambit of the guarantee which, as the evidence demonstrated, the parties intended to include in the LSA. The Tribunal will inquire as to what additional changes to the tax regime, if any, are covered by the guarantee of stabilization in addition to amendment or modification of Peruvian laws or regulations.\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis of this difficult question with the principle that its jurisdiction does not include the power to review the correctness of SUNAT\u2019s decisions and assessments or of the Tax Court\u2019s decisions as a matter of Peruvian tax law. As the Tribunal ruled in its Decision on Jurisdiction, it does not sit as the appellate division of the Tax Court.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, under this particular guarantee, is limited to determining whether the relevant decisions or interpretations of SUNAT and/or the Tax Court, be they right or wrong, are consistent with the tax regime stabilized for Claimant in the DEI Bermuda LSA. The Tribunal\u2019s standard is therefore comparative in nature, rather than absolute. In other words, the Tribunal does not opine on the correctness of the relevant decision or interpretation, but only determines whether such decision of SUNAT or of the Tax Court in the present case represents a change from their respective decisions prior to the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n217.\n\nThis comparative exercise is reasonably straightforward for legislation and regulations, where a change is objectively demonstrable. Claimant establishes an actionable change by proving (i) the existence of a pre-existing law or regulation (or absence thereof) at the time the tax stability guarantee was granted, and (ii) a law or regulation passed or issued after the LSA that changed the pre-existing regime.\n\n218.\n\nThe exercise is considerably more difficult where the Tribunal must analyze changes in the interpretation or application of a law or regulatory instrument, which could give rise to a finding of breach of the stability guaranteed by the Respondent. The Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant in this instance must prove (i) a *stable* interpretation or application at the time the tax stability guarantee was granted, and (ii) a decision or assessment after the LSA that modified that stable interpretation or application.\n\n219.\n\nThus, if, at the time when the guarantee was granted, the application of the existing rules resulted in a consistent interpretation, such interpretation must be deemed to be incorporated into the guaranteed stability. In a broad sense, stability is the standard by which the legal order prevailing on the date on which the guarantee is granted is perpetuated, including the consistent and stable interpretation in force at the time the LSA is concluded. The Tribunal is convinced that the maintenance of such stable interpretations of the law, existing at the time the LSA was executed, is part of \"the continuity of the existing rules.\"\n\n220.\n\nThe issue for Claimant is one of proof. Adducing proof of laws and regulations in force on a given date is not a significant problem. What is required, however, to prove to the satisfaction of the Tribunal the prevalence of a particular, consistent and stable interpretation? In brief, the Tribunal requires compelling evidence. Clear case law and/or well-established practice constitute persuasive evidence on the issue of consistent meaning, as does generally accepted legal doctrine. The opinion of lawyers retained by a party does not.\n\n221.\n\nFurthermore, the statements or actions of a State agency that merely *imply* a specific interpretation or application of the law do not, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, provide a sufficiently sound basis upon which to conclude that a stable interpretation of the law existed. That is not to say, however, that such statements or actions could not provide a sufficient basis to engage the State\u2019s liability under the theory of estoppel *(la doctrina de los actos propios).* This is a different issue, involving an inquiry into whether such statements or actions were sufficient to lead the investor to the reasonable conclusion that such an implied interpretation or application of the law would not be modified in the future. The Tribunal will address the concept of estoppel in the next Section of this Award.\n\n222.\n\nDoes the absence of proof of a change in legislation or regulations, or of a stable interpretation or application, put an end to the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry in respect of the guarantee of tax stabilization? No. This is particularly important where, as in this case, there was arguably insufficient time for the development of stable interpretations or applications of the relevant law and regulations, many of which were introduced as part of the overall privatization and liberalization programme at the beginning of the 1990s.\n\n223.\n\nIn such a case, the Tribunal may depart from a strictly comparative analysis, and of a strict adherence to the requirement that Claimant establish a stable pre-existing interpretation or application. Even here, however, the Tribunal\u2019s departure must be measured, and the Tribunal must avoid seeking to establish the \"correct\" interpretation or application of the relevant law or regulation. Rather, the Tribunal, in the absence of a stable pre-existing interpretation against which it can judge subsequent developments, can only evaluate the decision or assessment that is impugned by Claimant against a reasonableness standard.\n\n224.\n\nIn such a situation, by definition, there is no objective standard against which to compare the actions of SUNAT or the Tax Court, since the law has not been amended, and there is no stable interpretation that has not been taken into account. The sole standard is Peruvian law itself, with respect to which the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited.\n\n225.\n\nThe Peruvian courts are the appropriate forum in which to make a claim in relation to incorrect application of the law by SUNAT or the Tax Court. As explained earlier, as a consequence of DEI Egenor\u2019s use of the tax amnesty system, this Tribunal cannot substitute its own jurisdiction for the jurisdiction of the Peruvian courts in matters concerning the interpretation of tax law.\n\n226.\n\nTherefore, since this Tribunal is not a Peruvian court of appeal, more is required than a mere demonstration of an erroneous interpretation of the law. It is not for the Tribunal to simply determine if Peruvian law was properly applied, to formulate its own theory on Peruvian law, or to determine what it would consider to be the appropriate interpretation from the variety of interpretations that one might reasonably formulate. By their very nature, laws often invite different interpretations based on fairly reasonable principles. For this reason, and in order to preserve the proper balance of fairness between the parties in this arbitration, it must be demonstrated, absent a demonstrable change of law or a change to a stable prior interpretation or application, that the application of the law to DEI Egenor was patently unreasonable or arbitrary.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides that tax stabilization guarantees that: (a) laws or regulations that form part of the tax regime at the time the LSA is executed will not be amended or modified to the detriment of the investor, (b) a stable interpretation or application that is in place at the time the LSA is executed will not be changed to the detriment of the investor, and (c) even in the absence of (a) and (b), stabilized laws will not be interpreted or applied in a patently unreasonable or arbitrary manner.\n\n228.\n\nHowever, tax stabilization does not mean that the laws shall only be interpreted or applied based on the meaning that most favours the beneficiary, or the meaning that its legal advisors suggest would be the most appropriate. Tax stabilization does not provide a guarantee against the risk that the Government or the courts will interpret the law in a manner that is unfavourable to the investor, or that differs from the opinion of the investor\u2019s legal advisors. An interpretation adverse to the investor cannot *per se* be considered a modification or violation of legal stability unless it is so unreasonable that, in practice, it violates the very stability that was guaranteed.\n\n**2. Good Faith and the Doctrine of** ***Actos Propios***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n229.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction (at para. 134), the Tribunal determined that Duke Energy is protected not only by the text of the DEI Bermuda LSA, but by any guarantees that may be implied from the DEI Bermuda LSA under Peruvian law:\n\n[T]he Tribunal is not limiting Claimant strictly to the text of the DEI Bermuda LSA. First, Claimant is entitled to guarantees that are implied in the DEI Bermuda LSA by Peruvian law. Second, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees provided by such rules of international law as may be held by the Tribunal to be applicable to the merits of the dispute by virtue of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n230.\n\nThe most important of the implied guarantees is the Government\u2019s obligation to act in good faith. This follows directly from Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which states that \"contracts [must] be negotiated, entered into and executed according to the rules of good faith and common intention of the parties.\"\n\n231.\n\nOne of the fundamental facets of good faith within Peruvian law is the *doctrina de los actos propios.* This key aspect of good faith - known in various legal systems as *venire contra factum proprio non valet, la doctrina de los actos propios, allegans contraria non est audiendus,* estoppel or the principle of consistency - has also been universally applied as a general legal principle, both in civil and international law, to prohibit a State from taking actions or making representations which are contrary to or inconsistent with actions or representations it has taken previously to the detriment of another.\n\n232.\n\nThe parties do not disagree on the general content of the principle of good faith, or that the doctrine of *actos propios* is implied from all contracts, including LSAs, under Peruvian law. They do differ, however, on the question of whether Respondent breached its obligation of good faith when SUNAT issued the Tax Assessment against DEI Egenor, and whether SUNAT\u2019s conduct could properly be evaluated against the prior conduct and/or representations of the Government\u2019s various organs and entities, such as COPRI, CEPRI-ELP, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and the *Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional de Desarrollo* (\"CONADE\" today known as *Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento de la Actividad Empresarial del Estado* \"FONAFE\"). The latter question raises the issue of whether principles of international law need to be applied to supplement the doctrine of *actos propios* and, if so, how.\n\n**b) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**i) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n233.\n\nClaimant submits that, while the departmentalization or division of the State might be acceptable as an internal matter of Peruvian law, such a principle is inconsistent with the principle of the unity of the State under international law. According to Claimant, it is accepted by both parties that the latter principle must take priority in the event of such inconsistency, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n234.\n\nClaimant argues that SUNAT, COPRI, CONADE, CEPRI-ELP and the Ministry of Energy and Mines are all interrelated Government agencies. *Vis-\u00e0-vis* the investor, they are indistinguishable parts of a single State, whose actions and representations are binding on one another for purposes of the application of the doctrine of *actos propios.*\n\n235.\n\nClaimant contends that SUNAT\u2019s alleged autonomy within the Peruvian legal system does not mean that it is distinct, for all purposes, from the rest of the Government. The International Law Commission (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility make it absolutely unambiguous that SUNAT is as much a part of the same Government as, for example, the Minister of Energy and Mines. Moreover, SUNAT is part of the same Government as COPRI and CEPRI-ELP, which engineered and implemented the privatization of Egenor from 1996 to 1999, and as is CONADE, which instructed Electroper\u00fa on how to vote at Egenor shareholders\u2019 meetings.\n\n236.\n\nPut another way, Claimant asserts that when the conduct of Respondent\u2019s officials, entities and organs are observed as a whole, Respondent\u2019s arguments do not support its ultimate position that the conduct of its officials, entities and organs is not attributable to the Government of Peru. In other words, according to Claimant, Peru is not a passive party: the coherent action of one part of the Government dealing with taxation issues and another dealing with investment promotion is the responsibility of Respondent as a single unit. It is not the responsibility of Claimant, it argues, to bear the risk of Government ambiguity and inconsistency.\n\n**ii) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAccording to Respondent, which relies in this respect on the opinion of its expert, Professor Bullard, establishing a violation of the *actos propios* doctrine requires the establishment of three elements:\n\n\u2022 First, the entity must have engaged in \"binding conduct;\" that is, in actions that induced reasonable reliance by another.\n\n\u2022 Second, the entity must have engaged in subsequent conduct that contradicts or undermines its prior unequivocal message.\n\n\u2022 Third, the entity engaging in the subsequent, allegedly contradictory conduct must be the same party that engaged in the actions generating reasonable reliance.\n\n238.\n\nIn other words, asserts Respondent, entity A's conduct ordinarily cannot bind entity B. The actions of a state-owned entity acting in the limited capacity of corporate shareholder *(acta jure gestioni),* for example, cannot bind the subsequent actions of a different State agency acting in a sovereign capacity *(ius imperium).*\n\n239.\n\nIn reply to Claimant\u2019s reliance on international law, Respondent contends that international law applies to Claimant's claims in only two circumstances: (i) when there is a gap in Peruvian law; and (ii) when there is a serious inconsistency between Peruvian law and international law, such that application of Peruvian law would itself violate international law.\n\n240.\n\nIn the present case, argues Respondent, the parties both agree that the matter at issue is addressed by the Peruvian doctrine of *actos propios,* there is, therefore, no gap in the applicable domestic law. Moreover, asserts Respondent, Claimant has not even attempted to suggest how the *actos propios* doctrine, or indeed the Peruvian law on good faith, might conflict with international law. Accordingly, Claimant\u2019s passing reference to international law on good faith must be disregarded.\n\n**c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe DEI Bermuda LSA, as a legal instrument, is not a creature purely of domestic Peruvian law. As established earlier, in its discussion of applicable law, the Tribunal is of the view that principles of international law must be given effect in determining the extent to which the division of the State into separate entities and agencies can insulate the State from liability for certain actions and representations. More specifically, in interpreting the meaning of the doctrine of *actos propios* (or estoppel)23 for the LSA context, the Tribunal must take into account the perspective of a reasonable foreign investor, perceiving, observing and interacting with the Government of Peru, the host State.\n\nThe Tribunal uses the term estoppel here as a shorthand for the general concept, which exists both in the doctrine of *actos propios* and under international law, that a party is prohibited from taking actions or making representations that contradict what it has done or said before.\n\n242.\n\nTo this extent, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant. Claimant goes too far, however, in asserting that principles of State responsibility should apply, for purposes of estoppel, in attributing conduct of various State bodies or agencies to the State as a whole. The Tribunal rejects this aspect of Claimant\u2019s argument because there is an important and material distinction between, on the one hand, estoppel *vis-\u00e0-vis* the State created by acts or statements of its organs and, on the other hand, State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts of its organs.\n\n243.\n\nIn the context of State responsibility, the analysis begins with a breach of international law, and the subsequent inquiry focuses on whether that breach - the internationally wrongful act - can be attributed to the State as a whole. In the context of estoppel, any determination of \"wrongdoing\" - if that is the correct concept - is the end point of the inquiry. The analysis begins with a review of the acts and statements of the State\u2019s various organs and officials, all of which may very well be independently lawful. The conclusion of wrongdoing depends on the intricate dynamic, over time, between the State actors and the third party.\n\n244.\n\nUnder international customary law on State responsibility, the conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority are considered an act of the State if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions. In such a case, if the person or entity was vested with *any* form of public authority, the State is liable for its actions, irrespective of its rank within the State hierarchy, whether it acted within the scope of its competence, or whether it induced reliance by the victim of the act based on the capacity in which it was acting.\n\n245.\n\nEstoppel is different. Estoppel does not necessarily involve, *a priori,* any wrongful behaviour that causes damage. Instead, estoppel involves conduct that induces reliance by a third party as to the State\u2019s position on a particular subject, irrespective of whether that conduct is legal or not.\n\n246.\n\nIn the case of State responsibility, the State assumes the risk for the wrongful acts committed by its organs and officials. In the context of estoppel, the State assumes the risk for the acts of its organs or officials which, *by their nature,* may reasonably *induce reliance* in third parties. As such, what is relevant for estoppel is that there has been a declaration, representation, or conduct which has in fact induced reasonable reliance by a third party, which means that the State, even if only implicitly, has committed not to change its course.\n\n247.\n\nThe decisive element for estoppel is the *reasonable appearance* that the representation binds the State. In this regard, the competence, or rather, *the manifest lack of competence,* of a State organ is relevant, given that no one can reasonably have confidence in representations or statements coming from an organ which manifestly lacks the competence to make them.\n\n248.\n\nAccordingly, for purposes of estoppel, the Tribunal does not find helpful the principles on State attribution in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility. Rather, the Tribunal draws inspiration, by analogy, from the test that applies in international law to determine whether a treaty is binding even though it was signed in violation of a country\u2019s internal law. For the Tribunal, this test is helpful in understanding the test that should apply to determine whether a representation should be binding on the State, even though it has been made in violation of the country\u2019s internal law. The relevant test is set out in Article 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:\n\nArticle 46. Provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties\n\n1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.\n\n2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.\n\n249.\n\nFollowing this line of reasoning, for the conduct or representation of a State entity to be invoked as grounds for estoppel, it must be *unequivocal,* that is to say, it must be the result of an action or conduct that, *in accordance with normal practice and good faith,* is perceived by third parties as an expression of the State\u2019s position, and as being incompatible with the possibility of being contradicted in the future.\n\n250.\n\nThe *competence* of the State entity or official is also significant in this context. It is logical that this aspect is irrelevant within the regime of State responsibility, because what is essential there is the wrongful act (the breach of international law) committed by an organ or person acting under the aegis of the State. By contrast, it is difficult for an organ or official who manifestly lacks competence to be able to induce reasonable reliance in a third party, such as the foreign investor.\n\n251.\n\nThis analysis only takes the matter so far. In the end, everything depends on the particular circumstances surrounding the actions or statements at the heart of the estoppel allegations. These are studied more carefully by the Tribunal, for each of the Depreciation Assessment and Merger Revaluation Assessment, in the Liability Section, below.\n\n**3. Other Guarantees**\n-----------------------\n\n**a) Non-Discrimination**\n-------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Peruvian Government\u2019s commitment of non-discrimination is set forth in Clause Three, Section 5 of the DEI Bermuda LSA, which states as follows:\n\nTHREE- By virtue of this Agreement and as long as it remains in effect, in connection with the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO, the STATE guarantees legal stability for DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL, according to the following terms:\n\n[...]\n\n5. Stability of the right to non-discrimination as stipulated in subsection c) of article 10 of Legislative Decree No. 662, which implies that the State at none of its levels, whether entities or companies of the Central Government, or Regional or Local Governments, may apply to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL a different treatment by virtue of its nationality, the sectors or types of economic activity in which it engages, or the geographic location of the company in which it invests, or in the following matters:\n\na) Foreign exchange, such that with respect to the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO, the STATE may not apply to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL a currency exchange regime that entails a less favorable treatment that the one applied to any individual or legal entity in the execution of any type of foreign exchange transaction.\n\nb) Prices, tariffs or non-customs duties, such that the STATE may not apply differential amounts or rates to DUKE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY with respect to the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO.\n\nc) The form of corporate organization, such that the STATE may not require that DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL organizes DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL PERU HOLDINGS, S.R.L., in which it is going to invest, as a certain type of company;\n\nd) its status as an individual or legal entity, such that the STATE, may not apply differentiated treatment to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL because of this status; and,\n\ne) Any other cause with equivalent effects, such as may be arise from application of discriminatory treatment to DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL resulting from any combination of the various paragraphs of this section.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n253.\n\nThere is no parallel non-discrimination protection in the Egenor LSA.\n\n254.\n\nClaimant relies on several additional provisions to define the scope of the nondiscrimination guarantee, namely Articles 2 and 10(c) of the Foreign Investment Act.\n\n255.\n\nArticle 10(c) of the Foreign Investment Law, specifically referenced in the DEI Bermuda LSA, guarantees the foreign investor \"stability of the non-discrimination rights contemplated in Article 2 hereof.\" In turn, Article 2 of the Foreign Investment Law establishes the general principle of equal treatment between foreign and national investors, and clarifies, according to Claimant, that the non-discrimination protection granted to the foreign investor includes actions taken against the local company in which a foreign investor participates:\n\nArticle 2.- Foreign investors and the companies in which these participate have the same rights and obligations as the local investors and companies. Such rights and obligations are only limited by the exceptions established in the Political Constitution of Peru and the provisions hereof.\n\nIn no case the domestic juridical regulations will discriminate among investors or the companies based on the local or foreign share in the investments.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n256.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Article 2 of the Foreign Investment Law makes it clear that both DEI Bermuda and DEI Egenor *(i.e.,* \"the company in which DEI Bermuda participates\") have the right to equal treatment on the same terms as those granted to a national investor and recipient company. Equally clear, however, says Claimant, is the fact that only DEI Bermuda can assert a claim under the DEI Bermuda LSA for action that falls short of this standard, regardless of whether that discriminatory action is taken against the foreign investor or the company in which it invests.\n\n257.\n\nClaimant submits that the prohibition on discrimination based upon \"any other cause with equivalent effects\" (Clause Three, Section 5(e) of the DEI Bermuda LSA) is effectively synonymous with the Peruvian Constitution\u2019s prohibition on differential treatment based on any unjustified reason.\n\n258.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserts that the principle of non-discrimination under Peruvian law, as under international law, implies that differential treatment be judged against the context of those entities or individuals who are in the same situation. Thus, without a valid justification, the Government of Peru was prohibited from treating DEI Egenor differently from other similarly situated companies.\n\n259.\n\nThere is no disagreement on the part of Respondent on the scope of the protection that these provisions afford Claimant, and the Tribunal accordingly endorses Claimant\u2019s description of its scope. Where the parties differ is on the question of whether the tax assessment - and the Merger Revaluation Assessment in particular - was discriminatory. The parties\u2019 respective arguments on this issue are presented in the Liability Section below, at Section V.B.4.\n\n**b) Free Remittance of Capital**\n---------------------------------\n\n**i) Relevant Provisions of the DEI Bermuda LSA**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nIn Clause Three, Section 3 of the DEI Bermuda LSA, the Peruvian Government guaranteed free remittance of capital in the following terms:\n\nTHREE - By virtue of this Agreement, the **STATE,** and as long as it remains in effect, in connection with the investment referred in CLAUSE TWO, the **STATE** guarantees legal stability for **DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL** according to the following terms:\n\n[...]\n\n3. Stability of the right to freely remit its dividends and capitals pursuant to Article 10(b) of Legislative Decree No. 662, which implies that DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL may transfer abroad in freely convertible currency, without requiring prior authorization from any entity of the Central, Regional or Local Government as long as the investment was registered before the Competent National Organism and all corresponding tax obligations have been complied with, and without the **STATE** being allowed any restriction or limitation to this right, the following:\n\na) All its capitals brought from abroad, including the capital from the transfer of its shares, interests or rights over companies, of the reduction of the capital equity and partial or total liquidation, which come from the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO;\n\nb) All the dividends and the actually obtained net profits obtained from the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO, as well as the profits obtained as consideration for the use and enjoy of the assets physically located in the country used for such investment; and\n\nc) All the royalties and considerations for the use and transfer of technology; trademarks and patents; and any other industrial property element authorized by the Competent National Organism.\n\n**ii) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n261.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the protection contained in Clause Three, Section 3 of the DEI Bermuda LSA must be viewed as consisting of two distinct and yet related aspects: (i) the right to remit freely the total amount of the profits generated by DEI Egenor, or to repatriate freely the investment without any regulatory restrictions or approvals; and (ii) (a *sine qua non* of (i)) the underlying ownership interest in the distribution of profits available to the investor or repatriation of the investment itself.\n\n262.\n\nMoreover, Claimant contends that the reference to Duke Energy\u2019s compliance with all corresponding tax obligations does not vitiate its right of free remittance or its underlying ownership right. To the contrary, Claimant submits that it underscores the Government\u2019s breach of these rights, because the right to free remittance is predicated on the requirement of the payment of *legitimate* taxes.\n\n263.\n\nClaimant submits that SUNAT\u2019s multi-million dollar assessments were unlawful, discriminatory and confiscatory; thus, they impaired Duke Energy\u2019s right of free remittance of the *full* amount of its profits.\n\n**iii) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant\u2019s \"imaginative interpretation\" of Article Three, Section 3 of the DEI Bermuda LSA is unsustainable. At paragraph 202 of its Counter-Memorial, Respondent writes:\n\naccording to Claimant, the right to free transfers includes not only the right to be free from impediments to transfers but the right to be free of any measure that would have the effect of \"illegitimately\" or \"unreasonably\" reducing the amount of capital available to transfer. Claimant\u2019s interpretation is without merit and, in the absence of any real evidence that Peru has restricted Claimant\u2019s right to transfer, must be rejected.\n\n265.\n\nMoreover, Respondent notes that the right to remit dividends and capital is expressly conditional in the relevant provision of the LSA on compliance with the tax laws.\n\n**iv) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the guarantee of free remittance under the DEI Bermuda LSA. The guarantee of free remittance does not indirectly guarantee tax stabilization or non-discrimination to Claimant. Indeed, under the structure of the DEI Bermuda LSA, the free-remittance guarantee need not accomplish any more than it expressly sets out to do, as tax stabilization and non-discrimination are specifically provided for under separate guarantees.\n\n**c) Independent Guarantees under International Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**i) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n267.\n\nIn the earlier section of this Award addressing applicable law, the Tribunal already described Claimant\u2019s argument that international law in this case establishes certain independent and autonomous rights for Claimant. More specifically, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should apply relevant guarantees and protections found in customary international law and general principles of law.\n\n268.\n\nClaimant relies on the jurisprudence of investor-state arbitration tribunals, and the views of international law scholars such as Professor Dolzer (one of Claimant\u2019s experts), to argue that the requirement of fair and equitable treatment of an investment by a host State is widely recognized as forming part of the customary standard of treatment under international law. Claimant submits that the jurisprudence of investor-state arbitration tribunals confirms that bad faith is not a requirement of the standard. And even if it is, according to Claimant, the evidence demonstrates that the bad faith requirement is satisfied in the instant case.\n\n269.\n\nClaimant submits that there is no distinction between the fair and equitable treatment standard and the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law with regard, in particular, to the legitimate expectations of predictability, stability and transparency.\n\n270.\n\nThe minimum standard of protection requires a host state to: (1) act in good faith, with transparency and protection of legitimate expectations; (2) provide a stable and predictable legal framework for foreign investment; and (3) refrain from arbitrary conduct.\n\n271.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent breached the minimum standard of treatment by (1) failing to meet Duke Energy\u2019s legitimate expectations of a stable and predictable legal framework for its investment and (2) failing to refrain from arbitrary conduct.\n\n272.\n\nClaimant also relies on \"general principles of law\u2019\" and in particular on the principles of good faith and estoppel. In his expert written opinion, supported by his testimony before the Tribunal, Prof. Rudolf Dolzer wrote (at para. 66):\n\nIn case an investor relies upon such statements in making an investment in the host country, in case the host country subsequently acts inconsistently with its earlier position, and in case the investor turns out to be disadvantaged by its reliance on this earlier position, the principles of good faith and of estoppel will coalesce and form the basis of a rule according to which a host state incurs liability under the general rules of international law under such circumstances of a broken promise of the host state.\n\n273.\n\nAccording to Claimant, again relying on the opinion of Professor Dolzer, general principles of law are, in the first place, sources of international law addressing the relationship between States, but they also apply between host States and the foreign investor.\n\n**ii) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n274.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant may not raise independent claims under international law in this case; here international law may only fill gaps or correct shortcomings in domestic law. Even if international law were applicable as the basis for a claim, the only relevant law that would apply would be customary international law, says Respondent, because there is no applicable investment treaty.\n\n275.\n\nRespondent adds that the arbitral awards that Claimant and its experts have cited do not establish that fair and equitable treatment is part of customary international law. In fact, nearly all of the passages cited by Claimant explicitly involve interpretation of specific *treaty* provisions requiring \"fair and equitable treatment,\" rather than pronouncements on the content of *customary international law.*\n\n276.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant fails to acknowledge that the very existence and content of the minimum standard of treatment is highly disputed. Respondent notes that a number of arbitral tribunals have found that the international minimum standard can only be violated through a showing of \"bad faith\" or other \"egregious conduct\" by the host state.\n\n277.\n\nRespondent notes that various countries, notably the United States and Canada, deny the existence of a customary international law rule protecting investors\u2019 \"settled\" or \"legitimate\" expectations, or prohibiting \"arbitrary\" conduct.\n\n278.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant\u2019s argument under international law is defeated solely by the existence of debate and disputes among key states on those very questions. That Claimant\u2019s home State (the U.S.A.) \u2014the predominant capital-exporting State of the past century \u2014 does not consider customary international law to include the component principles invoked by Claimant demonstrates, according to Respondent, that the consistent state practice and *opinio juris* needed for a customary international rule do not exist.\n\n279.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent submits that, even if the Tribunal were to find that the fair and equitable treatment standard applied in this case, there could be no breach:\n\n\u2022 the determination of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment must be made in the light of the high measure of deference international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders;\n\n\u2022 the threshold for finding a violation is high; and\n\n\u2022 the minimum standard of treatment is applied with particular restraint when the action challenged relates to a definitive interpretation of the law of the host State by an administrative or judicial tribunal.\n\n**iii) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that it does not need to address the thorny issue of the content of the minimum standard of treatment. Even if the Tribunal held that the minimum standard did contain the elements that Claimant has advocated it did, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion would add little to the outcome of this arbitration. As explained by the Tribunal earlier, this is due to the fact that the elements that Claimant has argued are part of the international law principles that should be implied as independent guarantees into the DEI Bermuda LSA overlap entirely, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, with the protections provided to Claimant under the DEI Bermuda LSA as interpreted under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**V. LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n**A. The Depreciation Assessment**\n----------------------------------\n\n**1. Background**\n-----------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Depreciation Assessment was based on SUNAT\u2019s view that Egenor should have depreciated the assets that Electroper\u00fa had transferred to it during the privatization process using the special decelerated rate that had been granted to Electroper\u00fa by SUNAT in December 1995, rather than the general statutory rate set forth in the Income Tax Regulations.\n\n282.\n\nSUNAT based the Depreciation Assessment on Chapter XIII of Legislative Decree No. 774 (the Income Tax Law that came into effect on January 1, 1994). Article 105 thereof refers to the so-called continuity rule as follows: \"The depreciable value and useful life of assets transferred due to corporate reorganization shall be those which would have corresponded to be applied by the transferor.\"\n\n283.\n\nSUNAT maintained that Egenor was constituted as a result of Electroper\u00fa\u2019s reorganization (in the form of a \"division\") and, therefore, pursuant to Articles 103 and 105 of the Income Tax Law, should have applied the same depreciation rates granted to Electroper\u00fa.\n\n284.\n\nOn December 21, 2001, Egenor filed an administrative challenge against the Depreciation Assessment, which was rejected in September 2002. On September 23, 2002, Egenor submitted an appeal before the Tax Court.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tax Court found that Chapter XIII of Legislative Decree No. 774 was inapplicable as its entry into force was conditioned, pursuant to its Article 106, on the issuance of implementing regulations, which had not been passed. It held that the continuity rule was nonetheless applicable, as it had been embraced by legal doctrine, a source of Tax Law pursuant to Rule III of the Peruvian Tax Code. The Tax Court concluded that since Egenor had received a block of property that made up an economic unit, in order to allow it to continue with the activity for which it was used by the transferor (Electroper\u00fa), the transferred assets should have been depreciated for the rest of the useful life that they had in the hands of the transferor.\n\n286.\n\nIn this regard, the Tax Court affirmed: \"The assets received by EGENOR should have maintained the same useful life and, consequently, the same percentages that ELECTROPER\u00da S.A. had before the reorganization, for purposes of calculating the depreciation. For that reason it befits to maintain in this case the assessment by [SUNAT] to the transfer of assets made by ELECTROPER\u00da S.A. for tax year 1996.\"\n\n287.\n\nHowever, the Tax Court partially reversed SUNAT\u2019s assessment by ruling that Egenor was obliged to apply the special depreciation rate granted to Electroper\u00fa only to those assets transferred to it after the special rate was issued -December 28, 1995. On July 27, 2004, SUNAT issued a revised tax assessment against Egenor, pursuant to the Tax Court\u2019s finding. On August 27, 2004, Egenor applied for amnesty in respect of the Depreciation Assessment.\n\n**2. Breach of Tax Stabilization Guarantee?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n288.\n\nClaimant submits that the depreciation rate that was stabilized for Egenor under the Egenor LSA on July 24, 1996 was the general statutory rate and not the special rate. Claimant\u2019s position is based on two fundamental points:\n\n\u2022 at the time of the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor, no enforceable legal provision established the so-called continuity rule, according to which Egenor would have been obliged to apply the same depreciation rate authorized for Electroper\u00fa; and\n\n\u2022 in any event, the transfer of assets to Egenor was a \"capital contribution\", not a corporate reorganization in the form of a \"division\".\n\n**i) The Continuity Rule**\n--------------------------\n\n289.\n\nClaimant submits that while Article 105 of Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law - prior to its 1998 amendment- provided for the application of the continuity rule to asset transfers resulting from corporate reorganizations, Article 106 limited the concept of \"reorganization\" to corporate mergers and divisions, whose precise meaning was to be provided by the implementing regulations.24 However, those implementing regulations had not been issued at the time of the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor and, hence, according to Claimant, Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law was not enforceable.\n\nArticle 106 of the Income Tax Law provided as follows: *\"The reorganization of corporations or companies is configured only in cases of mergers and divisions of same, with the limitations and in accordance with the provisions set forth in the regulations '\"* (Emphasis added).\n\n290.\n\nThe continuity rule not being in force at the relevant time, Claimant asserts that Egenor was legally compelled to apply the general depreciation rate specified in Article 22(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, as it effectively did. Thus, the stabilized depreciation rate under the Egenor LSA and, therefore, under the DEI Bermuda LSA, was the general rather than the special one. According to Claimant, by insisting that Egenor should have applied the special depreciation rate, Respondent breached the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**ii) Capital Contribution vs. Corporate Reorganization**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nClaimant maintains that, even if the continuity rule were applicable, SUNAT could not apply it to Egenor because the assets were not transferred from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor as part of a \"corporate reorganization\" (as required by the continuity rule), but rather as a capital contribution.\n\n292.\n\nAt the time of the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor, there was no particular definition of a corporate \"division\" for tax purposes. In that context, submits Claimant, the concept of \"division\" should be the one applied in corporate law.\n\n293.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the defining elements of a \"division\" are reflected in Law No. 26887, the new General Law on Corporations which came into force as of January 1, 1998. Relying on Professor Avenda\u00f1o, Claimant explains that Law No. 26887 reflected the general understanding on what constitutes a division existing in Per\u00fa before such statute entered into effect. According to Article 367 of Law No. 26887:\n\nIn a spin-off, a company divides its capital into two or more blocks to transfer them completely to other companies or to keep one of them, satisfying the requirements and formalities set forth by this law. It may take one of the following forms:\n\n1. The division of the whole capital of a company into two or more patrimonial blocks, which are then transferred to new companies or are absorbed by preexisting companies or both at the same time. This kind of spin-off causes the termination of the original company, or\n\n2. The separation of one or more patrimonial blocks of a company that is not terminated and that transfers them to one or more new companies, or that are absorbed by preexisting companies or both at the same time. The original company adjusts its capital to the corresponding amount.\n\nIn both cases, the partners or shareholders of the original company receive shares or quotas as shareholders or partners of the new companies or. should that be the case, of the absorbing companies.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n294.\n\nIn short, Claimant submits that in a division, (i) once the assets are transferred to the new company, the original company reduces its capital in the amount of the value of the transferred assets and (ii) the shareholders in the original corporation receive shares in the new corporation.\n\n295.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Electroper\u00fa\u2019s reorganization did not comply with either of these two elements. First, the transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor was not followed by a capital reduction by the former. Second, Electroper\u00fa, not its shareholders, received shares of Egenor.\n\n296.\n\nFurther elements, asserts Claimant, confirm that the incorporation of Egenor was not the result of Electroper\u00fa\u2019s division. For example, the transfer of assets to Egenor did not take place in a single act, as would normally happen in a division, but through a series of acts. Egenor received contributions from four different companies - Electroper\u00fa, Electronorte S.A, Electronoroeste S.A. and Electrolima - and returned some of those assets to Electroper\u00fa.\n\n297.\n\nThus, according to Claimant, Electroper\u00fa\u2019s reorganization cannot be qualified as a \"division\" to which the continuity rule would have been applicable under Articles 105 and 106 of Legislative Decree No. 774 - assuming such rule contained in Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law was in full force and effect. Claimant submits that this confirms that it was the general statutory rate rather than the special rate authorized for Electroper\u00fa that was stabilized under the Egenor LSA and, therefore, under the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n298.\n\nRespondent submits that the depreciation rate that had been stabilized for Egenor under the Egenor LSA was the special rate, not the general statutory rate. Respondent presents the following principal arguments to support its position:\n\n\u2022 Even if the continuity rule was not codified in 1996, it was clearly established in legal doctrine, which is recognized as a source of tax law in Peru.\n\n\u2022 Prior to the issuance of Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law, Legislative Decree No. 200 provided for the continuity rule.\n\n\u2022 The transfer of assets from Electroper\u00fa to Egenor constituted a transfer of economic units - not of independent units - under the so-called permanent regime established by Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law. The depreciation rate established under Article 22(b) of the Income Tax Regulations can apply to the transfer of independent units only.\n\n\u2022 In order to carry out the privatization process, Electroper\u00fa reorganized its activities and assets into several companies. Even though, as Claimant argues, the incorporation of Egenor was the result of several capital contributions, those capital contributions took place in the context of Electroper\u00fa\u2019s reorganization pursuant to Decree No. 674 and Legislative Decree No. 782.\n\n\u2022 The General Law on Corporations in force at the time the Egenor LSA was executed (Supreme Decree No. 003-85-JUS) did not contain a definition of \"division.\" In the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Egenor\u2019s challenge to the Depreciation Assessment, it held as follows regarding the concept of \"division\":\n\n(...) during the effective term of the Single Uniform Text of the General Business Corporations Law, approved by Supreme Decree No. 003-85-JUS, which is applicable to this case, it was not possible to interpret the term \"split-up\" [divisi\u00f3n] or the verb \"to split up\" [dividir] just as synonyms of the term \"spin-off\u2019 [escisi\u00f3n] and the verb \"to spin off\u2019 [escindir], respectively, and rather a new, broader, meaning had to be adopted and extended both to the act of splitting up the activities of a company of enterprise, even if that could not be interpreted as a spin-off or split-up, strictly speaking, in corporate terms, but always in the context of the reorganization of a company or enterprise.25\n\nExhibit C-l19 (Tax Court Resolution No. 02538-1-2004).\n\n**c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by observing that both the general statutory rate and the special decelerated rate were part of the tax regime in place at the time the Egenor LSA was executed. The real question for the Tribunal is to determine which particular rate should have been applied by Egenor to the assets that Electroper\u00fa transferred to it, as a matter of Peruvian tax law.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that it does not have the jurisdiction to rule on the correctness of particular interpretations of Peruvian tax law. This is therefore an instance in which the Tribunal must simply determine whether the Depreciation Assessment was based on a patently unreasonable or arbitrary interpretation of the tax rules. For the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that it was not.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal turns first to the issue of continuity. While it is true that the Tax Court decision of April 23, 2004 (Resolution No. 02538-1-2004) questioned the validity of Chapter XIII of the Tax Law prior to 1998, it nevertheless confirmed that the principle of continuity was part of the tax regime (as legal doctrine) at the time that Electroper\u00fa transferred assets to Egenor, and on the date of the Egenor LSA.\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider the Tax Court\u2019s decision unreasonable. It is reasonable that depreciation over the useful life of assets should not be changed by the mere fact that ownership thereof has been transferred, if the assets are used in the same way. Depreciation is linked to the depreciating asset and its economic use rather than to the identity of its owner. It is not illogical or arbitrary that the rate should be determined *intuitu rei* and not *intuitu personae.*\n\n303.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider that the Tax Court\u2019s decision violates the principle of legality, given the particular circumstances in which it applied legal doctrine to fill the gap left by the assumed inapplicability of Chapter XIII of the Tax Law. Notably, it appears to the Tribunal that had the Tax Court not relied on legal doctrine in order to ground the existence of the continuity rule, it could have done so on the basis of other sources of Peruvian tax law. For example, the Tax Court cited in its decision, among other arguments supporting the validity of Chapter XIII, a decision of the Constitutional-Social Division of the Supreme Court which had upheld the validity of a law (Law Decree No. 25764) even though its implementing regulations had not been adopted.26\n\nDetails about this decision, dated November 28, 2001, were provided in the Second Expert Report of Dr. Luis Hern\u00e1ndez Berenguel dated March 21, 2007, at paragraph 73.\n\n304.\n\nIndeed, having carefully read Articles 105 and 106 of Chapter XIII, the Tribunal is not convinced that the conclusion that Chapter XIII was not in force or inapplicable due to the absence of \"implementing regulations\" is sound. Articles 105 and 106 read as follows:\n\n**Article 105.-** The depreciable value and useful life of assets transferred in a company reorganization will be those that would have applied when they were in the possession of the transferor.\n\n**Article 106.-** The reorganization of companies or corporations occurs only in cases of merger and division, with limitations, and in accordance with the stipulations stated in the regulations.\n\nArguably, Article 106 affords the executive branch the opportunity to define limitations applicable to the concept of merger or division through regulation, but does not require such regulations for the general concepts to apply. In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 106 of Chapter XIII can be distinguished from more explicit language in other Peruvian legislation that makes it clear that a tax measure is necessarily contingent on the promulgation of regulations. For example, Article 2 of Decree Law No. 26009 provided that the applicability of a benefit in relation to the Consumption Selective Tax would be exclusively contingent upon its regulations.27 In contrast, the text of Article 106 does not expressly condition the entry into force of that provision, or any other article of Chapter XIII, on the promulgation of regulations.\n\nSUNAT Memorandum No. 370-2001-K00000, July 12, 2001 (emphasis added) (Exhibit R-079).\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the evidence of Professor Talledo, one of Claimant\u2019s experts on Peruvian tax law, to the effect that the continuity rule set out in Chapter XIII of the Income Tax Law could not have been in effect due to the absence of implementing regulations,28 seems to contradict earlier opinions given by Professor Talledo himself concerning analogous provisions, namely Chapter XIV of the Decree Law No. 25751.29\n\n*See* Report of Prof. C\u00e9sar Talledo dated December 20, 2006 at para. 5.\n\n*See* Second Expert Report of Dr. Luis Hern\u00e1ndez Berenguel dated March 21, 2007 at paras. 74-79.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the issue of \"corporate reorganization\". Prior to the Egenor case, in its Decision No. 594-2-2001 dated May 25, 2001, the Tax Court had held that the concept of corporate reorganization in tax law is a matter of substance and not of form. In that case, the Tax Court found that the term \"division\" or \"spin-off\u2019 under Supreme Decree No. 003-85-JUS of 1985,30 the predecessor to the General Corporations Law, was understood as including the act of dividing the activity of a corporation, in the context of a corporate reorganization, even if a formal spin-off was not carried out.31 The Tax Court found that the assets transferred by a state-owned company to an acquiring company in the context of a privatization, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 674, amounted to a \"division\" in the context of a corporate reorganization. Consequently, the acquiring company had to continue depreciating those assets in accordance with the useful life and cost basis that the state-owned company had applied to the assets prior to their transfer. The Tax Court in the *Egenor* case cited that earlier decision and noted that, in accordance with the interpretation of the term \"division\", Egenor had to continue depreciating the assets using the same useful life that those assets had at the time Electroper\u00fa transferred them.32\n\n*See* Supreme Decree No. 003-85-JUS, January 14, 1985 (Exhibit R-204).\n\nTax Court Resolution No. 594-2-2001, May 25, 2001, at 2 (Exhibit R-134).\n\nTax Court Resolution No. 2538-1-2004, April 23, 2004, at 5 (Exhibit R-146).\n\n307.\n\nOf course, it is possible to interpret these provisions in a different way, concluding that the concept of corporate reorganization should be applied identically for tax purposes and for corporate purposes. That does not mean, however, that the decision of the Tax Court or the Depreciation Assessment itself were so unreasonable that they constitute a violation of the guarantee of tax stabilization. It is not unreasonable, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that depreciation over the useful life of assets should not be modified by the mere change of ownership, provided that the economic use and nature of the assets remain the same. That was the case with the assets transferred by Electroper\u00fa to Egenor.\n\n**3. Breach of Good Faith (Doctrine of** ***Actos Propios)?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n308.\n\nClaimant alleges that the Government of Peru:\n\n\u2022 mandated the application of the statutory depreciation rate to Egenor\u2019s assets;\n\n\u2022 confirmed that the general statutory depreciation rate was stabilized for Egenor during negotiations with Duke Energy;\n\n\u2022 ratified Egenor\u2019s application of the general statutory depreciation rate through Electroper\u00fa\u2019s shareholder vote;\n\n\u2022 failed to mention any possibility of forthcoming or latent tax liability during negotiations with Duke Energy;\n\n\u2022 commanded a higher price from Duke Energy by representing Egenor as a company in which the statutory depreciation rate was stabilized; and\n\n\u2022 benefited financially from Egenor\u2019s application of the statutory depreciation rate.\n\n309.\n\nClaimant submits that, in light of these actions and statements, on which Duke Energy relied, the Depreciation Assessment constitutes a breach of good faith.\n\n310.\n\nClaimant submits that the Government cannot avoid the consequences of its inconsistent conduct based on the principle of separation of powers, as Respondent suggests. SUNAT, COPRI, CONADE, CEPRI-ELP and the Ministry of Energy and Mines are all interrelated Government agencies. As such, *vis-\u00e0-vis* the investor, they are indivisible, and in the eyes of the foreign investor, their actions must be deemed synonymous.\n\n311.\n\nWith respect to CEPRI-ELP, Claimant argues that:\n\n\u2022 CEPRI-ELP, the sole Governmental entity authorized to address potential bidders on behalf of the State, was fully capable of making binding pronouncements on tax matters, and furthermore, it had the right to seek advice from SUNAT.\n\n\u2022 Specifically in the context of the privatization of Egenor, CEPRI-ELP was the \"sole voice\" of the Government and its pronouncements, e.g., Circular 15, became a binding part of the Privatization Agreement pursuant to the mandates of the Bidding Rules.\n\n312.\n\nAccording to Claimant, CEPRI-ELP confirmed in Circular 15 that the general statutory depreciation rates contained in the Income Tax Legislation were the ones that would be applicable to Egenor\u2019s assets, thus excluding application of the Special Rate.\n\n313.\n\nAt the time CEPRI-ELP issued Circular 15, according to Claimant, there is no evidence to suggest that any potential buyer interested in acquiring the 60 Percent Tranche of Egenor was even aware that a Special Rate for Electroper\u00fa\u2019s assets had been requested or issued, much less that CEPRI-ELP intended it to apply to the assets of Egenor.\n\n314.\n\nClaimant notes that, in fact, the question asked of CEPRI-ELP in Circular 15 is whether the statutory depreciation rate or *an even more accelerated rate* would apply to Egenor\u2019s assets. In other words, (a) the investor submitting the questions did not even hint at a special decelerated rate; and (b) CEPRI-ELP\u2019s answer must be judged in response to two variables (the statutory rate or an even more accelerated rate), neither of which envisages a special decelerated rate.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n315.\n\nRespondent submits that, under Peruvian law, Egenor was required to continue applying the same depreciation rate to the assets it received from Electroper\u00fa as Electroper\u00fa had applied to those assets before they were transferred, and that bidders were assumed to know the laws and regulations applicable in Peru.\n\n316.\n\nAccording to Respondent, CEPRI-ELP\u2019s Circular 15 \"refers the bidder to the Income Tax regulations in order for the bidder itself\u2014based on its own analysis and knowledge of these regulations\u2014to determine the corresponding rate, pursuant to those regulations.\" Respondent submits that CEPRI-ELP did not - and could not have specified - which depreciation rates applied to Egenor under the Income Tax Rules.\n\n317.\n\nRespondent also points to the written opinion provided to Egenor on September 25, 1996 (within a few months of its privatization) by the law firm Luna Victoria - V\u00e1squez & Asociados. The opinion advised Egenor that, pursuant to the Income Tax Law and Supreme Decree 122-94-EF, the special rate \"can and must be applied by Egenor.\"\n\n318.\n\nRespondent has filed witness statements from the various Government officials who, according to Claimant, provided assurances to Duke Energy in late 1999 about the Depreciation Rate. These witnesses say that they never provided such assurances.\n\n319.\n\nWith respect to CEPRI-ELP, Respondent argues that CEPRI-ELP could not and did not instruct Electroper\u00fa to approve Egenor\u2019s financial statements. Article 9 of the Privatization Law did not grant CEPRI-ELP the authority to issue \"directions and instructions\" concerning Egenor outside the context of a privatization process. For CEPRI-ELP, the Egenor privatization process was limited to the sale of the 60 percent interest.\n\n**c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n320.\n\nAs the Tribunal explained earlier, determining whether the Depreciation Assessment violated the implied duty of good faith or the doctrine of *actos propios* requires close scrutiny of the specific acts and statements that are alleged to have induced reasonable reliance on the part of Duke Energy. For the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has not met its burden of establishing that Respondent, through its agencies or officials, unequivocally committed to Egenor that it should apply the general statutory rate. In coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal pays particular attention to the contemporaneous signals that, at the very least, cautioned Dominion (and later Duke Energy) that the special decelerated rates should continue to apply.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal bases its decision, in particular, on the following observations:\n\n\u2022 the bidding rules for the 60 Percent Tranche were silent on the question of the applicable depreciation rate;\n\n\u2022 Circular 15 referred the bidder to the \"Income Tax Legislation\", but not to a particular depreciation rate;\n\n\u2022 the May 31, 1996 and June 30, 1996 Financial Statements of Egenor suggested that the decelerated rate was being used;\n\n\u2022 by its letter dated June 10, 1996 to CEPRI-ELP, Dominion, through IDP, specifically inquired if Egenor had received a special depreciation rate from SUNAT. Although CEPRI-ELP never replied to IDP\u2019s inquiry, it is clear from this letter that Dominion, even after Circular 15 had been issued, was uncertain as to which depreciation rate should be applied;\n\n\u2022 the letter Egenor sent to its advisors (Deloitte & Touche, and Luna Victoria-V\u00e1squez) on September 9, 1996, acknowledged that Egenor was then applying the special depreciation rate, because it inquired whether Egenor could modify its depreciation rate to the general rate;\n\n\u2022 although Egenor received conflicting advice from its advisors, the response Egenor received from Luna Victoria-V\u00e1squez on September 25, 1996 stated that Egenor must apply the special rate granted to Electroper\u00fa in 1995 based on the continuity rule set out in Article 105 of the Income Tax Law;\n\n\u2022 Egenor, instead, accepted the advice it received from Deloitte & Touche, to the effect that it should apply the general statutory rate, but never sent Deloitte & Touche\u2019s advice to Luna Victoria-V\u00e1squez for their comments; and\n\n\u2022 this record was available to Duke Energy in 1999 when it was carrying out its due diligence for the acquisition of the 60 Percent Tranche from Dominion, and the 30 Percent Tranche from the Government.\n\n322.\n\nIt was also demonstrated, during the cross-examination of Pastor Narron in particular, that - as a matter of fact - Circular 15 was not interpreted by Egenor as a clear direction from the Government as to what depreciation rate to apply. If anything, the wording of Circular 15, combined with Egenor\u2019s historical use of the special decelerated rate, created confusion. It did not induce comfort and reliance. If it had, such reliance would not have been reasonable.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimant has failed to establish that it could reasonably rely on Circular 15 and the general approval of Egenor\u2019s Financial Statements by Electroper\u00fa as a basis to challenge the Depreciation Assessment on the basis of good faith and the doctrine of *actos propios.*\n\n**B. The Merger Revaluation Assessment**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Background**\n-----------------\n\n324.\n\nIn the Merger Revaluation Assessment, SUNAT determined that it was permitted, under Rule VIII, to assess companies it concluded had undertaken \"simulated\" (or \"sham\") mergers in order to avail themselves of the Merger Revaluation Benefits. SUNAT concluded that the merger between Egenor and Power North did not constitute a \"real economic transaction\" and declared this transaction a \"simulation\".33\n\n3.00% 33,40,60,80 1.25%, 1.67%, 2.50%, 3.00%\n\n325.\n\nUseful background on Rule VIII was provided in the expert report of Prof. Shoschana Zusman dated September 29, 2006, submitted by Respondent. Professor Zusman notes, at paragraph 35, that \"the requalification of acts of private parties by the tax administration and the application of the criterion of economic reality date back to the year 1968 when there was not yet a legal regulation on evasion.\" She notes that provisions in successive Civil Codes of Peru \"were considered sufficient to apply the criterion of reality and requalify evasive acts.\" Professor Zusman then sets out the evolution of the actual text of Rule VIII in paragraphs 36 and 37:\n\n36. After an evolution, the Tax Code approved through Decree-Law 816 dated April 21, 1996, included in Norm VIII a provision to fight evasion. Its text is as follows:\n\n\"When applying tax norms, all interpretation admitted by Law may be used.\n\n33 The reference to the term \"simulation\" in this context should not be confused with the concept of simulation in civil law, where a transaction that is found to be simulated can be declared to be invalid and without legal effect. \"Simulation\" in the context of Rule VIII refers to the determination by SUNAT that a transaction - such as the merger - lacks economic reality. While such a determination by SUNAT deprives the transaction of its tax consequences, it does not affect the validity of the transaction for civil- or commercial law purposes. This was helpfully explained by Professor Talledo during Day 5 of the hearing (Hearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, at pp. 1286-87).\n\nTo determine the true nature of the taxable event, the National Tax Administration Superintendency (SUNAT) will deal with the business relations, situations and acts that are actually performed, pursued or established by tax debtors. When these submit those acts, situations or relations to legal forms or structures that are not expressly those offered or authorized by private law to configure properly the true actual business intention of the tax debtors, in considering the actual taxable event, we shall waive the adopted legal forms or structures and consider the actual business situation.\n\nIn the process of interpretation, no taxes may be created, no sanctions may be established, no exemptions may be granted and no tax provisions may be issued to be applied to entities or situations different from those specified in the law.\"\n\n37. Said text was valid until September 22, 1996, date when Law No. 26663 was issued, which eliminated the second section of the second paragraph of said law (hereinafter referred to as the Second Paragraph), in reference to the power of the Public Administration to do away with the practice of subjecting acts to forms that are not expressly provided by Private Law. The new text of Norm VIII was then worded as follows:\n\n\"When applying the tax norms, all interpretation methods admitted by Law may be used.\n\nTo determine the true nature of the taxable act, the National Tax Administration Superintendency (SUNAT) will deal with the business relations, situations and acts that are actually performed, pursued or established by tax debtors.\n\nIn the process of interpretation, no taxes may be created, no sanctions may be established, no exemptions may be granted and no tax provisions may be issued to be applied to entities or situations different from those specified in the law.\"\n\n326.\n\nIn its decision in the Edegel case,34 the Tax Court considered the amended text of Rule VIII. The Court concluded that the new text of Rule VIII preserved the requalification power of SUNAT, including the power to requalify simulated acts, even though the September 22, 1996 amendment (Law No. 26663) did away with requalification on the basis of legal fraud *(fraude a la ley).*\n\nCase No. 4852/2003 dated September 8, 2004 (Exhibit C-l15).\n\n**2. Breach of Tax Stabilization Guarantee?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n**i) Rule VIII**\n----------------\n\n327.\n\nClaimant argues that SUNAT gave Rule VIII a far broader reach than was legally permissible. The original text of Rule VIII allowed SUNAT to evaluate the purpose of a transaction in order to ascertain whether there was a fraudulent evasion of the tax laws *(fraude a la ley tributaria).* This original text, however, was explicitly repealed in 1996, long before the Merger Revaluation Assessment. Claimant contends that Rule VIII, as amended, does not authorize SUNAT to scrutinize the purpose of a merger.\n\n328.\n\nUnder the amended Rule VIII, according to Claimant, SUNAT is permitted to examine solely whether the economic substance of a business transaction (e.g., a merger) corresponds to that which is typical of the type of transaction at issue. SUNAT was allowed to make two inquiries regarding the merger in this case: (a) what are the typical economic features of a merger transaction; and (b) were those features present in this transaction. If SUNAT considered factors extraneous to those two inquiries, it arbitrarily exceeded its authority under Rule VIII, says Claimant.\n\n329.\n\nAs such, according to Claimant, the Merger Revaluation Assessment constitutes an outright violation of the law and hence a breach of the tax stabilization guarantee under the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**ii) The MRL**\n---------------\n\n330.\n\nClaimant also argues that SUNAT deprived DEI Egenor of the benefits of the MRL, which was part of the Stabilized Tax Regime.\n\n331.\n\nClaimant submits that both of Respondent\u2019s tax experts have concluded, albeit in writings outside of the context of this arbitration, that criteria identical to those considered by SUNAT (i.e., duration of existence of the companies, economic link between the companies, existence of previously carried out operations, magnitude of existing operations, etc.) were not required for a merger to be valid under the Merger Revaluation Law. In other words, the MRL did not prohibit the merger of \"paper\" companies. By invalidating the merger on the basis of the above-mentioned criteria, SUNAT breached the tax regime stabilized for Duke Energy\u2019s investment by: (a) effectively depriving DEI Egenor from being able to avail itself of the benefits of a stabilized law; and (b) changing the scope of a stabilized law by reading in additional requirements.\n\n332.\n\nClaimant contends that the Merger Revaluation Law unconditionally provided tax exemptions for asset transfers \"arising from merger or division agreements of any type of legal entity.\" On its face, there were no additional requirements or any specific directions relating to how companies should merge or divide. Similarly, Claimant argues, the regulations implementing the Merger Revaluation Law established no requirement or condition for applying the law that had to do with the objective of the companies that merged.\n\n333.\n\nConsequently, Claimant asserts, all that was required in order for a merger to qualify for the benefits of the MRL was that the merger be a valid merger under Peruvian corporate law.\n\n334.\n\nAccording to Claimant, at the time of the merger between Egenor and Power North in December 1996, the requirements for a valid merger were set forth in Articles 355, 356 and 358 of the General Law of Corporations. Under these provisions, a valid merger had to meet three substantive requirements: (i) the extinguishment of the legal status of the absorbed company; (ii) the transfer of capital in block and universally; and (iii) the delivery to the partners or shareholders of the absorbed company of shares or participations in the new company or in the absorber, as applicable.\n\n335.\n\nThese were the only requirements under Peruvian corporate law governing the validity of the merger between Egenor and Power North, and Claimant submits that each and every requirement was in fact satisfied.\n\n**iii) Motivations for Merger**\n-------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nEven if economic motivation were somehow relevant to the inquiry of whether the merger was simulated, Claimant contends that Peru has ignored numerous valid reasons underlying the merger, *inter alia.*\n\n\u2022 To revalue the assets transferred by Electroper\u00fa to Egenor, which were not revalued by CEPRI-ELP pursuant to Legislative Decree 782.\n\n\u2022 To maximize the value of Egenor, and hence the Government\u2019s shareholding, in order to comply with the Privatization Agreement. Clause 12.1 of the Privatization Agreement obligated Egenor, and hence Dominion, to take all necessary actions to assist the Government in the sale of its 30 percent shareholding in Egenor. The merger boosted the value of the company and thus the value of Electroper\u00fa\u2019s shares, thus fulfilling the objective of Clause 12.1 of the Privatization Agreement.\n\n\u2022 To obtain the benefits of the Peruvian State\u2019s private investment laws. Tax incentives were key to investors\u2019 decisions to revalue their assets, and in fact, to invest in Peru in the first place.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**i) Rule VIII**\n----------------\n\n337.\n\nRespondent submits that SUNAT applied Rule VIII properly. According to Respondent, Rule VIII of the Preliminary Title of the Tax Code requires SUNAT to interpret and apply the tax laws in a manner that takes into account the economic substance of taxable events (including business transactions), and not merely their legal forms.\n\n338.\n\nAlthough Rule VIII was not codified until 1996, Respondent asserts that its underlying principle had been a component of the Peruvian Civil Code for decades. Article 191 of the Civil Code, in particular, provides that the legal effects arising from a transaction lacking in economic substance (i.e., a \"simulated\" transaction) are to be disregarded if those effects harm the rights of third parties.\n\n339.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s description of Rule VIII as a \"seldom-used provision\" of the Peruvian Tax Law, Respondent states that SUNAT has applied, and the Tax Court has confirmed, the principle underlying Rule VIII in numerous cases spanning at least the last forty years. Moreover, Respondent notes, the Tax Court's recent decisions reviewing SUNAT\u2019s application of Rule VIII likewise confirm that the underlying principle requiring transactions to have economic substance (as first reflected in Article 191 of the Civil Code and now set out in Rule VIII) continues to be applied.\n\n**ii) The MRL**\n---------------\n\n340.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant cannot shift the focus of its argument to the Merger Revaluation Law, because economic substance is required not only by Rule VIII but also by the Merger Revaluation Law itself. This is confirmed, Respondent submits, by (i) the structure and framework of the Merger Revaluation Law and (ii) the purposes for which the law was enacted:\n\n\u2022 The structure and framework of the Merger Revaluation Law indicate that the State was willing to sacrifice tax revenues that it would otherwise receive in exchange for corporate mergers that would strengthen the companies undertaking such transactions.\n\n\u2022 The purpose of the Merger Revaluation Law likewise confirms that the law was based on the underlying premise that companies would undertake a real merger in order to claim the tax benefits that it provided in exchange for reorganizing.\n\n341.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that the Merger Revaluation Law had multiple objectives, including, as articulated by Claimant, to \"improve the financial health of companies\" through the revaluation of their assets. Respondent argues, however, that Claimant cannot escape the fact that \"merger or division agreements\" were the means through which the law's objectives - including those cited by Claimant - were to be achieved. Simply put, Respondent says, the 1996 merger did not satisfy the law's objective that the merger be a genuine reorganization involving real companies.\n\n**iii) Motivations for Merger**\n-------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nRespondent does not dispute Claimant's statement that Egenor wished to revalue its assets in order to \"rectify the distortions in the balance sheets.\" Respondent replies, however, that Claimant could have remedied this distortion in the value of its assets through a tax-free voluntary revaluation, as was permitted under Article 252 of Peru's General Law of Corporations (Ley General de Sociedades). Indeed, Respondent observes that this was the precise advice provided by both Luna Victoria-V\u00e1zquez and Deloitte & Touche to Egenor in September 1996 in response to its specific inquiry \"[w]hether it is permissible to carry out the voluntary revaluation of the fixed assets.\"\n\n343.\n\nRespondent submits that Egenor, against the advice of its advisors, chose to avail itself of the Merger Revaluation Law through a simulated merger as a tax-driven alternative means to achieve its stated objective, doubtless because that option offered certain tax benefits that Article 252 did not.\n\n**c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n344.\n\nTo determine whether the Merger Revaluation Assessment violated the guarantee of tax stabilization in the DEI Bermuda LSA, the Tribunal must determine the following issues: (1) was Rule VIII part of the tax regime stabilized for Egenor on July 24, 1996; and (2) if so, was SUNAT\u2019s assessment under Rule VIII consistent with any stabilized interpretation and application of the Merger Revaluation Law in 1996?\n\n345.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that while Rule VIII could properly be invoked by SUNAT to evaluate the legitimacy of transactions for tax purposes, SUNAT violated the guarantee of tax stabilization by using Rule VIII to change the stable interpretation of the MRL that generally prevailed in 1996 and was thus part of the tax regime stabilized for Egenor.\n\n**i) Rule VIII**\n----------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Rule VIII was introduced in April 1996, several months before the date of the Egenor LSA. Arguably then, the tax regime that was stabilized for Egenor, and thus later for DEI Bermuda in respect of Egenor, included the original version of Rule VIII. This original version, by Claimant\u2019s own admission, permitted SUNAT to scrutinize the underlying purpose of a transaction, such as a merger, and to disregard it for tax purposes if it concluded that the transaction was fraudulent.\n\n347.\n\nIn light of this observation, a claim for breach of the guarantee of tax stabilization based on a misuse of the new version of Rule VIII would not be upheld since the new version of Rule VIII was not the one that was stabilized. It seems to the Tribunal that Claimant could only complain that SUNAT had misinterpreted the new version of Rule VIII, but not bring a claim based on such complaint under the tax stabilization guarantee of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n348.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal accepts that both versions of Rule VIII provided SUNAT with the authority to set aside for tax purposes transactions which it concluded were \"simulated\".\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that SUNAT did not violate the DEI Bermuda LSA\u2019s guarantee of tax stabilization merely by invoking Rule VIII.\n\n**ii) The MRL**\n---------------\n\n350.\n\nPart of the stabilized tax regime for Egenor was the MRL, which was passed by Congress in 1994 and extended for annual periods until the end of 1998. The fact that the MRL was stabilized under Peru\u2019s LSA Regime was confirmed, as a general matter, by the Edelnor and Luz del Sur arbitral decisions. As for Egenor\u2019s specific situation, it was agreed by all advisors who considered the matter that the MRL was stabilized under the Egenor LSA. The Tribunal refers here to the due diligence report prepared for the privatization of the 30 Percent Tranche by Estudio Grau, the legal opinion prepared for Egenor by the same law firm on January 5, 1999, and the legal opinion prepared by Miranda & Amado for Duke Energy on September 20, 1999. Indeed, in the case of Egenor, SUNAT did not challenge this conclusion.\n\n351.\n\nClaimant argues that the MRL imposed no prerequisites on the type of companies that could take advantage of the tax benefits of the law. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that it was implicit in the structure, framework and purpose of the MRL that only \"real\" companies, which would be genuinely strengthened by a merger, could avail themselves of the Merger Revaluation Law.\n\n352.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant has discharged its burden of demonstrating that SUNAT\u2019s use of Rule VIII to invalidate the tax consequences of the Egenor merger with Power North violated the stable interpretation or application of the MRL at the time the Egenor LSA was executed.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal comes to its conclusion concerning the stable interpretation and application of the MRL based on its assessment of the expert testimony presented by the parties. The Tribunal found the testimony of Professor de Trazegnies particularly compelling. Professor de Trazegnies testified that it was clear to everyone at the time the MRL was introduced by Congress that \"the actual objective of that law, in keeping with the statements of those who at that time opined on the law, the objective was revaluation, reassessment.\" (Hearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, at p. 1139:15-18) Professor de Trazegnies noted that the law addressed the problems caused by the hyper-inflationary period that gripped Peru between 1985 and 1991.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the following testimony of Professor de Trazegnies from his direct examination at the hearing:\n\nQ. The Revaluation Merger Law was from January 1994, and it was renewed four times by the Peruvian Parliament.\n\nWhat does this fact suggest to you?\n\nA. Well, what this is, it makes it obvious that the government, the Congress, and the country was very happy, very pleased with that merger and revaluation law and the way it was being applied. There was no mystery whatsoever that these mergers were taking place with a view to the revaluation. This has been stated by many, Cesar Luna Victoria, Luis Hernandez, all of those who intervened at that point in time thus recognized. However, that law continued to be extended during four years, which means that its purpose had not yet been fully satisfied and that it was considered that it was a positive end, a good purpose. (Hearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, at p. 1144:4-20)\n\n355.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal refers to the article by Dr. C\u00e9sar Luna Victoria published in Semana Econ\u00f3mica on December 16, 2001 (Exhibit C-l 14), which confirms that the MRL did not impose restrictions or conditions on companies before they were able to avail themselves of the benefits of the law. Dr. Luna Victoria affirms in that article that: \"[...] *the [MRL] never stabilized a period of pre-existence, a minimum capital or a specific number of transactions, as it has done in other cases. If the law did not do so, the company (a paper company or not) had legal pre-existence, and the merger has been legally valid. By way of interpretation, the SUNAT cannot make up the omissions of the law under the same Rule VIII that it invokes\"35*\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the evidence of Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. C\u00e9sar Luna-Victoria, that the quotation in this article was taken out of context.\n\n356.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position, that the MRL had certain implicit requirements that companies had to satisfy before being able to enjoy the benefits of the law, was supported by Prof. Shoschana Zusman. Professor Zusman was not called to testify at the merits hearing, but the Tribunal has considered her two expert reports that were submitted by Respondent. In her Second Report, dated March 2007, Professor Zusman concludes as follows in respect of the MRL:\n\n(ii) Even if Law No. 26283 did not establish requirements for the merger, it was not enough to undergo the formal merger process in order to consider that such merger was valid for tax purposes.\n\n(iii) The merger may not be considered valid if it is carried out with a company that does not have an actual economic reality and if the only purpose of the merger was tax-related, because Law No. 26283 was a promotional law which, precisely because it granted an incentive, required the merger to have economic substance.\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Professor Zusman bases her conclusions on an abstract analysis of what she considers to be the applicable legal principles under Peruvian law, such as the principle of \"self-integration\" and the need to interpret the MRL as a \"promotional\" law (see Professor Zusman Second Report at paras. 6-14). However, the Tribunal finds Professor Zusman\u2019s opinion to be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the MRL, with its wording *(i.e.,* no indication of any special requirements) and, in particular, with the actual interpretation of the MRL that was prevalent at the time when the guarantee of tax stability was granted to Egenor. The Tribunal finds Professor de Trazegnies\u2019 testimony much more compelling, as it refers directly to contemporaneous documents and opinions.\n\n358.\n\nIn any event, Professor Zusman\u2019s opinion was effectively rebutted by the testimony of Professor Talledo, concerning comparable legislation in other jurisdictions. The following is an extract from his direct examination at the hearing:\n\nQ. Professor Shoshanna Zusman states that tax benefits provided for in the Merger Revaluation Law are not to be applied to all sorts of mergers, just to mergers among active companies, and also mergers that help consolidate or increase the trade value or the trade volume of the merger companies.\n\nDo you agree with this position?\n\nA. I don't agree with this. In the statement by Dr. Zusman, it is implicit that 26283 included pre-requirements or conditions for the exemption, but the requirement would be that they have to be companies operating with assets or that had something to integrate or strengthen, and corporations who could also achieve the goals provided for in this regime. In comparative legislation, the conditions and requirements, be they previous or not, for the merger and reorganization of companies, is clearly stated\u2014 clearly stated\u2014and from the legal point of view, those conditions, whether they are legal conditions or conditions that are part of the fact generating tax income or whether they are legal resolutions for that benefit\u2014that is to say, that those requirements as well as more efficiency, et cetera or greater market share were not achieved, none of those requirements\u2014 that is to say, pre-requirements or requirements were established in this law 26283, and we cannot say that the fulfillment of the requirements leads to the enjoyment of the benefits.\n\n(Hearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, at pp. 1226:17-1228:1)\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal also draws support from the testimony of Dr. Javier N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carvallo. Dr. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a partner at Estudio Grau, testified that his law firm was involved in completing some forty mergers under the MRL. He emphasized that the MRL was renewed in successive years until the end of 1998, and that none of the \"implicit\" requirements for which Respondent is now arguing was ever raised as a relevant issue in those other mergers. The Tribunal did not hear or read testimony from any other witnesses contradicting the testimony of Dr. N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that it is not unusual, following a period of hyperinflation of the kind that plagued Peru between 1985 and 1991, that companies should be allowed to revalue their assets tax-free. The book value of the assets, expressed in nominal terms, no longer reflects their actual value in the new currency adopted in the post-hyperinflation era. The re-valued figures are, of course, nominally higher than the old book values, but they do not reflect either any actual increase of value of the assets or any actual income or increase of wealth of the owner of such assets, *i.e.,* the taxpayer. Therefore, in such circumstances, it is reasonable that such revaluations should be tax free.\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that, as a matter of legal or economic policy, the Peruvian Government did not implement a general legal regime that would have permitted revaluations with no tax consequences. Instead, the Peruvian Government allowed such revaluations in the context of corporate reorganizations under the MRL. The Tribunal is convinced that this restricted legal framework of beneficial revaluations clearly gave rise to a general practice in the country of using mergers and spin-offs mainly to revalue assets rather than to actually reorganize companies or corporations.\n\n362.\n\nThe general practice of allowing the MRL to be used in this way was based on a very broad interpretation of the literal terms of Article 1 of the MRL, which required a \"merger or division agreement of any type of legal entity, whether mercantile, civil or cooperative...\" (emphasis added). What was essential was the existence of a merger of \"any type of legal entity\", irrespective of whether the sole purpose of the merger was the revaluation of assets in order to claim the tax benefits associated with it. According to the normal and widespread practice at the time, \"merger\" meant a formal legal act through which two or more companies joined together to form a new one, without regard to the underlying economic reality of the transaction.\n\n363.\n\nIn other words, at the time of the Egenor LSA, the prevailing interpretation of the MRL was that a formal merger was sufficient to invoke the tax benefits offered by this law. It was this interpretation that was stabilized by the LSA.\n\n364.\n\nWhen SUNAT concluded in November 2001 that the Egenor-PowerNorth merger lacked economic reality, and thus invalidated its tax benefits under the MRL, SUNAT implicitly gave the word \"merger\" a meaning that was different from the meaning that prevailed in 1996, and which was thus the stabilized meaning under the Egenor LSA.\n\n365.\n\nTherefore, based on the totality of evidence, the Tribunal concludes that SUNAT\u2019s use of Rule VIII in 2001 to disallow the tax benefits of the Egenor-PowerNorth merger constituted a change in the stable pre-existing interpretation of the MRL.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Merger Revaluation Assessment constitutes a violation of the guarantee of tax stabilization.\n\n**3. Breach of Good Faith (Doctrine of** ***Actos Propios)?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n367.\n\nClaimant alleges that the Government of Peru:\n\n\u2022 approved the 1996 merger and the manner in which it would be concluded;\n\n\u2022 acknowledged that a primary reason for the merger was for Egenor to avail itself of the Merger Revaluation Benefits;\n\n\u2022 ratified the merger through Electroper\u00fa\u2019s shareholder vote;\n\n\u2022 ratified the merger through a series of resolutions issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines;\n\n\u2022 failed to mention any possibility of forthcoming or latent tax liability during negotiations with Duke Energy;\n\n\u2022 confirmed the propriety of the merger in connection with the sale of its 30 Percent Tranche;\n\n\u2022 commanded a higher price from Duke Energy by representing Egenor as a company for which the Merger Revaluation Law was stabilized; and\n\n\u2022 benefited financially from the merger.\n\n368.\n\nGiven these actions and representations, Claimant submits that Respondent is estopped from invalidating the merger for tax purposes.\n\n369.\n\nClaimant submits that the Government cannot avoid the consequences of its inconsistent conduct based on the principle of separation of powers, as Respondent would suggest. SUNAT, COPRI, CONADE, CEPRI-ELP and the Ministry of Energy and Mines are all interrelated Government agencies. As such, *vis-\u00e0-vis* the investor, they are indivisible, and in the eyes of the foreign investor, their actions must be deemed the actions of the State.\n\n370.\n\nClaimant notes that Egenor\u2019s by-laws made it clear that asset transfers and interested party transactions required a \"favourable vote\" of 85 percent of the company\u2019s Board of Directors, thus necessitating the approval of Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives, and thereby of the government.\n\n371.\n\nWith respect to Electroper\u00fa, Claimant argues that:\n\n\u2022 Electroper\u00fa\u2019s actions as shareholder, such as whether it would vote for or against actions proposed by Egenor\u2019s Board of Directors, were firmly preordained by the Government of Peru, pursuant to Articles 15 and 21 of Supreme Decree 027-90-MIPRE, the regulations generally applicable to state-owned companies;\n\n\u2022 Electroper\u00fa\u2019s actions were not, as Respondent suggests, that of a \"private company\" operating under primarily commercial conditions in a predominantly commercial market, with state ownership being merely an insignificant and incidental attribute. Its actions were clearly defined by a distinctive and incontrovertible \"governmental\" purpose; and\n\n\u2022 Even assuming, *arguendo,* that Electroper\u00fa was not performing any \"governmental\" function *per se,* the Tribunal can *still* find that Electroper\u00fa\u2019s actions were binding on the State based on the sole fact of Government *control.*\n\n372.\n\nClaimant contends that, despite their proclamations to the contrary, Mr. Miranda and Mr. S\u00e1nchez clearly viewed Electroper\u00fa\u2019s 30 percent shareholding in Egenor as the Government\u2019s shares, as evidenced by numerous references to the State\u2019s shares, which are found in Egenor Board or Shareholders\u2019 Meeting Minutes. Moreover, pointing to their resignation letter, Claimant submits that both Mr. Manuel Su\u00e1rez Mendoza and Mr. Victor Guevara Pezo, who were appointed by Electroper\u00fa to succeed Mr. Gast\u00f3n Miranda and Mr. Alfredo Montesinos as Egenor Directors, unquestionably understood that they served on Egenor\u2019s Board on behalf of the Peruvian Government.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n373.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant\u2019s claim that Peru breached its obligation of good faith under Peruvian law is entirely premised on unfounded factual assertions, from which meritless legal conclusions are drawn. Respondent specifically denies that Peru in fact made such statements or took such actions.\n\n374.\n\nAs a general matter, Respondent contends that:\n\n\u2022 There cannot be a contradiction between Electroper\u00fa's conduct as a shareholder of Egenor and SUNAT\u2019s assessment of DEI Egenor for tax underpayment because they are separate entities.\n\n\u2022 A sophisticated investor such as Claimant cannot claim to be unfamiliar with the well-recognized principle that a national tax service cannot be bound by the actions of a separate Governmental entity. In the United States, Duke Energy\u2019s home jurisdiction, this rule was settled over 6 years ago by the US Supreme Court. Other jurisdictions have taken a similar view (Canada, Mexico).\n\n375.\n\nFurthermore, in reply to Claimant\u2019s arguments based on the approval of the Egenor merger by its shareholders, Respondent asserts that it was not the Peruvian State that was shareholder of Egenor, but Electroper\u00fa. With respect to Electroper\u00fa, Respondent argues that:\n\n\u2022 Electroper\u00fa is a private law corporation with its own legal standing. Electroper\u00fa is governed by the General Law of Corporations Law and by express provision of that law, Electroper\u00fa lacks power of *ius imperium.* This means that Claimant cannot succeed in labeling Electroper\u00fa\u2019s votes as sovereign acts of the Government of Peru.\n\n\u2022 The act of a state-owned company, acting as a commercial actor *(acta jure gestionis),* and not as a sovereign authority *(acta jure imperri),* cannot be regarded as an organ of the tax administration and is thus not authorized to interpret or apply tax laws. Still less can it preclude their interpretation and application by authorized state organs.\n\n\u2022 International law also draws a clear distinction between a state and a corporate entity owned by that state.\n\n\u2022 The representative of Electroper\u00fa did not receive instructions from the Government of Peru. Under Peruvian law, Electroper\u00fa did not require such instructions to decide how it would vote its shares in Egenor.\n\n\u2022 Egenor\u2019s amended by-laws provided that certain significant corporate actions required a vote of at least 85 percent of the members of the Board of Directors (and therefore the support of both Electroper\u00fa-appointed Directors). But that fact did not transform the commercial nature of the Electroper\u00fa-appointed Directors\u2019 actions on the board into governmental action attributable to the State, much less into a pronouncement on tax matters over which SUNAT had exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\u2022 Electroper\u00fa\u2019s approval of the merger between Egenor and Power North at the General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting was by no means an act of the State but rather an act decided by the directors of a State-owned company subject to private law. The law required that Electroper\u00fa, and not the State, provide written instructions on how to vote Electroper\u00fa\u2019s minority shareholding to Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representative at the Egenor General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting.\n\n\u2022 Claimant mischaracterized a statement made by an Electroper\u00fa-appointed Director, Mr. Gast\u00f3n Miranda, during a meeting of Egenor\u2019s Board of Directors, to argue that the Directors \"were well aware of their central role in the State\u2019s ongoing privatization process.\" According to the meeting minutes, Mr. Miranda stated that \"the Republic of Peru, represented by Electroper\u00fa, wanted to have an attractive quotation of Egenor\u2019s stock on the stock exchange...\" Claimant\u2019s assertion that Mr. Miranda \"directly represented the State\" - and purportedly bound the State in the latter\u2019s exercise of sovereign authority - simply does not follow from the \"fact that [Mr. Miranda] spoke about the State\u2019s indirect interest in the good business performance of Nor Per\u00fa-Egenor.\"\n\n376.\n\nWith respect to CONADE, Respondent argues that:\n\n\u2022 CONADE did not vet or approve the 1996 merger;\n\n\u2022 In any event, such an approval could not bind SUNAT and it therefore cannot be reasonably relied on by the taxpayer as a guarantee that the taxpayer will not be audited and assessed by the tax authority.\n\n\u2022 Putative \"approval\" from CONADE does not constrain SUNAT\u2019s authority to audit and assess. As a factual matter, several state-owned companies that, unlike Electroper\u00fa in relation to Egenor, do act pursuant to CONADE\u2019s instructions have been regularly assessed by SUNAT.\n\n377.\n\nWith respect to CEPRI-ELP, Respondent argues that:\n\n\u2022 CEPRI-ELP could not and did not instruct Electroper\u00fa to approve Egenor\u2019s financial statements or the 1996 merger. Article 9 of the Privatization Law does not grant CEPRI-ELP the authority to issue \"directions and instructions\" to Egenor outside the context of a privatization process. For CEPRI-ELP the Egenor privatization process was limited to the sale of the 60 percent interest.\n\n378.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that under international law, which Claimant has asserted is applicable, Government actions are accorded a presumption of regularity. This is particularly true when, as here, a claimant has accused a state of acting in bad faith, an assertion which must be proven by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" [Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 64]\n\n**c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n379.\n\nIn the previous section, the Tribunal determined that the Merger Revaluation Assessment constituted a beach of the guarantee of tax stabilization under the DEI Bermuda LSA. Having found Respondent liable on that basis, the Tribunal need not consider Claimant\u2019s alternative grounds for liability, including breach of the doctrine of *actos propios* or good faith. The Tribunal nevertheless feels compelled, having heard a substantial amount of evidence and argument on this point, to set out its views on the issue.\n\n380.\n\nBy contrast to its conclusion concerning the actions and representations of various Government actors in respect of the depreciation rate applicable to the fixed assets transferred to Egenor by Electroper\u00fa, the Tribunal has come to the view that the actions and representations of the various State actors who participated in the process leading up to and including the merger of Egenor and PowerNorth in 1996, as well as the process of completing the privatization of Egenor to Duke in 1999, have legal effect. Indeed, the conduct of the various State actors confirms that, at the time of the merger, and up to Duke\u2019s investment in Egenor, the prevailing interpretation of the MRL was that all that was required in order to enjoy its tax benefits was a formal merger.\n\n381.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the analysis of the *actos propios* issue comes down to four fundamental questions: (i) did the representatives of Electroper\u00fa and of the various State agencies involved in the privatization have full information about the nature of the merger and its tax implications?; (ii) did Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives unequivocally support the merger and the manner in which it would be concluded, and was it reasonable for Dominion (and later Duke) to interpret that support as coming from the State itself?; (iii) did the representatives of the various State agencies involved in the privatization unequivocally support the merger and the manner in which it would be concluded?; and (iv) assuming the answer to questions (i)-(iii) is, in each case, affirmative, is the Merger Revaluation Assessment nevertheless immunized from scrutiny under the doctrine of *actos propios* based on the Respondent\u2019s defense that only SUNAT has authority over tax matters within Peru, and therefore representations and support from any other State agencies or entities are irrelevant?.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal takes each question in turn.\n\n**i) Information about the Merger and its Tax Implications**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal considers whether the representatives of Electroper\u00fa and of the various State agencies involved in the privatization had full information about the nature of the merger and its tax implications.\n\n384.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is ample evidence to show that the Electroper\u00fa-appointed Directors who sat on Egenor\u2019s Board, as well as members of CEPRI-ELP (including Mr. Alfageme, CEPRI-ELP\u2019s legal advisor) received information regarding the merger in the form of draft meeting minutes, financial statements and the Price Waterhouse valuation report well before the merger took place.\n\n385.\n\nThe relevant minutes of the Egenor Board of Directors\u2019 meeting (November 13 and November 25, 1996) explicitly evidence that the Board, which included Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives, had full knowledge of the fact that a primary reason for the merger was for Egenor to avail itself of the Merger Revaluation Benefits. Indeed, it is pointed out in each set of minutes that the revaluation is based on the MRL.\n\n386.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent has admitted that Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who was Chairman of Electroper\u00fa's Board of Directors and represented Electroper\u00fa's minority interest in Egenor at the shareholders' meetings, received the detailed technical, financial, and legal information and analyses provided by the company's professional management and legal advisor, who recommended the merger of the two companies. Respondent made the admission in arguing that Mr. S\u00e1nchez relied on that information without forming an independent view that Claimant could reasonably rely on.\n\n387.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the Tribunal concludes that the representatives of Electroper\u00fa and of the various State agencies involved in the privatization had full and complete information about the nature of the merger and its tax implications.\n\n**ii) The Merger and Electroper\u00fa**\n----------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal considers whether Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives on the Egenor Board unequivocally supported the merger and the manner in which it would be concluded, and whether it was reasonable for Dominion (and later Duke) to interpret that support as coming from the State itself.\n\n389.\n\nAs noted earlier in the factual background, Egenor\u2019s Board of Directors approved the merger of Egenor with Power North on November 25, 1996. Two days later, on November 27, 1996, the merger also received a favourable vote at the general meeting of Egenor\u2019s shareholders.\n\n390.\n\nIt is not contested by Respondent that, at the Board meeting, a vote in favour of the merger was cast by Mr. Gast\u00f3n Miranda and Mr. Alfredo Montesinos, the two representatives of Electroper\u00fa. Nor is it contested that, at the shareholders\u2019 meeting, a vote in favour of the merger was cast by Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the representative of Electroper\u00fa.\n\n391.\n\nWhat is contested by Respondent is that the respective votes of these individuals could reasonably be relied upon by Dominion (and now Claimant) for the proposition that the State itself (and not just Electroper\u00fa) approved the merger.\n\n392.\n\nRespondent argues that the Peruvian State was not the shareholder in Egenor; rather, Electroper\u00fa, a company subject to the General Law of Corporations, was the shareholder. In support of Respondent\u2019s position, Mr. S\u00e1nchez explains in his witness statements that he was not acting as a Government representative, and that he based his decisions strictly on commercial considerations.\n\n393.\n\nConsidering all of the evidence presented to it, the Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that the State - through the support demonstrated for the merger by Electroper\u00fa - did approve the merger, and the manner in which it was conducted.\n\n394.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives did not vote for the merger in a void, but rather in context of the by-laws of Egenor. Egenor\u2019s by-laws, dated May 10, 1996, were purposely amended by CEPRI-ELP and provided to potential investors on May 22, 1996. The amended by-laws mandated that certain significant corporate actions undertaken by Egenor following the 60 percent privatization had to be approved by the Electroper\u00fa-appointed Directors of the company.\n\n395.\n\nSpecifically, Article Forty-Two of the amended by-laws provided that any decision made in relation to, *inter alia,* disposal of property worth more than US $30 million, or transactions between Egenor and companies wholly or partially owned by the Class A Shareholders (both of which were corporate actions undertaken as part of the 1996 merger), \"must be made at the decision of at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the Members of the Board of Directors....\"\n\n396.\n\nGiven that in 1996 Electroper\u00fa held 40 percent of the seats on the Board, an opposing vote by either of its two appointed Directors, Mr. Gast\u00f3n Miranda or Mr. Alfredo Montesinos, would have been enough to block the merger with Power North.\n\n397.\n\nThe preamble to the Egenor by-laws reflects that they were amended in order \"to grant to the shares belonging to the State certain control powers through qualified majorities in order to make certain decisions at the General Shareholders meetings and on the Board of Directors....\" On this basis, among others discussed below, it is reasonable for the Tribunal to conclude that CEPRI-ELP (presided by Mr. S\u00e1nchez) viewed Electroper\u00fa\u2019s shareholding in Egenor as the Government\u2019s shareholding.\n\n398.\n\nThe Egenor by-laws were drafted to reflect the requirements of the Privatization Law, as well as Law No. 29248 and its Regulations (approved by Supreme Decree No. 027-90 -MIPRE, dated April 2, 1990). Pursuant to these laws, the Peruvian Government was anything but a \"private\" shareholder; rather, it was under very specific obligations to exercise control over the operation of all companies in which it had holdings, including Egenor.\n\n399.\n\nElectroper\u00fa was required under Peruvian law to act in accordance with the directions and instructions of CEPRI-ELP. Article 9 of the Privatization Law required that \"companies subject to the process of the promotion of private investments shall be obligated to the following, subject to the personal liability of their Directors: (a) to carry out the decisions of the Special Committee pertaining to such process in the company;\" and \"(b) to provide the representatives of the Special Committee any assistance necessary for carrying out their duties, in keeping with the principles of veracity, efficiency or celerity.\" Moreover, Article 9 states clearly that, \"in the event that the State is a minority shareholder in a company included in the process [in this case, Egenor], the obligations referred to in this article shall apply to the holders of the State\u2019s shares in such Company.\"\n\n400.\n\nDespite Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s testimony that \"my participation in CEPRI-ELP had no bearing whatsoever on how I cast my votes as the representative of... Electroper\u00fa,\" the fact that he was appointed to the Boards of both Electroper\u00fa and CEPRI on the same day, and, some time later, appointed as Chairman of Electroper\u00fa and CEPRI on the same day, was not a mere coincidence. Rather, the Tribunal finds that it was consistent with the requirements of the Privatization Law for Mr. S\u00e1nchez to occupy those positions simultaneously: he was thereby able to make decisions with a unified objective, as he did with regard to the 1996 merger.\n\n401.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Fritz Du Bois testified on this point. The Tribunal accepts Mr. Du Bois\u2019 evidence rather than the categorical denials of Mr. S\u00e1nchez, which the Tribunal does not find credible:\n\nQ. Did you find Mr. [S\u00e1nchez] Gamarra's testimony credible?\n\nA. Well, it's difficult to understand how somebody who had both roles, head of Electroper\u00fa and head of the CEPRI, could say that one had [no] relation with the other. One would have assumed that he was always acting together.\n\nAnd as I already mentioned, that 30 percent continued to be shares of the State, continued to be within the privatization process, and will have been normal for somebody participating in a general shareholders' meeting to have had instructions either from the main holding company, the CONADE, FONAFE, in those days probably CONADE in 1996, or through the board of Electropeni. I think in this case the same person taking all those roles maybe was assumed that the instructions were basically posted.\n\nI find it difficult to believe it could be completely separate from his overall main role within the electricity sector privatization process.\n\nQ. Thank you.\n\nNow, in addition to testifying that he never received instructions from CEPRI-ELP on how to act in Nor Peru-Egenor's general shareholder meetings\u2014and I gave the previous paragraph reference which was to the first affidavit\u2014he again testifies to that effect in his second affidavit at paragraph 15. Mr. Gamarra has testified that he never received any instructions regarding his voting of the State's shares from CONADE, and here I'm referring to his second affidavit which appears under Tab 6, so I would like you to turn to Tab 6.\n\nA. Um-hmm.\n\nQ. And I would like you to turn to paragraph 16.\n\nA. Um-hmm.\n\nQ. Now, in respect of Mr. S\u00e1nchez Gamarra's testimony in paragraph 16 that he never received instructions from CONADE, do you find his testimony credible?\n\nA. Once again, the norm says that CONADE is the overall holder of all State shares, and from my experience certainly in the case of Petroperu, for example, which had a similar situation with a 30 percent holding in a new company that was created out of the privatization process, we always coordinated with CONADE the position as not only with CONADE, but also with separate concern as the overall objective was that sooner or later those shares would be sold and those proceeds would go to the treasury.\n\nSo, I don't know if he did or didn't receive instructions, obviously, but he should have received some kind of guidance or at least have coordinated adequately the position.\n\nI had participated in shareholders' meetings once again Banco Continental, where we were a 30 percent\u2014had a 30 percent participation, and I got instructions as to how to vote, and those instructions were given to me by the holding company, you know, the holding entity, OIOE, the replacement of CONADE.\n\nSo, my experience was there had to be some kind of procedure. It couldn't be just left to the\u2014well, free initiative of a person. It was clearly a procedure by which the State coordinated its position where the companies would have had a stake.\n\nQ. You've testified that you have been on the boards of several companies that were in the process of being privatized.\n\nCould you describe for the Tribunal's benefit what you viewed as your responsibilities with respect to the State's interests and whether you had to seek approval before taking a vote.\n\nA. I was represented in the State in several companies. One was Petroperu, for example, a hundred percent owned company, but which was part of the privatization process and sold. An important operation was La Pampilla, included a new company where we had a 30 percent -we kept the 30 percent minority shareholder, which is already now sold.\n\nI also participated on behalf of the State in two companies where we had minority shareholding, which was Telefonica and Banco Continental, where basically my role was to assist the privatization process until those shares were eventually sold.\n\nIn the case of shareholders' meetings, I always participated. At times I participated with reading instructions, and in the case of day-to-day business of the board, I had permanent contact with the people concerned, basically the people involved in the privatization process, the CEPRI, to make certain that we were going all in the same line, and were going to reach our objective of selling those shares as soon as possible and at the best possible price. That's how I\u2014that's where I was instructed when I was designated in those boards, and I tried to fulfill that during the time I was in the boards.36\n\nHearing Transcript, May 9, 2007, at pp. 337:5-341:14.\n\n402.\n\nArticle 15 of Supreme Decree No. 027-90-MIPRE provides that, \"In order to participate in a General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting or the corresponding highest corporate organ, the State shall give to the company which holds the shares, the credentials of the authorized representative and clear and written instructions. Such representative may not alter such instructions or vote in a manner contrary to the mandate contained therein.\"\n\n403.\n\nPursuant to Article 21 of this Decree, Mr. S\u00e1nchez, and later Mr. Jes\u00fas Beoutis, were the \"authorized representative[s]\" within the meaning of Article 15 by virtue of the fact that each was \"the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company [i.e., Electroper\u00fa] or Business Group that owns the shares\" of Egenor. Indeed, both Mr. S\u00e1nchez and Mr. Beoutis attended Egenor Shareholders\u2019 Meetings and voted Electroper\u00fa\u2019s shares at those meetings pursuant to Article 21 of Supreme Decree 027-90-MIPRE, as evidenced by each and every set of minutes from those meetings in which they participated. Importantly, Article 21 expressly declares that \"the provisions of Article 15 of these Regulations applies to the present article.\" Consequently, it is clear that Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s participation in Egenor Shareholders\u2019 Meetings was governed by Article 15 of the decree in question.\n\n404.\n\nNowhere in Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s witness statement does he ever deny receiving such instructions.\n\n405.\n\nAs one of Claimant\u2019s counsel said in his opening statement, the evidence is convincing that Electroper\u00fa was \"doing the State\u2019s work.\"37 The Tribunal agrees.\n\nHearing Transcript, May 8, 2007, at p. 79:19.\n\n406.\n\nFurther evidence that Electroper\u00fa was \"doing the State\u2019s work\" relates to the period when Duke enters the picture.\n\n407.\n\nFollowing the repeal of the Merger Revaluation Law at the end of 1998, four electricity companies (i.e., Egenor, Edegel, Edelnor and Luz del Sur) formed the view that the repeal could not apply to them because of their respective LSAs. In February 1999, Electroper\u00fa, while still a shareholder of certain of these companies, including Egenor, specifically requested instructions from the Ministry of Economy and Finance as to what position it should take on the issue. A letter from Mr. Jes\u00fas Beoutis Ledesma, Chairman of Electroper\u00fa, to the Minister of Economy and Finance, dated February 25, 1999, states that, \"given the importance of the subject in question, we request your interpretation of the problem in order to define a position to take as representatives of the State\u2019s shares in the privatized companies of the electric sector.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n408.\n\nIn addition, shortly after Duke Energy\u2019s acquisition of Egenor in 1999, Messrs. Manuel Su\u00e1rez and Victor Guevara, the Electroper\u00fa-appointed Directors at that time, sent Egenor\u2019s President, Mr. Mark T. Cox, a formal letter of resignation from the Egenor Board. In the letter, they expressly confirmed that they were appointed to Egenor\u2019s Board for the purpose of representing the Government\u2019s interests; they said: \"we hereby advise you that we were appointed as directors of EGENOR S.A.A. as representatives of the State\u2019s shares.\"38 (Emphasis added).\n\nLetter from Mr. Manuel Su\u00e1rez Mendoza and Mr. Victor Guevara Pezo to Mr. Mark T. Cox IV, dated November 12, 1999, Exhibit C-165.\n\n409.\n\nElectroper\u00fa\u2019s actions were not, as Respondent suggests, that of a \"private company\" operating under primarily commercial conditions in a predominantly commercial market, with State ownership being merely an insignificant and incidental attribute. Its actions were clearly defined by a distinctive and incontrovertible \"governmental\" purpose.\n\n410.\n\nEverything that Electroper\u00fa did within the context of the privatization of Egenor was at the direction and on behalf of the Government. Indeed, Egenor\u2019s by-laws, the Privatization Agreement, and the Privatization Law all clearly indicate that Electroper\u00fa was one of the Government\u2019s agents in the privatization of Egenor.\n\n411.\n\nSpecifically, as already noted, the Egenor by-laws contained \"qualified majority\" provisions to ensure that the Government, through Electroper\u00fa, retained a certain level of control. Additionally, the Privatization Agreement mandated that Dominion cooperate with Electroper\u00fa and any other Governmental entities necessary to effectuate the Government\u2019s 30 percent privatization. Most importantly, the Privatization Law mandated that Electroper\u00fa implement CEPRI-ELP\u2019s privatization initiatives vis-\u00e0-vis Egenor and other privatized companies.\n\n412.\n\nIn this context, it is clear why the Government supported the merger. As Mr. Miranda himself said during a meeting of Egenor\u2019s Board of Directors: \"the Republic of Peru, represented by Electroper\u00fa, wanted to have an attractive quotation of Egenor\u2019s stock on the stock exchange...\"39 The Electroper\u00fa-appointed Directors understood that their role was to safeguard and foster the State\u2019s 30 percent shares for later privatization, thus supporting a merger that increased the value of those shares on the stock exchange.\n\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Meeting Minutes, dated March 13, 1997 at p. 1, Exhibit C-048.\n\n413.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it was reasonable for Dominion (and later Duke) to interpret the support for the merger from Electroper\u00fa\u2019s representatives as coming from the State itself.\n\n**iii) The Merger and Various State Agencies**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal considers whether, apart from Electroper\u00fa, representatives of the various State agencies involved in the privatization unequivocally supported the merger and the manner in which it was to be concluded.\n\n415.\n\nClaimant asserts that the approval for Electroper\u00fa to vote its shares in favour of the 1996 merger was provided by the CONADE, a separate Peruvian Government agency established to serve as a holding company for all companies in which the Government holds a stake. CONADE appointed certain directors to sit on Egenor\u2019s Board.\n\n416.\n\nClaimant also submits that Electroper\u00fa\u2019s approval of the merger was \"blessed\" by CEPRI-ELP. Claimant points to the minutes of the Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, which state that the merger \"had been discussed with our shareholder ELECTROPER\u00da S.A. and coordinated with CEPRI, and had earned their backing.\"\n\n417.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant fails to show how the simple fact that Egenor forwarded information regarding the 1996 merger to CEPRI-ELP could possibly constitute CEPRI\u2019s approval of the merger. Moreover, Respondent says, even if one were to assume that Messrs. Alfageme and Delboy had received such documents, it would not prove that CEPRI-ELP approved the merger. Finally, Respondent argues that even if the 1996 merger could be said to fall within the scope of the privatization of Egenor, Article 8 of Decree 874 states that all CEPRI approvals and decisions must be \"adopted by a Resolution of the Committee,\" and no such Resolution exists.\n\n418.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent notes that the quoted language from the meeting minutes does not describe a statement made at Egenor\u2019s General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. Rather, it is a reference to a statement made by Mr. Cox to Egenor\u2019s Board of Directors. Respondent points out that while Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, President of CEPRI-ELP, participated in the Shareholders' Meeting, no member of the Board of Directors was a member of CEPRI-ELP. Therefore, Respondent concludes, there was no one from CEPRI-ELP at Egenor\u2019s Board of Directors Meeting who could have stood up and contradicted Mr. Cox when he made his statement.\n\n419.\n\nAt first blush, Respondent\u2019s arguments appear to have some merit. They have been carefully considered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal concludes, however, that they are plainly rebutted by the evidence. On the issue of support for the merger by CEPRI-ELP and other State agencies, the Tribunal finds the testimony of several of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, namely Pastor Narron, Mr. Cox and Dr. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, most compelling.\n\n420.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, Pastor Narron described what he perceived as the State\u2019s approval for the merger. From his perspective, the various Government agencies (CEPRI, COPRI, the Ministry of Energy) and Electroper\u00fa unequivocally supported the merger and the manner in which the merger was implemented. He said:\n\nThey [government officials] endorsed it through their directors, they were quite happy to endorse it, and as shareholders, Pedro S\u00e1nchez and those others that worked with him in certain capacities, Alfageme and Jean Delboy, they were all ecstatic, as I said earlier, about this.40\n\nHearing Transcript, May 11, 2007, at p. 960:14-19.\n\n421.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal also heard from Mr. Cox, who became Chairman of the Board of Egenor after Dominion\u2019s acquisition, and who therefore led the Board at the time of the merger. The Tribunal found Mr. Cox to be a very credible witness. Mr. Cox testified as follows:\n\nQ. How did the idea of merging Nor Peru-Egenor with Power North come about?\n\nA. Well, it emerged, I guess, in part, with the work of the staff and people working in Nor Peru-Egenor as well as amongst directors and in consultations with the government. Clearly, we had the examples before us of similar transactions that had been done with Electrolima and two other electric distribution companies, and as we began to study on the one hand the issues of the revaluation and on the other the office problems and how to finance that and put it all together, people began to say, well, gee, maybe this is what we should do that would make the most sense of all, so I think staff began to look at it. The lawyers began to look at it. The accountants began to look at it. We had already hired some experts to go out and make studies of the assets of Egenor that were subject to revaluation, and they, you know, were working on that part of the puzzle, and then, of course, there was a great deal of consultation with the government and amongst the directors.\n\nWe included the government for a variety of different reasons. One, they owned, still, 30 percent of the company and were, of course, on the Board of Directors, but we were appreciative of the fact that although Egenor, our acquisition of 60 percent of Egenor, for us, was primarily an economic event, in the context of government of Peru, the privatization of Egenor was not just an economic event, it was a political event, and it was something that, you know, in whatever we did, you know, there was a lot of focus on us. This was part of a major privatization program, and so we wanted to make sure ministers or other government officials, Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, others, would be in a position to respond, should a newspaper start talking about, well, this privatized company getting a new office space or this or that or the other.\n\nAnd upon an ongoing basis we consulted with them as well, so we went forward together and ultimately designed a process which ended in the approval at the Board of Nor Peru-Egenor and ultimately the shareholders of Nor Peru-Egenor and the merger.\n\nQ. Mr. Cox, could you take a look at Claimant's Exhibit 146, C-146, which is key exhibits volume C7. Hopefully you will see there a memo of November 22, 1996. In particular, if you take a look at points one and two there.\n\nWhat materials were circulated to the government in advance of the merger?\n\nA. Well, this letter, this note is November 22, so this is\u2014this is toward the end of the process, but as you can see from this particular memo, given the complexities of the transactions, the lawyers had done some draft minutes of an Egenor board of directors' meeting which outlined all the details of the transaction. I think somewhere in these documents there are probably copies of those.\n\nAnd they were rather complex, and then there were draft minutes of special shareholders' meetings as well that included financial statements and the revaluation by PriceWaterhouse\u2014all sorts of details.\n\nAnd it was very important that we get these out early to all parties, and particularly to the government so that they would have time to carefully analyze them and then guidance could be provided or information could be synthesized and provided to the appropriate parties.\n\nSo, you can see, for example, that the copies of this went to Dr. Alfageme who, in addition to his position as a legal advisor at CEPRI, was also an alternate director for Mr. Montesinos and Nor Peru-Egenor. And Mr. Delboy also.\n\nAllow these folks and their people to study these issues, make any final comments as to deal, structure and the like so that those could all be put in final order before the Board of Directors and the government as well as our directors at the level of the board of Egenor approves them, and when we looked at the shareholders' meeting where the shareholders of Nor Peru-Egenor approved them, and in that particular instance the government was represented by Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez. He would want to have his people make absolutely certain that all the documents were in order.\n\nSo, it was a comprehensive set of documents that were prepared. They were prepared in draft to permit changes, corrections and the like that might come in from either the technicians at CEPRI or Electropeni or, for that matter, from Dominion and the like to make sure that everything was in order before we finalized the transactions and give the technicians in the ministries as well as Electropeni and Dominion time to brief the people who were going to have to make the final decisions so we could intelligently know what we were approving and approve it appropriately.\n\nQ. Mr. Cox, I would like you to take a look at C-46, Claimant's Exhibit C-046, which is a copy of Board minutes of Nor Peru-Egenor. I think the page should be open to November 25th, 1996, minutes.\n\nA. Yes, I have them here.\n\nQ. And there in paragraph one is a statement at the end of the first paragraph under point 1, \"The above-mentioned plan, meaning revaluation of assets and merger, had been discussed with our shareholder ELECTROPER\u00da S.A. and coordinated with CEPRI and had earned their backing.\"\n\nNow, in this arbitration, Peru's witnesses, in particular Mr. Alfageme, have criticized that statement. What's your reaction to that?\n\nA. Well the statement was made to the Board by me, and it was meant to, in summary, really reflect the series of consultations that had taken place at various levels, exchanges of documents and ideas with members of the government, with Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, with a lot of his advisors, with people in Electroper\u00fa, with people at CEPRI. as well as within Dominion, so that we could reach an appropriate and correct structure for the transaction.\n\nAnd in every instance, we had the full support of the people involved at CEPRI and Electroper\u00fa. And ultimately this was demonstrated quite clearly by the fact that directors from the government as well as Dominion on the Board of Nor Peru-Egenor unanimously approved this proposal, and then we put it to the shareholders, and the shareholders unanimously approved it, and the shareholders in the case of the Government of Peru shares were represented by Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who was a very senior official, and by me on behalf of Dominion.\n\nSo, the ultimate facts speak to the correctness of this statement.41\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nHearing Transcript, May 10, 2007, at pp. 822:6-828:9.\n\n422.\n\nDr. N\u00fa\u00f1ez also testified in a convincing manner about the perception that he, as Secretary of the Board of Egenor, had formed concerning the State\u2019s support for the merger and the manner in which it was being undertaken:\n\nQ. You also say in paragraph six of your first witness statement that Mr. S\u00e1nchez, Chairman of Electropeni and Chairman of CEPRI-ELP, told you personally about why the State was agreeing to the merger. Please, can you tell us where that exchange took place and exactly what he told you.\n\nA. I recall clearly that Mr. S\u00e1nchez was, indeed, invited to participate, was convened to the general meeting of stockholders of Egenor which was held, the meetings at the offices of Estudio Grau on that very day in 1996.\n\nBefore the meeting, when I came out to greet Mr. Pedro S\u00e1nchez and later after the meeting and throughout the meeting itself, I had a chance to converse with him and to exchange ideas as to how this process was actually taking place, and he was extremely enthusiastic in his comments about the adequacy of this revaluation merger because it enormously facilitated the success of the Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana project within which the State would be selling off the balance of the stock that it had in its hand of privatized industry. Not just Egenor, but other companies of the electric sector and even of other sectors as well.\n\nSo, the position by Mr. S\u00e1nchez in this case was one of enthusiastic support toward the project.\n\n[...]\n\nQ. Did he tell you this statement in his capacity as head of CEPRI-ELP, or in his capacity as head of Electroper\u00fa?\n\nA. I would say that in his\u2014twofold, in his double capacity as President for CEPRI, the Special Committee for privatization of Electroper\u00fa, as well as in his capacity as President of Electroper\u00fa. In the first case, as a high-level official in charge of the success of the privatization program; and, in the second case, as President of the stock holding company of Egenor, which was the beneficiary of the issuance of the new liberated stock that the company produced as a consequence of the revaluation of its assets and the merger.42\n\nHearing Transcript, May 11, 2007, at pp. 1042:10-1043:13 and p. 1044:4-17.\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds the testimony of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Daniel Amado on this point helpful:\n\nQ. Thank you.\n\nNow, let's turn back to the due diligence that was done in connection with the '99 acquisition of Egenor.\n\nIn the context of that due diligence, what significance did you draw from the votes of Mr. S\u00e1nchez Gamarra, who was at the time the Chairman of CEPRI-ELP and of Electroper\u00fa, approving the merger between Nor Peru-Egenor and Power North that had taken place in 1996?\n\nA. Well, in fact, this was what was in order in keeping with the law. Mr. S\u00e1nchez was the President of Electroper\u00fa, and it was up to him to, indeed, take the vote regarding this type of a situation. But, indeed, Mr. S\u00e1nchez, a person who was one of the actual architects of the privatization process in Peru, particularly in the energy sector, and considering further his official position as President of CEPRI Electropeni, so he was part of the COPRI structure. Obviously, there was an additional assurance for everyone.43\n\nHearing Transcript, May 10, 2007, at pp. 618:14\u2014619:12.\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that public notification of the merger was published in El Comercio, El Peruano, and El Tiempo and a 30-day protest period was provided in accordance with the requirements set forth in the General Law of Corporations. No Governmental entity complained about the merger.\n\n425.\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy that various rights, concessions and permits that were previously granted by the Government were assigned, with no protest whatsoever, in favour of the new company, Egenor S.A., as part of the merger process. Moreover, at Duke Energy\u2019s request, the Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the assignment of the Egenor LSA in favour of Egenor S.A. in 1999, making explicit reference to the merger.\n\n426.\n\nOn the basis of the totality of the evidence on this issue, the Tribunal concludes that, apart from Electroper\u00fa, representatives of various State agencies involved in the privatization unequivocally supported the merger and the manner in which it was concluded.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that, in coming to the conclusion that the various State actors named herein supported the merger of Egenor with Power North, it is not suggesting that these individuals did anything wrong *per se.* To the contrary, it appears to the Tribunal that these individuals were properly and effectively implementing the policy of the Peruvian Government at that time. Indeed, it bears repeating that the Tribunal\u2019s primary finding in respect of the Merger Revaluation Assessment is that SUNAT breached the Egenor LSA by straying from the widely-accepted and stable interpretation of the MRL at the time of the foreign investment into Egenor. The Tribunal\u2019s findings concerning the conduct of the various individuals that are described under the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the *actos propios* issue are secondary in nature and support its primary finding on liability.\n\n**iv) The Defense Based on SUNAT\u2019s Authority over Tax Matters**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal has answered questions (i)-(iii) in the affirmative. It is therefore necessary to turn now to question (iv): is the Merger Revaluation Assessment immunized from scrutiny under the doctrine of *actos propios* based on the Respondent\u2019s defense that only SUNAT has authority over tax matters within Peru, and therefore representations and support from any other State agencies or entities are irrelevant?\n\n429.\n\nRespondent argues that any approvals by Electroper\u00fa or various Government entities and officials of the 1996 merger could not immunize Egenor\u2019s tax practices from review by SUNAT. Respondent rests its argument on the principle that a national tax service cannot be bound by the actions of a separate Governmental entity. Respondent points to case law that supports this principle in various jurisdictions in addition to Peru, including the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\n430.\n\nIn short, Respondent asserts that, for purposes of Claimant\u2019s claim of breach of good faith, there is no contradiction between Electroper\u00fa\u2019s conduct as a shareholder of Egenor and SUNAT\u2019s assessment of DEI Egenor for tax underpayment because they are separate entities. The same conclusion is urged by Respondent in connection with the putative approvals for the merger by the other relevant Governmental agencies (CONADE, COPRI, CEPRI-ELP).\n\n431.\n\nEarlier in the present Award, the Tribunal developed its reasoning on estoppel.\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal determined that this was one of the areas in which there was an inconsistency between international law and Peruvian law. In international law, it is possible for entities and agencies other than the national tax service to bind the State to a particular position concerning transactions with tax implications.\n\n433.\n\nThe Tribunal also determined that, in the context of estoppel, the State assumes the risk for the acts of its organs or officials which, *by their nature,* may reasonably *induce reliance* in third parties. As such, what is relevant for estoppel is that there has been a declaration, representation, or conduct which has in fact induced reasonable reliance by a third party, which means that the State, even if only implicitly, has committed not to change its course.\n\n434.\n\nThe decisive element for estoppel is the *reasonable appearance* that the representation binds the State. In this regard, the competence, or rather, *the manifest lack of competence,* of a State organ is relevant, given that no one can reasonably have confidence in representations or statements coming from an organ which manifestly lacks the competence to make them.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal now applies its earlier determinations to the evidence before it, and to the factual conclusions reached in the first three sections of this part of the Award.\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, from the point of view of the reasonable investor, the actions and representations of the representatives of Electroper\u00fa and of the various State agencies involved in the privatization of Egenor created confidence in the investor that the State would not reverse course after the merger was approved and consummated. Having considered the evidence put forward by both parties, the Tribunal concludes that the actions and representations surrounding the merger were of such a nature as to create such a climate of confidence.\n\n437.\n\nThis is particularly true given the basis for SUNAT\u2019s assessment. SUNAT did not assess the merger on the basis that the Merger Revaluation Law was outside the scope of the stabilization guarantee of the LSA. If that were the basis for the assessment, Claimant could not invoke the representations and conduct of the other entities, as it was clearly on notice that SUNAT could challenge the merger on that basis.\n\n438.\n\nIndeed, in the Due Diligence Report prepared by Estudio Grau for Banco de Cr\u00e9dito in 1999, in preparation for the auction of the Government\u2019s remaining interest in Egenor, the sole tax contingency mentioned pertained to whether Egenor could continue applying the benefits granted by the Merger Revaluation Law or whether, pursuant to Law 27034, it had to cease applying those benefits. Although the report mentioned that SUNAT could be expected to take the view that the Merger Revaluation Law was not capable of stabilization under a legal stability agreement, it specifically concluded that Egenor had a reasonably strong legal basis to continue claiming the benefits of that law under its LSA.\n\n439.\n\nHowever, SUNAT\u2019s conclusion that the merger was a sham, and that it did not fulfil the objectives of the Peruvian legislation, flies in the face of all of the evidence concerning the unequivocal support that the State showed for the merger.\n\n440.\n\nNot surprisingly, nothing in the Grau report in 1999 indicated to Claimant that there may have been questions raised by SUNAT regarding the validity of the merger itself. Furthermore, throughout negotiations with Duke Energy, the Government made absolutely no mention of any tax contingencies stemming from the merger. To the contrary, the Government actively encouraged Duke Energy\u2019s acquisition.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the defence based on SUNAT\u2019s authority over tax matters is unavailing to Respondent.\n\n442.\n\nIn conclusion, having considered the evidence and arguments presented by the parties, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Merger Revaluation Assessment constitutes a breach by Peru of the implied duty of good faith owed to Claimant under the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n**4. Breach of Non Discrimination Guarantee?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n443.\n\nClaimant submits that SUNAT\u2019s own data reveals the contours of four distinct groups of companies that were \"in the same situation\" as DEI Egenor for purposes of their selection for audit and ultimate assessment, and against which the Tribunal can measure SUNAT\u2019s treatment of DEI Egenor:\n\n\u2022 With regard to the first group, the 1,558 other companies that reorganized under the Merger Revaluation Law were clearly similarly situated to DEI Egenor for purposes of their selection for audit, given that they all undertook the same type of transaction that served as the alleged basis for DEI Egenor\u2019s assessment. All of these companies reorganized, and all were entitled to enjoy the tax benefits of the resulting asset revaluation. It thus stretches the bounds of imagination to believe that none of them - aside from the five that continued those benefits - engaged in any \"questionable\" conduct in connection with the reorganizations.\n\n\u2022 With regard to the second group, comprised of the 101 Major Taxpayers that were actually selected for audit in 2000, each of these Major Taxpayers was clearly similarly situated to DEI Egenor for purposes of their ultimate assessment, given that each and every one of them must have satisfied essentially the same \"objective criteria\" that allegedly led SUNAT to select DEI Egenor for audit. Again, given that all 101 of these companies displayed what SUNAT admittedly considered to be the tell-tale signs of tax evasion, it is astonishing that not a single one was ultimately assessed for any wrongdoing, apart from those that continued benefits under their LSAs. Furthermore, all the companies that did claim those LSA benefits were ultimately assessed, in some cases under multiple theories.\n\n\u2022 With regard to the third category of comparators, namely the companies that SUNAT was allegedly \"investigating\" in connection with revaluations done between 1994 and 1998, it is clear that each of those companies were in a similar situation as DEI Egenor, but, to the best of Claimant\u2019s knowledge, were never assessed.\n\n\u2022 Finally, with regard to the fourth category of comparators, namely the companies that merged, revalued, but relinquished their LSA rights, it is unquestionable that the (at least) three companies in this group were similarly situated to DEI Egenor, but were treated more favourably. The only distinguishing factor between these companies and DEI Egenor was that they decided not to continue applying the Merger Revaluation Law\u2019s depreciation benefits, while DEI Egenor chose to continue doing so. Tellingly, the four other companies that also continued to insist on their LSA rights - Edelnor, Luz del Sur, Edegel and Barrick - were also assessed by SUNAT under Rule VIII.\n\n444.\n\nOn the basis of the above, Claimant submits that SUNAT\u2019s assessment of DEI Egenor *(i.e.,* Duke Energy\u2019s investment) was discriminatory on the basis of nationality.\n\n445.\n\nIndeed, Claimant asserts that SUNAT\u2019s assessments were discriminatory in intention, character and effect. Claimant submits that the evidence it has put forward demonstrates that the Government of Peru, facing an immense political storm after the fall of the Fujimori administration, singled out foreign investors that were continuing to avail themselves of the Merger Revaluation Benefits under their LSAs.\n\n446.\n\nClaimant highlights in particular that SUNAT resorted to Rule VIII (to disallow the Egenor and Power North merger as a \"sham\" transaction) only after its initial strategy *(i.e.,* taking the position that the benefits of the Merger Revaluation Law were not stabilized under LSAs) seemed destined to fail.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n447.\n\nRespondent denies that SUNAT\u2019s audit of DEI Egenor was politically motivated, and has put forward several witnesses from SUNAT who attest to the objectivity of the agency and the audit process that was undertaken against Egenor.\n\n448.\n\nRespondent submits that the companies in Claimant\u2019s \"four groups\" are not similarly situated to DEI Egenor and, in any event, their treatment does not support Claimant\u2019s assertion that SUNAT discriminated against DEI Egenor for having continued to claim benefits under the MRL:\n\n\u2022 First, Claimant\u2019s assertions are based on the incorrect premise that SUNAT\u2019s selection criteria included whether a taxpayer had conducted a reorganization and that consequently each of the 1,558 companies should have been selected for audit because they had reorganized. Instead, SUNAT employed objective criteria. Those criteria included whether the taxpayer had not yet been audited in the past two years, whether the taxpayer had a permanent credit balance, and whether the taxpayer had significant distortions in its sales tax ratios. During the audit period 1999-2004, 587 of the 1,558 companies were considered major taxpayers. Of those 587, 329 reorganized under the MRL, and approximately half (143 of 329) of these companies revalued their assets in combination with their reorganization. Of those 143 large taxpayers that revalued and reorganized under the MRL, 71 were selected for audit and 34 were ultimately assessed. Thus, even if SUNAT\u2019s selection criteria had included reorganizations, the numbers demonstrate that SUNAT was exercising its authority to audit and assess taxpayers on a reasonable, even-handed, and non-discriminatory basis.\n\n\u2022 Second, of the 101 major taxpayers selected for audit in 2000, 68 were ultimately assessed on various grounds, including underpayments of income tax. If one accepts Claimant\u2019s premise that these 101 companies were similarly situated to DEI Egenor, the fact that 70% of them were assessed nullifies Egenor\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u2022 Third, the 129 taxpayers referred to by Ms. Merino were selected for audit two years after DEI Egenor. Forty-three of them were major taxpayers and 12 were ultimately assessed. In any event, it is unclear how Claimant would make the case that these 129 companies are similarly situated to DEI Egenor, given that Egenor was selected by SUNAT two years earlier.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, Claimant fails to demonstrate how DEI Egenor was discriminated against when it was not assessed because it had continued to avail itself of the MRL benefits after the law expired.\n\n449.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that Claimant\u2019s argument that SUNAT changed its strategy in a politically motivated campaign to go after Egenor, based on a comparison of the way other companies (Edelnor and Luz del Sur) were treated, is not valid. Respondent submits that:\n\nThe specific facts in the case of Egenor justified the approach SUNAT took in that case. Specifically, in the case of Egenor, the issue was whether it was eligible to receive the tax benefits under Law No. 26283 in the first place because its merger in 1996 with Power North S.A. had been a sham. In the other cases *(Edelnor* and *Luz del Sur),* by contrast, the issue was whether the companies had continued claiming the tax benefits beyond the expiration of Law No. 26283, by virtue of their respective LSAs.\n\n**c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n450.\n\nThe claim for the guarantee against discrimination under the DEI Bermuda LSA is another one of Claimant\u2019s alternative bases for liability in respect of the Merger Revaluation Assessment. Given its earlier findings of liability under the guarantee of tax stabilization, and its conclusions under the doctrine of *actos propios,* the Tribunal has decided that it is not necessary for it to develop its conclusions under this alternative theory.\n\n**VI. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**A. Applicable Standard of Damages**\n-------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nIn its Memorial, Claimant submits the following arguments for the applicable standard of damages:\n\n\u2022 It is a generally accepted principle of international law that a State\u2019s violation of an investor\u2019s rights, guarantees and protections requires that the offending Government pay prompt, full and adequate compensation.\n\n\u2022 The provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code clearly state that there is liability for damages whether the breach is partial or total, and whether it arises from *dolo, culpa inexcusable* or *culpa leve.*\n\n\u2022 Peruvian Law follows the *restitutio in integrum* principle, which means that the reparation of damages is integral, covering all consequences arising from the breach. In this respect, Peruvian law is supported by long-standing international jurisprudence.\n\n452.\n\nIn sum, Claimant submits that whatever measure of damages the Tribunal adopts, it should: (1) make Claimant whole, and (2) result in a fair outcome.\n\n453.\n\nRespondent does not contest Claimant\u2019s submissions on the applicable standard of damages. Respondent does, however, question whether Claimant has sustained any damages at all, and therefore whether there is any loss to be made whole.\n\n454.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant has failed to present any evidence that Claimant itself (i.e., DEI Bermuda) sustained damages as a result of Respondent\u2019s breach of the DEI Bermuda LSA, given the dependence of Claimant\u2019s liability theory on the breach of the Egenor LSA. Respondent notes that Claimant has not provided a single financial statement, balance sheet, or tax return for DEI Bermuda that shows that that company suffered economic harm because of SUNAT\u2019s assessments of DEI Egenor. Rather, argues Respondent, Claimant's allegations relate solely to the harm suffered by DEI Egenor, a company which is not, and could not be, a party to this proceeding. As such, Respondent concludes, Claimant has failed to meet its burden of proof. By providing evidence only for damages allegedly sustained by DEI Egenor, Claimant is asking the Tribunal to assume that one hundred percent of those damages are transferable to, and thus recoverable by, DEI Bemuda.\n\n455.\n\nIn response, Claimant argues that the losses suffered by DEI Egenor are the losses suffered by DEI Bermuda in proportion to DEI Bermuda\u2019s percentage ownership of DEI Egenor through DEI Peru Holdings SRL (i.e., 99.7 percent). Claimant contends that DEI Bermuda\u2019s claim to lost dividend payments is fully supported in two respects. First, utility companies are generally purchased for their dividend-paying capacity, given the regulated environment in which they operate. The same is true of DEI Egenor. Second, the Navigant Expert Reply Report demonstrates how DEI Egenor has actually declared and paid dividends, as expected, in nearly every year since its privatization. Indeed, Claimant points to the fact that more than 95 percent of DEI Egenor\u2019s entire retained earnings has been used consistently for the purpose of distributing dividends to its shareholders. Claimant submits that to the extent the earnings of DEI Egenor have been impaired by SUNAT\u2019s tax assessments, then the amount by which those earnings have been impaired is the amount unavailable for distribution to DEI Egenor\u2019s shareholders.\n\n456.\n\nRespondent replies that even assuming that \"utility companies are generally purchased for their dividend paying capacity,\" this general assertion does not begin to meet Claimant\u2019s burden of proof to evidence its damages in this specific case. Respondent notes that DEI Egenor\u2019s dividend payment ratio has fluctuated wildly during the time period in question, from a positive 173 percent in one year to a negative 238 percent in the next.\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Claimant has indeed sustained a loss as a result of SUNAT\u2019s assessment against Egenor. Although it is true that the dividend payment ratio fluctuated significantly between 1996 and 2000, the evidence reveals that a dividend was declared in each of those years, and that a total of approximately 95% of Egenor\u2019s profit was paid out as dividends during that period.\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that DEI Bermuda is entitled to be made whole for the damages suffered by DEI Egenor, but that DEI Bermuda\u2019s damages are not identical to DEI Egenor\u2019s damages. The Tribunal will award to Claimant the proportion of the losses sustained by DEI Egenor that reflects the product of the historical level of dividends paid by DEI Egenor to its shareholders (95 percent) multiplied by DEI Bermuda\u2019s percentage ownership of DEI Egenor through DEI Peru Holdings SRL (99.7 percent), which results in a factor of 94,715 percent.\n\n459.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the actual quantification of damages.\n\n**B. Quantum of Damages**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Navigant\u2019s Analysis (for Claimant)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nIn support of its position on the quantification of damages, Claimant submitted the following expert reports from Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, C.F.A., of Navigant Consulting, Inc.:\n\n\u2022 Expert Report dated June 15, 2006; and\n\n\u2022 Expert Reply Report dated December 20, 2006.\n\n461.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Kaczmarek submitted a document entitled \"Revised Damages Support\" at the hearing on May 14, 2007, at the end of his examination-in-chief.\n\n462.\n\nNavigant\u2019s approach to quantifying damages in this case was explained as follows at paragraph 116 of its Expert Report:\n\nTo determine the harm caused by SUNAT\u2019s revaluation and depreciation rate assessments, we have calculated the difference between 1) the corporate income tax and employee profit sharing payments Egenor has paid since 1996 and will pay in the future (\"Actual Scenario\") and 2) the corporate tax and employee profit sharing payments Egenor would have paid if SUNAT\u2019s audits did not result in the revaluation and depreciation rate assessments (\"But-for Scenario\"). We have calculated the net present value of the difference between the two scenarios as of 15 June 2006 using the interest rates SUNAT credits to taxpayer, on tax refund requests. For periods prior to 15 June 2006, we have utilized the actual interest rate as stipulated by SUNAT. For periods after 15 June 2006, we have utilized SUNAT\u2019s currently quoted interest rate of 7.2 percent.\n\n463.\n\nIn order to be able to forecast depreciation and employee profit-sharing expenses under the various scenarios, Navigant constructed a financial model containing the 6,000 plus assets on Egenor\u2019s balance sheet.\n\n464.\n\nAppendix 1 to Navigant\u2019s Expert Report contains a schematic diagram that explains the information flow in the damages model. There are 23 steps in the model that Navigant developed in order to produce the annual cash flow impact of SUNAT\u2019s assessment from 1996 to 2074. Navigant produced with its model various exhibits that contained the information produced at each step of the modelling exercise, as described in the following table:\n\n**Exhibit Information**\n\nA2 Annual Cash Flow Impact of SUNAT\u2019s Assessment from 1996 to 2005\n\nBI A Actual and BUT-FOR Cash Payments to Settle Tax Returns 1996 to 2005\n\nBIB Actual and BUT-FOR Cash Payments to Employee Profit Sharing Plan 1996 to 2005\n\nB2 Summary of Egenor\u2019s Actual Tax Returns and But-for Tax Filings 1996 to 2005\n\nB3 Actual & BUT-FOR Monthly Payment Calculation 2001 to 2005\n\nB4 Actual & BUT-FOR Monthly Payment Factor Calculation 2001 to 2005\n\nCl Cash Payments to Settle Audits of 1996 to 2000 Tax Returns\n\nD2A General v.

This required Navigant to re-run the model through its 23 steps for each of the two scenarios. The information generated by that exercise was submitted as part of Navigant\u2019s Revised Damages Support as Exhibits G1 through H4 (for the Depreciation Assessment damages) and as Exhibits II through K1 (for the Merger Revaluation Assessment damages).\n\n468.\n\nThe results of Navigant\u2019s calculations were set out in a document entitled \"Damages Summary\" submitted with Navigant\u2019s Revised Damages Support. The Damages Summary is reproduced in the table below:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Navigant\u2019s Damages Summary** (Amounts in Soles unless otherwise noted) |\n|  | **[A]****As of 15 June 2006** | **[B]****Interest to****15 June 2007** | **[C=A+B]****Total as of****15 June 2007** | **[=C/ 3.1754] Total (in USD) as of 15 June 2007** |\n| **Depreciation Rate and Merger Assessment Damages** Damages | S/. 122,358,198 | S/. 10,528,077 | S/. 132,886,275 | $ | 41,848,673 |\n| If Interest is Added to 2002/2003 Tax Credit, Adjust by: | (S/. 1,151,143) | (S/. 99,048) | (S/. 1,250,191) | $ | (393,711) |\n| If Damages Beyond 2011 are not Recoverable, Adjust by: | (S/. 16,686,025) | (S/. 1,435,717) | (S/. 18,121,742) | $ | (5,706,916) |\n| **Merger Assessment Damages Only** Damages | S/. 71,412,243 | S/ 6,144,530 | S/. 77,556,773 | $ | 24,424,253 |\n| If Interest is Added to 2002/2003 Tax Credit, Adjust by: | S/. 0 | S/. 0 | S/. 0 | $ | -- |\n| If Damages Beyond 2011 are not Recoverable, Adjust by: | (S/. 14,486,184) | (S/. 1,246,436) | (S/. 15,732,620) | $ | (4,954,532) |\n| **Depreciation Rate Assessment****Damages Only** Damages | S/. 21,487,624 | S/. 1848,862 | S/. 23,336,486 | $ | 7,349,148 |\n| If Interest is Added to 2002/2003 Tax Credit, Adjust by: | (S/. 1,151,143) | (S/. 99,048) | (S/. 1,250,191) | $ | (393,711) |\n| If Damages Beyond 2011 are not Recoverable, Adjust by: | (S/. 2,199,841) | (S/. 189,281) | (S/. 2,389,122) | $ | (752,385) |\n\n469.\n\nNavigant has therefore calculated the damages from the Merger Revaluation Assessment alone to be US$24,424,253, and the damages from the Depreciation Assessment alone to be US$7,349,148. These figures are, in each case, calculated as of June 15, 2007, and subject to adjustment if the Tribunal finds that damages beyond 2011 (the date the DEI Bermuda LSA expires) are not recoverable.\n\n**2. Macroconsult\u2019s Analysis (for Respondent)**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s position on the quantification of damages, Respondent submitted the following expert reports from Mr. Pablo Bustamante of Macroconsult S.A.C.:\n\n\u2022 Expert Report dated October 2, 2006; and\n\n\u2022 Expert Reply Report dated March 26, 2007.\n\n471.\n\nIn addition, with the Tribunal\u2019s permission, Respondent submitted a letter on June 1, 2007 commenting on the Revised Damages Support submitted by Claimant on May 14, 2007.\n\n472.\n\nMr. Bustamante\u2019s criticism of Navigant\u2019s analysis was summarized as follows in paragraph 2 of his Expert Reply Report:\n\n(i) Navigant\u2019s allegation that Peru received a \"double payment\" for the tax benefits associated with the Merger Revaluation Law (\"MRL\") and the use of the general depreciation rate is not supported by evidence and, in any event, does not affect its estimate of damages; (ii) Navigant\u2019s methodology for calculating damages is conceptually flawed and unnecessarily complex; (iii) Navigant has failed to justify its inconsistent treatment of tax credits earned by DEI Egenor, which inflates Claimant\u2019s damages; and (iv) Navigant has confirmed the accuracy of my calculation of the amount that Claimant\u2019s damages would be reduced if those damages are not calculated after the expiration of the DEI Bermuda LSA in 2011.\n\n473.\n\nMr. Bustamante was the first of the parties\u2019 experts to seek to isolate the damages of each of the two separate assessments. In his Expert Reply Report, he presented the relevant figures. These are summarized by the Tribunal in the following table:\n\n**Macroconsult\u2019s Damages Summary**\n\n(in US Dollars, and applying adjusted tax credits)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Depreciation****Assessment** | **Merger****Revaluation****Assessment** |\n| Cash Damages (1996-2074) | 15,000,538 | 15,385,392 |\n| Non-Cash Damages | 639,002 | (1,373,620) |\n| Total | 15,639,540 | 14,011,772 |\n| Adjustment if post-2011 damages excluded | (644,798) | (4,443,614) |\n| Total (1996-2011) | 14,964,742 | 9,568,158 |\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n474.\n\nIn the present award, the Tribunal has found Peru liable to the Claimant for breach of the LSA in relation to the Merger Revaluation Assessment only. In this respect, the Tribunal finds that damages beyond 2011 cannot be recovered, given that the benefits of the MRL (which itself was repealed at the end of 1998) could only be expected to extend until the expiry of the LSA.\n\n475.\n\nAs for the actual amount of damages sustained by Claimant by reason of the Merger Revaluation Assessment alone, the Tribunal must choose between Navigant\u2019s and Macroconsult\u2019s calculations. Navigant\u2019s calculation, excluding damages beyond 2011, results in damages of US$19,469,721. Macroconsult\u2019s calculation, on the same basis, results in damages of US$9,568,158. This is not an insignificant difference.\n\n476.\n\nIn reviewing the two calculations, the Tribunal, of course, is mindful of the criticism levied against the Navigant assessment by Respondent and its expert.\n\n477.\n\nFirst, and most fundamentally, Respondent argues that Claimant has simply not proven that Navigant\u2019s calculation is correct, and that Macroconsult\u2019s calculation is incorrect. Respondent made this point most directly in its comments on Claimant\u2019s revised damages, which Respondent submitted by letter on June 1, 2007. In that letter, Respondent wrote:\n\nMr. Kaczmarek\u2019s Revised Damages Support does not meet Claimant\u2019s burden to establish that its calculation of the damages from the Merger Revaluation and Depreciation Rate Assessments is correct and Respondent\u2019s is wrong.\n\n478.\n\nRespondent implies that Navigant\u2019s calculations are incorrect because they are based on what Respondent suggests is a flawed and unnecessarily complex methodology that creates two scenarios for the time period (1996-2000) before SUNAT\u2019s 2001 assessment. In particular, Respondent submits that Navigant calculated the difference between what Egenor actually paid based on its understanding of the rules and what it owed under SUNAT\u2019s rules during those five years prior to the assessment. According to Respondent, however, no such difference existed during that period: Egenor paid what it thought it was entitled to pay and not what SUNAT ordered it to pay. Thus, argues Respondent, Claimant's experts calculate a difference between the actual payment and the \"but-for-the-breach\" payment where none existed.\n\n479.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a simpler way to calculate Egenor\u2019s damages would have been to add together (i) the amount of the Tax Assessment in 2001, and (ii) from 2001 onward, the difference between the taxes paid under SUNAT\u2019s rules and the taxes paid under the company\u2019s understanding of the rules.\n\n480.\n\nClaimant responds that:\n\n\u2022 Its damages do not somehow predate the issuance of SUNAT\u2019s assessment. Navigant, argues Claimant, simply \"redid\" the accounting for Egenor starting in 1996, as this was necessary to determine the exact amount of the losses DEI Egenor and DEI Bermuda would suffer in prospective years.\n\n\u2022 Navigant simply followed the very same procedures that SUNAT followed in order to quantify the impact SUNAT\u2019s assessments would have on Claimant\u2019s investment in prospective years. If the calculations appear to be complex, contends Claimant, it is not because they were made so unnecessarily by Navigant.\n\n\u2022 Importantly, Claimant submits that Respondent\u2019s criticism does not conclude that Navigant has erred in its quantification.\n\n481.\n\nIn order to resolve the disagreement between the parties on the issue of quantum, the Tribunal has studied closely the calculations submitted by their respective experts. Although the Tribunal was not supplied with an electronic version of either of the experts\u2019 models, it sought to follow the calculations through the information contained in the exhibits and appendices of each report.\n\n482.\n\nReviewing the data contained in the exhibits and appendices of the various Navigant reports, the Tribunal was able to follow the logic of its model, and understand the flow of data. Macroconsult\u2019s model was not as transparent, and thus less helpful to the Tribunal. Although Mr. Bustamante\u2019s expert reply report was accompanied by 20 exhibits, the Tribunal was unable to verify its calculations because the supporting data was insufficient for these purposes. In this connection, the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of Macroconsult\u2019s Report is identical to the observations made by Mr. Kaczmarek when he was asked by Claimant\u2019s counsel to comment on Mr. Bustamante\u2019s calculations. Mr. Kaczmarek testified that he \"looked at the calculations to see if he could replicate them. We did find some errors in the analysis, but we were unable to fully reconcile it because a lot of the supporting detail was not included with it.\"44 The Tribunal agrees.\n\nHearing Transcript, May 14, 2007, at p. 1346: 4\u20148.\n\n483.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that it can and does rely on the calculations submitted to it by Mr. Kaczmarek. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that DEI Egenor suffered damages of US$19,469,721. Applying its earlier finding concerning the proportion of DEI Egenor\u2019s loss suffered by Claimant (94,715 percent), the Tribunal awards Claimant damages in the amount of US$18,440,746 (plus pre- and post-award interest).\n\n484.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must determine where and in what currency the award is payable.\n\n485.\n\nRespondent submits that even if damages to DEI Bermuda were established, any damages should be payable in Soles in Peru as the DEI Bermuda LSA is an instrument of Peruvian law, and the alleged harm occurred in Peru.\n\n486.\n\nIn response, Claimant submits that, in light of the fact that Claimant has demonstrated harm not only to DEI Egenor, but also to DEI Bermuda, damages should be payable in U.S. Dollars in Bermuda.\n\n487.\n\nConsidering that (i) the Tribunal has found that DEI Bermuda suffered a loss, (ii) such loss was suffered in Bermuda, (iii) there is evidence before the Tribunal that dividends paid by Egenor to DEI Peru Holdings SRL are not subject to additional taxes under Peruvian tax laws, and (iv) the tax rate on dividends paid by DEI Peru Holdings SRL to DEI Bermuda have been stabilized at zero percent in the DEI Bermuda LSA *(i.e.,* until 2011, which is the same period for which the Tribunal has assessed the underlying damages), the Tribunal orders Respondent to pay the award of damages in Bermuda in U.S. Dollars.\n\n488.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal awards Claimant damages in the amount of US$18,440,746 plus simple interest from June 15, 2007, calculated using the actual interest rate(s) stipulated for that period by SUNAT *(i.e.,* the interest rate(s) SUNAT credits to taxpayers on tax refunds).45\n\nThe parties\u2019 damages experts each used the interest rate stipulated by SUNAT to adjust calculations in their analysis. See Navigant Expert Report dated June 15, 2006, at paragraph 116, and MacroConsult\u2019s Expert Reply Report dated March 26, 2007 at paragraph 21.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n489.\n\nThe parties submitted their respective submission on costs, as directed by the Tribunal, on July 25, 2007. Claimant filed a supplementary submission on costs on August 30, 2007. The parties very helpfully agreed on a template that both sides used in their submissions, which indeed has made the Tribunal\u2019s analysis simpler, and has avoided the need for the Tribunal to review voluminous quantities of supporting law firm, expert and vendor invoices spanning a period of four years.\n\n490.\n\nThe parties agreed on the categories of costs incurred by each side in this arbitration. They are: (1) fees and expenses of legal counsel; (2) fees and expenses of experts; (3) expenses incurred by fact witnesses; and (4) out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each party (including advance payments to ICSID).\n\n491.\n\nIn their submissions, each party submitted the reasonably incurred costs on a month-bymonth basis from the inception of this dispute to the date of the submission, followed by the presentation of the total of all of these categories added together.\n\n492.\n\nClaimant\u2019s overall total costs amount to US$9,715,837.2546, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount (US$)** |\n| Legal Fees and Expenses |  |\n| Fulbright & Jaworski LLP |  |\n| Fees | 4,350,836,29 |\n| Expenses | 517,786.46 |\n| Crowell & Moring LLP |  |\n| Fees | 300,000.00 |\n| Expenses | 27,137.07 |\n| Miranda & Amado, Abogados |  |\n| Fees Expenses | 1,300,121.50 |\n| 184,869.68 |\n| Expert Fees and Expenses | 1,979,563.54 |\n| Witness and Client Out-of-Pocket Costs and Expenses (including, but not limited to witnesses\u2019 and client representatives\u2019 travel expenses) | 228,522.71 |\n| ICSID Payments | 827,000.00 |\n| OVERALL TOTAL | 9,715,837.25 |\n\nThis amount includes an advance payment of US$175,000 requested by ICSID on November 15, 2007 and an advance payment of US$225,000 requested by ICSID on March 20, 2008, both of which made after the Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs of July 25, 2007 and the Suplement to Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs of August 30, 2007.\n\n493.\n\nRespondent\u2019s overall total costs amount to US$5,248,930.2347, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount (US$)** |\n| Legal Fees and Expenses |  |\n| Sidley Austin LLP Fees Expenses Judge Stephen M. Schwebel | 3,696,091.56 244,323.76 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees | 80,637.50 |\n| Expenses | 0.00 |\n| Santistevan de Noriega & Asociados |  |\n| Fees Expenses | 169,119.31 2,907.97 |\n| Expert Fees and Expenses | 231,039.48 |\n| Witness and Client Out-of-Pocket Costs and Expenses (including, but not limited to witnesses\u2019 and client representatives\u2019 travel expenses) | 4,810.65 |\n| ICSID Payments | 820,000.00 |\n| OVERALL TOTAL | 5,248,930.23 |\n\nThis amount also includes the advance payment of US$175,000 requested by ICSID on November 15, 2007 and the advance payment of US$225,000 requested by ICSID on March 20, 2008, both of which made after the Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs of July 25, 2007.\n\n**B. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n494.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n495.\n\nIn this case, the parties have agreed on the allocation of certain costs. In Article 9 of the DEI Bermuda LSA, which contains the ICSID arbitration clause, the parties agreed that \"the costs incurred in connection with the application of this [arbitration] clause shall be shared by both parties in equal parts.\"\n\n496.\n\nBy letter from the Secretariat dated March 20, 2008, the Tribunal invited the parties to make simultaneous submissions on the interpretation of their agreement on costs within ten days. By letter dated March 31, 2008, the parties jointly stipulated that they understood the agreement on costs in Article 9 to refer only to the payments requested by ICSID and made by the parties. In the same letter, they jointly wrote:\n\nBoth parties respectfully request that the fees and costs incurred by the parties in this arbitration, other than the payments requested by ICSID and made by the parties, be assessed by the arbitral tribunal pursuant to Article 61(2) of the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, after taking into account the submissions on costs made by the parties on July 25, 2007 and August 30, 2007.\n\n497.\n\nThe parties have therefore agreed that, in connection with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, \"the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre\" shall be shared equally by them. In fact, as is standard, the parties have paid equal shares of the advances requested by ICSID.48 The Tribunal therefore need not make any assessment in order to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement to share equally these costs. The decision that remains for the Tribunal on the issue of costs, under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, is therefore how to attribute \"the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings.\"\n\nEach party has paid $820,000 by way of advances to ICSID against the costs of the arbitration. Claimant has, in addition, paid a registration fee of $7,000. The Tribunal has decided that this amount is excluded from the parties\u2019 agreement in relation to \"payments requested by ICSID and made by the parties,\" and is in any event *de minimis.*\n\n498.\n\nThe amounts in question are set out in the parties\u2019 respective submissions on costs. Excluding the payments to ICSID, Claimant has incurred expenses in the total amount of US$8,888,837.25. Respondent has incurred expenses in the total amount of US$4,428,930.23.\n\n499.\n\nAlthough Claimant was successful during the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration, Respondent raised serious arguments against jurisdiction, many of which raised novel and difficult issues related to the unique investment protection regime at issue here. As for the merits phase, Claimant has succeeded only in part: it has prevailed in one of its two claims; in relation to that claim, it has succeeded on two of the five alleged breaches of the LSA; and it has been awarded damages representing roughly half of the overall damages that were being sought. Finally, the Tribunal has found that there was no individual bad-faith conduct in relation to the estoppel claim against Respondent for the Merger Revaluation Assessment.\n\n500.\n\nHaving considered the matter carefully, the Tribunal has decided that it is just and equitable, in the circumstances of this case, to order that each party bear its own legal costs and expenses.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n501.\n\nHaving heard and read all the submissions and evidence in this arbitration, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal awards and orders as follows:\n\n1. Within thirty (30) days of the date of this Award, Respondent shall pay to Claimant the sum of US$18,440,746, plus simple interest calculated thereon from June 15, 2007 using the actual interest rate(s) stipulated for that period by SUNAT for refunds to taxpayers; and\n\n2. Each of Claimant and Respondent shall bear its own legal costs and expenses, and share equally the payments requested by ICSID and made by the parties."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2011-03-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 15 December 2008, the Republic of Peru (**'Peru'**) made a timely application for annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction rendered in favour of Duke Energy Investments Peru No. 1 Limited (**'DEI Bermuda'**) in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28, and in the alternative partial annulment of the Award in that case.\n\n**A. The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Award**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Decision on Jurisdiction was rendered on 1 February 2006. The Award was rendered on 18 August 2008. The Tribunal comprised L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C. (President, a national of Canada), Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil (a national of Argentina) and Dr. Pedro Nikken (a national of Venezuela).1\n\nDr Tawil and Dr Nikken each lodged a partial dissenting opinion to the Award on different issues. The Decision on Jurisdiction, Award and partial dissenting opinions are published at 15 ICSID Rep 100.\n\n3.\n\nThe proceedings concerned an investment, made by Duke Energy International Investments No. 1 Ltd (**'DEI Bermuda'** a company organized under the laws of Bermuda), which is ultimately owned by Duke Energy International LLC (**'Duke Energy'** (a company organized under the laws of the United States) through several acquisitions and reorganisations, of privatised interests in Egenor S.A.A., a Peruvian electricity corporation, which eventually became Duke Energy International Egenor S.A.A. (**'DEI Egenor'**). In an effort to encourage investment in privatised industries, the Peruvian Government concluded a number of Legal Stability Agreements (**'LSAs'**) with investors. These included the **'Egenor LSA'**, which applied from 1996 to 2006. The Peruvian Government had also passed the Merger Revaluation Law (**'MRL'**) on 10 January 1994, which guaranteed that corporate reorganisations would not incur tax liability. In order to benefit from this law, DEI Egenor merged with Power North S.A. in December 1996.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing DEI Bermuda's acquisition of privatised interests in DEI Egenor, DEI Bermuda entered into the **'DEI Bermuda LSA'** with Peru on 24 July 2001. The **DEI Bermuda LSA** applied for a term of ten years from the date of its execution. Pursuant to it, DEI Bermuda agreed to make a capital contribution to Duke Energy International Peru Holdings SRL (**'DEI Peru Holdings'**) of US$200 million (clause 2) and Peru in return agreed to guarantee legal stability for DEI Egenor in relation to various matters, including income tax (clause 3(1)). By clause 9, the parties agreed that *'any dispute, controversy or claim between them, relative to the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement, shall be submitted'* to ICSID arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 26 November 2001, the Peruvian tax authority (*Superintendencia Nacional de Administraci\u00f3n Tribunaria,* **'SUNAT'**) assessed a tax liability of approximately US$48 million (including interest and penalities) against DEI Egenor in respect of tax years 1996 - 1999 (**'the Tax Assessment'**).2\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [61].\n\n6.\n\nIn the Arbitration, DEI Bermuda claimed, *inter alia*, that this Tax Assessment constituted a violation of its rights under the DEI Bermuda LSA. Peru objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the admissibility of the claims. The Tribunal decided to hold a separate hearing on issues of jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n7.\n\nIn a reasoned Decision on Jurisdiction dated 1 February 2006, the Tribunal held that *'[t]he dispute submitted by DEI Bermuda is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.'*3 It rejected some of Peru's objections to admissibility, and joined others to the merits.\n\n*Ibid Dispositif* [168(1)].\n\n8.\n\nBy its Award dated 18 August 2008, the Tribunal found that Peru was not liable to DEI Egenor on one major limb of the latter's claims.4 However, it concluded, as to the claim concerning the Merger Revaluation Assessment (**'MRA'**), that SUNAT had violated the guarantee of tax stabilisation for DEI Egenor and in turn for DEI Bermuda.5 In addition, a majority of the Tribunal was of the opinion that the MRA constituted a breach by Peru of the implied duty of good faith owed to DEI Bermuda under the DEI Bermuda LSA.6 By way of compensation for breach of the DEI Bermuda LSA, the Tribunal ordered Peru to pay DEI Bermuda US$18,440,746 plus simple interest.7\n\nE.g. the Depreciation Assessment claim, Award [307], [323].\n\n*Ibid* [345] - [366].\n\n*Ibid* [442].\n\n*Ibid Dispositif* [501].\n\n**B. The Application for Annulment**\n------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nBy its Application, Peru seeks primarily annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction in its entirety, which would have the consequence that the Award as a whole would be annulled.8 In the alternative, it seeks partial annulment of *'the portions of the Award concerning (1) the effect of the Tax Amnesty; (2) the Merger Revaluation Assessment (specifically, the conclusions regarding tax stabilization and* actos propios *); and (3) the calculation of damages.'9*\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 366/2-9 (Peru), 408/17-409/1 (DEI Bermuda).\n\nApplication [101].\n\n10.\n\nPeru's Application for Annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction is based primarily on Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention (manifest excess of powers). Peru submits that the Tribunal asserted a jurisdiction *ratione materiae* which exceeded the scope of the parties' consent as set out in the instrument of their consent, namely the DEI Bermuda LSA.10 Further, Peru asserts that, in going beyond the plain words of the DEI Bermuda LSA, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law.11 The Tribunal also exceeded its jurisdiction *ratione personae* by asserting its jurisdiction over claims which were those of DEI Egenor not DEI Bermuda; and exceeded its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* by asserting jurisdiction over claims based on events occurring prior to the execution of the DEI Bermuda LSA.12 Peru seeks in addition annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, alleging that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision not to apply the plain words of the DEI Bermuda LSA;13 and under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention on the ground that failure to abide by the scope of the parties' consent to arbitration and to apply the applicable law is a failure to observe a fundamental rule of procedure.14\n\n*Ibid* [36].\n\n*Ibid* [39].\n\n*Ibid* [40] - [41].\n\n*Ibid* [43] - [44].\n\n*Ibid* [45] - [46].\n\n11.\n\nPeru's application for partial annulment of the Award relies compendiously on Articles 52(1)(b), (d), and (e) to challenge the above-noted portions of the Award to which it objects.15\n\n*Ibid* [79] - [100].\n\n12.\n\nBy paragraph 102 of its Annulment Application, Peru requested that the *ad hoc* Committee stay enforcement of the Award pending its decision (**'the Stay Request'**).\n\n**C. Summary of Annulment Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn 24 December 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered Peru's Annulment Application. In accordance with Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pending the *ad hoc* Committee's decision.\n\n14.\n\nOn 27 February 2009, the Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed Judge Dominique Hascher (a national of France), Professor Campbell McLachlan QC (a national of New Zealand) and Judge Peter Tomka (a national of Slovakia) as members of the *ad hoc* Committee, which was properly constituted on 4 March 2009. The parties were informed on 16 March 2009 that the members of the *ad hoc* Committee had appointed Professor McLachlan as its President. Also on that date, the Committee invited the parties to agree on a timetable for filing of written pleadings on Peru's Stay Request, and proposed that oral argument on the Stay Request be heard at its First Session. It suggested that the First Session be held on 27 or 28 April 2009 at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.\n\n15.\n\nAt the First Session, which was held in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague on 27 April 2009, the parties confirmed that they had no objections to the proper constitution of the Committee or to any of its members. The parties reached agreement with the *ad hoc* Committee on the establishment of a procedural timetable and various other procedural directions for the further conduct of the annulment proceeding. It was provided that the languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish. Simultaneous interpretation would be provided at the hearing. The Committee would render its Decision in English and Spanish, the Spanish translation being provided by the Secretariat. The hearing was scheduled for 12 and 13 April 2010 at the headquarters of ICSID in Washington, DC.\n\n16.\n\nThe parties submitted simultaneous briefs on Peru's Stay Request on 17 April 2009, and oral argument was heard on the Stay Request on 27 April 2009. By letter from its Secretary dated 5 May 2009, the *ad hoc* Committee confirmed that the provisional stay of enforcement was to continue until the Committee issued its Decision.\n\n17.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee released its Decision on Peru's Stay Request on 23 June 2009. The Committee decided that the stay of enforcement would only continue if, within 30 calendar days of the notification of the Decision by the ICSID Secretariat, Peru provided an official written assurance that it would effect full payment of its liability under the Award within 30 calendar days of the Decision on Annulment, to the extent that the Award was not annulled.\n\n18.\n\nPeru duly provided a written assurance on 17 July 2009, by letter from the Special Committee in charge of the representation of the Peruvian State in international investment disputes.\n\n19.\n\nPeru filed its Memorial on Annulment on 31 July 2009. DEI Bermuda filed its Counter-Memorial on 20 November 2009. Peru filed its Reply on 22 January 2010, accompanied by an Opinion on the Question of Annulment, prepared by Professor W. Michael Reisman, dated 20 January 2010. DEI Bermuda filed its Rejoinder on 19 March 2010, together with an Opinion of Professor Rudolf Dolzer dated 14 March 2010.\n\n20.\n\nA hearing was held in Washington D.C. on 12 and 13 April 2010. The parties agreed, by joint letter dated 26 March 2010, the schedule for that hearing. It was attended by counsel for the parties, together with Mr Fernando Quir\u00f3s and Ms Yesenia Cabezas of the Embassy of the Republic of Peru in Washington D.C. and Ms Pat Smith of Duke Energy.\n\n21.\n\nThe majority of documents referred to in the parties' pleadings were lodged in electronic form with the pleadings. By letter dated 9 April 2010, the President requested the parties to lodge lists of any documents referred to in the annulment proceedings and not already filed, and to lodge copies of any documents so listed. This the parties did at the conclusion of the hearing.\n\n22.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the President closed the oral phase of the proceedings, and indicated that the *ad hoc* Committee would notify the parties through the Secretariat when it had reached its Decision.\n\n23.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee then deliberated by various means of communication, including at meetings in Washington D.C. on 14 April 2010, in Paris on 28 July 2010 and in The Hague on 7 September 2010. On 18 November 2010, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 28, the Committee invited the parties to submit their respective statements of costs by 1 December 2010. The parties did so. DEI Bermuda also filed a written submission as to costs on the same date. Accordingly, the *ad hoc* Committee afforded Peru an opportunity to file any written submissions as to costs in reply by 10 December 2010.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 December 2010, the proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nAs set out above, Peru makes a wide-ranging challenge to the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and to certain portions of the Award. The arguments on each of these issues were fully developed by the parties in their written pleadings. At the hearing, whilst maintaining all of the grounds set out in writing, Peru helpfully placed particular emphasis on certain of those grounds. These included in particular:\n\n(a) Its objection to the Decision on Jurisdiction based upon manifest excess of powers, specifically:\n\n(i) the Tribunal's approach to its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* (including the law applicable to determination of that question); and,\n\n(ii) the Tribunal's assumption of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* (including Peru's allegation that the Tribunal had exceeded its powers by failing to decide on the objection *ratione temporis* actually taken by Peru); and\n\n(b) Its objection that the Tribunal had failed to state reasons for that part of its Award which set out its 'threshold analysis', namely *'the Tribunal's conclusion that claims for breach of the Egenor LSA could be raised by DEI Bermuda thanks to its so-called link found in Article 23(a).'*16\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 55/5-8.\n\n26.\n\nThis section of the Decision will summarise the parties' arguments on each of these issues, followed by the additional arguments in relation to each of the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Award.\n\n27.\n\nBefore doing so, however, it is necessary also to mention the parties' submissions as to the scope of the annulment standards under Article 52(1). As noted above, Peru supported its Reply with an Opinion of Professor Reisman, which contained a discussion of the annulment standards. In response, DEI Bermuda filed an Opinion of Professor Dolzer. The Committee is obliged to both eminent experts for their views. It will have occasion to refer to certain aspects of the interpretation of Article 52(1) to the extent relevant and necessary to its analysis in Part III below. However, despite the apparent difference of emphasis on some issues of construction and approach between the experts, the Committee finds that it is not necessary to deal with all of these questions in the abstract, in view of the confirmation provided by Peru in oral submissions that:17\n\n*Article 52, we submit must be read and applied on its terms in order to maintain the balance struck by the states parties to the ICSID Convention. And that is what we are asking this ad hoc committee to do....*\n\n*[T]he question before this committee is not whether the law of annulment is trending in one direction or another or whether cases embrace or caution against annulment..*\n\n*It is an exercise in case specific analysis within the framework of Article 52 itself.*\n\n*Ibid* 120/17-21, 121/12-16, 122/1-3.\n\n**A. Submissions on the Decision on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nPeru argues that the Decision on Jurisdiction should be annulled for manifest excess of powers, departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and failure to state reasons. This Decision adopts the structure followed by the parties, and is therefore structured to follow the objections raised by Peru to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In effect, in its Application for Annulment, Peru repeats the objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction that it raised before the Tribunal itself, but now does so on the basis that the Tribunal's conclusions on those issues warrant annulment pursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n29.\n\nPeru thus argues that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal's conclusion that it had jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is to be annulled under Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e);\n\n(b) The Tribunal's conclusion that it had jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is to be annulled under Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e); and\n\n(c) The Tribunal's improper arrogation to itself of jurisdiction vested in other fora under other LSAs requires annulment under Article 52(1)(b).\n\n30.\n\nThe parties' submissions on each of these points are summarised in turn.\n\n***1. Jurisdiction*** **ratione materiae**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n31.\n\nClause 3 of the DEI Bermuda LSA guaranteed legal stability *'in connection with the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO'*. Under clause 2.1, DEI Bermuda was obliged to contribute capital of US$200,000,000 to DEI Peru Holdings. The other obligations imposed on DEI Bermuda under clause 2 were ancillary to that obligation.\n\n32.\n\nPeru argues that DEI Bermuda's protection under the LSA was constrained to that investment of $200,000,000 *only*, and did not protect DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru generally, notwithstanding that the capital contribution was a stage in DEI Bermuda's acquisition of Egenor.18 In its Reply, it stresses the background to the LSAs, and the recognition of, among others, DEI Bermuda, that multiple LSAs were required to protect indirect investments.19 Peru argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law in interpreting the LSA, and consequently reached an incorrect interpretation.20 In the face of the DEI Bermuda's argument to the contrary, it maintains that Clauses Two and Three *are* crucial to jurisdiction, because they circumscribe the matters referred to in Clause Nine.21\n\nMemorial [116].\n\nReply [60]-[61].\n\nMemorial [117].\n\nReply [75], [79].\n\n33.\n\nPeru states that it was accepted before the Tribunal that, as a Peruvian legal instrument, the LSA had to be interpreted according to Peruvian civil law.22 Peru submits that Peruvian law is also applicable if Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is applied, and that the Tribunal identified no gap in Peruvian law, or inconsistency between its provisions and those of international law, that justified reference to supervening principles of international law.23\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [31]; Memorial [120]; Reply [73].\n\nMemorial [122]; Reply [82].\n\n34.\n\nPeru points out that the Tribunal did not refer to any of the applicable provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code in its Decision on Jurisdiction,24 or discuss the appropriate approach to contractual interpretation.25 Nor did it, as DEI Bermuda suggests, indicate that its approach was based on a 'good faith' interpretation as mandated by Peruvian law.26 It simply concluded that it was entitled to go beyond the narrow literal meaning of Clauses Two and Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA to consider four extrinsic factors.27 Peru contends that the Tribunal's failure to engage with the relevant provisions of the applicable law is evidence of its failure to apply the proper law at all.28\n\nMemorial [134]; Reply [80] - [81].\n\nMemorial [137].\n\nReply [85], [89].\n\nMemorial [140].\n\n*Ibid* [135].\n\n35.\n\nPeru contends that if the Tribunal had applied Peruvian law, it would have found that it was not entitled to go beyond the 'plain meaning' of the LSA. It would have thus found that only DEI Bermuda's capital contribution was protected.29 It further argues that the Tribunal so transparently and consciously departed from the approach advocated by Peru that its error must be manifest.30\n\nMemorial [131]; Reply [70].\n\nReply [66].\n\n36.\n\nPeru lastly contends that the Tribunal actually misapplied the four extrinsic factors it relied upon, and that a proper application of those factors would have lead it to decline jurisdiction.31\n\nMemorial [143] ff.\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nDEI Bermuda begins by arguing that Peru mischaracterised the terms of the LSA as the 'applicable law', when in fact the only provisions that governed jurisdiction were Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and clause 9 of the DEI Bermuda LSA.32 The Tribunal saw its central task as construing clause 9, *'taking account of the consequences of [the parties'] commitments which the parties must be considered to have reasonably and legitimately contemplated.*'33 It then concluded that the dispute before it concerned *'the interpretation, performance or validity'* of the LSA.34 DEI Bermuda submits that clauses 2 and 3 form no part of the applicable law for the purpose of the jurisdictional determination, and were essentially irrelevant to the issue of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction under clause 9.35\n\nCounter-Memorial [102].\n\n*Ibid* [109], citing Decision on Jurisdiction [77].\n\n*Ibid* [111], citing Decision on Jurisdiction [82].\n\n*Ibid* [119].\n\n38.\n\nDEI Bermuda submits that, in order for the Tribunal to have committed a manifest excess of powers then, having reached that conclusion, it would have to have made a finding that it would be impossible for the DEI Bermuda to substantiate its claims at the merits phase.36 The Tribunal made no such finding. Furthermore, DEI Bermuda argues that Peru's argument must fail because (a) the Tribunal did in fact find a breach at the merits phase, and (b) Peru conceded during the merits phase that its conduct was capable of constituting a breach.37\n\n*Ibid* [122].\n\n*Ibid* [124].\n\n39.\n\nLastly, DEI Bermuda argues that the Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons on which its conclusions were based.38 DEI Bermuda notes that the Tribunal invoked the Peruvian requirement that contracts be negotiated, executed and performed in good faith.39 It notes that, according to its experts, actual intention must prevail over 'literality'40 and that, were Peruvian law different on this point, the international law principle of *pacta sunt servanda* would intervene.41 In DEI Bermuda's view, Peru fails to substantiate its allegation that the Tribunal decided the dispute *ex aequo et bono.*42 DEI Bermuda argues that the Tribunal did not ignore clause 2 and 3 of the LSA, but set out its reasons '*in extenso*' for adopting the interpretation it did and thus provided reasons for its decision.43 DEI Bermuda maintains that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and clause 9 of the DEI Bermuda LSA sufficed as 'authority' for the Tribunal's interpretation and that it was well within its mandate to consider contextual factors.44\n\n*Ibid* [132].\n\n*Ibid* [133].\n\n*Ibid* [135].\n\n*Ibid* [136].\n\n*Ibid* [140].\n\n*Ibid* [144] - [147].\n\n*Ibid* [150] - [151].\n\n***2. Jurisdiction*** **ratione temporis**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n40.\n\nPeru submits that it was accepted before the Tribunal that the DEI Bermuda LSA was the sole source of DEI Bermuda's rights claimed in the arbitration.45 That LSA applies from 24 July 2001 until 24 July 2011. The SUNAT assessment which the DEI Bermuda alleged violated the LSA was issued in November 2001.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [146]; Memorial [105].\n\n41.\n\nPeru maintains that there are two aspects of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, and that the Tribunal considered only one of them. First, the 'dispute' between the parties must arise during the period specified in the instrument of consent.46 Peru never disagreed that the dispute - which was crystallised by SUNAT's unfavourable audit assessment - arose during the period specified in the LSA. Its complaint is that the Tribunal failed to address the second aspect of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* : that *'the substantive provisions of the relevant instrument must temporally cover the events on which the claim is based.'*47\n\nMemorial [107].\n\nMemorial [107]; Reply [44]. In this respect Peru relies on *Salini v Jordan*, which held that 'one must distinguish carefully between jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of an ICSID Tribunal (*i.e.*, the existence of a dispute) and applicability *ratione temporis* of the substantive obligations contained in a BIT': *Salini Costruttori SpA and Italstrade SpA v Jordan* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, 9 November 2004 (Decision on Jurisdiction),[176].\n\n42.\n\nPeru argues that clause 3(1) of the LSA only guarantees stability for the tax legislation which is in force on the date the agreement is signed.48 It thus argues that *'[a]ny claims based on factual or legal predicates falling outside that 10-year period are beyond the scope of the LSA's tax stability provision'*.49 It argues that the SUNAT assessment enforced tax rules that had applied to Egenor from 1996 to 1999 - rules that were not the subject of the DEI Bermuda LSA. The Tribunal did not engage with this aspect of temporal jurisdiction, satisfying itself with the conclusion that the dispute arose during the term of the LSA.50 Peru disputes DEI Bermuda's argument that, in addressing the first aspect of *ratione temporis* jurisdiction, the Tribunal implicitly rejected Peru's actual *ratione temporis* objection. It argues that the Tribunal could have addressed Peru's argument, but failed to do so.51\n\nMemorial [109].\n\n*Ibid* [110].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [148]; Memorial [112].\n\nReply [47] - [51].\n\n43.\n\nApplying Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, Peru submits that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction that it did not have, and failing to consider an issue put to it by a party;\n\n(b) departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to consider an issue put to it by a party; and\n\n(c) failed to provide reasons for its decision, by omitting the reasoning required to move from Point A (Peru's actual *ratione temporis* argument) to Point B (the Tribunal's conclusion that it had temporal jurisdiction).52\n\nMemorial [114] - [115].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n44.\n\nDEI Bermuda's central response is that the Tribunal did address Peru's *ratione temporis* argument when it held, in paragraph 148, that the crucial time was when the dispute arose, *'not the point in time during which the factual matters on which the dispute is based took place'*.53 According to DEI Bermuda, the Tribunal was entitled to define the *ratione temporis* issue for itself.54 Having made that decision, the Tribunal was entitled to consider all the relevant factual background to that dispute, as it did.55 Addressing Peru's argument that the DEI Bermuda LSA only stabilised tax laws in effect from 2001, DEI Bermuda argues that the Tribunal held this question over until the merits phase.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [148]; cited in Counter-Memorial [87].\n\nCounter-Memorial [90].\n\nCounter-Memorial [89], citing Decision on Jurisdiction [149] - [150].\n\n45.\n\nDEI Bermuda maintains that the Tribunal properly explained its decision, rejecting the first argument and ruling the second irrelevant, citing authority for its approach. According to DEI Bermuda, the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties has no role to play here because the act complained of occurred in November 2001.56\n\n*Ibid* [94] - [95].\n\n*3. **Jurisdiction vested in other tribunals***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nBy this additional head of challenge to the Decision on Jurisdiction, Peru seeks to support its two specific objections above with an over-arching point that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by assuming a jurisdiction properly vested in other tribunals under other LSAs.57\n\nMemorial [104].\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n47.\n\nPeru begins with the argument that the Tribunal failed to take account of all the other LSAs Peru signed, each concluded with a different party, in respect of a different investment and in force for a different period.58 This argument provides context for Peru's argument that the entire approach to jurisdiction followed by DEI Bermuda - and largely adopted by the Tribunal - was designed to circumvent the shortcomings of individual causes of action available to the Duke Energy group as a whole. Duke's particular problem was that only the DEI Bermuda LSA (and not, for example, the Egenor LSA) contained a reference to ICSID arbitration. But the DEI Bermuda LSA only applied from 2001, after the tax years in respect of which SUNAT issued the assessment that Duke claimed violated the LSA.59 In other words, Peru argues, the Tribunal took jurisdiction over a matter that really arose under a different LSA, namely the Egenor LSA, and not the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\nMemorial [92] ff; Reply [93] ff.\n\nMemorial [94], [99]; Reply [38].\n\n48.\n\nIn terms of the grounds of annulment under Article 52(1) of the Convention, Peru maintains that the Tribunal was motivated, in refusing to treat the DEI Bermuda LSA as an independent instrument with carefully-circumscribed boundaries, by a *'misguided concern for Duke Energy's ability to seek relief in a single arbitration for a full range of claims*.'60 Peru maintains that this decision was made on the basis of equity rather than law, and therefore constitutes a manifest excess of powers.\n\nMemorial [93], [95].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n49.\n\nDEI Bermuda's primary response to this argument is that the Tribunal was right to decide that the particular dispute brought before it under the DEI Bermuda LSA belonged in no other forum. It argued that the Tribunal properly rejected the Peru's admissibility and *ratione personae* objections because the three criteria for 'concurrent jurisdiction' were not met.61\n\nCounter-Memorial [66], [68].\n\n50.\n\nIn DEI Bermuda's view, Peru's argument that the Tribunal should have declined jurisdiction in favour of a 'hypothetically available' forum (under another LSA) provides no basis for a claim of manifest excess of powers,62 especially when there are no rules for stipulating when ICSID tribunals must decline jurisdiction, but simply principles derived from general international law. Indeed, DEI Bermuda suggests, the *Vivendi* annulment Committee confirmed that an investment arbitral tribunal was *prohibited* from declining jurisdiction that it enjoyed in favour of a domestic forum.63\n\nCounter-Memorial [69].\n\n*Ibid* [72], citing *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux/Vivendi Universal ('Vivendi') v Argentina* (First Decision on Annulment) (2002) 6 ICSID Rep 327.\n\n**B. Submissions on the Award on the Merits**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nPeru also seeks partial annulment of the Award.64 Although the parties organised their arguments in slightly different ways, their submissions were directed at the following issues:\n\n(a) The effect of the tax stability guarantee, and in particular (i) the relationship between the Investment Regulations and the tax stability guarantee;65 (ii) the meaning of legal stability under the LSA;66 and (iii) whether the MRA breached the guarantee of tax stability;67\n\n(b) The effect of DEI Bermuda's decision to invoke the amnesty procedure;68\n\n(c) The Tribunal's finding on the good faith/ *actos propios* issue;69 and\n\n(d) The question of damages.70\n\nThe parties' submissions on each of these issues are summarised in turn.\n\nPeru did not seek annulment of the Tribunal's conclusions in respect of the Depreciation Assessment, a point on which the DEI Bermuda places some reliance below.\n\nMemorial VI.C.1; Counter-Memorial V.B.\n\nMemorial VI.C.2; Counter-Memorial V.C.\n\nMemorial VI.C.3; Counter-Memorial V.D.\n\nMemorial VI.B; Counter-Memorial V.A.\n\nMemorial VI.D; Counter-Memorial V.E.\n\nMemorial VI.E; Counter-Memorial V.F.\n\n***1. Tax stability***\n----------------------\n\n52.\n\nPeru makes two arguments under this head: first, that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion that Article 23(a) of the Regulations of the Regime to Guarantee Private Investment, approved by Supreme Decree No. 162-92-EF ('**Investment Regulations**') 'linked' the DEI Bermuda LSA and the Egenor LSA; and second that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and exceeded its powers in concluding that the Peruvian Civil Code overrode Article 23(a)'s limitation on remedy.\n\n53.\n\nIn order to advance these arguments, Peru criticises four steps in the Tribunal's reasoning in its Award: (i) its treatment of the linkage between the Egenor LSA and the DEI Bermuda LSA pursuant to Article 23(a);71 (ii) its decision to supplement the specific remedy in Article 23(a) with remedies from the Civil Code;72 (iii) its determination that the guarantee of tax stability in the DEI Bermuda LSA included both the tax laws and official interpretations of them;73 and (iv) its decision that the stable interpretation of the MRL allowed companies to obtain tax advantages from a reorganisation even when conducted solely in order to secure those advantages.74 The arguments of the parties on each of these steps can be conveniently taken in turn.\n\nAward [201].\n\n*Ibid* [208].\n\n*Ibid* [219].\n\n*Ibid* [363].\n\n*(i) Linking of DEI Bermuda LSA and Egenor LSA*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n54.\n\nPeru submits that DEI Bermuda's position before the Tribunal was that the effect of Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations was that the DEI Bermuda LSA preserved the position in effect in 2001, which included the tax regime stabilised by the Egenor LSA.75 Peru contested this, arguing that neither the LSAs themselves nor the relevant Peruvian Regulations76 allowed the holder of one LSA to take benefits under another, and that it was inconsistent with the terms of the LSA itself.77 Peru's essential complaint is that, having acknowledged the parties' difference of opinion on the issue, the Tribunal only addressed the dispute in one sentence and implied that Peru accepted the DEI Bermuda's position on the effect of Article 23(a). It provided no further reasons for its conclusion, and did not address Peru's argument that Article 23(a) was a stand-alone regulatory mechanism, not a means of expanding existing LSAs.\n\nMemorial [201].\n\nPeruvian Law No. 27342 on Regulation of Legal Stability Agreements.\n\n*Ibid* [203] - [204].\n\n55.\n\nPeru disagrees with the submission of DEI Bermuda that Peru's counsel accepted the linkage effect of Article 23(a).78 Peru also argues that the Tribunal's conclusion was inconsistent with its decision to award damages extending to 2011, when the Egenor LSA - which it determined was incorporated into the DEI Bermuda LSA - only extended to 2006.\n\nReply [123] - [127].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nDEI Bermuda simply disagrees with Peru's depiction of the record. It argues that Peru did, in fact, agree that in some circumstances Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations could have the 'linkage' effect contended for by the DEI Bermuda.79 DEI Bermuda argues that when counsel for the DEI Bermuda pointed this out, and Peru had an opportunity to deny it, it did not do so.\n\nCounter-Memorial [191], [194], [198].\n\n57.\n\nDEI Bermuda also maintains that Peru is deliberately attempting to obfuscate the issue by introducing unrelated arguments - such as whether DEI Bermuda can claim for a breach of the Egenor LSA *itself -* when discussing the linkage issue. DEI Bermuda maintains that the Tribunal's analysis was simple: (1) DEI Bermuda can only claim for a breach of its LSA; (2) DEI Bermuda relies on Article 23(a) to link its LSA with the Egenor LSA; (3) The parties agree that Article 23(a) can have this effect; and (4) DEI Bermuda has a claim if the stabilisation granted to Egenor in 1996 was breached after 24 July 2001.80\n\nCounter-Memorial [207], citing Award [184], [194], [201] & [209].\n\n*(ii) Supplementing Investment Regulations with Civil Code*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n58.\n\nPeru argues that the remedy provided by Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations was a reduction in the withholding tax rate charged on dividends paid to DEI Bermuda. This remedy had no effect, however, because DEI Bermuda already paid zero withholding tax.81 The Tribunal failed to apply Article 23(a)'s plain meaning because it did not provide a sufficient basis on which to establish a limitation of liability and relied upon Article 1322 of the Civil Code, which guaranteed damages for breach of an obligation.82 Peru argues that this constituted a failure to apply the proper law, which was Article 23(a). By fashioning its own remedy, the Tribunal exceeded its powers. This also constituted a failure to state reasons, because the Tribunal did not expressly identify how it was reconciling the clash between Article 23(a) and Article 1322 of the Civil Code. Peru finally argues that the Tribunal's reasoning was contradictory, because it did not consider the effect of other Civil Code Articles on its linkage interpretation of Article 23(a). Peru also argues that the reasoning was contradictory because, having adopted the offset mechanism in Article 23(a), the Tribunal then decided that the offset mechanism in that Article was inapplicable to calculating compensation.\n\nMemorial [214].\n\nMemorial [216], citing Award [205] - [209].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n59.\n\nDEI Bermuda identifies a number of inconsistencies and illogicalities in Peru's argument.83 Substantively, it argues that the Tribunal simply determined that Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations did not provide a definitive limitation of liability, and therefore left open subsidiary bases of compensation. There was no clash between Article 23(a) and the Civil Code; the Civil Code simply supplied a supplementary basis of compensation. DEI Bermuda further argues that its PostHearing Brief provided an *'ample basis in Peruvian law'* for invoking the Civil Code in this manner.84\n\nCounter-Memorial [210] ff.\n\n*Ibid* [222].\n\n*(iii) The meaning of tax stability*\n------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n60.\n\nOne of the major disputes between the parties before the Tribunal was whether the tax stability preserved not only the tax laws themselves (Peru's argument) but also certain interpretations of them (DEI Bermuda's argument). Peru maintains that in adopting DEI Bermuda's argument, the Tribunal committed annullable errors.\n\n61.\n\nHaving referred to provisions in the Investment Regulations that guaranteed the stability of the *legislation* in force,85 the Tribunal went on to adopt DEI Bermuda's argument. Peru argues that this step was wholly unaccompanied by reasons or explanation and thus breached Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.86 It rejects DEI Bermuda's submission that the reasoning is apparent from elsewhere in the Award and disputes DEI Bermuda's suggestion that there was more convergence between the parties than Peru recognised.87 Peru also rejects DEI Bermuda's argument that its decision not to challenge another part of the Award prevents it challenging this part.\n\nAward [212] - [213].\n\nMemorial [225] - [226]; Reply [142] - [143].\n\nReply [145] - [153].\n\n62.\n\nPeru further argues that the absence of any reference to applicable Peruvian law leads to the conclusion that the Tribunal's approach to legal stability was developed *'from whole cloth'*, and not by the application of law.88 It finally argues that a failure to apply the proper law is necessarily violation of a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nMemorial [227].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n63.\n\nDEI Bermuda's response is that if the Tribunal's reasoning on this point is read in the context of the Award as a whole, then no annullable error is apparent. After reciting the parties' submissions and the evidence of the experts, DEI Bermuda argues, first, that Peru and its expert agreed that stabilised standards had to be applied in a manner that was not *'illegitimate, unreasonable, or manifestly incorrect.'*89 Secondly, they accepted that government agencies were required to apply those standards *'such as* [they had been] *applied'*.90 Finally, the parties differed on whether a new interpretation had to be 'radically different' to constitute a breach.91\n\nCounter-Memorial [248].\n\n*Ibid* [249].\n\n*Ibid* [250].\n\n64.\n\nAccording to DEI Bermuda, the Tribunal first determined that there had to be a stable interpretation when the LSA was signed for DEI Bermuda to rely upon. The Tribunal's conclusions, according to DEI Bermuda, were based on the proper law, Article 10 of the Investment Regulations,92 and were consistent with general principles of law, in particular the doctrine of good faith. Lastly, the Tribunal concluded that *'all interpretation of law must be undertaken subject to basic principles of reasonability'*.93 Thus, DEI Bermuda argues that the Tribunal's conclusion was necessitated by the arguments of the parties and the applicable law, as recited by the Tribunal.\n\nSupreme Decree No 162-92-EF (October 9, 1992).\n\nCounter-Memorial [260], referring to Award [226].\n\n65.\n\nLastly, DEI Bermuda argues that if the Tribunal's conclusions on this point should be annulled for the reasons advanced by Peru, then so too should the Tribunal's conclusions as to the Tax Depreciation Assessment (of which Peru does not seek annulment) that were wholly dependent upon that same determination.94\n\n*Ibid* [263].\n\n*(iv) Interpretation of the Merger Revaluation Law*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n66.\n\nPeru submits that DEI Bermuda presented three propositions, all of which the Tribunal accepted: (i) that the regime stabilised for Egenor in 1996 included a stable interpretation of the MRL; (ii) that that interpretation allowed companies to gain tax advantages from a reorganisation even when the reorganisation was conducted solely for that purpose; and (iii) that the MRA's view of the Power North merger was inconsistent with that stable interpretation.\n\n67.\n\nPeru criticises the Tribunal's adoption of the second proposition. First, it argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law in determining the criteria for a stable interpretation. Secondly, its application of these criteria was ambiguous and contradictory, because it only relied on well-established practice but did not explain whose practice qualified, and it thus failed to state the reasons for its conclusion.95 Thirdly, the Tribunal failed to address Peru's argument that government input is required for a stable interpretation to be formed. Fourthly, the Tribunal contradicted itself in finding, first, that there may not have been a single stable interpretation of the 1994 MRA in 1996, but second, that it did have a stable interpretation in 1996.\n\nMemorial [234]; and see further Reply [164] - [172].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n68.\n\nDEI Bermuda maintains that Peru's arguments under this head constitute no more than a request for the Committee to analyse the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence, a task that is beyond the Committee's remit.\n\n69.\n\nFirst, DEI Bermuda argues that there can be no failure to apply the proper law, because the *content* of the law - the meaning of stability - had already been identified. The Tribunal's task was to *apply* the law to the factual circumstances; there was no further standard to be determined. According to DEI Bermuda, there is no basis to review the assessment the Tribunal reached on the basis of the evidence. Secondly, DEI Bermuda argues that-even if the Committee could examine that issue-the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence was not ambiguous or contradictory.96\n\nCounter-Memorial [276] - [285].\n\n70.\n\nThirdly, DEI Bermuda maintains that the Tribunal was not obliged to consider any particular form of evidence (in this case as to the need for government input in forming a stable interpretation) and, in any case, did consider the relevance of government practice.97 Finally, DEI Bermuda argues that the reasons given for the Tribunal's conclusion that there was a stable interpretation of the MRL in 1996 were not contradictory.98\n\n*Ibid* [286] - [290].\n\n*Ibid* [292] - [294].\n\n***2. Tax Amnesty***\n--------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n71.\n\nPeru submits that it made two arguments to the Tribunal. First, it argued that, by invoking the amnesty procedure, Egenor accepted that the SUNAT assessment was substantively valid and that it did not violate any of Egenor's rights, thus barring any argument by Egenor to the contrary.99 Secondly, it argued that by invoking the amnesty procedure Egenor waived its rights to challenge the assessment. It disputes DEI Bermuda's suggestion that it did not make this distinction before the Tribunal.100 It argues, finally, that if Egenor was barred from challenging the assessment so too was DEI Bermuda.\n\nMemorial [188].\n\nReply [107].\n\n72.\n\nPeru argues that the Tribunal failed to address the first argument, regarding what it calls the '*substantive* effect of tax amnesty'.101 This failure, Peru argues, contributed to the ultimate finding against it and constitutes a failure to state reasons and a manifest excess of powers, as the Tribunal failed to decide an issue put to it.\n\nMemorial [192].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n73.\n\nDEI Bermuda's first argument is that Peru never presented two arguments -procedural and substantive - to the Tribunal, but simply made one 'monolithic' claim that accepting amnesty prevented the tax debt from being challenged, relying on two bases: the terms of the *Sistema Especial de Actualizaci\u00f3n y Pago de Deudas Tributarias* ('**SEAP**') itself and the principle of equitable estoppel.102 DEI Bermuda argues that at no point did Peru distinguish the two alleged arguments.\n\nCounter-Memorial [168].\n\n74.\n\nDEI Bermuda's second argument is that, even if the Tribunal had explicitly acknowledged the two separate arguments, it would have made no difference to the outcome. DEI Bermuda suggests that the substantive waiver argument is an attempt to repackage Peru's argument that the DEI Bermuda's claims were 'in fact tax claims'.103 The Tribunal rejected the suggestion that the claims were for breach of Peruvian tax law in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Award, and therefore any estoppel in relation to the substance of the assessments was irrelevant, because the claims were founded on a breach of the tax stabilisation guarantee in the LSA, not a breach of Peruvian tax law.104 DEI Bermuda finally notes that tribunals are not obliged to consider every argument put to them, nor provide reasons for rejecting every argument unless it is necessary to their decision.105\n\n*Ibid* [177].\n\nAward [179].\n\nCounter-Memorial [184], citing *MCI Power Group LC v Ecuador* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/03/6 (19 October 2009), [67] ; and *Empresas Lucchetti SA (sub nom. Industria Nacional de Alimentos SA) v Peru* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/03/4 (5 September 2007), [128].\n\n***3. Good faith/*****actos propios (estoppel)**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n75.\n\nPeru submits that the Tribunal developed its own test for the application of the obligation of good faith embodied in the Peruvian *actos propios* (estoppel) doctrine.106 It then concluded that the State had effectively represented that Egenor would be permitted to claim tax benefits under the MRL as a result of the merger with Power North, and that the subsequent MRA contradicted that representation.107\n\nAward [249] - [250].\n\nMemorial [244], citing Award [436] - [442].\n\n76.\n\nFirst, Peru argues that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its conclusion that DEI Bermuda could 'stand in the shoes' of, and take the benefit of, representations made to Egenor and Dominion.108 Secondly, the Tribunal did not explain why DEI Bermuda could, in 2001, take the benefit of representations made in 1996 while ignoring contrary representations that had been made in the interim (notably SUNAT's unfavourable opinion in 1999).\n\n*Ibid* [247].\n\n77.\n\nPeru then argues that the Tribunal failed to apply Peruvian law to determine the content of the *actos propios* doctrine. Instead it applied international law principles when it had already explained that no gap or inconsistency justifying the application of international law existed. Nor did it, in Peru's submission, explain why it ignored Peruvian law or, in particular, why it used international law109 to adopt the final limb of its test, which effectively reversed the burden of proof on the question of reliance.\n\nSpecifically Article 46 of the Vienna Convention of the Law on Treaties, cited at [248] of the Award.\n\n78.\n\nPeru also argues that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for which it relied on the statements and actions of certain agencies and officials other than SUNAT, when Peru argued at length that only SUNAT's representations counted.110 Lastly, Peru argues that the Tribunal never explained how it resolved the contradiction between its finding that Pedro S\u00e1nchez Gamarra, the Chairman of Electroper\u00fa, never denied receiving instructions from the Peruvian Government, and Peru's claim that he *did* deny receiving such instructions. According to Peru, both of these failures provide a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*Ibid* [256] - [258].\n\n79.\n\nResponding to DEI Bermuda's argument that Tribunal's finding on *actos propios* is unreviewable because it was *obiter*, Peru disputes whether the finding was in fact irrelevant to the decision.111 It argues that if the Tribunal spent more than 20 pages on the issue, it must be relevant. Lastly, if the *ad hoc* Committee annuls the Tribunal's primary findings, then the Tribunal's secondary findings on *actos propios* may in fact determine whether Peru is liable.\n\nReply [181] - [183].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nDEI Bermuda argues that the Tribunal's findings on this point were *obiter dicta*, and therefore cannot provide a basis for annulment.112 The Tribunal made it clear that its findings on the point were distinct from its finding on liability.113\n\nCounter-Memorial [296], citing *Vivendi supra* n 63, [65] and [86].\n\n*Ibid* [297], citing Award [379].\n\n***4. Damages***\n----------------\n\n*(a) Peru's argument*\n---------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe parties each presented expert reports that quantified the effect of the allegedly wrongful MRA: DEI Bermuda a report from Navigant Consulting, and Peru a report from Macroconsult. The Tribunal noted that it found Navigant's report easier to follow, and that Macroconsult's report lacked supporting data that the Tribunal required to properly verify its conclusions.114\n\nAward [481] - [483].\n\n82.\n\nPeru argues that the Tribunal did not explain what data were missing from Macroconsult's report. This failure to provide explanation amounts, according to Peru, to a failure to give reasons and thus provides a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, it never gave Peru an opportunity to amend the report, and nor did it call Macroconsult's lead expert as a witness to be cross-examined. This, Peru claims, denied it a fair opportunity to put its case in breach of a fundamental rule of procedure, thus providing a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d).115\n\nMemorial [270] - [272]; Reply [185] - [188].\n\n*(b) DEI Bermuda's argument*\n----------------------------\n\n83.\n\nFirst, DEI Bermuda maintains that Peru had ample opportunity to present its case, submitting two expert reports, cross-examining DEI Bermuda's witness, making supplemental submissions on damages on 1 June 2007 and devoting seven pages of its Post-Hearing Submission to the question. DEI Bermuda maintains that the Tribunal simply assessed the evidence as Peru acknowledged it was entitled to do and adequately explained why it rejected Peru's evidence, thus providing reasons. According to DEI Bermuda, Peru essentially expects the Tribunal to have assisted it in making out its case. DEI Bermuda suggests that it is a 'self-evident' proposition that a tribunal has no duty to assist a party in determining what evidence is sufficient to make out its case.116\n\nCounter-Memorial [303] - [310]; citing *Wena Hotels Ltd v Egypt* (Decision on Annulment) (2002) 6 ICSID Rep 129, [72].\n\n**III. THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A The scope of review under Article 52 ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nPeru seeks annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and, in the alternative, a partial annulment of the Award under three heads of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, namely:117\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n*Supra* [10] - [11].\n\n85.\n\nIt is not necessary, for the purposes of this Decision, to restate compendiously all of the principles applicable to the construction of the scope of the powers of an *ad hoc* committee to annul an award under Article 52. The *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the submission made by Peru that Article 52 is to be *'read and applied on its terms in order to maintain the balance struck by the state parties to the ICSID Convention'* and that this is a *'case specific analysis within the framework of Article 52 itself.'*118 But that is not to say that Article 52 is to be interpreted in a vacuum. On the contrary, the customary international law rules of interpretation (which have consistently been held to be accurately stated and codified in Articles 31 - 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969119) are as applicable to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention as they are to other treaty obligations.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 120/17-20, 122/1-3.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ('Vienna Convention') (signed 23 May 1969, entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331; *Territorial Dispute (Libya v Chad)* [1994] ICJ Rep 6, [41]; *Mondev International Ltd v United States of America* (Award) 6 ICSID Rep 192, [43].\n\n86.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the Vienna Convention sets the application of ordinary meaning within a larger matrix of good faith, context (as more particularly defined in Article 31(2)) and object and purpose, in providing that:\n\n*A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n87.\n\nTo this central exercise, Article 31(3) adds other matters to be taken into account. These include *'any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties '* (Article 31(3)(c)), a reference which itself denotes all applicable sources of international law, including general principles of law.120 Article 31(4) further permits a special meaning to be ascribed to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. Article 32 then also permits reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention in order to confirm a meaning arrived at by applying Article 31 or to determine the meaning when the application of Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure or manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nArticle 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n88.\n\nIn carrying out this task of interpretation, an *ad hoc* committee may legitimately refer to decisions of other annulment committees, not because they are formally binding on it (which they are not); nor to determine whether, and to what extent, there may exist some trend of decisions. Rather, the decisions of other committees may help to illuminate specific aspects of the interpretative process which the Committee is charged to undertake, just as, in appropriate cases, reference to wider sources of jurisprudence may help to determine the existence of a general principle of law applicable to the interpretation of the content of Article 52, or indeed other relevant provisions of the Convention.\n\n89.\n\nThe analysis of any particular tribunal decision or award which an annulment committee is required to carry out under Article 52(1) must perforce be case-specific, since the committee's task is to review the conduct of a particular tribunal: its constitution; its powers; the conduct of its members; its procedure and the reasons given in its award. But this is not, of course, to say (and Peru does not contend otherwise) that the Committee may consider the objections taken by a party to the decision or award of a tribunal in isolation from the grounds specified in Article 52(1). To do so would amount to an appeal - a remedy which the Contracting States decided by Article 53(1) should not be available. Thus, where a party objects to any particular aspect of a tribunal's process or decision, it must relate that objection to a specific ground for annulment under Article 52(1), explaining how and why the objection falls within the specific ground invoked.\n\n90.\n\nIn the present case, two further general observations are germane: (a) as to the relationship between the various grounds of annulment under Article 52(1); and (b) as to the requirement of manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b).\n\n91.\n\nPeru bases its Application for Annulment compendiously on Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e). As set out in more detail in Part II of this Decision, Peru often invokes all three heads of Article 52(1) in relation to the same subject-matter. This practice is entirely permissible within the framework of Article 52(1), which permits a party to request annulment *'on one or more of the following grounds.'* It has been a frequent feature of ICSID annulment applications to submit that one and the same aspect of an award constitutes a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and a failure to state reasons.121\n\nSchreuer et al *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2ed, 2009) 933.\n\n92.\n\nHowever, Article 52(1) is carefully divided into separate clauses, each dealing with a separate ground for annulment. Reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* confirms that the framers of the Convention took particular care to avoid any elision of different concepts in drafting Article 52, separating, for example, the ground in clause (e) from clause (d).122 Each of the grounds identified by the Contracting States in Article 52 as sufficient for the annulment of an award has a different object and purpose. Thus, an assessment of whether the scope of the powers conferred upon a tribunal has been exceeded involves quite different considerations to whether, in the exercise of those powers, it has failed to observe a fundamental rule of procedure. So, too, an examination of the procedure adopted by the tribunal involves distinct considerations to an analysis of its statement of reasons for a decision or award. While, therefore, the possibility that the same aspect of an award may constitute several grounds for annulment under Article 52 cannot be excluded, if a party wishes to advance such a case, it must identify separately how the very different considerations involved in each of these enquiries are nevertheless provoked by the same aspect of an impugned award.\n\n*History of the Convention*, Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention (*'History'*) Vol I, 230, 232.\n\n93.\n\nIn its Application for Annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction, Peru (whilst referring in addition to Articles 52(1)(d) & (e)) places the primary emphasis of its complaint on manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b). Peru also relies on Article 52(1)(b), together with clauses (d) & (e), in its application for Partial Annulment of the Award.\n\n94.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) plays an important role in the control of awards under the annulment process, since it is directly related to principle of mutual consent which, as is expressly recognised in the Preamble to the ICSID Convention and in the Report of the Directors of the World Bank on it, is fundamental to the operation of the obligations assumed under the Convention and to the jurisdiction of the Centre.123\n\nPreamble to the ICSID Convention, recitals (6) & (7); Report of the Executive Directors, [23] - [25], which begins: *'Consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.'*\n\n95.\n\nThe question whether an ICSID arbitral tribunal has exceeded its powers is determined by reference to the agreement of the parties. It is that agreement or *compromis* from which the tribunal's powers flow *,* and which accordingly determines the extent of those powers. In the case of a claim under an investment agreement, the powers of the tribunal are determined by reference to the arbitration agreement included in or in respect of the investment agreement and by the ICSID Convention (which the agreement to arbitrate incorporates by reference). Read together, these two elements constitute the arbitration agreement and therefore prescribe the parameters of the tribunal's powers.124 As the International Law Commission put it in formulating its seminal Draft Rules on Arbitral Procedure from which Article 52 was derived, an excess of powers:125\n\n*...is a question which is to be answered by a careful comparison of the award or other contested action by the tribunal with the relevant provisions of the* compromis *. A departure from the terms of submission or excess of jurisdiction should be clear and substantial and not doubtful and frivolous.*\n\nAccord Schreuer *supra* n 121, 938.\n\nInternational Law Commission, 'Commentary on the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure' UN Doc A/CN.4/92, 108.\n\n96.\n\nThe concept of the 'powers' of a tribunal goes further than its jurisdiction, and refers to the scope of the task which the parties have charged the tribunal to perform in discharge of its mandate, and the manner in which the parties have agreed that task is to be performed. That is why, for example, a failure to apply the law chosen by the parties to the determination of the dispute (but not a misapplication of it) was accepted by the Contracting States of the ICSID Convention to be an excess of powers,126 a point also accepted by other annulment committees.127 In considering annulment on this basis, it is necessary to bear in mind the point made on annulment in *Wena* that:128\n\n*The Committee is mindful of the views expressed in* Klockner I, Amco I *and* MINE *to the effect that the failure to apply the proper law may constitute a manifest excess of power and a ground for annulment. It is also mindful of the distinction between failure to apply the proper law and the error* in judicando *drawn in* Kl\u00f6ckner I *, and the consequential need to avoid the reopening of the merits in proceedings that would turn annulment into appeal.*\n\n*History* Vol II, Part 1, 518.\n\n*E.g.* *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7) (Decision on Annulment), June 5, 2007, ('*Soufraki v UAE'*), [85].\n\n*Wena supra* n 116, [22].\n\n97.\n\nFurther, a failure to decide a question entrusted to the tribunal and requiring its decision may also constitute an excess of powers, since the tribunal has also in that event failed to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by virtue of the parties' agreement.129\n\n*Ibid* paragraph 44; *Vivendi v Argentina supra* n 63, [86].\n\n98.\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee must also be satisfied that the tribunal's excess of powers is manifest.130 As the committee in *MCI* put it, Article 52(1)(b) *'suggests a somewhat higher degree of proof than a searching analysis of the findings of the Tribunal.'*131 No distinction is to be drawn in this regard between the standard to be applied to determining an excess of power based on an alleged excess of jurisdiction and any other excess of power. In both cases, the excess must be manifest.132\n\n*Wena supra* n 128, [25]. See also *CDC Group PLC v Republic of the Seychelles* (Decision on Annulment) (2005), 11 ICSID Rep 237, [41]; *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v Guinea* (Decision on Annulment) (1989) 4 ICSID Rep 79, [4.06]; *Mitchell v. The Democratic Republic of Congo*, (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7 (1 November 2006), [20].\n\n*Supra n* 105, [49].\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A/S v Kazakhstan* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/05/16 (25 March 2010), [96].\n\n99.\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee will not therefore annul an award if the tribunal's disposition on a question of law is tenable, even if the committee considers that it is incorrect as a matter of law.133 The existence of a manifest excess of powers can only be assessed by an *ad hoc* committee in consideration of the factual and legal elements upon which the arbitral tribunal founded its decision and/or award based on the parties' submissions. Without reopening debates on questions of fact, a committee can take into account the facts of the case as they were in the record before the tribunal to check whether it could come to its solution, however debatable. Is the opinion of the tribunal so untenable that it cannot be supported by reasonable arguments? A debatable solution is not amenable to annulment, since the excess of powers would not then be 'manifest.'\n\n*Kl \u00f6 ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v Republic of Cameroon* Case No. ARB/81/2, (Decision on Annulment) (1985) 2 ICSID Rep 95, [52]; and see, to like effect, *Case concerning the* *Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea-Bissau v Senegal)* ICJ Rep. 1991, 53, [47]-[48]; *Government of Sudan v Sudan People's Liberation Movement/ Army (the 'Abyei' arbitration)* (PCA, 22 July 2009), [508]-[510], followed in *Rumeli ibid*.\n\n100.\n\nThe Committee will have to return to the standard under Article 52(1)(b) in more detail when it comes to apply it to the facts of the present case. But it is first necessary to summarise the essential elements of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction. This, to adopt the language of the International Law Commission, is the first contested action of the Tribunal, which must then be compared with the relevant provisions of the *compromis* and then tested against the requirement of manifestness.\n\n**B Decision on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n***1. The Tribunal's Approach***\n--------------------------------\n\n*(a) Procedure*\n---------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal established the following procedure for dealing with Peru's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and admissibility of claims:\n\n(a) At its first session held on July 28, 2004, the Tribunal decided to suspend proceedings on the merits pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3) and to bifurcate the proceedings. It invited each party to plead the questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, stating that it would decide at a later stage whether to deal with these objections as a preliminary question or join them to the merits of the dispute.134\n\n(b) The parties submitted respectively a Memorial, Counter-Memorial, Reply and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility.135\n\n(c) The Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction at the seat of the Centre in Washington on March 29-30, 2005. At the hearing, the Tribunal heard oral pleading on behalf of both parties. Further, and following the Tribunal's request, the Tribunal heard evidence of one witness nominated by each party on the history of the negotiations between the parties in connection with the issues relevant to jurisdiction.136\n\n(d) Following deliberations, the Tribunal delivered its Decision on Jurisdiction on February 1, 2006. It unanimously decided that:\n\n*The dispute submitted by DEI Bermuda is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.137*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [10].\n\n*Ibid* [11] - [12]. Each of these pleadings is exhibited in the record of these annulment proceedings.\n\n*Ibid* [20] - [21].\n\n*Ibid Dispositif,* [168]. Peru's objections to admissibility were joined to the merits.\n\n*(b) Reasons*\n-------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal began its analysis of the issues of jurisdiction by setting out the factual background, observing in summary that:138\n\n(a) LSAs were provided for within the legislative framework adopted by Peru in the early 1990s, which was designed to attract and promote investment.139 Such LSAs had a distinct juridical character within the Peruvian legal system, being governed by the Civil Code and not subject to unilateral modification by the State.140\n\n(b) Egenor was established by Peru to hold state-owned energy generating assets which were to be privatised. Initially, a controlling interest in Egenor was acquired by Dominion Energy Inc (**'Dominion'**). However, in 1999, Duke Energy set about acquiring Egenor through a series of transactions, which led, by the end of that year, to it owning some 90% of Egenor for which it had paid US$288 million.141 On December 18, 2002, Duke Energy, through DEI Bermuda, made a US$200 million capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings, which used the funds to acquire the interests already held by other Duke companies in Egenor.142\n\n(c) Peru had entered into LSAs with each of Egenor, Dominion, and Dominion's locally-incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary.143 The Dominion LSA, but none of the other LSAs, included an ICSID arbitration agreement.\n\n(d) Duke Energy *'sought to obtain the same investment protection, through LSAs, as Dominion had obtained.'*144 This could not be done through assignment of the Dominion LSA. The parties therefore explored alternative structures to achieve the same result that would have been achieved, if the Dominion LSA had been assignable.145 Duke Energy's proposal, submitted in February 2000, involved an application for a DEI Bermuda LSA, which application was made on June 20, 2000. Peru provided a draft of this on April 3, 2001. Duke Energy requested the inclusion of an ICSID arbitration agreement. The DEI Bermuda LSA was finally executed on July 24, 2001, effective immediately. It included an ICSID arbitration agreement in exactly the same terms as the Dominion LSA.146\n\n*Ibid* Part II.\n\n*Ibid* [24] - [27].\n\n*Ibid* [28] - [31].\n\n*Ibid* [32] - [40].\n\n*Ibid* [45].\n\n*Ibid* [46] - [49].\n\n*Ibid* [50].\n\n*Ibid* [54].\n\n*Ibid* [55] - [58].\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal then dealt with each of Peru's objections to jurisdiction, *ratione materiae, ratione personae,* and *ratione temporis,* in turn.\n\n104.\n\nDealing with jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the Tribunal approached the question on the basis that the arbitration agreement was to be interpreted in good faith, without adopting an *a priori* strict or broad construction.147 The parties had agreed by clause 9 of the DEI Bermuda LSA to submit to arbitration *'any dispute, controversy or claim between them, concerning the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement.'* Accordingly, the Tribunal interpreted its task as being to determine whether the dispute before it did indeed concern those matters.148\n\n*Ibid* [76] - [78], citing *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v Senegal* (Award) (1988) 2 ICSID Rep 164, [4.10]\u00a0and *Amco Asia Corp v Indonesia* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (1983) 1 ICSID Rep 389, 394, [14].\n\n*Ibid* [82].\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal turned to the Claimant's Request for Arbitration to determine the scope of the dispute. It enumerated the claims of DEI Bermuda as follows:149\n\n*1. breach of the guarantee of non-discrimination and equal treatment of DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, in violation of Clause Three, Section 5 of the DEI Bermuda LSA;*\n\n*2. breach of the guarantee of tax stabilization with respect to DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, in violation of Clause Three, Section I of the DEI Bermuda LSA;*\n\n*3. breach of the guarantee regarding the free repatriation of DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, in violation of Clause Three, Section 3 of the DEI Bermuda LSA; and*\n\n*4. breach of the obligation of good faith and fair dealing and the* Doctrina de los actos propios *in connection with DEI Bermuda's investment in Peru, obligations that are implied under the Peruvian* Civil Code *in all contracts, and here specifically in the DEI Bermuda LSA*.\n\n*Ibid* [83], citing Request for Arbitration [42] - [56].\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal then set out the terms of Clauses Two and Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA. By Clause Three, Peru makes a number of specific guarantees of legal stability for DEI Bermuda *'in connection with the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO.'* Clause Two describes DEI Bermuda's obligation as being to make capital contributions to DEI Peru in the amount of US$200 million.150\n\n*Ibid* [85].\n\n107.\n\nObserving that it must not prejudge the merits of the claim, the Tribunal held that it task was *'simply [to] examine whether the merits dispute, as stated by Claimant, is within its jurisdiction.'*151 Citing prior ICSID jurisprudence, the Tribunal considered that it was only required to be satisfied that *'* prima facie *the claim, as stated by the Claimants when initiating this arbitration, is within the jurisdictional mandate of ICSID arbitration, and consequently of this Tribunal.'*152\n\n*Ibid* [86].\n\n*Ibid* [87], citing *Amco Asia supra* n 147, 405, [38].\n\n108.\n\nHolding, contrary to Peru's submission, that such a *prima facie* case had been established, the Tribunal found that the merits of the claims under Clause 3 (and under Peruvian law) were not to be limited by a literal reading of Clause 2 which would restrict its application to DEI Bermuda's US$200 million capital investment in DEI Peru.153 This was so for four reasons:154\n\n*1. the capital contribution, without more, would not appear to satisfy the requirement, under Peruvian law, that an \"investment\" in relation to which an LSA is granted contribute to economically productive activity (i.e., that it be an \"active\" investment);*\n\n*2. the capital contribution was not an isolated transaction, but was rather one of many transactions deliberately concluded as part of the privatization of Egenor;*\n\n*3. a narrow focus on the wording of Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA as an indication of the \"investment\" elevates form over substance, by ignoring the purpose of the capital contribution, which was described in the application DEI Bermuda submitted for the DEI Bermuda LSA referred to in Clause One thereof; and*\n\n*4. in determining their jurisdiction, ICSID tribunals have recognized the unity of an investment even when that investment involves complex arrangements expressed in a number of successive and legally distinct agreements*.\n\n*Ibid* [88] - [92].\n\n*Ibid* [92].\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to develop each of these four reasons in detail.155 But it concluded its analysis by observing that the fact that the Tribunal was entitled to take into consideration the overall investment did not affect the scope of the claims which could be permissibly advanced:156\n\n*Claimant will need to substantiate its claims, during the merits phase, by reference solely to the guarantees contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and not those contained in any of the other LSAs. This is a function of the specific wording of Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, and of the legal basis of the Claimant's claims as formulated in the Request for Arbitration, namely the alleged breach of the protections contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and not in any of the other LSAs.*\n\n*Ibid* [94] - [134].\n\n*Ibid* [132].\n\n110.\n\nDealing with jurisdiction *ratione personae,* the Tribunal decided that Peru's objections in this regard, *i.e.* that the claims were those of Egenor or other entities who had not submitted to ICSID arbitration, were in reality subject-matter objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. There was no doubt that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae* in respect of a dispute between DEI Bermuda and Peru and the objections relating to subject-matter had already been dealt with.157\n\n*Ibid* [136] - [138].\n\n111.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turned to jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* Peru had contended that the claims were outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they were addressed to matters arising before the DEI Bermuda LSA entered into force on July 24, 2001, being concerned in particular with Egenor's tax liability for the tax years 1996 to 1999.158 DEI Bermuda argued that the relevant time decisive of the Tribunal's jurisdiction was when the parties' legal dispute arose.\n\n*Ibid* [146].\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that *'[w]hat is decisive of the Tribunal's jurisdiction* ratione temporis *is the point in time at which the instant legal dispute between the parties arose, not the point in time during which the factual matters on which the dispute is based took place.'159*\n\n*Ibid* [148], citing *Maffezini v Spain* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (2000) 5 ICSID Rep 387, [95].\n\n113.\n\nIt then explained:160\n\n*Here, the legal dispute arose only after the Respondent imposed the Tax Assessment on DEI Egenor, on November 22, 2001, several months after the effective date of the DEI Bermuda LSA. It was in the Tax Assessment, and not before, that SUNAT decreed a tax liability of approximately US$48 million against DEI Egenor for what SUNAT determined, at that time, were tax underpayments in 1996 through 1999.*\n\n*Naturally, during the merits phase, the Tribunal will have full jurisdiction to consider all of the factual matters related to the dispute, including those that preceded the effective date of the DEI Bermuda LSA, for the purposes of determining whether the Respondent violated the DEI Bermuda LSA through conduct which took place or reached its \"consummation point\" after its entry into force (i.e., the Tax Assessment).*\n\n*Ibid* [149] - [150], citing *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v Mexico* (Award) (2004) 43 ILM 133, [66].\n\n114.\n\nHaving determined in this Decision that the dispute was within its jurisdiction, the Tribunal then proceeded to the merits of the claim, and did not revisit the jurisdictional issues in its Award.\n\n***2. The character of the Decision on Jurisdiction***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nBefore proceeding to consider *seriatim* each of Peru's arguments that, in assuming jurisdiction, the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers, it is necessary to consider at the outset the character of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, which the Committee is called upon to annul. This occasioned some discussion at the annulment hearing in response to a question from the Committee.161 It is important to be clear about the matter, since the manner in which the Tribunal exercised its powers necessarily impacts upon the Committee's review.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 336-342 (Peru); 453/19-454/14 (DEI Bermuda).\n\n116.\n\nAs noted above,162 the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that its task was *'simply [to] examine whether the merits dispute, as stated by Claimant, is within its jurisdiction.'*163 The Tribunal, referring to prior ICSID case-law and to Peru's Reply, characterised this as a requirement to establish a 'prima facie *case'.*164 It found that:165\n\n*Claimant has made a* prima facie *case that the dispute falls within its jurisdiction, in the sense that the claims stated in the Request for Arbitration are capable of constituting a breach of the DEI Bermuda LSA.*\n\nBut it nevertheless held in its *dispositif* that the dispute *'is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.'*166\n\n*Supra* [107].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [86].\n\n*Ibid* [87] - [88].\n\n*Ibid* [90].\n\n*Ibid* [168].\n\n117.\n\nIt has become common-place in ICSID jurisprudence for tribunals to invoke a so-called *'prima facie* standard' as applicable to jurisdictional challenges,167 and to support their analysis by reference to the decisions of other international tribunals, including the International Court of Justice.168 But this expression is apt to mislead, since it is in reality a short-hand for two quite distinct aspects of the jurisdictional enquiry, particularly as it relates to the determination of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* only the first of which imports a *prima facie* qualification.\n\nSheppard \"The jurisdictional threshold of a prima-facie case\" in Muchlinski et al *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (2009) 932.\n\nNotably in *Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)* (Preliminary Objection) [1996] ICJ Rep 803.\n\n118.\n\nFirst, since - as the Tribunal here correctly observed - it *'must not in any way prejudge the merits of the case',*169 an arbitral tribunal must, for the purpose of its jurisdictional determination, presume the facts which found the claim on the merits as alleged by the claimant to be true (unless they are plainly without any foundation). In that sense, its determination may be said to be *prima facie.* But, second, in the application of those presumed facts to the legal question of jurisdiction before it, the tribunal must objectively characterise those facts in order to determine finally whether they fall within or outside the scope of the parties' consent. In making this determination, the tribunal may not simply adopt the claimant's characterisation without examination. In this way, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is contested strikes the balance between avoiding pre-judging the merits, on the one hand, and objectively determining the question of jurisdiction on the other.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [86].\n\n119.\n\nThat an objective and final determination must be made was a central element in the reasoning of the International Court of Justice in *Oil Platforms* when it observed:170\n\n*[T]he Court cannot limit itself to noting that one of the Parties maintains that such a dispute exists, and the other denies it. It must ascertain whether the violations of the Treaty of 1955 pleaded by Iran do or do not fall within the provisions of the Treaty and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction* ratione materiae *to entertain, pursuant to Article XXI, paragraph 2.*\n\n*Supra n* 168 *,* [16].\n\n120.\n\nThe distinction here drawn was well elucidated by Judge Higgins in her Separate Opinion, when she said:171\n\n*Where the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application and interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be definitive....It does not suffice, in the making of this definitive decision, for the Court to decide that it has heard claims relating to the various articles that are \"arguable questions\" or that are \"bona fide questions of interpretation\"..*\n\n*The only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims of Iran are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept* pro tem *the facts as alleged by Iran to be true and in that light to interpret Articles I, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of Iran's claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.*\n\n*Ibid,* Higgins Separate Opinion, [31].\n\n121.\n\nThe same distinction was made in the investment arbitration context by the Tribunal in *UPS v Canada* when it held:172\n\n*[The Tribunal] must conduct a* prima facie *analysis of the NAFTA obligations, which UPS seeks to invoke, and determine whether the facts as alleged are capable of constituting a violation of these obligations.*\n\n*That formulation rightly makes it plain that a claimant party's mere assertion that a dispute is within the Tribunal's jurisdiction is not conclusive.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The test is of course provisional in the sense that the facts alleged have still to be established at the merits stage. But any ruling about the legal meaning of the jurisdictional provision, for instance about its outer limits, is binding on the parties.*\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc v Canada* (Award on Jurisdiction) (2002) 7 ICSID Rep 285, 296-7; and see, to like effect: *Continental Casualty Co v Argentina* (Decision on Jurisdiction) ICSID Case No ARB/03/9 (2006), [60] - [64]; accord Douglas *The International Law of Investment Claims* (2009) Rules 27 & 28, [502] - [527].\n\n122.\n\nPrecisely this distinction was accepted by both parties in their submissions before this Committee.173 Moreover, irrespective of the short-hand expression used in paragraph 90 of its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Committee is in no doubt that this is in fact the basis on which the Tribunal actually proceeded. Without making any final finding about the merits of the factual claims advanced by DEI Bermuda, the Tribunal made an objective determination of the question whether those facts, as alleged, were capable of falling within the parameters of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It was neither required to, nor did, revisit those issues at any subsequent stage in the proceedings.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 336-342 (Peru), 453/19 - 454/14 (DEI Bermuda).\n\n123.\n\nThus, for the purpose of this Committee's review on annulment, it is entitled to and does proceed on the basis that it has before it, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal's definitive determination of the legal questions relating to the its jurisdiction. With that in mind, it is now possible to consider whether in confirming its jurisdiction in the way that it did, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n***3. Jurisdiction*** **ratione materiae**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Manifest excess of powers***\n-----------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nPeru contends, in applying for annulment, that the Tribunal did manifestly exceed its powers in asserting jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in two principal respects: (i) in failing to apply the applicable law to the determination of the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement; and (ii) in taking an approach to the meaning of the DEI Bermuda LSA which manifestly exceeded its scope.174 Peru contends, in short, that the Tribunal was bound, but failed, to apply solely Peruvian law to the scope of its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and that, had it done so, it would have been bound to adopt a literal construction of the DEI Bermuda LSA which would have excluded the Claimant's claims.\n\n*Supra* [31] - [36].\n\n*(i) Application of the applicable law*\n---------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nPeru's objection based on the Tribunal's alleged failure to apply the applicable law to the determination of its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* arises in a particular context, which distinguishes this case in at least two respects from many other challenges based on this ground: (i) as to the issue to which the question of applicable law applies; and (ii) as to the source of the parties' consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n126.\n\nIn the first place, the Tribunal was seized of an issue of jurisdiction and not of substance. When a Tribunal has failed to apply the law chosen by the parties to the merits of the dispute, it may exceed its powers because it is not determining the dispute in accordance with the mandate entrusted to it by the parties. The same may be the case where the parties have not expressly chosen the applicable law, since, in that event, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention (which describes one of the 'Powers and Functions of the Tribunal') applies to mandate the approach to be taken by the tribunal to determination of the applicable law.\n\n127.\n\nSome argument in the present case was devoted to the proper construction of Article 42(1),175 but, as Peru rightly accepted in the course of the annulment hearing, Article 42 does not apply to a determination of jurisdiction.176 It is concerned with the Tribunal's decision on the substantive dispute between the parties. Thus, *ad hoc* committees as well as tribunals have confirmed that *'the jurisdiction of the Centre is determined not by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention but by Article 25.'*177\n\nMemorial [122]; Reply [82]; Transcript, Day 1, 36.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 461/10 - 462/3.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co v Argentina* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/01/8 (September 25, 2007), [68] and see also *MCI supra* n 105, [40]. For the confirmation of this approach at the Tribunal stage see: *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd v Egypt* (*'SPP v Egypt'*) (Decision on Jurisdiction No 2) (1988) 3 ICSID Rep 131, and the further decisions cited in Schreuer *supra* n 121, 550-2.\n\n128.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides, in relevant part:\n\n*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State. and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.*\n\nThus, the critical question for the extent of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the present case was simply whether the dispute was one which the parties had consented in writing to submit to the Centre.\n\n129.\n\nThe parties' consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre in the present case is founded upon an arbitration agreement between the parties, which is contained in an investment agreement, namely the DEI Bermuda LSA. It is not founded upon a state's unilateral offer of arbitration contained in a bilateral investment treaty, which is accepted by the investor in writing. Submission to ICSID jurisdiction by consent contained in treaties has, in recent years, become more common than submission pursuant to contract. But when the ICSID Convention was formulated, the Convention's framers envisaged that the first basis for consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre would be by contract between the host state and the investor.178\n\nReport of the Executive Directors, [24], and see Broches (1972) 136 *Recueil des Cours* 331, 335.\n\n130.\n\nIn the present case, the arbitration agreement is contained in Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, which provides:\n\n*It being the intention of both parties that problems arising in connection with the enforcement of this agreement be resolved as expeditiously as possible, the parties agree hereinafter that any dispute, controversy or claim between them, relative to the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement, shall be submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes to be resolved by de jure international arbitration, pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Rules set forth in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States which was approved by Peru pursuant to Legislative Resolution N. 26210.*\n\n*The costs incurred in connection with the application of this clause shall be shared by both parties in equal parts.*\n\n131.\n\nThe separability of an arbitration agreement from the contract of which it forms part is a general principle of international arbitration law today.179 This principle is notably enshrined at Article 16(1) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, which provides:\n\n*The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail* ipso jure *the invalidity of the arbitration clause.*\n\nThis principle has been recognised in Peruvian arbitration law, as part of its adoption of the Model Law.180\n\nBorn *International Commercial Arbitration* (2009) 311-353; Collins et al *Dicey, Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Laws* (14th edn, 2006) [16-011]; Gaillard & Savage (eds) *Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration* (1999), [388] - [419]; Poudret & Besson *Comparative Law of International Arbitration* (2nd ed, trans Berti & Ponti, 2007), [162] - [179]; *Plama Consortium Ltd v Bulgaria* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (2005) 20 ICSID Rev-FILJ 262, [212].\n\nArticle 106 General Law on Arbitration of January 3, 1996 No 26572.\n\n132.\n\nOne of the consequences of the independence of the arbitration agreement is that the law governing the arbitration agreement is also independent of the law which governs the main contract, so that the arbitration agreement may be governed by a different law to that which governs the main contract.181 Peru accepts in argument that this is possible in principle. But it submits that it was not the case here.182\n\nBorn *supra* n 179 *,* 354-357; Collins et al *ibid,* [16-012] ff.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 460/17-22.\n\n133.\n\nIn the present case, both parties accept that the main contract, the DEI Bermuda LSA, is governed by Peruvian law.183 Clause One of the DEI Bermuda LSA mentions that the LSA is executed *'in accordance with the provisions set forth in Legislative Decree No. 662, in Title II and in the first chapter of Title V of Legislative Decree No 757'*. According to Article 39 in Title V of Legislative Decree no 757:\n\n*Legal stability agreements are entered into pursuant to Article 1357 of the Civil Code and have the nature of law-contracts with the force of law, so that they cannot be unilaterally modified or revoked by the Government. Such contracts are civil and not administrative in nature, and may only be modified or revoked by agreement between the parties.*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 29/6-38, 220-222.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal found as much, when it held:184\n\n*Under Peruvian law, the* Civil Code *provisions governing private contracts in general are also applicable to LSAs and, as such, these agreements are subject to the principles of* Contrato-Ley *, as set forth in Article 1357 of the 1984* Civil Code.\n\n\u2026\n\n*As private-law contracts, the negotiation, execution, interpretation and enforcement of the provisions set forth in LSAs are subject to the general principles applicable to contracts between private parties under the Peruvian* Civil Code *. As such, the fundamental rights granted by Peru pursuant to an LSA are private contractual rights that are enforceable against the Sate as if it were a private party.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [28],[31].\n\n135.\n\nFurther, both parties accepted at the annulment hearing that, in interpreting the scope of the instrument of consent, namely Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, the Tribunal was entitled, as it did, to refer to the substantive clauses of the main contract (Clauses Two & Three), which define the scope of the agreement and also the nature of the investment.185\n\nPeru: Reply [72] - [79]; DEI Bermuda: Transcript, Day 1, 226/7 - 227/19.\n\n136.\n\nHowever, the parties differ in their view of the law applicable to the arbitration agreement. Peru submits that it is governed by Peruvian law alone, and specifically Peruvian contract law.186 International law has no role to play in the interpretation of any part of the DEI Bermuda LSA, including Clause Nine. Peru continues:187\n\n*International law is relevant, if at all, to the process only of determining whether Claimant's dispute also meets the additional specific jurisdictional elements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In other words, does the investor have the proper nationality? Is there an investment?... International law applies to the interpretation of the ICSID Convention, not to the LSA...*\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 456/14-459/5.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 313/20-314/10.\n\n137.\n\nOn this basis, Peru submits that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by failing to apply Peruvian law - specifically Peruvian contract law - to the determination of the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement.188 Without any suggestion that Peruvian law was inadequate to interpret the DEI Bermuda LSA, Peru submits that the Tribunal turned instead to international law and also invoked ICSID jurisprudence in order to justify its departure from the plain meaning of Clauses Two and Three.189\n\nReply [72], Transcript, Day 1, 29/6 - 38/1\n\n*Ibid* [82] - [90].\n\n138.\n\nBy contrast, DEI Bermuda submits that both Peruvian law and international law are applicable to the arbitration agreement. More precisely, it states:190\n\n*[T]he Tribunal has to determine its jurisdiction in an ICSID arbitration with reference to international law for purposes of construing the requirements under the ICSID Convention. And when it is interpreting the instrument of consent and specifically that part of the DEI Bermuda LSA which contains that consent, reference must be made to international law and Peruvian law.*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 225/21 - 226/6.\n\n139.\n\nIn a case where, as here, the parties have not expressly chosen a specific law to govern their arbitration agreement, but have instead consented to submit disputes relative to the interpretation of an investment agreement (itself governed by host state law) to international arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention (an instrument of international law), the *ad hoc* Committee takes the view that it would be artificial and incorrect to refer solely to the law applicable to the main agreement to determine the scope of the arbitration agreement.\n\n140.\n\nThe central question, which is posed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention itself, is the extent of the parties' *consent.* This question is to be addressed, as the Tribunal correctly observed,191 in the light of the general principles enunciated in *Amco Asia Corp v Indonesia* (a case where the Centre's jurisdiction was founded on an investment application, which had been accepted by the host state). The Tribunal held:192\n\n*[A] convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle* pacta sunt servanda, *a principle common indeed to all legal systems of internal law and to international law. Moreover - and this is again a general principle of law -any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [76] - [78].\n\n(Decision on Jurisdiction) (1983) 1 ICSID Rep 394, [14].\n\n141.\n\nIn addressing this question of consent under Article 25, a tribunal is not bound to apply host state law, even in a case where the parties' consent derives from or relates to an agreement under host state law. Thus, in *SPP v Egypt,193* the source of the state's consent was a provision in its investment law. Egypt submitted that the jurisdictional issues were governed by Egyptian law, and that, pursuant to the Egyptian Civil Code, no effective arbitration agreement had been concluded. This submission was rejected by a Tribunal presided by Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga. It applied instead general principles of interpretation and international law to the question of consent. In *CSOB v Slovakia,* the Tribunal's jurisdiction was derived from a contract. The Tribunal held nevertheless, citing *Amco* with approval, that: *194*\n\n*The question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is governed by international law as set out in* *Article 25(1) of the* ICSID *Convention**.*\n\n*SPP v Egypt supra* n 177, [55] - [61].\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka AS ('CSOB') v Slovakia* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (1999) 5 ICSID Rep 330, [35].\n\n142.\n\nThus, an ICSID tribunal determining its jurisdiction is not required to interpret the instrument of consent according solely to national law, but rather it is to consider directly whether there is the requisite evidence of consent required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, having regard to the common will of the parties on which arbitration is grounded and the general principle (widely applied in municipal law as well as in international law) of good faith.\n\n143.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the Decision on Jurisdiction in the present case, the *ad hoc* Committee is in no doubt that this is exactly what the Tribunal proceeded to do. In carrying out its task, the Tribunal did not ignore Peruvian law. On the contrary, the first reason it advanced for its construction of the scope of consent is *'Peru's Requirement that an Investment Contract Contribute to Economically Productive Activity.'* The Tribunal's reasoning on this point is supported by specific reference to Peru's Foreign Investment Law and to Article 1357 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which it records expressly provides that an LSA can be established only when *'supported by reasons of social, national or public interest*.'195 Further, its discussion of the relevance of DEI Bermuda's Application for an LSA is conducted by reference to the requirements of the Foreign Investment Law.196\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [94].\n\n*Ibid,* [113].\n\n144.\n\nPeru objects before this Committee that the Tribunal ought to have been considering other provisions of Peruvian contract law, rather than the Foreign Investment Law.197 But it is beyond the scope of the powers of review entrusted to this Committee under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention to re-evaluate which particular provisions of Peruvian law might be said to be relevant to the Tribunal's determination of its jurisdiction. An *ad hoc* committee, which is not an appellate body, is not called upon to substitute its own analysis of law and fact to that of the arbitral tribunal.\n\nMemorial [123] - [125]; Reply [70], [80], [88].\n\n145.\n\nPeru objects in particular to the Tribunal's reference to the *'unity of the investment'* principle as its fourth reason for reaching the decision which it did on the scope of the parties' consent. It claims that this was an improper reference to an international law principle which was developed to deal with treaty claims and can have no application in the interpretation of a Peruvian law contract.198 Peru made precisely this submission to the Tribunal itself, which considered and rejected it, explaining:199\n\n*The Tribunal is not importing into this proceeding a general definition of \"investment\" from BITs together with inapposite BIT jurisprudence. In the relevant cases, which are discussed below,200 ICSID tribunals have applied the principle of the \"unity of the investment\" in situations where consent to ICSID arbitration is found in individual investment agreements or contracts, not in an umbrella instrument such as a BIT. The Tribunal is of the view that the principles derived from those cases are directly applicable to its determination of the investment in relation to which the parties consented to ICSID arbitration in Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA.*\n\n*Supra* [33] - [34].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [121].\n\n*Holiday Inns v Morocco* 1 ICSID Rep 645; *CSOB v Slovakia supra* n 194, [72], [74] - [75], [80] - [82]; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest-Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels ('SOABI') v Senegal* (Award) (1988) 2 ICSID Rep 164, [4.10].\n\n146.\n\nThe Committee accordingly does not find any application of the wrong law to the determination of the scope of the parties' consent. On the contrary, this Committee considers that the Tribunal was proceeding in accordance with the general approach adopted in the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Amco Asia,* namely *'to find out and to respect the common will of the parties'* and to interpret the arbitration agreement *'in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.'*201\n\n*Supra* n 192.\n\n147.\n\nIt remains then to consider in this section whether nevertheless, in proceeding to interpret the common will of the parties as to the scope of their arbitration agreement, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n*(ii) Determination of the meaning of the DEI Bermuda LSA*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that the investment protected by the DEI Bermuda LSA could not be restricted solely to DEI Bermuda's US$200 million capital contribution in DEI Peru Holdings referred to in Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA. Rather the investment referred to in the DEI Bermuda LSA, which was approved by Peru, *'was part and parcel of the investment being made by Duke Energy in DEI Egenor, an operating company generating wealth, jobs and providing public services in Peru (* i.e. *, an active investment).*'202\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [99].\n\n149.\n\nPeru claims that it can only be held to the content of what it signed.203 Peru argues here that the Tribunal exceeded its powers under the literal meaning of the DEI Bermuda LSA.204 In Peru's view, the DEI Bermuda LSA did not provide guarantees of legal stability with respect to Egenor or with anything other than the US$200 million capital contribution mentioned in Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA.205 According to Peru, the Tribunal disregarded the LSA scheme as there were five LSAs in force, each covering a separate segment of Duke Energy's investment in Egenor.206\n\nMemorial [137]; Transcript, Day 1, 55, 56, 59; Day 2, 327.\n\nReply [66].\n\nMemorial [127] - [132].\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 12-19.\n\n150.\n\nPeru declares that it accommodated the wishes of Duke Energy to own Egenor through DEI Bermuda within the limits of the LSA system but that this does not make the DEI Bermuda LSA the all encompassing source of protection for a series of investment already made by Duke well before the DEI Bermuda LSA.207 The DEI Bermuda LSA was structured to cover only one slice of Duke's investment in Peru because all other parts of its investment were already covered by their own LSAs. DEI Bermuda knew about this multi-tiered scheme of LSAs in order to protect sequentially each stage and each channel of the investment.208\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 326-327.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 60; Day 2, 329-332, 467, 468.\n\n151.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, the claims of DEI Bermuda, which were summarised by the Tribunal and are set out above,209 related to breaches of the guarantees provided in the DEI Bermuda LSA in connection with the investment as well as to breaches of general obligations in the Peruvian law of contract. All claims were made under Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, as acknowledged by the Tribunal.210 They were based on alleged violations by Peru of the DEI Bermuda LSA arising out of the consequences for DEI Bermuda of the tax assessments by Peru against Egenor.211 The *ad hoc* Committee considers that DEI Bermuda is correct in its submission that it never made claims on behalf of Egenor.212 The Arbitral Tribunal remained within its terms of reference. The reasons for the Committee's conclusion are as follows.\n\n*Supra* [103].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction,[80].\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 386-387.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 232/12-16.\n\n152.\n\nIn order to determine the scope of the reference in the arbitration agreement (Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA) to *'any dispute, controversy or claim between them, relative to the interpretation, performance or validity of this Agreement'* it is necessary, as the parties both agree, to refer to the operative clauses of the agreement. At the jurisdiction stage, this is not of course to determine whether such clauses may in fact successfully be invoked. Rather, it is to determine the scope of the subject-matter of the main Agreement referred to in the arbitration agreement.\n\n153.\n\nThe operative clause, Clause Three, makes certain guarantees of legal stability *'in connection with the investment referred to in CLAUSE TWO.'* Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA speaks of an agreement by DEI Bermuda:\n\n*To make contribution to the capital stock of the company DUKE ENERGY INTERNATIONAL PERU HOLDINGS, S.R.L., incorporated in the city of Lima, registered in Entry n\u00b0 11184295 of the Registry of Companies of the Office of Registration of Lima and Callao, in the amount of US $ 200,000,000 (Two hundred million Dollars of the United States of America) within a term of no more than two (2) years, from the date of execution of this Agreement.*\n\nBut the scope of an arbitration agreement is not to be determined on the plain words in isolation, since the arbitral tribunal is obliged, as the Committee has earlier observed, *'to find out and to respect the common will of the parties'* and to interpret the arbitration agreement *'in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.'*213 As recounted in the Decision on Jurisdiction,214 the privatization of Egenor was acknowledged as a complex process. The DEI Bermuda LSA was concluded as part of Duke Energy's effort to complete the protection of its investment in Egenor in Peru.\n\n*Supra* [140], citing *Amco Asia.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [100].\n\n154.\n\nDEI Bermuda replaced Dominion and DEI Peru Holdings replaced Inversiones Dominion Per\u00fa S.A. ('**IDP**').215 It is undisputed between the Parties that the Dominion LSA, also containing an ICSID arbitration clause, could not be assigned for technical reasons.216 Duke Energy therefore declared in February 2000 that it wanted the same protection and stability regime as that accorded to Dominion with respect to the acquisition of Egenor when Dominion made a capital contribution of US$228 million in IDP whose place was taken by DEI Peru Holdings.217 DEI Bermuda explained that different protections including tax stabilization, which are reflected in the Investment Regulations218 are accorded to the investor and to the operating company.219\n\n*Ibid* [102], [109].\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 145, 148-149.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [53] - [54]; Transcript, Day 2, 444-445, 447-448.\n\nLegislative Decree n\u00b0 662, Article 19 (a) to (e) and 25 of Supreme Decree n\u00b0 162-92-EF.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 149-150; Day 2, 433-435.\n\n155.\n\nOn June 20, 2000, DEI Bermuda filed a request for a foreign investor LSA and DEI Peru Holdings (which was established in May 2000) filed a request for a recipient company LSA. Looking at the terms of the two applications for LSAs, the Tribunal found that they reinforced the purpose of the capital contribution to permit consolidation of Duke Energy's ownership interest in Egenor.220\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [117] - [118].\n\n156.\n\nDuke Energy made a capital contribution to DEI Peru Holdings through DEI Bermuda on December 18, 2002. This capital contribution was used to acquire shares in Egenor from other Duke companies.221 Duke, which already owned 90% of Egenor at the time the DEI Bermuda LSA was negotiated, did not need to buy Egenor twice. The Tribunal declared that it was difficult to see how a contribution of funds from DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings could be an active investment within the meaning of Article 1 of Legislative Decree 662 if considered in isolation of the context of the transaction.222 Peru itself recognized that the DEI Bermuda LSA did not require DEI Bermuda to invest in Egenor.223\n\n*Ibid* [45].\n\n*Ibid* [94].\n\n*Ibid* [101]; Memorial [150].\n\n157.\n\nAt the annulment proceeding hearing, DEI Bermuda specified that the contribution of US$200 million came in and went out the same day. It was a paper or bookkeeping transaction intended to comply with the requirements of the Foreign Investment Law in order to provide Duke Energy with protection for its investment in Egenor.224 But it also pointed out that this transaction, while necessary to meet the requirements for the granting of an LSA, was not sufficient, since, on its own, it provided no contribution to Peru's economic development, which was a prerequisite for the granting of an LSA. It was the prior US$263 million purchase of the shares in Egenor, which represented the reality of that investment and it would have been a fiction to maintain otherwise.225\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 151, 159-161, 164; Day 2, 447.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 417/4-15. This is the figure provided to the Committee at the hearing. The Award at [54] states the total cost of Duke Energy's acquisition of a 90% interest in Egenor as of the end of 1999 as US$288 million.\n\n158.\n\nPeru, whilst stressing the separate character of each of the LSAs in the structure of protections accorded to Duke Energy's investment in Egenor, accepted that there was no evidence in the record as to why the legal stability regime involved separate LSAs at each step.226\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 464/17-20.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal considered the provisions of the DEI Bermuda LSA in the broader context of Duke's investment in Peru. It held that the Peruvian investment laws did not contemplate a three-tiered structure including a holding-company such as DEI Bermuda.227 It examined the overall circumstances of Duke's investment in Egenor to give an efficient meaning to the provisions of the DEI Bemuda LSA.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [96].\n\n160.\n\nWhen a tribunal engages in interpretation of a written instrument of consent in light of the surrounding circumstances or in the context of other documents, its final construction of the meaning of the document in the light of all the evidence and submissions of the parties is unlikely to amount to a manifest excess of powers. Interpretation, which leaves room for discussion (as the arguments of Peru in the annulment proceeding amply demonstrate),228 is not likely to give rise to a manifest excess of powers. For the reasons set out in this section, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers in this case in its decision that the dispute submitted to it by DEI Bermuda fell within the parties' arbitration agreement.\n\nSee e.g., Memorial, [143]-[176].\n\n***(b) Failure to state reasons***\n----------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nPeru also claims that the failure to apply the proper law requires annulment under Article 52(1)(e) because the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its decision on a dispositive issue in failing to provide reasons grounded in Peruvian law for its decision to ignore the express terms of the contract.229\n\nMemorial [178]; Reply, [69]-[70]; Transcript, Day 1, 38.\n\n162.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) retains an important, and distinct, place in the scheme of the ICSID Convention. A supplementary decision or correction envisaged by Article 49(2) can only take place for unintentional omissions to decide any question put to the Tribunal.230 The failure to state reasons which is contemplated by Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons as this would otherwise draw an *ad hoc* committee into reviewing the substance of the arbitral tribunal's decision.231\n\nSee the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Amco Asia Corp v Indonesia (Amco I)* (1986) 1 ICSID Rep 509, [32]-[34], on the relation between Articles 49(2) and 52.\n\n*MINE* supra n 130 [5.08]; *Vivendi v Argentina*, *supra* n 63,[64]-[65].\n\n163.\n\nIn the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal provides reasons for its decision on *ratione materiae* jurisdiction which are sufficiently set forth in paragraphs 91 -134 of its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal specifically answered each of Peru's four objections to its interpretation of the scope of the subject-matter of the DEI Bermuda LSA with the following conclusions:\n\n1. \"*[T]he Tribunal finds that Respondent granted its approval for the DEI Bermuda LSA because it was part and parcel of the investment made by Duke Energy in DEI Egenor, an operating company generating wealth, jobs and providing public services in Peru (* i.e., *an active investment)*\";232\n\n2. \"*Because the underlying investment by Dominion (and later by Duke Energy) in the Peruvian electricity generator - Egenor - underpinned all of these transactions, including the capital contribution from DEI Bermuda to DEI Peru Holdings, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's argument on the characterization of the investment as defined in Clause Two of the DEI Bermuda LSA*\";233\n\n3. \"*The wording of the application referred to in Clause One of the DEI Bermuda LSA is another evidentiary element which assists the Tribunal in concluding that the investment contemplated by the parties when they entered into the DEI Bermuda LSA included DEI Bermuda's indirect ownership of DEI Egenor*\";234\n\n4. \"*Finally, by focusing on the guarantees included in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and excluding the application of the guarantees included in the other LSAs, the Tribunal is not limiting Claimant strictly to the text of the DEI Bermuda LSA. First, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees that are implied in the DEI Bermuda LSA by Peruvian law. Second, Claimant is entitled to the guarantees provided by such rules of international law as may be held by the Tribunal to be applicable to the merits of the dispute by virtue of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention*\".235\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [99].\n\n*Ibid* [110] (citation omitted).\n\n*Ibid* [111] (citation omitted).\n\n*Ibid* [134].\n\n165.\n\nPeru may not agree with the Tribunal's reasoning. But the Committee may only take the Decision on Jurisdiction as it is, not as Peru would have wished the decision to be. The role of an *ad hoc* committee is to ensure the stability of the ICSID arbitration system, not to overthrow awards because of its disagreement with the arbitral tribunal. Otherwise, the annulment mechanism of Article 52 would slide into an appeal.\n\n166.\n\nFinally, as mentioned above, because the Arbitral Tribunal is under no obligation to cite Peruvian law in reference to all of its findings, there is no contradiction in its reasoning in applying international law to jurisdiction as Peru claims.236 Contradictory reasons which cancel each other out must be carefully distinguished from dissatisfaction with the reasons expressed in the award. Peru's criticism that the Tribunal misapplied the above four extrinsic factors237 concerns the correctness of the Tribunal's reasoning and escapes review under Article 52.\n\nMemorial [138].\n\n*Ibid* [143].\n\n***(c) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nPeru says that the Tribunal's omission to apply Peruvian law chosen by the Parties requires annulment under Article 52(1)(d) because the obligation to apply the proper law is a fundamental rule of procedure from which the Tribunal seriously departed.\n\n168.\n\nDefinition of a fundamental rule of procedure can be found in the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena* :238\n\n*The said provision refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured at an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.*\n\n*Supra* n 116, [57].\n\n169.\n\nRather than identifying such a fundamental rule, Peru voices yet another time its criticism of the outcome of the Tribunal's decision under a different count for annulment of Article 52(1). As the First *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* recognized:\n\n*Under article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term \"rule of procedure\", that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not on the content of its decision.'*239 Peru fails to identify such fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*Supra* n 63, [83].\n\n***4. Jurisdiction*** **ratione temporis**\n------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nPeru's principal ground of objection under this head is that the Tribunal failed to decide a question put to it. This constituted, in Peru's view, a manifest breach of Article 52(1)(b), since it was an obvious failure to address the objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction raised by Peru. According to Peru, the objection which it had raised to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* was not that the *dispute* arose after the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA, but rather that *'there was no consent in the Bermuda LSA to retroactive application of the substantive promise of tax stability.'*240 In deciding that *'[w]hat is decisive of the Tribunal's jurisdiction* ratione materiae *is the point in time at which the instant legal dispute between the parties arose, not the point in time during which the factual matters on which the dispute is based took place',*241 the Tribunal had failed to address the question which Peru had submitted for its decision. Peru also submits that this failure is a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure requiring tribunals to consider issues put to them by the parties and that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons required to move from its statement of Peru's actual *ratione temporis* argument to its conclusion that it had jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*242\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 80/11-14, citing Transcript of Jurisdiction Hearing, March 29, 2005, 75-76.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [148].\n\n*Supra* [41] - [43].\n\n171.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, there is indeed a distinction between a jurisdictional objection *ratione temporis* based on: (i) the time at which the dispute between the parties arose; and (ii) the time at which the underlying events giving rise to the claim arose. Each may provide an independent ground of objection.\n\n172.\n\nThe second type of objection relates to the temporal application of the substantive obligations which give rise to the claim. It flows from the general principle (in the absence of express provision by the parties to the contrary) enunciated by Judge Huber in *Island of Palmas* that *:*243\n\n*[A] juridical fact must be appreciated in the light of the law contemporary with it, and not of the law in force at the time when a dispute arises or falls to be settled.*\n\nThis principle is as applicable to legal obligations arising under contract as by treaty.244\n\n(1928) II RIAA 829, 845.\n\nIn the case of obligations under international law, the principle is codified in Article 13 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility and in Article 28 of the VCLT.\n\n173.\n\nThe consequence of this principle in the context of ICSID arbitration is that the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is limited to claims which are founded on legal obligations in force and binding on the host state at the time of the alleged breach.245\n\n*Impregilo SpA v Pakistan* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (2005) 12 ICSID Rep 245, [309] - [314]; *Salini v Jordan supra* n 47 ; *Mondev International Ltd v United States of America* (Award) (2002) 6 ICSID Rep 181, 206-210; accord Douglas *supra* n 172, [616] - [617].\n\n174.\n\nThe application of this principle does not preclude a tribunal from taking into account any earlier facts. Rather, the tribunal is required to identify the facts which are the source or real cause of the dispute. If these facts arose after the entry into force of the obligation in question, an objection *ratione temporis* on this ground is not well-founded.246\n\nThis has been the *jurisprudence constante* of the PICJ and the ICJ in interpreting restrictions on its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* in relation to facts or situations arising prior to a specified date: *Electricity Co of Sofia and Bulgaria* PCIJ (1939) Ser. A/B, No 77, 82; *Right of Passage over Indian Territory* [1960] ICJ Rep 6; *Certain Property (Liechtenstein v Germany)* (Preliminary Objections) [2005] ICJ Rep 6, [41] - [46]; *Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy)* (Order on Counter-Claim) (July 6, 2010), [23].\n\n175.\n\nThis distinction was well explained in the context of determining the jurisdiction of an investment tribunal in *Mondev v United States of America* :247\n\n*Thus events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed when a treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct. Any other approach would subvert... the intertemporal principle...*\n\n*Supra* n 119, [70].\n\n176.\n\nIn the present case, the *ad hoc* Committee is in no doubt that the Tribunal decided that the fact which was the source or real cause of the dispute between the parties was the Tax Assessment, levied on DEI Egenor on November 22, 2001 after the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA, and not the prior tax years in respect of which that Assessment was levied. That was the state action which DEI Bermuda alleged constituted in turn a breach of Peru's obligations to it under the guarantee of legal stability contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA.248 This must logically be so, since, prior to the levying of that Assessment, there was no state conduct by Peru in respect of the tax liability of Egenor in respect of which DEI Bermuda laid complaint. Its case depended upon establishing a breach of legal stability predicated upon an alleged change of legal position at the time of the Tax Assessment from that which had pertained hitherto.\n\nSee the similar reasoning of the PCIJ in *Electricity Co of Sofia and Bulgaria supra* n 246.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal finds as much, when it holds:249\n\n*It was in the Tax Assessment, and not before, that SUNAT decreed a tax liability of approximately US$48 million against DEI Egenor for what SUNAT determined, at that time, were tax underpayments in 1996 through 1999.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [149]\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus quite correct, when it continues by drawing the following distinction:250\n\n*Naturally, during the merits phase, the Tribunal will have full jurisdiction to consider all of the factual matters related to the dispute, including those that preceded the effective date of the DEI Bermuda LSA, for the purposes of determining whether the Respondent violated the DEI Bermuda LSA through conduct which took place or reached its \"consummation point\" after its entry into force (* i.e *., the Tax Assessment).*\n\n*Ibid* [150].\n\n179.\n\nIt is true that, in reaching its decision on jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* the Tribunal couches its reasoning in terms of a rejection of a test based upon *'the factual matters on which the dispute is based'* in favour of *'the point in time at which the instant legal dispute between the parties arose.'*251 It relies for this purpose on a *dictum* in *Maffezini v Spain.*252 This *dictum*253 was concerned with the rather different question which might arise in satisfying jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of the first type, namely pin-pointing the time at which a dispute between the parties is to be treated as having crystallised.\n\n*Ibid* [148].\n\n(Decision on Jurisdiction) (2000) 5 ICSID Rep 387, [95].\n\nCiting *Case concerning East Timor* [1995] ICJ Rep 90, [22].\n\n180.\n\nHowever, read in the context of the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction *ratione temporis* as a whole, the *ad hoc* Committee finds it to be clear that the Tribunal was simply finding that a number of matters related to the dispute, which had taken place prior to the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA, were not in fact the relevant conduct. These included those enumerated in paragraph 146 of its Decision, such as that *'the tax liability at issue in SUNAT's tax audit was incurred by DEI Egenor with respect to tax years 1996 to 1999.'* Rather it was the Tax Assessment itself, which post-dated the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA, which was the relevant conduct that *in turn* gave rise to the dispute. After all, the levying of a tax assessment does not, *ipso facto*, constitute a legal dispute. Its validity or consistency with the state's obligations under a relevant LSA would first have to be the subject of express objection by the taxpayer or investor as the case may be for there to be a dispute between the parties.\n\n181.\n\nBut the *ad hoc* Committee cannot regard any such infelicity in language or legal reference in the Decision on Jurisdiction as constituting a manifest excess of the Tribunal's powers. On the contrary, it is plain that the Tribunal did decide the substantive question put to it by Peru in its jurisdictional objection, by finding that the relevant conduct, namely the Tax Assessment, did take place after the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA.\n\n182.\n\nFor the same reason, the Committee finds no failure in the reasoning of the Tribunal. On the contrary, by rejecting as irrelevant prior facts which did not give rise to the claim, and finding instead that the relevant conduct did take place within the relevant time, the Tribunal did explain the rationale for its decision. The fact that this Committee might have expressed these reasons in a different way, or by reference to different authority, is nothing to the point. Article 52(1)(e) is not concerned with the review of wrong reasons, it is concerned with the comprehensibility of the reasons advanced by the Tribunal itself.\n\n***3. Jurisdiction vested in other tribunals***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nNow that the Committee has explained the reasons for its decision not to annul the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction in relation to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* it is possible to deal more briefly with Peru's objection that the Tribunal's assumption of jurisdiction constituted an excess of powers because it constituted an unwarranted incursion upon the jurisdiction of other tribunals chosen by the parties to the other LSAs.\n\n184.\n\nPeru did not advance this objection in this way before the Tribunal itself. At that stage, it objected to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* on the ground that the claims advanced by DEI Bermuda were properly the claims of DEI Peru Holdings or DEI Egenor.254 The Tribunal decided that:255\n\n*The arguments raised by the Respondent as objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction* ratione personae *are, in reality, subject-matter objections in relation to the claims brought before this Tribunal by DEI Bermuda, dressed up as objections to the Tribunal's personal jurisdiction over putative claims by entities (such as DEI Peru Holdings and DEI Egenor) that are not claimants before this Tribunal.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [136].\n\n*Ibid* [143].\n\n185.\n\nIn these Annulment Proceedings, Peru contends differently that the Tribunal improperly arrogated to itself the jurisdiction vested in other tribunals (notably that chosen by the parties to the DEI Egenor LSA). This, Peru submits, constitutes a manifest excess of powers.256\n\nMemorial, [103].\n\n186.\n\nIn the Committee's view, this ground of objection to the Tribunal's Decision does not add materially to those already discussed. Arbitration, as a consensual method of dispute resolution, operates to confer jurisdiction on the parties' chosen tribunal in a manner that necessarily excludes other fora. It is well established in ICSID jurisprudence that a tribunal's *failure* to assume a jurisdiction which the parties have conferred upon it may itself constitute a manifest excess of powers.257 But it does not add anything to the enquiry mandated by Article 52(1)(b) into whether the tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers by *exceeding* its jurisdiction to contend that the tribunal has trespassed upon the jurisdiction of other tribunals. The enquiry which the annulment committee is empowered to make is the same. In the present case, this has already been undertaken by the *ad hoc* Committee in considering Peru's objections in relation to the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis.*\n\n*Supra* [97].\n\n187.\n\nThis was not a case where the Tribunal had to consider staying its proceedings in light of the same, or substantially the same dispute being actually pending before another tribunal - a situation of *lis pendens.258* Nor was it a case where the same parties, who were before an investment tribunal pursuant to the general dispute settlement provisions of a bilateral investment treaty, had already chosen by contract another tribunal to determine the same dispute. *259*\n\nAs in *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd v Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction No 1) (1985) 3 ICSID Rep 101, 129.\n\nAs in *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v Philippines* (Decision on Jurisdiction) (2004) 8 ICSID Rep 515. By the same token, Peru's reliance (Memorial, [102]) on *Southern Bluefin Tuna (Australia and New Zealand v Japan)* (UNCLOS Annex VII Tribunal, Award on Jurisdiction) (2000) 119 ILR 508 is inapposite here. In that case, the Tribunal's decision was based upon Article 281 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which required priority to be given to a method of dispute settlement chosen by the parties.\n\n188.\n\nOn the contrary, in the present case, there was only one tribunal competent to determine a dispute between DEI Bermuda and Peru founded on alleged breaches of the DEI Bermuda LSA, namely the ICSID Tribunal designated by the parties pursuant to Clause Nine. By contrast, the arbitration agreement in Clause Eight of the DEI Egenor LSA (an agreement to submit disputes *'to national or international arbitration, which shall be defined by mutual agreement'*) related only to disputes between the parties to that agreement, namely DEI Egenor and Peru, and to disputes relating to the *'interpretation or execution of the various clauses of* [that] *Agreement.'*\n\n189.\n\nIn consequence, the Tribunal in the present case was simply required to satisfy itself that the dispute brought before it properly fell within its jurisdiction within the terms of that clause. This it did by conducting the enquiry into its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* discussed above.\n\n190.\n\nIn so doing, it did not *'deprive* [] *the arbitral fora specified under* [the other] *LSAs of their rights to exercise the specific jurisdiction granted to them in those contracts.'*260 On the contrary, the Tribunal emphasised that its jurisdiction was strictly limited to claims under the DEI Bermuda LSA, so that:261\n\n*... Claimant will need to substantiate its claims, during the merits phase, by reference solely to the guarantees contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, and not those contained in any other LSAs. This is a function of the specific wording of Clause Nine of the DEI Bermuda LSA, and of the legal basis of the Claimant's claims as formulated in the Request for Arbitration, namely the alleged breach of the protections contained in the DEI Bermuda LSA, not in any of the other LSAs.*\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction could have no effect on the rights of other claimants under other LSAs.\n\nMemorial, [100].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, [132].\n\n191.\n\nNor does the Committee accept that, in arriving at its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal made a decision *'driven by equity rather than law'*262 by assuming an overbroad jurisdiction *'acting out of a misguided concern for Duke Energy's ability to seek relief in a single arbitration for a full range of claims.'*263 Paragraph 102 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, on which Peru relies for this allegation, contains the Tribunal's reasoning as to the nature of the investment referred to in the DEI Bermuda LSA. The Committee has already found that the Tribunal was entitled to interpret that Agreement in consideration of the parties' real intentions.264 But, as the passage from the Decision just cited in the previous paragraph makes clear, that does not mean that the Tribunal abandoned law for equity. On the contrary, it was at pains to emphasise that DEI Bermuda would have to make good its claims solely by reference to the contractual rights which it enjoyed pursuant to the DEI Bermuda LSA. Indeed, it went on to state that:265\n\n*... it will not be in a position to \"give effect\" to the protections in [the other] LSAs. In other words, in the peculiar circumstances of this case (successive agreements* for the protection *of the investment), the unity of the investment does not necessarily imply the unity of the protection of the investment.*\n\nMemorial [95].\n\n*Idem.*\n\n*Supra* [153].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [133] (citation omitted).\n\n192.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee holds that this third challenge to the Decision on Jurisdiction is not well founded and must be dismissed.\n\n**C. Award on the Merits**\n--------------------------\n\n193.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Committee has dismissed Peru's Application for Annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction, it is necessary now to turn to a consideration of whether, in the alternative, the Award on the Merits is liable to partial annulment in one of the four respects of which Peru makes complaint.\n\n194.\n\nThe particular portions of the Award in respect of which partial annulment is sought are those dealing with:\n\n(a) Tax stability guarantee;\n\n(b) Tax amnesty;\n\n(c) Good faith/ *actos propios* (estoppel); and,\n\n(d) Damages.\n\n195.\n\nThe Committee has set out the submissions of the parties on each of these points above in Part II B. It has also set forth its own general approach to the grounds of review specified under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention in Part III A. With these observations in mind, it is now possible to deal *seriatim* with the application of those general principles to each of the specific substantive issues, explaining first the Tribunal's treatment of the point and then the Committee's reasons for its decision on that aspect of the Application for Annulment.\n\n***1. Tax Stability***\n----------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe question of the meaning and effect of the guarantee of tax stability contained in Clause Three of the DEI Bermuda LSA lay at the heart of the arbitral proceedings, since DEI Bermuda's claim was that the tax assessment levied by SUNAT against DEI Egenor in turn violated DEI Bermuda's rights under that Agreement.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with the construction of Clause Three in paragraphs 186 - 228 of its Award. Having set out the clause, the Tribunal summarised the parties' arguments. In order, as the Tribunal put it *'to link the DEI Bermuda LSA and the Egenor LSA, but remain within the confines established by the Tribunal in paras. 132 and 133 of the Decision on Jurisdiction (cited earlier), Claimant has relied in particular on Article 23 of the Investment Regulations.'*266\n\nAward, [194].\n\n198.\n\nThe Investment Regulations,267 enacted in implementation of Peru's Private Investment Law,268 made detailed provision for the system and contents of LSAs. Article 23(a) provided, in relevant part, that:269\n\n*The stability regime granted to investors as provided for by section (a) of Article 10 of Legislative Decree No 662 implies that, in the event the income tax should be modified during the effective term of the stability agreement in such a manner that it results in a variation of the tax base or the percentages imposed on the profit generating company, or in the creation of new taxes imposed on the company's income, or for whatever other cause of equivalent effects the profits or dividends distributable or available to the investor is reduced in terms of percentage with respect to pre-tax profits in comparison with the ones distributable or available at the time the guaranteed tax regime became effective, by virtue of the protection granted by the agreement the tax rate(s) applicable to the profits or dividends the investor is entitled to shall be reduced in order to allow the profits or dividends finally available or subject to allocation are equal to the ones that were guarantied* [sic], *up to the possible limit as to the tax imposed on profits or dividends.*\n\nSupreme Decree No 162-92-EF (October 9, 1992).\n\nLegislative Decree No 757 (November 8, 1991).\n\nThe authoritative text of this article is that found in the original text in the Spanish language. The English translation of this Article is reproduced from that submitted by the parties in the arbitration at Exhibit C-010. It differs slightly, but not materially, from the translation reproduced by the Tribunal in the English text of its Award at [190]. The Committee has used the above translation for clarity of exposition.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal, referring to the Memorial, summarised DEI Bermuda's case on the effect of that provision as being to afford DEI Bermuda a claim for damages in the event that the guarantee of tax stability afforded to DEI Egenor was breached by amendment. Such an amendment, claimed DEI Bermuda, could be effected either by law or by a change in the interpretation or application of the law. *270*\n\nAward, [195] - [197].\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal next summarised Peru's position at paragraph 199 as that *'DEI Bermuda - can only invoke the guarantees under its own LSA, and therefore Claimant's attempt to fuse the DEI Bermuda LSA and the Egenor LSA (by way of Article 23 of the Investment Regulations or otherwise) is impermissible*. *'271* Peru added that the guarantee of tax stability related only to the law and not to its interpretation or application. *272*\n\n*Ibid* [199].\n\n*Ibid* [199] - [200].\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal then undertook its own analysis of the question in paragraphs 201 -228. It proceeded to its decision in three steps:\n\n(1) It found that *'[t]he parties agree that the linkage between the Egenor LSA and the DEI Bermuda LSA is provided by Article 23(a) of the Investment Regulations'273* but that they disagreed as to whether Article 23(a) was merely an offset mechanism or could also support a claim for damages;\n\n(2) The Claimant's evidence as to Peruvian law was to be preferred - to the effect that Article 23 would support a claim for damages by DEI Bermuda if the tax stabilisation afforded to DEI Egenor was violated after 24 July 2001;\n\n(3) The guarantee of tax stabilisation applied not only to laws, but also to stable interpretations or applications of the law. It may also be invoked to protect the investor in the absence of a prior stable interpretation to the extent that *'stabilized laws will not be interpreted or applied in a patently unreasonable or arbitrary manner.'274*\n\n*Ibid* [201].\n\n*Ibid* [227].\n\n202.\n\nPeru's critique of this approach in these annulment proceedings is brought principally under Article 52(1)(d) (failure to state reasons) though it advances additional arguments based on Article 52(1)(b) (manifest excess of powers) in relation to steps (2) and (3) and adds in addition a claim under Article 52(1)(e) (procedure) in relation to step (3).275\n\nMemorial [197] - [230].\n\n203.\n\nThe general approach which should guide the review of an award for failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) has been well developed by earlier *ad hoc* committees. Thus the decision in *Kl \u00f6 ckner I* explained that the Award must allow '*the reader to follow the arbitral tribunal's reasoning, on facts and on law*'.276 In *MINE,* the *ad hoc* Committee added that *'the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.'*277\n\n*Klockner supra* n 133, [119].\n\n*MINE v Guinea,* [5.09].\n\n204.\n\nThese general statements must also be read in the light of the observations in *Vivendi* that:278\n\n*... it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning..*\n\n*It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an* ad hoc *committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.*\n\n*Vivendi v Argentina supra* n 63, [64] - [65], followed in *Rumeli v Kazakhstan supra* n 132, [137] - [138].\n\n205.\n\nMoreover, an *ad hoc* committee is entitled itself to seek to understand the reasons for the award from the record before the tribunal.279 Indeed, in appropriate cases, it should do so. As the *ad hoc* Committee held in *Soufraki* :280\n\n*It is also possible that a tribunal may give reasons for its award without elaborating the factual or legal bases of such reasons. So long as those reasons in fact make it possible reasonably to connect the facts or law of the case to the conclusions reached in the award, annulment may appropriately be avoided.*\n\nAccord Reisman *Systems of Control in International Adjudication and Arbitration: Breakdown and Repair* (1992), 95.\n\n*Soufraki v UAE supra* n 127 *,* [128].\n\n*(a) Linking of DEI Bermuda LSA and Egenor LSA*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nPeru's main criticism of the Tribunal's approach at Step (1) of its analysis is that there is a fundamental contradiction between the Tribunal's accurate statement of Peru's position at paragraph 199 with its finding two paragraphs later of an agreement between the parties. *281*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 61-65.\n\n207.\n\nIn order to understand the basis for the Tribunal's finding of an agreement between the parties, the Committee was referred to the transcript of the merits hearing. In the key passage, which, in view of its importance, the Committee now quotes in full, Peru submitted: *282*\n\n*There is nothing, however, in Article 23 that suggests that investors can invoke the tax stability guarantees in LSAs granted to the companies that receive the investment. There is nothing in Article 23 that suggests that the Tribunal was wrong in concluding that Claimant cannot invoke any other LSA but its own. In fact, this morning Mr. Baker* [counsel for DEI Bermuda] *conceded that Claimant cannot invoke the Egenor LSA. He stated instead that Claimant has certain rights under the DEI Bermuda LSA with respect to the tax stability of Egenor.*\n\n*This is an important point: Peru does not dispute that the legal stability guarantee for investors under Article 23(a) of the Private Investment Regulations may grant the investors certain protections if the income tax on the profit-generating company is affected in certain circumstances. Thus, under Article 23(a), certain changes in the income tax of Egenor might affect the tax stability granted to DEI Bermuda. If that occurs, DEI Bermuda can invoke its own, and only its own, LSA with respect to actions affecting Egenor's income tax. But this does not mean that DEI Bermuda can invoke the Egenor LSA. Nothing in Article 23 affects the Tribunal's conclusion that Claimant must show a breach of its own LSA, not of Egenor's LSA.*\n\nIn the immediately following passage, Peru went on to explain *'an important limitation'* - namely that Peru was only obliged to reduce proportionately the investor's tax *'within the limits of the withholding taxes or the taxes from profits imposed on the investor.'*283\n\nMerits Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 249/1 - 250/4; and see, to like effect, *ibid,* Day 7, 1595/17 - 1596/21.\n\n*Ibid* 251/3-5.\n\n208.\n\nExamining the Tribunal's findings at paragraphs 199 and 201 in the light of that admirably clear explanation of Peru's submission as to the effect of Article 23(a), the Committee finds no fundamental inconsistency amounting to a want of reasons under Article 52(1)(e). On the contrary, in the Committee's view, the Tribunal has accurately captured the nuances of Peru's position as presented to it in these two paragraphs. On the one hand, Peru insisted, as the Tribunal recorded at paragraph 199, that Article 23(a) did not have the effect of *fusing* the two LSAs. DEI Bermuda would have to make its claim under the DEI Bermuda LSA and not otherwise. On the other hand, Peru did agree that Article 23(a) provided a linkage between the two LSAs to the extent that *'under Art23(a), certain changes in the income tax of Egenor might affect the tax stability granted to DEI Bermuda. If that occurs, DEI Bermuda can invoke its own, and only its own, LSA with respect to actions affecting Egenor's income tax.'*284\n\n*Ibid* 249/18-20 - 250/1.\n\n209.\n\nWhere the parties did not agree was as to the proper construction and effect of the rights granted under Article 23(a) - as to whether, as Peru contends, such rights were limited to the extent of an offset any tax on DEI Bermuda's own dividends (a right which in the present case would have no result, since the tax rate on such dividends was zero), or alternatively whether Article 23(a) could found an independent claim for damages. But this, too, was accurately summarised by the Tribunal in the rest of paragraph 201.\n\n*(b) Supplementing Investment Regulations with Civil Code*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nPeru's critique of the second stage of the Tribunal's analysis is that it failed to explain how it could reconcile its application of the remedies provided under the Civil Code with the clear terms of Article 23(a), which limited the available remedy to the offset mechanism there specified. *285* Peru adds that this also amounted to an excess of powers, because it was a failure to apply the applicable law, which it defines here as *'the Peruvian* lex specialis *on foreign investment and stabilization agreements.'286*\n\nMemorial [212] - [219].\n\n*Ibid* [215], citing Award [194].\n\n211.\n\nIn the Committee's view the Tribunal squarely addressed this point at paragraphs 204 - 209. It accepted that *'[t]he wording of Article 23(a), at first blush, appears to favour Respondent's line of argument.'287* But it then turned to consider the expert evidence on Peruvian law advanced to the contrary by DEI Egenor's two experts - Professors Trazegnies and Talledo. Citing from their evidence in detail, the Tribunal concluded that Peruvian law did allow a claim for damages, notwithstanding the limitation wording in Article 23(a), as a subsidiary means of compensation where the primary means provided for was not available. *288*\n\n*Ibid* [204].\n\n*Ibid* [205] - [209].\n\n212.\n\nNor can the Tribunal be criticized for having exceeded its mandate in applying the Civil Code to the resolution of this issue. On the contrary, the obligation upon a tribunal under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to apply, *inter alia*, *'the law of the Contracting State'* is a reference to the whole of that law, such as the Tribunal may determine to be relevant and applicable to the issue before it, and not to any particular portion of it.\n\n213.\n\nPeru may well disagree with the view that the Tribunal formed as to the correct solution of the issue before it under Peruvian law. But an *ad hoc* committee may not enter upon an assessment of whether a tribunal made a correct assessment of the content of the applicable law. It must be *'mindful of the distinction between failure to apply the proper law and the error* in judicando *drawn in* Klockner I *, and the consequential need to avoid the reopening of the merits in proceedings that would turn annulment into appeal.'289*\n\n*Wena supra* n 116, [22].\n\n214.\n\nMoreover, in the present case, the Tribunal reached its conclusions on the basis of a careful assessment of the evidence before it. By ICSID Arbitration Rule 34, *'[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.'* It would not be proper for an annulment committee to re-evaluate that evidence, and nor is it in a position to do so. As it was put in *Rumeli v Kazakhstan, '[a]n* ad hoc *committee is not a court of appeal and cannot therefore enter, within the bounds of its limited mission, into an analysis of the probative value of the evidence produced by the parties.'*290\n\n*Supra* n 132, [96].\n\n*(c) The meaning of tax stability and interpretation of the MRL*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nAs regards step (3) of the Tribunal's analysis, Peru submits that there is a complete failure of reasoning in the Award to explain how it was that the Tribunal came to decide that the guarantee of tax stability applied to changes in interpretations of the law as well as to changes in the text itself.291\n\nMemorial [222] - [228].\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal reasoned this issue in the following way:\n\n(a) It opened this part of its analysis by stating that, as the Foreign Investment Law guarantees to investors the *'continuity of the existing rules',*292 the question for it was to what extent this guarantee included *'their specific interpretation and application'* at the time of the investment.293\n\n(b) It accepted that its task was not to sit on appeal from the decisions of SUNAT or the Tax Court, but only to determine whether their decision *'represents a change from their respective decisions prior to the entry into force of the DEI Bermuda LSA.'*294\n\n(c) It stated that what would be required, in the case of a change in interpretation, would be a 'stable *interpretation at the time the tax stability guarantee was granted'* and a subsequent decision which modified it.295 This would have to be established by *'compelling evidence'* and not mere implication. *296*\n\n(d) Even where there was no pre-existing stable interpretation, a decision on the interpretation or application of the law to the investor might infringe legal stability if it was *'patently unreasonable or arbitrary.'297*\n\nPreamble, Legislative Decree No 662.\n\nAward [210].\n\n*Ibid* [216].\n\n*Ibid* [218].\n\n*Ibid* [220] - [221].\n\n*Ibid* [226] - [227].\n\n217.\n\nThis set of reasoning steps is both logical and complete. In other words, it very well explains how the Tribunal got from point A (the question for determination) to point B (its conclusion on the point). The Committee accepts that the Tribunal does not cite legal authorities or passages from the expert evidence in support of its reasons. But, as the *Soufraki* Committee pointed out, *'a tribunal may give reasons for its award without elaborating the factual or legal bases of such reasons.'298*\n\n*Soufraki supra* n 127, [128].\n\n218.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal was, in large measure, engaged in a process of logical reasoning which did not require citation of authority. The processes of interpretation and application are, as the Study Group of the International Law Commission on the Fragmentation of International Law has wisely observed, integral to law itself, which *'should be seen not merely as a mechanic application of apparently random rules'*. *299* They are the processes by which law gains its meaning.\n\nUN DocA/CN.4/L.682 (April 13, 2006), [34] - [36].\n\n219.\n\nReference to the record in the arbitration *300* shows that the Tribunal had before it a considerable amount of expert evidence as to Peruvian law adduced by both parties on this question, from which it benefited when formulating its reasons in the way that it did. Thus, Professor Trazegnies developed in his evidence the point that: *301*\n\n*[I]nterpretation is an intrinsic part of the law, and one cannot be understood without the other. The sense of the law is the interpretation of the law. Consequently, legal stability can be thwarted if, without making changes to the text of the law itself, it is interpreted in a way that is radically different from the way it was understood and applied before.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, [244] - [250].\n\nTrazegnies 2 (February 22, 2005), [54] (a paragraph referred to in the Award at [196]; and see also Trazegnies 4, [22] - [34].\n\n220.\n\nProfessor Bullard, the expert called on behalf of Peru, accepted that *'every interpretation must be reasonably based on the stabilized regulations'.*302 Whilst, therefore, in Professor Bullard's view, stabilization did not prevent SUNAT from interpreting or applying the Regulations, he added:303\n\n*That does not mean that the authorities have complete discretion to interpret and apply the stabilized regulations and said regulations shall remain subject to the principles of legality and lawfulness that govern public administration.*\n\n*In other words, interpretation cannot be used to \"defraud\" the stabilization framework created by the government as a mechanism designed specifically to protect investment. So SUNAT could not, for example, through an interpretation, change the income tax rate that applies under a stabilization agreement. SUNAT could, however, decide whether a specific legal consequence applies to a specific circumstance, as long as the circumstance reasonably falls within the scope of the stabilized regulation.*\n\nBullard 1, [45].\n\n*Ibid,* [47].\n\n221.\n\nThus, in the Committee's view, this part of the Award was not only adequately reasoned, it was also arrived at after consideration of the evidence of Peruvian law. The Committee, therefore, cannot accept Peru's request to partially annul the Award under Article 52(1)(b) on account of the alleged failure to apply the applicable law.\n\n222.\n\nFurther, insofar as Peru seeks to bolster its application under this head by reference in addition to Article 52(1)(d), the Committee recalls the observations that it made in paragraph 92 *supra.* It does not add anything to a challenge based on failure to apply the applicable law to characterise such a failure as a *'serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.'* The requirement to apply the applicable law goes to the substantive legal framework within which the tribunal is empowered by the parties to decide the matter, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 96 *supra,* and not the procedures which the tribunal must ensure are observed in the hearing of that case. The Committee repeats the comments which it made in this regard *supra* at paragraphs 168 - 169.\n\n223.\n\nFor these reasons, Peru's application for partial annulment under this head must also be dismissed.\n\n***2. Tax Amnesty***\n--------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe next basis for partial annulment of the Award advanced by Peru relates to the Tribunal's treatment of the effect of DEI Egenor's acceptance of the tax amnesty afforded to it by SUNAT upon DEI Bermuda's claim in the arbitration. *304* Peru submits that the Tribunal failed to deal with its submission that this amnesty had a substantive as well as procedural effect and thus both failed to give reasons and failed to decide an issue submitted to it, committing a manifest excess of powers.\n\n*Supra* [71] - [72].\n\n225.\n\nPeru's arguments as to the effect of the tax amnesty had been originally raised by as an admissibility objection. *305* The Tribunal took the view that this was a question for the merits phase. *306* Accordingly, it was fully re-pleaded on the merits. *307* The Tribunal addressed this issue in its Award at paragraphs 162 - 183. This was one of the preliminary issues addressed by the Tribunal in Part IV as providing the necessary framework for its decisions on the merits in Part V.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction [128] - [134].\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [163] - [164].\n\nMemorial on the Merits [271] - [285]; Counter-Memorial on the Merits [120] - [136]; Reply on the Merits [389] - [407; Rejoinder on the Merits [307] - [330].\n\n226.\n\nIn the jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal stated Peru's argument in terms of estoppel. *308* At the merits phase, the Tribunal summarised Peru's case on the 'scope of renunciation' as follows: *309*\n\n*According to Respondent, a taxpayer's request to receive the benefits of the Tax Amnesty Law entails the recognition and acceptance of the tax obligations specified in the request, since payment made in accordance with the Tax Amnesty Law constitutes renunciation of any ongoing or future challenge of the tax obligation in question, whether through administrative or judicial proceedings.*\n\nIt added that Peru's expert had opined that this renunciation applied to proceedings in any forum including in international arbitration. *310* The Tribunal then outlined DEI Bermuda's principal response as being that *'the only effect of DEI Egenor's acceptance of amnesty was the waiver of its right to challenge the amnesty payments through the procedural mechanisms available under Peruvian tax law.'*311\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction [163], citing Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction [133].\n\nAward [164].\n\n*Ibid* [165].\n\n*Ibid* [166].\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal then set out its own reasoning at 179 - 182:312\n\n*179. The Tribunal finds that the LSA rights of both DEI Egenor and of DEI Bermuda are separate and distinct from the rights to which the SEAP renunciation applies, quite apart from the fact that DEI Egenor may have reserved certain rights in its amnesty applications. In order to benefit from the Tax Amnesty Law, the taxpayer must desist from challenges before \"administrative or judicial authorities.\" Under each LSA, it was agreed that disputes over the scope of protection provided by the LSA would be referred to arbitration (national or international arbitration, in the case of the Egenor LSA, and ICSID arbitration, in the case of the DEI Bermuda LSA) and not to administrative or judicial authorities.*\n\n*180. The Tribunal therefore concludes that, since neither administrative nor judicial authorities in Peru had jurisdiction to hear claims or challenges based on the LSAs, renunciation of all challenges to the tax obligation through \"administrative or judicial authorities\", as provided under the Tax Amnesty Law, could not have resulted in the waiver of the rights of DEI Egenor or DEI Bermuda under the respective LSAs.*\n\n*181. In addition, the DEI Bermuda LSA contains no specific provision regarding the applicable substantive law. In such circumstances, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to apply \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflicts of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"*\n\n*182. Consequently, even if payment under the Tax Amnesty Law did, as a matter of Peruvian law, result in the renunciation of rights under the LSAs (which in the Tribunal's opinion it did not do), Peruvian law (\"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute\"), and in particular the Tax Amnesty Law, would be inconsistent with applicable principles of international law. One such principle is that waiver of ICSID rights must be explicit (* see *Professor Dolzer Second Expert Report at paras. 28-29). As discussed in the previous Section, Respondent does not dispute that, in the case of such conflict, it is international law that must prevail over the local law.*\n\nFootnotes omitted. It added, at [183] a subsidiary point of interpretation under Peruvian law, supported by experts for both parties, that specialised systems for tax matters were to be interpreted restrictively.\n\n228.\n\nArticle 48(3) of the ICSID Convention requires that *'[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons on which it is based.'* But the framers of the Convention declined to elevate failure to comply with the first element of this requirement to a ground for annulment, *313* preferring instead to provide the specialised remedy of a request to the tribunal for a supplemental decision. *314* Thus, a failure to address every question will not *ipso facto* constitute a ground for annulment. Rather, it is necessary for an applicant to demonstrate that such a failure amounts to a failure in the intelligibility of the reasoning in the award itself (under Article 52(1)(e)). *315*\n\nHistory, II, 849.\n\nArticle 49(2).\n\nAccord *MINE supra* n 130, [5.13]; *Wena supra* n *116,* [100] - [101].\n\n229.\n\nAlternatively the applicant may show that the failure to address a question submitted to it by the parties amounts to a manifest excess of power, because it amounts to a failure on the part of the tribunal to undertake the mandate entrusted to it (under Article 52(1)(b)). *316* In that event, *'it is only where the failure to exercise a jurisdiction is clearly capable of making a difference to the result that it can be considered a manifest excess of power.'317* A tribunal does not manifestly exceed its power if it fails to deal with every argument raised by one party as to a legal question, so long as, objectively, it has dealt with the legal question itself. As it was put by the *ad hoc* committee in *CDC v Seychelles:318*\n\n*The specific terminology used by the Republic in its Memorial cannot define the question the Tribunal was obliged to answer. Rather, the Tribunal was required to answer a legal question, or to put it another way, come to a conclusion about the Parties' rights and liabilities.*\n\n*Supra* [97].\n\n*Vivendi idem,* and, to like effect, *Kl \u00f6 ckner supra* n 133 [131], [148].\n\n*CDC Group PLC v The Seychelles*, *supra* n 130, [57].\n\n230.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the *ad hoc* Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal has both addressed the legal question put to it and done so in a manner which shows no failure of reasoning.\n\n231.\n\nPeru first raised its objection as to the preclusive effect of the tax amnesty as a plea as to admissibility at the jurisdictional phase. It submitted there that DEI Bermuda's claims were inadmissible because the tax disputes that were the predicates for the claim in the arbitration had all been fully resolved within the Peruvian tax system.319 DEI Egenor's acceptance of the tax amnesty, submitted Peru, precluded DEI Bermuda's subsequent arbitration claim and estopped DEI Bermuda from pursuing it.320 DEI Bermuda's response was that DEI Egenor's acceptance of the tax amnesty had no such effect, both as a matter of Peruvian law and because such a step could not in any event operate preclusively so as to estop DEI Bermuda from pursuit of its claims in the arbitration.321\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, Section V.\n\n*Ibid* [128] - [134].\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, [206] - [212].\n\n232.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Tribunal decided that this question went to the merits and not to admissibility, the parties resumed legal argument on it in their written pleadings at the merits stage. DEI Bermuda submitted that *'by availing of the local tax amnesty - and thereby capping its exposure, mitigating its damages, and protecting the value of its investment - Duke Energy only relinquished its rights as a local taxpayer against SUNAT under Peruvian tax law. It never relinquished its rights as a foreign investor against the Government of Peru under its LSAs.'*322 In response, Peru submitted that '*Claimant's [r]ecourse to Peru's [t]ax [a]mnesty [l]aw [b]ars its [c]laims.'323* According to Peru, this followed whether as a matter of Peruvian law or in the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel as applied in international law.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, [272], footnotes omitted.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, Section III B.\n\n233.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the parties thus submitted to the Tribunal what was in reality one legal question for decision: the legal effect of the conduct of DEI Egenor in accepting the tax amnesty on DEI Bermuda's ability to pursue its claim in the arbitration. It was that question that could have been dispositive of the outcome - in the sense that, had Peru succeeded in this defence, it would have been preclusive of DEI Bermuda's claim.\n\n234.\n\nEach party then proceeded to develop different arguments in relation to that question, some under Peruvian law and some under international law. But the Committee finds no inherent bifurcation of the kind now asserted by Peru in these annulment proceedings, between the substantive and the procedural effect of the tax amnesty. On the contrary, once the effect of the amnesty had been determined by the Tribunal to be a matter for the merits phase of the arbitration, it had to be decided as a substantive matter - *i.e.* as a defence on the merits. But it is of the essence of a plea of preclusion or estoppel based upon the disposition of an issue in prior litigation, that the conduct of the party has a dual character - at once preclusive of the process and determinative of the substance. These two elements are not separable. They are inherent parts of the same plea. As a Chamber of the International Court of Justice put it in the *Gulf of Maine* Case: *'preclusion is in fact the procedural aspect and estoppel the substantive aspect of the same principle.'*324\n\n*Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada v United States of America)* [1984] ICJ Rep 246, 305, [130].\n\n235.\n\nIn the context of this case, a logically essential element in determining this effect was to determine the extent to which the conduct of one party (DEI Egenor) in one legal forum could estop or preclude another party (DEI Bermuda) from pursuit of its related claim in another forum. The Tribunal, by its reasoning in paragraphs 179 - 182, found that the conduct of DEI Egenor could not preclude DEI Bermuda's claim, since the rights of each were separate; the jurisdictions of the Peruvian tax authorities and the ICSID Tribunal did not overlap; and each claim was governed by a different applicable law. It thus considered both the substantive and the procedural consequences of the tax amnesty plea and rejected Peru's defence. In the result, then, there has been neither a failure of reasoning nor a manifest excess of power.\n\n***3. Good faith/*****actos propios** ***(estoppel)***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal was divided on DEI Bermuda's claim that Peru had breached its implied duty of good faith and the Peruvian doctrine of *actos propios* or estoppel. The majority on this point (President Fortier and Arbitrator Tawil) found that there was such a breach. Arbitrator Nikken delivered a Partial Dissenting Opinion devoted to this issue.\n\n237.\n\nThe majority set out its reasoning in four sections of the Award: (i) in its determination of the applicable law; (ii) in its determination of the scope of protection implied in the DEI Bermuda LSA; (iii) in its application to the depreciation assessment claim; and (iv) in its application to the merger revaluation claim.\n\n238.\n\nIn determining the applicable law generally, the Tribunal held, applying Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, that, in view of the fact that there was no express choice of law clause in the DEI Bermuda LSA, it was entitled to apply both Peruvian law and international law. To the extent of any inconsistency between the two, this had the effect that it was entitled to accord priority to international law.325 It held that *'principles of international law must be given effect in determining the extent to which the division of the State into separate entities and agencies can insulate the State from liability for certain actions and representations (i.e. the analysis of good faith and the doctrine of* actos propios *)'*.326\n\nAward [158].\n\n*Ibid* [160].\n\n239.\n\nThen, it set out its approach to the preliminary issue as to the legal content of the obligation.327 It held that estoppel, as an obligation to be implied into the DEI Bermuda LSA, could not be construed purely by reference to Peruvian law. Rather, the Tribunal thought it was entitled to apply international law and to *'take into account the perspective of a reasonable foreign investor, perceiving, observing and interacting with the Government of Peru.*'328 The Tribunal, however, rejected the unity of the state test proposed by DEI Bermuda, derived from the law of state responsibility. Rather, it considered that *vis-\u00e0-vis* a foreign investor, *'the State assumes the risk for the acts of its organs or officials which,* by their nature, *may reasonably* induce reliance *in third parties.'*329 What mattered, thought the Tribunal, was the 'reasonable appearance *that the representation binds the State',* a determination in which '*the manifest lack of competence'* of the State organ could well be decisive.330 The Tribunal referred by analogy to the test in Article 46 of the Vienna Convention331 dealing with provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties, which precluded a state from relying on a violation of its internal law *'unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rules of its internal law of fundamental importance.'* Thus, the representation had to be '*unequivocal*' in the sense it is *'the result of an action or conduct that,* in accordance with normal practice and good faith *, is perceived by third parties as an expression of the State's position, and as being incompatible with the possibility of being contradicted in the future.'*332\n\nIn Part IV C 2 (c) [241] - [251].\n\n*Ibid* [241].\n\nAward,[246].\n\n*Ibid* [247].\n\n*Supra* n 119.\n\nAward [249].\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed DEI Bermuda's claim in relation to the Depreciation Assessment, finding that it had failed to meet its burden of proof of establishing that it had received the requisite unequivocal representation.333\n\n*Ibid* [320] - [323].\n\n241.\n\nIt then returned to the estoppel argument in the context of the Merger Revaluation Assessment.334 At that stage in its analysis, the Tribunal had already considered DEI Bermuda's claim for breach of the contractual undertaking of tax stability in the DEI Bermuda LSA and had found that there was a breach of that undertaking. An essential step leading to that finding was that there was a stable interpretation of the tax law in place at the time the tax stability guarantee was granted, which interpretation was itself stabilised pursuant to the DEI Bermuda LSA.335\n\n*Ibid* Part V B 3, [379] - [442].\n\nAward [352] - [366].\n\n242.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal opened the section of its Award dealing with estoppel with the observation that, having found Peru liable for breach of the tax stability guarantee, it *'need not consider Claimant's alternative grounds for liability, including breach of the doctrine of* actos propios *or good faith.'*336 However, it continued, *'[t]he Tribunal nevertheless feels compelled, having heard a substantial amount of evidence and argument on this point, to set out its views on the issue.'*337\n\nAward [379].\n\n*Idem.*\n\n243.\n\nFollowing its detailed assessment of the evidence on the support of various State actors for the merger of Egenor with Power North, the Tribunal added that these officials were simply implementing applicable Peruvian policy at the time. It added, for good measure:338\n\n*[T]he Tribunal's primary finding in respect of the Merger Revaluation Assessment is that SUNAT breached the Egenor LSA by straying from the widely-accepted and stable interpretation of the MRL at the time of the foreign investment into Egenor. The Tribunal's findings concerning the conduct of the various individuals that are described under the Tribunal's analysis of the* actos propios *issue are secondary in nature and support its primary finding on liability.*\n\n*Ibid* [427].\n\n244.\n\nIt then proceeded to find that Peru was not entitled to rely on SUNAT's sole authority to make representations on tax matters, because, opined the Tribunal, the law applicable to the question was international law not Peruvian law. *'In international law, it is possible for entities and agencies other than the national tax service to bind the State to a particular position concerning transactions with tax implications.'*339\n\n*Ibid* [432].\n\n245.\n\nArbitrator Nikken dissented from this portion of the Award. In his view, *both* estoppel as a rule of international law and *actos propios* as a matter of Peruvian law were *'beyond any doubt'* applicable.340 However, this did not mean that the state must always act with complete consistency. What mattered was, as the majority had held, whether the state's actions reasonably induced reliance. Reliance could not be reasonable where the representation was made by an organ which manifestly lacked competence.341\n\nNikken Dissenting Opinion, [5].\n\n*Ibid* [6] - [7].\n\n246.\n\nWhere Arbitrator Nikken parted company with the majority was not therefore on the relevant legal test, but rather on its application to the problem at hand. He opined that an investor could be expected to know the legal order of the State in which he was investing, at least in respect of a fundamental issue connected with his economic activity, such as tax. In a tax matter, he was of the view that the investor could not reasonably conclude that the transaction had been approved in a clear and consistent way if the tax authority had not pronounced on the matter.342 He pointed out that this was consistent with normal practice in privatizations, since the seller (a State enterprise) would normally, as in this case, assume liability for hidden tax liabilities, since it was not the seller but the tax authority which had the power to determine the application of the tax law. Thus he considered that the conduct of the other state officials was relevant only to confirm the prevailing interpretation, which was stabilized under the DEI Bermuda LSA and did not in addition create an estoppel.343\n\n*Ibid* [11].\n\n*Ibid* [19].\n\n247.\n\nPeru advances a wide-ranging critique of the majority's finding in its Award on this issue, alleging a manifest excess of powers based upon failure to apply Peruvian law as the applicable law and a number of failures in the Tribunal's reasoning.344\n\nSummarised *supra* at [75] - [79].\n\n248.\n\nDEI Bermuda responds simply that the Tribunal's observations on this point are *obiter* and therefore do not provide a basis for annulment. Peru replies, accepting that the Award is *'susceptible to Claimant's interpretation'*345 but arguing that it is *'equally susceptible to the interpretation that the Tribunal has decided after all to consider and decide Peru's liability on this alternative ground.'*346 It submits further that this secondary finding would become particularly important were this Committee to have annulled the Tribunal's primary finding on liability for tax stability, since then it could operate as an alternative basis of Peru's liability.347 Peru points out that DEI Bermuda had been invited to, and had not, confirmed its acceptance that the Tribunal's conclusions on *actos propios* would not have this consequence, were the Committee to annul the primary finding in the Award.348\n\nReply, [181].\n\n*Idem.*\n\n*Ibid* [183]; Transcript, Day 1, 107/20 - 108/5.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 108/6 - 109/10.\n\n249.\n\nThe resolution of the substantive issue presented to the Tribunal is one on which views might legitimately differ. This is so as regards the balance to be struck between the twin legal systems specified as the applicable law in the absence of express choice under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention,349 a formulation which undoubtedly *'confer[s] on to the Tribunal a certain margin and power of interpretation.'*350 It is also the case that alternative tenable views as to the application of the law may be entertained even if international law principles of estoppel are applicable, as all members of the Tribunal thought. Different views might legitimately be taken, as they were between the arbitrators, as to the balance to be struck between the effect produced on the respondent and the degree of authority in fact vested in the relevant official,351 especially in the context of representations on tax matters, where there may well be grounds for a more cautious approach.\n\nCf. Reisman \"The Regime for *Lacunae* in the ICSID Choice of Law Provision and the Question of its Threshold\" (2000) 15 ICSID Rev-FILJ 362 and Gaillard and Banifatemi \"The Meaning of 'And' in Article 42(1), Second Sentence, of the Washington Convention: The Role of International Law in the ICSID Choice of Law Process\" (2003) 18 ICSID Rev-FILJ 375.\n\n*Wena* supra n 116, [39].\n\nAccord: Thirlway \"The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice 1960-1989 Part One\" (1989) LX BYIL 1, 36.\n\n250.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee is in no doubt that the views expressed by the majority in this case cannot be treated as a binding part of its Award, since they do not constitute a decision on an issue that was essential or fundamental to the Award, a part of the necessary reasoning of the arbitrators in reaching their decision, as opposed to being incidental to the arbitral tribunal's determination.352 Rather, the majority's views on this issue are, as appears from the face of the Award, *obiter dicta.* The *ratio* of the Award is the finding of breach of the tax stability guarantee in the DEI Bermuda LSA by the MRA. The Tribunal's assessment of damages, leading to the award of damages in the *dispositif,* is for *'breach of the DEI Bermuda LSA'* as a result of the MRA.353 The Tribunal emphasised the subsidiary nature of its findings on *actos propios* in the passages cited *supra* in paragraphs 242 - 243. Furthermore, the Tribunal carefully distinguished elsewhere in the Award between its *finding* of breach of the tax stabilization guarantee and its *conclusions* in relation to *actos propios.*354\n\nILA Committee on International Commercial Arbitration 'Final Report on Res Judicata and Arbitration' (2006) 72 ILA Conf Rep 186, 200, [56]; accord: *Associated Electric and Gas Insurance Services Ltd (**AEGIS**) v European Reinsurance Co of Zurich* [2003] 1 WLR 1041 (PC), [14].\n\nAward [454], [474].\n\nAward [142], [450].\n\n251.\n\nThe Committee has not, for the reasons set out in section III C 1 of its Decision, annulled the finding of the Tribunal in relation to the guarantee of tax stability. The Award and its *ratio* stand. Therefore the possible scenario adverted to by Peru as requiring consideration of partial annulment of the section of the Award dealing with *actos propios* has not come to pass. Furthermore, DEI Bermuda having taken the formal position in its pleadings that the Tribunal's conclusions on estoppel are *obiter dicta* is itself bound by that statement. In the light of parties' positions, therefore, it is not necessary for the Committee to enter upon an analysis of whether the grounds for annulment advanced in relation to this section have merit, since such an analysis could not lead to the outcome sought by Peru, namely the partial annulment of that portion of the Award dealing with the MRA.355 Accordingly, the Committee does not do so.\n\nApplication for Annulment [101(2)].\n\n***4. Damages***\n----------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with the quantum of damages in Part VI of its Award (paragraphs 460 - 488). It had before it reports in chief and reply from experts called by each of the parties: Mr Kaczmarek of Navigant Consulting for DEI Bermuda and Mr Bustamante of Macroconsult for Peru, whose calculations are summarised at paragraphs 460 - 473, together with their respective critiques of each other's approach.\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal held that its task was to calculate damages resulting from the MRA only, limited to the period until the DEI Bermuda LSA expired in 2011. The Tribunal noted that the difference between the respective experts on these parameters was between US$19,469,721 (Navigant) and US$9,568,158 (Macroconsult).356\n\nAward [474] - [475].\n\n254.\n\nIn order to resolve this difference, the Tribunal considered the methodology adopted by each of the experts and their respective critiques of the other's approach. In the end, having scrutinised the data and calculations in each of the reports, the Tribunal came to the view that it could rely on the calculations of Mr Kaczmarek. By contrast, it was unable to verify the calculations of Mr Bustamante by reference to the supporting data. As a result, it adopted the sum as calculated by Mr Kaczmarek.357\n\n*Ibid* [481] - [483].\n\n255.\n\nPeru objects that the Tribunal did not supply reasons to explain why it regarded Macroconsult's methodology as inadequate. If it had had such concerns, Peru contends that the Tribunal had a duty to call Mr Bustamante to give oral evidence at the hearing, as DEI Bermuda had not. Its failure to do so violated Peru's fundamental procedural right to be heard.358\n\nMemorial [270] - [272].\n\n256.\n\nThe question of the margin of appreciation accorded to a tribunal in calculating damages was the subject of detailed consideration by an *ad hoc* committee in *Rumeli Telekom A/S v Kazakhstan.*359 That committee observed:\n\n*[T]ribunals are generally allowed a considerable measure of discretion in determining issues of quantum. Thus, in* Wena Hotels *, the* ad hoc *Committee held:360*\n\n*With respect to determination of the quantum of damages awarded, it may be recalled that the notion of \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" confers to the Tribunal a certain margin of discretion, within which, by its nature, few reasons more than a reference to the Tribunal's estimation can be given, together with statements on the relevance and the evaluation of the supporting evidence.*\n\n*This is not a matter to be resolved simply on the basis of the burden of proof. To be sure, the tribunal must be satisfied that the claimant has suffered some damage under the relevant head as a result of the respondent's breach.361 But once it is satisfied of this, the determination of the precise amount of this damage is a matter for the tribunal's informed estimation in the light of all the evidence available to it. This is widely accepted in municipal law.362*\n\n(Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/05/16 (25 March 2010), [146] - [147].\n\nSupra n 116, [91].\n\nCiting *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case (Germany v Poland)* (Merits) (1928) PCIJ Rep Ser A No 17, 56.\n\nCiting Gotanda 'Recovering Lost Profits in International Disputes' (2004-5) 36 Georgetown JIL 61, 101 and *Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL* (1992-4) 179 CLR 332, 368 (HCA).\n\n257.\n\nThis analysis is equally applicable here. The Tribunal had determined that DEI Bermuda had suffered loss as a result of the MRA. It was common ground between the experts that the MRA had had a material effect on DEI Bermuda. The Tribunal's task was thus to determine the extent of that loss as a matter of informed estimation, taking into account the evidence before it.\n\n258.\n\nThis the Tribunal patently did. It is the Tribunal that is *'the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value'.*363 It is no part of the mission entrusted to an *ad hoc* committee under Article 52 to review those judgments. Nor were the parties denied an opportunity to be heard on the question of damages. Both parties adduced two rounds of reports. In view of the sequential nature of written pleadings in ICSID procedure, this gave Peru and its expert the opportunity to consider and respond in writing to the approach taken by DEI Bermuda's expert and to respond to the latter's critique of Peru's approach. A tribunal is not obliged to hear from all witnesses orally. On the contrary, it is empowered under ICSID Arbitration Rule 36 to admit evidence given by a witness or expert in a written deposition. It follows that it may also evaluate the probative value of the evidence given in such a form. This final ground for partial annulment of the Award is thus also rejected.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1).\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n259.\n\nIt remains for the *ad hoc* Committee to consider what order it should make for, respectively, (i) the **ICSID Costs**364; and (ii) the costs and expenses of the parties in connection with the Annulment Proceeding (*'***Party Costs'**).\n\nComprising, in accordance with Articles 52(4) & 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n260.\n\nIn accordance with the direction of the *ad hoc* Committee, each party submitted a statement of its costs on 1 December 2010:\n\n(a) Peru submitted a Statement of its Costs quantified at US$1,365,400.60 (including Party Costs of US$885,400.60 together with its advances of ICSID Costs, which at that stage totalled US$480,000.00).\n\n(b) DEI Bermuda submitted a Statement of its Party Costs, which it quantifies, using an hourly rate, at US$1,373,325.40, whilst conceding that at present it is only obligated to pay US$662,380.90 as its attorneys' fees are capped, subject to an unspecified success fee.\n\n261.\n\nDEI Bermuda's Statement of Costs was accompanied by legal submissions as to costs. The *ad hoc* Committee accorded Peru the opportunity to respond to those submissions, which it did by letter dated 10 December 2010.\n\n262.\n\nDEI Bermuda requests that the *ad hoc* Committee order Peru to pay DEI Bermuda's Party Costs together with all of the ICSID Costs.365 DEI Bermuda submits that an award of costs is justified on the basis that Peru's application was *'manifestly unfounded'* and *'most unlikely to succeed'*,366 and that Peru *'artificially and unnecessarily'* drove up the cost of defending the annulment application.367\n\nCounter-Memorial [312(2)].\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, [13].\n\n*Ibid* [13] - [14].\n\n263.\n\nPeru responds that it has already paid US$480,000 in advances to the Centre and has not requested to be reimbursed for any portion of the ICSID costs.368 Peru further argues that it has brought *'serious, well-substantiated claims for annulment'* and thus submits that an order for it to pay DEI Bermuda's Party Costs is not justified and should be dismissed.369\n\nPeru's Response to Claimant's Submission on Costs, [18].\n\n*Ibid* [8] - [17].\n\n264.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee has discretion to determine how, and by whom, ICSID Costs and Party Costs should be borne (Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), read in conjunction with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53).\n\n265.\n\nIn view of Peru's clarification regarding ICSID costs, the *ad hoc* Committee is not required to make a determination as to apportionment of those costs, and accordingly makes an order confirming that Peru has to bear all of those costs.370\n\nThe Secretariat will in due course provide the Parties with a financial statement showing the ICSID Costs. The Centre will reimburse Peru any remaining balance in the case account once all costs and expenses have been paid.\n\n266.\n\nIn relation to DEI Bermuda's claim for reimbursement of its Party Costs, the practice of virtually all ICSID annulment committees has been to order each party to bear their own Party Costs, even where the Applicant has been wholly unsuccessful in its annulment application.371\n\nSchreuer *supra* n 121, 1234. See, *e.g., Wena Hotels supra* n 116, [112]; *Kl \u00f6 ckner supra* n 133, 163; *Amco Asia supra* n 230, [10.01]; *Rumeli supra* n 359, [183]; *MCI supra* n 105, [89]; *Azurix Corp v Argentine Republic* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/01/12 (1 September 2009), [380].\n\n267.\n\nThere have only been two cases in which *ad hoc* committees have departed from this approach. In each such case, there were exceptional circumstances.372 Thus, in *CDC v Seychelles* the *ad hoc* Committee concluded that the Respondent's application was *\"fundamentally lacking in merit\" and \"most unlikely to succeed\"*.373 In *Repsol v Ecuador,* the *ad hoc* Committee stressed that *\"the arguments for annulment did not pose novel or complex questions\"*374 and also pointed to the Applicant's failure to make timely payment of the advance on costs.\n\n*CDC v Seychelles supra* n 130, [89]; *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador* (Decision on Annulment) ICSID Case No ARB/01/10 (8 January 2007), [86].\n\n*Ibid* [89].\n\n*Ibid* [87].\n\n268.\n\nIn the present case, not all of the grounds raised in Peru's Application for Annulment were manifestly unfounded. Peru raised arguments in particular on the question of manifest excess of power - as it relates both to the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* and to the Tribunal's approach to the law applicable to *actos propios /* estoppel - that required the *ad hoc* Committee's extended consideration. Moreover, despite the number of points raised by Peru during the annulment proceeding, the Committee considers that Peru pursued the annulment proceeding in a constructive and professional manner. In light of these factors, the *ad hoc* Committee is not prepared to order that Peru pay DEI Bermuda's Party Costs. The Parties shall each bear their own Party Costs.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n269.\n\n**For the reasons given above, the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee decides that:**\n\n**(1) Peru's Application for Annulment is dismissed in its entirety.**\n\n**(2) Peru shall bear all ICSID Costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.**\n\n**(3) Each Party shall bear its own Party Costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.**\n\n**(4) Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3), the stay of enforcement of the Award ordered by the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee in its decision of 23 June 2009 is terminated.**"}]}
