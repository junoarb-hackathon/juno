In fact**\n--------------\n\nIn this section, the Arbitral Tribunal will confine itself to providing a brief summary of the facts underlying the dispute, to the extent required for this decision.\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe first Claimant, **Millicom International Operations B.V.** (hereinafter referred to as \"Millicom\", or \"Claimant 1\", or alternatively \"MIO\"), is a limited liability company organised and existing under Dutch law.\n\n2.\n\nThe second Claimant, **Sentel GSM S.A.** (hereinafter referred to as \"Sentel\", or \"Claimant 2\") is a limited company with a share capital of 60,000,000 CFAF, organised and existing under Senegalese law. Sentel is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millicom (see Request for Arbitration, no. 12), and has run a mobile telephony network in Senegal (\"Tigo\") since 1999.\n\n3.\n\nBoth Millicom and Sentel are part of the *Millicom International Cellular S.A.* Group (hereinafter referred to as \"MIC\"), a company under Luxembourg law established in 1990, founded by Millicom acting in joint venture with another mobile telephone operator, Industriforvaltnings AB Kinnevik (Sweden). MIC is not a party to these arbitration proceedings.\n\nMIC is a global telecommunications company. Via its subsidiaries, it provides telecommunication services in sixteen countries, in Asia, Latin America and Africa (Request for Arbitration, no. 12). According to the Claimants, Millicom (Claimant 1) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MIC, and Sentel (Claimant 2) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Claimant 1 (idem).\n\nClaimant 1 and Claimant 2 shall be jointly referred to as the \"Claimants\". They are represented by Messrs. Stephen Jagusch, Andrew Battisson, and Mark Levy of the firm of Allen & Overy LLP, London.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the **Republic of Senegal** (hereinafter referred to as \"Senegal\" or the \"Respondent\"). It is represented by Mr. Abdoulaye Dianko, State Judicial Officer, Mr. Remi Sermier, Esq., from the firm of Brandford-Griffith & Associes, Paris, Mr. Francois Sarr, Esq., SCP Francois Sarr & Associes, Dakar, and Professor Thomas Clay, Versailles.\n\n**B. Summary of the facts**\n---------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 3 July 1998, the Republic of Senegal granted Sentel a concession for its mobile telephony services entitled: *'\"Convention de concession entre l'Etat du Senegal et la Societe Sentel GSM S.A. pour l'exploitation d'un reseau public de radiotelephonie mobile cellulaire numerique GSM au Senegal*\" (hereinafter the \"Concession\"; Claimants' Exhibit C2).\n\nThis Concession was concluded under the Senegalese Telecommunications Code of 1996, which was in force at the time (Reply, no. 8). It granted Sentel the right to operate a (first) mobile telephony network in Senegal. Sentel undertook to abide by the terms and conditions of operation (Article 2) and to pay a licence fee to the Respondent (Article 9). The term of the Concession was set at twenty years, beginning on the publication of the Decree approving it (Article 1).\n\nDecree no. 98-719 approving the Concession between *The State of Senegal and Sentel* (Exhibit C3) was published on 2 September 1998, so the Concession was intended to lapse on 2 September 2018.\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 July 2000, Sentel was given a formal warning by the Respondent for serious breaches of the Concession (Reply, no. 13; Respondent's Exhibit R6). The document accused Sentel of having failed to pay the licence fee due on 1 January 2000; of being responsible for blatant violations of its obligation to provide technical, administrative and financial information; and of failing to respect the schedule for the radioelectric coverage of the National Territory (Exhibit R6). Sentel was given one month to respond to the allegations made against it.\n\n7.\n\nOn 29 September 2000, Mr. Bernard Sambou, Esq., bailiff, acting for the Respondent, visited the premises of Sentel to serve notice that, in accordance with Article 7.4 of the Concession, the Concession was being formally terminated, since Sentel had failed to comply within the period allotted to it in the formal warning and had failed to remedy the defects of which it was accused (Reply, nos. 14 and 15).\n\n8.\n\nOn 19 October 2000, Sentel informed the Judicial Officer of Senegal via Mr. Aloyse Ndong, Esq., bailiff, that it was formally contesting the reasons set out in the notice served on 29 September 2000 (Exhibit R8).\n\n9.\n\nOn 17 January 2001, the Respondent passed Decree no. 2001-23, intended to be the final stage in the proceedings terminating the Concession (Exhibit C5). This text has however still not been published.\n\n10.\n\nOn 13 March 2001, the Managing Director of Sentel filed an administrative appeal with the President of the Republic of Senegal against Decree no. 2001-23 of 17 January 2001. In this filing he contested the reasons for termination and emphasised that Sentel had respected all the terms and conditions of use of the Concession (Exhibit R11). On 15 March 2001, the Managing Director of Sentel sent to the Judicial Officer of Senegal a \"preliminary application\", the contents of which were identical to the contents of the filing submitted to the President of the Republic of Senegal (Exhibit R12).\n\nNeither of these letters received any response from the authorities to whom they were addressed. According to the Respondent, who is relying on Article 729 of the Senegalese Code of Civil Procedure, the silence kept for over four months by the authorities is equivalent to a decision of dismissal (Exhibit R21).\n\nStill according to the Respondent, the Claimant Sentel allegedly accepted the end of the Concession, since it was fully aware of Decree no. 2001-23 and had failed to bring any court proceedings in respect of that Decree. This situation is alleged to have become definitive on 17 August 2001.\n\n11.\n\nOn 27 December 2001, the new Senegalese Telecommunications Code came into force (Application, no. 14). Its transitional provisions include the following (Article 76, Exhibit R4):\n\n\" *Les titulaires de concession d'\u00e9tablissement et d'exploitation de r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications ouverts au public et de fourniture de services de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications en place \u00e0 la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du pr\u00e9sent Code, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de plein droit de l'exploitation des r\u00e9seaux et services de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9s.*\n\n*Ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient, en outre, des droits d'utilisation des fr\u00e9quences radio\u00e9lectriques relatives \u00e0 l'exploitation de leurs r\u00e9seaux et services vis\u00e9s ci-dessus. Cependant, ils sont soumis aux nouvelles conditions relatives aux licences notamment au paiement de contre partie financi\u00e8re, de redevances et de contributions pr\u00e9vues dans les cahiers de charge pr\u00e9vues par le pr\u00e9sent Code. Toutefois, pour les besoins de la mise en \u0153uvre du pr\u00e9sent Code, l'ART peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des modifications des assignations de fr\u00e9quences existantes.*\n\n*Dans un d\u00e9lai de six mois, un cahier des charges, approuv\u00e9 par d\u00e9cret, fixera les nouvelles conditions dans lesquelles les services de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications seront rendus.*\" (article 76).\n\n12.\n\nOn 9 August 2002, Senegal and MIC concluded an agreement, the content of which is as follows:\n\n*\"Le Groupe Millicom International adh\u00e8re \u00e0 la politique de l'Etat du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal relative \u00e0 la modernisation et la r\u00e9gulation du secteur des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et traduite recemment par la promulgation d'une nouvelle loi sur les telecommunications, la naissance d'une Agence de Regulation des Telecommunications et l'annonce de l'arrivee prochaine d'un nouvel operateur.*\n\n*Ainsi, soucieuse de se conformer a ce nouveau processus, le Groupe Millicom International accompagne de sa filiale Sentel a informe l'Etat du Senegal de sa volonte de negocier de bonne foi les nouvelles conditions mutuellement acceptables devant regir ses operations au Senegal.*\n\n*A la suite de cet engagement, le groupe Millicom International, a travers sa filiale Sentel continuera d'operer en toute legalite sous le cadre juridique de la Convention de 1998.*\"\n\nThis agreement, on whose scope the Parties have differing opinions, was signed by Abdoulaye Balde for Senegal and by David Kimche for MIC (Application, no. 14; Reply, no. 28; Exhibits C6 and R13).\n\n13.\n\nDespite the documents that were served to it, Sentel has continued and is still continuing to operate the Concession, developing its service and extending its subscriber base. It claims that it also regularly paid Senegal the licence fee in connection with the subscriptions it received during this period, in accordance with the Concession of 1998.\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 September 2008, the Respondent wrote to MIC inviting it to submit a tender for a second licence, informing it that a reasonable tender would be around two hundred million USD (Exhibit C10). This amount corresponded to the amount that Sudan Telecom Company Ltd. (Sudatel) had accepted to pay, when the latter obtained a full licence in autumn 2007 (Decree no. 2007-1333 of 7 November 2007, Exhibit R15). Correspondence was subsequently exchanged (Exhibits R16 and C11).\n\n15.\n\nOn 10 October 2008, Sentel submitted a tender stipulating the payment of twenty-one million USD, in preparation for the improvement of the network covered by the Concession (Exhibit C4).\n\nThe Respondent informed MIC by letter dated 22 October 2008 that it rejected this offer. It added: \"[...] *le Gouvernement a decide de mettre fin a cette situation provisoire. Aussi je vous informe que, faute par vous de vous ressaisir et de nous proposer un montant de contrepartie financiere tenant compte du prix plancher que represente le versement effectue par Sudatel pour une 3eme licence, la publication du decret n\u00b0 2001-23 du 17 janvier 2001, dont vous trouverez ci-joint une copie, interviendra au Journal Officiel de la Republique du Senegal, le vendredi 31 octobre 2008*.\" (Exhibit C12). Another exchange of correspondence took place following this (Exhibit R17 and Exhibits C15 and C16).\n\n16.\n\nOn 3 November 2008, Decree no. 2001-23 terminating the Concession (see no. 9 above) was published in the Official Journal (Exhibit R3).\n\nThat same day, the Respondent issued a press release stating that it had brought legal proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court to confirm the end of Sentel's licence (Exhibit C14).\n\n17.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, the Respondent brought proceedings against Sentel (Claimant 2 in these proceedings) and MIC (which is not a party to these proceedings) before the Dakar Regional Court (Exhibit C17A). It requested the Dakar Court on the one hand to order Sentel to cease and desist its illegal activity immediately and on the other hand to compel Sentel and MIC to pay damages for the harm that the two companies would have caused to the State, on the grounds that they allegedly used false promises to ensure that Senegal allowed Sentel to continue operating under a provisional framework since 2000 (Reply, nos. 59 and 60).\n\n18.\n\nThese proceedings continued as follows:\n\n- On 28 January 2009, MIC and Sentel submitted their requests for relief to the Dakar Regional Court (Exhibit C17B). They confined themselves to contesting the Court's jurisdiction, and did not submit any arguments on the merits of the case. According to them, Article 11 of the Concession grants exclusive jurisdiction to international arbitration institutions, such as the OHADA Arbitration Court, ICSID or the ICC in Paris (Exhibit C17B, p. 6).\n\n- On 10 February 2009, the Respondent submitted its response (Exhibit C17C). With regard to jurisdiction, the Respondent replied to the Claimants' claims by alleging that Article 11 of the Concession did not contain an arbitration clause, and that if it did, the clause was not valid, and that in any event it fell to the Court before which proceedings were brought to rule on its own jurisdiction.\n\n- On 11 March 2009, MIC and Sentel submitted their reply, in which they confined themselves to confirming their jurisdictional objection of the Dakar Regional Court, without making any submissions as to the merits (Exhibit C17D).\n\n- On 7 April 2009, the Respondent filed its summary submissions in rejoinder (Exhibit C17E). It maintained its previous submissions with respect to the issue of jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court (Exhibit C17E).\n\n- On 13 May 2009, MIC and Sentel made their summary submissions in rejoinder (Exhibit C17F). They once again raised the lack of jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court in favour of ICSID.\n\n- On 27 May 2009, the Respondent made additional submissions with respect to the jurisdictional objection (Exhibit C17G). It concluded that the Dakar Regional Court had jurisdiction.\n\n- On 24 June 2009, MIC and Sentel indicated that they did not intend to reply to the latest Respondent's submissions on the grounds that it was merely a repetition. They stated that they were upholding all of their requests, allegations and claims as they had been set out in their previous written submissions (Exhibit C17H).\n\n- At an unspecified date, the Dakar Regional Court is, according to the statements of the Respondent, alleged to have closed the proceedings (Transcript of the hearing of 9 November 2009, English version, p. 134).\n\nThe Dakar Regional Court had set a hearing for 23 September 2009. Under the rules of the Senegalese Code of Civil Procedure, the purpose of this hearing was to inform the parties that the judgement was being deliberated, which meant that the Court could issue its decision on a date that it would communicate to the Parties.\n\nFollowing the joint interventions of the two Parties recommended by this Arbitral Tribunal during the first session held on 7 September 2009, the Dakar Regional Court accepted to postpone the hearing until 23 December 2009.\n\n19.\n\nNotwithstanding these letters and proceedings, Sentel continues to operate the Concession.\n\n**C. Summary of Arbitration Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, the date on which the Respondent brought proceedings before the Dakar Court (see no. 17 above), the Claimants jointly submitted a \"**Request for Arbitration**\" (hereinafter the \"Request for Arbitration\") to the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as the \"Secretariat\").\n\nIn that Request they made the following requests for relief:\n\n\"*The Claimants request the following relief:*\n\n*(i) a declaration that the Respondent has violated Articles 3, 4 and 8 of the Treaty;*\n\n*(ii) a declaration that the Respondent has violated the Licence, as well as applicable rules of Senegalese and international law;*\n\n*(iii) an order that the Respondent make full reparation to the Claimants for the injury or loss to their investment arising out of the Respondent's violation of any of the Treaty, the Licence, and applicable rules of Senegalese and international law, such full reparation being in the form of damages or compensation paid to the Claimants in an amount to be determined, including interest thereon;*\n\n*(iv) compensation for the moral damages done to the Claimants, in an amount to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal;*\n\n*(v) an order that the Respondent pay the costs of these arbitration proceedings including the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimants including but not limited to the fees of their legal counsel, experts and consultants as well as the Claimants' own employees, on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable commercial rate; and*\n\n*(vi) any other relief the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances.\"*\n\n21.\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Secretariat asked the Claimants to provide additional information about Sentel's incorporation in Senegal, Sentel's representation, Millicom's ownership of Sentel, Millicom's status as a \"national\" for the purposes of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Netherlands and Senegal (hereinafter (\"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\") and the consent of Senegal to submit this dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n22.\n\nOn 5 December 2008, the Respondent asked the Secretariat to refuse to register the Request for Arbitration in the ICSID Arbitration Register on the grounds that the Centre has no jurisdiction. In response, the Claimants submitted a document entitled \"Observations on the jurisdiction of the Centre\" on 19 December 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \"Observations on the jurisdiction of the Centre\").\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 December 2008, the Secretariat received the information it had requested (see no. 21 above) and on 31 December 2008, it registered the Request for Arbitration.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 January 2009, the Claimants proposed a method for constituting the Arbitral Tribunal. Following an exchange of correspondence dated 19 February, 23 February, 26 February and 2 March 2009, the Parties agreed to constitute a tribunal of three arbitrators, with each Party appointing an arbitrator and the two arbitrators thereby appointed nominating a President.\n\n25.\n\nOn 1 April 2009, the Claimants appointed Professor Kaj Hober as an arbitrator, who accepted this appointment.\n\n26.\n\nOn 7 April 2009, the Respondent appointed Judge Ronny Abraham as an arbitrator, who accepted this appointment.\n\n27.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, the two co-arbitrators appointed Professor Pierre Tercier as President of the Arbitral Tribunal, who accepted this appointment.\n\n28.\n\nOn 12 June 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted.\n\n29.\n\nOn 24 August 2009, the Claimants submitted a \"**Provisional Measures Application**\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Application\"; see no. 36 below).\n\n30.\n\nOn 27 August 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held a telephone conference to discuss the Application submitted by the Claimants and the agenda for the first session of the Tribunal that it intended to hold.\n\n31.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, the Respondent informed the Arbitral Tribunal by letter that the Application submitted by the Claimants was the Claimants' latest tactic to gain time. However, the Respondent would not be opposed to postponing the hearing originally scheduled to be heard before the Dakar Regional Court on 23 September 2009 (see no. 18 above).\n\n32.\n\nOn 7 September 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held its first session with the Parties, in Paris. With regard to the unresolved questions, it was agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal would take the necessary decisions in a procedural order (see Minutes of the session, p. 14).\n\nWith respect to the provisional measures regarding the proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court, the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged that the Respondent was not opposed to a joint letter being drafted with the Claimants in order to apply to have the hearing scheduled for 23 September 2009 to be postponed. The Parties furthermore agreed that whichever of them would subsequently win would not enforce any decision from the Dakar Regional Court (see Minutes of the first session, p. 15).\n\nThat same day, the Respondent confirmed by letter the undertaking it had made during the first session.\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its **Procedural Order No. 1**, in which it ruled as follows:\n\n***\"1.***\n\n*- In principle, hearings of the Tribunal will take place in Paris, unless the Parties agree on another venue and inform the Arbitral Tribunal in a timely fashion.*\n\n***2.***\n\n*- The proceeding will be conducted simultaneously in French and in English. All documents from the Arbitral Tribunal or the Centre will be written in both languages and all hearings will be subject to simultaneous interpretation.*\n\n*- Each Party is entitled to write its submissions (with annexes) and its correspondence in the language of its choice without having to provide a translation into the other language;*\n\n*- The Arbitral Tribunal will decide at a later stage and in accordance with its assessment on the allocation of costs generated by this decision.*\n\n***3.***\n\n*- The Parties are invited to file a first round of written submissions limited to objections to jurisdiction;*\n\n*- The Respondent is invited to submit its memorial on jurisdiction by October 29, 2009, at the latest;*\n\n*- The Claimants are invited to file their counter-memorial within forty-five days upon receipt of the first submission, or by December 14, 2009, at the latest;*\n\n*- Upon receipt of the counter-memorial, the Arbitral Tribunal will decide if it continues to address this issue as a preliminary matter or if it intends to address the case altogether;*\n\n*- In either case, the Arbitral Tribunal will fix a timetable after consultation with the Parties.*\n\n***4.***\n\n*- The Parties' undertakings with regard to the proceeding pending before the Court in Dakar are noted.*\n\n***5.***\n\n*- The Respondent has until October 5, 2009, to respond to the request for provisional measures;*\n\n*- If they so wish, the Claimants may file their comments on this response within ten days upon receipt of the response;*\n\n*- If it so wishes, the Respondent may file its observations on these comments within ten days upon their receipt;*\n\n*- A hearing will take place in Paris on November 9, 2009, to hear the Parties' oral arguments on this issue.\"*\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 October 2009, the Respondent submitted its \"**Memoire en reponse a la demande de measures conservatoires**\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Reply\"; see no. 37 below).\n\n35.\n\nOn 9 November 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held a hearing in Paris with the Parties (see Transcript of the hearing of 9 November 2009). The representatives of the Parties were given the opportunity to submit their arguments orally and to respond to questions from the Arbitral Tribunal. Following this hearing, the representatives of the two Parties stated that they did not wish to formulate any new applications with regard to this stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring that same hearing, the Arbitral Tribunal discussed with the representatives of the Parties the potential timetables for the subsequent stages in the proceedings, depending on whether or not it decided to bifurcate the proceedings and address the jurisdictional objections and the questions on the merits in two successive phases; it should be recalled that this decision is to be taken in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 (see no. 33 above) after having received a response from the Claimants regarding the jurisdictional objections that must be filed by 14 December 2009 at the latest. In that regard, it was agreed that if the Arbitral Tribunal were to order the \"bifurcation\" of the proceedings, the Respondent would submit its reply on the Tribunal's jurisdiction by 15 January 2010; the Claimants would submit their rejoinder by 15 February 2010; and the hearing would take place in Paris on 31 March and/or 1 April 2010 (see Transcript of the hearing of 9 November 2009 at the end).\n\n**II. In law**\n--------------\n\n**A. The Submissions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn their Application (no. 29 above), the Claimants made the following requests for relief:\n\n*\"(a) that the Respondent, the Republic of Senegal (**Senegal**), discontinues, or causes to be discontinued, the proceedings instituted by it in the Regional Court of Dakar, Senegal (the **Regional Court**) against Millicom International Cellular S.A. (**MIC**) (the ultimate parent of the Claimants) and Sentel, as described in section 2 below (the **Regional Court Proceedings**);*\n\n*(b) in the alternative, that Senegal agrees to stay such proceedings, or causes them to be stayed, for the duration that the present ICSID arbitration proceedings under reference number ICSID Case No. ARB/08/20 (the **ICSID Arbitration Proceedings**) are pending;*\n\n*(c) that Senegal does not seek to enforce, or cause to be enforced, any interim or final judgment of the Regional Court in relation to the Regional Court Proceedings while the ICSID Arbitration Proceedings are pending;*\n\n*(d) that the parties refrain from conduct that might aggravate or further extend the dispute submitted to this Tribunal; and*\n\n*(e) that the Tribunal recommends any further measures or relief that it deems appropriate in the circumstances to preserve the rights identified in section 3.4 below, including the maintenance of the status quo.\u00bb* (Application, n\u00b0 1) *.*\n\n37.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent requested the following:\n\n*\"On these grounds, the Republic of Senegal requests that it please the Arbitral Tribunal to reject in its entirety the application for provisional measures submitted by MIO and Sentel.\"* (Reply, p. 37).\n\n**B. The basis for the provisional measures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe principle of provisional measures is set out in Article 47 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\" or the \"Washington Convention\"), on the basis of which these proceedings were opened and which stipulates:\n\n*\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"*\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention is referred to, extended and developed by Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules, which in its current version reads:\n\n\"*(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\"*\n\nIt should be added that provisional measures, which are temporary in nature and by definition, may be modified or cancelled at any time by the Arbitral Tribunal, do not have the same authority as an issue already judged (*res judicata*), are valid only for as long as the proceedings last and become automatically null and void if the Arbitral Tribunal rules that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the dispute.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 39(4) of the Arbitration Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal gave *\"each party an opportunity of presenting its observations*\", and the Parties have had ample opportunity to express themselves both orally and in writing.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is thus able to give an informed ruling on the Claimants' Application.\n\n**C. Conditions**\n-----------------\n\n39.\n\nProvisional measures may be granted only on the following four conditions:\n\n- The Arbitral Tribunal must be *prima facie* competent to hear the merits of the case (see ch. 1 below);\n\n- The measure requested must intend to preserve the rights the protection of which has been sought (see ch. 2 below);\n\n- The measure must be necessary (ch. 3 below); and\n\n- The measure must be urgent (ch. 4 below).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will examine each of these conditions below.\n\n**1. The** ***prima facie*** **jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on the Application for provisional measures.\n\n- In short, the Claimants deem that the *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is chiefly established by the registration of the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention (Application, no. 35); that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over Sentel in application of Article 11 of the Concession; and that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over MIO and Sentel in application of Article 10 of the BIT between Senegal and the Republic of the Netherlands.\n\n- In short, the Respondent deems that the mere fact that the Request for Arbitration was registered is not sufficient to establish a *prima facie* jurisdiction, that Article 11 of the Concession does not contain an arbitration clause, and that Article 10 of the Treaty does not apply, since MIO is not an investor as defined by that provision and Sentel is not a national from another State.\n\n41.\n\nThe core of the debate centers around two provisions, whose content it is worth restating:\n\n- Article 11 of the Concession states as follows:\n\n\"*Les Parties feront tout leur possible pour regler a l'amiable tout differend resultant de l'execution de la Presente Convention. Elles devront, au prealable si les lois et reglements en vigueur le permettent, recourir a tout organisme de conciliation de reglementation et d'arbitrage competent en matiere de telecommunications. Il en sera de meme en cas de conflits entre operateurs notamment lors des accords d'interconnexion. Si le litige persiste, les parties pourront en definitive recourir a l'arbitrage d'organismes internationaux tels que la cour d'arbitrage de l'OHADA, le Centre International de reglement des differends sur les investissements (CIRDI) ou la Chambre de Commerce Internationale de Paris (CCIP) etc...\"*\n\n- Article 10 of the Treaty between Senegal and the Netherlands states as follows:\n\n*\"La Partie Contractante sur le territoire de laquelle un ressortissant de l'autre Partie Contractante effectue ou envisage d'effectuer un investissement, devra consentir a toute demande de la part de ce ressortissant en vue de soumettre, pour arbitrage ou conciliation, tout differend pouvant surgir de cet investissement au Centre institue en vertu de la Convention de Washington du 18 mars 1965 pour le reglement des differends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d'autres Etats.*\"\n\n42.\n\nIt is accepted jurisprudence for the tribunals that have issued rulings based on the Washington Convention that the mere fact that a party contests the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to which the case is referred is insufficient to deprive that tribunal of the jurisdiction to order provisional measures1. If the contrary were to be accepted, it would be easy for a party to raise any jurisdictional objection in order to deprive in practice a large part of the institution's competence. It is also undisputed and indisputable that provisional measures form an essential part of the operation and the effectiveness of the ICSID arbitration system; while waiting for a decision to be given on the merits of a case and provided that the conditions have been met, the aim is to ensure as far as possible that no decisions can be taken that risk depriving that decision of its main effect in fact2.\n\nThat said, on the other hand, it is not enough for one party to bring proceedings to establish the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal before which an application for provisional measures has been brought. The solution would be every bit as indefensible.\n\nIn order to take account of these conflicting interests, it is accepted practice for the Arbitral Tribunal to find that it holds at least *prima facie* jurisdiction to rule on the merits. This implies that the Arbitral Tribunal cannot and must not examine in depth the claims and arguments submitted on the merits of the case; it must confine itself to an initial analysis, i.e. \"*at first sight*\" *.* For this, it is necessary and sufficient that the facts alleged by the applicant establish this jurisdiction without it being necessary or possible at this stage to verify them and analyse them in depth.\n\nSee for example *Victor Pey Casado and Fondation President Allende v. Republic of Chili*, ICSID Case no. ARB/98/2, Decision on provisional measures, 25 September 2001, para. 7: \"*Aussi la jurisprudence internationale est-elle claire a cet egard : l'instance dont la competence est contestee n'est nullement privee du pouvoir de decider des mesures provisoires.\"* (hereinafter referred to as \"*Pey Casado*\").\n\nSee for example, *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1, 1 July 2003, para. 2: \"*the parties to a dispute over which ICSID has jurisdiction must refrain from any measure capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision, and in general refrain from any action of any kind which might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult\"* (hereinafter referred to as \"*Tokios Tokeles\"*). See also *Pey Casado*, *cited above*., para 26: \"*les mesures conservatoires ont, notamment ou principalement, pour but de preserver ou proteger l'efficacite de la decision a intervenir sur le fond, donc d'eviter de \"porter prejudice a l'execution de la sentence\" et/ou d'empecher que, de facon unilaterale, une Partie par action ou omission porte atteinte aux droits eventuels de la Partie adverse.*\"\n\n43.\n\nIt is in light of these principles that the Arbitral Tribunal intends to examine whether it has *prima facie* jurisdiction to rule on the requests submitted to it:\n\na) The Claimants base their argument on the fact that the ICSID Secretariat agreed to register the Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimants (see \"In fact\" above). It is correct that the Secretariat was entitled to refuse to register such a request, in application of Article 36(3) of the Washington Convention, which states as follows:\n\n*\"The Secretary-General shall register the request unless he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. He shall forthwith notify the parties of registration or refusal to register.\"*\n\nFor the Arbitral Tribunal, the mere fact that the Request for Arbitration has been registered might certainly constitute a sign of *prima facie* jurisdiction, but under no circumstances may it constitute a sufficient condition. The registration process is summary in nature and is intended solely to perform an initial check in order to dismiss immediately any requests manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre. The decision is taken solely on the basis of the Request for Arbitration and the additional information provided by the requesting party, without waiting for or formally requesting any comments from the other party.\n\nRequirements are necessarily stricter at the provisional measures stage, since the Arbitral Tribunal will have had the opportunity to receive additional information (whether unprompted or at its own request), which therefore enables it - still on a provisional basis, of course - to give an initial ruling on its own jurisdiction.\n\nRegistration as an argument is therefore insufficient in and of itself to establish the Arbitral Tribunal's *prima facie* jurisdiction.\n\nb) The Claimants then deem that the *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is established pursuant to Article 11 of the Concession, reproduced above. This jurisdiction may extend only to Sentel, which is a party to the Concession, but not to MIO, which is not.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the clause under Article 11 of the Concession is not without ambiguities. It seems to imply that recourse to arbitration is one possibility open to the parties (\"*may*\") rather than the only option; it leaves open the issue of which institution will govern the proceedings; the list of institutions set out (OHADA, ICSID and ICC) is itself not exhaustive (\"*etc.*\"). As asserted by the Respondent, it is not impossible that this provision is intended as an invitation for the parties to agree on an arbitration agreement in order to refer the dispute to one of the institutions listed.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, these arguments do not automatically exclude another interpretation. The provision does not actually make any reference to local courts, and there would be good reasons for making disputes relating to concessions of this nature subject to the jurisdiction of international arbitration, under the auspices of the institutions mentioned. What is more, the clause contains a clear reference to arbitration, and it is not automatically excluded that the option given to the party refers not to the choice of proceedings but to the choice of the institution, as the Claimants maintain.\n\nThe fact is that the Claimants also contested the jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court, even going so far as to take the risk of renouncing to comment on the submissions made by the Republic of Senegal on the merits of the case before that Court.\n\nIn these conditions, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it does have *prima facie* jurisdiction to rule on the Request for Arbitration, to the extent that the latter is based on the Concession.\n\nc) The Claimants finally maintain that the Arbitral Tribunal also has jurisdiction to rule on the issue by virtue of Article 10 of the Treaty, the text of which has been reproduced above. This jurisdiction would primarily extend to MIO, which maintains that it can avail itself of the Treaty, and only indirectly to Sentel, which is a Senegalese company.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, its jurisdiction is not given from this perspective either, since it is incumbent on Claimant 2 to prove that it can benefit from this protection despite the fact that the Treaty appears to confine this protection to individuals, and it must also be established that the Claimant actually made an investment in Senegal as defined by the Treaty.\n\nThat said, the Arbitral Tribunal admits that there is room for doubt, since the phrasing of the Treaty is not without ambiguity, as it is possible that MIO made an investment in Senegal, via links that will be described below, in the form of its (direct or indirect) investment in Sentel's share capital.\n\nWhat is more, it appears to the Arbitral Tribunal that, since it has acknowledged its *prima facie* jurisdiction over Sentel, it can acknowledge that same jurisdiction by analogy over MIO, especially as the provisional measures requested mainly relate to the continuation of the proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court, precisely because MIO is not a party to those proceedings.\n\n**2. Preserving rights the protection of which has been sought**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe second condition required to grant provisional measures is that those measures must be necessary to preserve rights the protection of which is being sought in the proceedings brought on the merits.\n\na) In the Claimants' view, granting the measures is directly linked to the rights that they are requesting be protected: the right to bring the dispute exclusively before the jurisdiction of ICSID, in accordance with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, to the exclusion of any remedy under national, international, judicial or administrative law; and the right to continue bringing their claims without the arbitration proceedings becoming meaningless owing to a judgement to the contrary passed by the Senegalese courts (Application, no. 42).\n\nb) In the Respondent's view, there is no link between the provisional measures requested and the dispute brought before the Arbitral Tribunal. In their Application, the Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunal suspend the effective application of the decision in which the Republic of Senegal has decided to terminate the authorisation to operate enjoyed by Sentel. This is apparently a fundamental request, and examining it would require adopting a position on the merits of the case, and thus issuing a pre-judgement (Reply, no. 97). Furthermore, the Claimants apparently did not make a request for relief to the Arbitral Tribunal intended to annul the decision terminating their authorisation to operate (Reply, no. 99). With regard to the argument concerning Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent alleges that the two disputes are not connected (Reply, no. 110). Allegedly, neither the parties nor the subject-matter of the proceedings is identical, since before the Dakar Regional Court the applications would be based exclusively on the behaviour of MIC and Sentel in the wake of the termination of the Concession (Reply, nos. 132 and 133). Finally, the causes of action in the two disputes are not identical (Reply, nos. 134 *et seq.*) A judgement from the Regional Court upholding the submissions of Senegal in their entirety would not by any means harm the interests that the Claimants intend to assert as part of these arbitration proceedings (Reply, no. 141).\n\n45.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the objections raised by the Respondent are not decisive:\n\na) Although it is true that the requests for relief made by the Claimants thus far before the Arbitral Tribunal appear to be intended merely to obtain damages, nothing prevents the Claimants from modifying their requests during the proceedings. Such a measure is not by any means prohibited, provided it respects the principle of the right to be heard and the scope of the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction. What is more, in spite of the phrasing of these requests for relief, as set out under paragraph 20 above, the argument developed refers to the possibility of claiming restitution (see no. 60 of the Request for Arbitration).\n\nb) It cannot be disputed that both sets of proceedings concern the same set of facts, i.e. the development of the status of the parties bound by the Concession for mobile telephony. In spite of the provisional or temporary phrasing of the requested relief, it is based or can be based on the same issue, namely the existence and continuation of the Concession. The outcome of any pecuniary submissions made in either circumstance depends directly on this.\n\nc) The Respondent states that the parties are different between the two proceedings, since MIC is a party to the State proceedings but not a party to these proceedings, whereas MIO is a party to these proceedings but is not a party to the Senegalese proceedings. This argument is not conclusive either, given that the status of the parties is not necessarily defined in the same way in both sets of proceedings. In particular, in so far as the other conditions have been met, Claimant 2 in these proceedings (MIO) has an obvious interest in the outcome of the Senegalese proceedings, if it can claim the benefit of a protected investment by virtue of its interest in Sentel's capital.\n\nd) It is worth noting that the Arbitral Tribunal will not rule on the question of whether it would have the power to order restitution and the power to order the Republic of Senegal to respect the Concession, if the latter were to be held valid. Regardless of the requests for relief submitted, the essence of both proceedings concerns whether or not the Concession is valid.\n\ne) Finally, it is admitted that protected rights can also include procedural rights such as the general right to *status quo* and the right to non-aggravation of the dispute3.\n\nSee for example, *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, para. 60: \"*In the Tribunal's view, the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form the subject-matter of the dispute or substantive rights as referred to by the Respondents, but may extend to procedural rights, including the general right to the status quo and to the non-aggravation of the dispute. These latter rights are thus self-standing rights*\", relying on other decisions. In the same sense, *Tokios Tokeles*, *cited above*. Procedural Order No.. 3, 18 January 2005, para. 7: \"*Among the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID Arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy* [ *..*.].\"\n\n**3. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n46.\n\nIn order for an arbitral tribunal to be able to recommend provisional measures, they must also be necessary:\n\na) According to the Claimants, a judgement from the Dakar Regional Court would cause irreparable harm, if the Concession were to be held invalid (Application, no. 59).\n\nb) According to the Respondent, the existence of irreparable harm has not been proven, due to the fact that if a judgement were passed that caused harm to the Claimants, the latter would be able to request the Arbitral Tribunal for equitable compensation measures in order to remedy the situation (Reply, no. 89). Furthermore, Millicom would not be affected by any judgement from the Dakar Regional Court, since it is not even party to the Senegalese proceedings. According to the Respondent, it would be unfair if the Arbitral Tribunal were to grant Millicom the right to cease all proceedings brought by Senegal against Sentel and MIC, on the sole ground that Millicom availed itself of the ICSID Convention and the Treaty between Senegal and the Netherlands despite the fact that Senegal had no means of bringing any claim whatsoever against that company (Reply, nos. 116 and 128). With regard to the harm suffered, the Respondent alleges that if the Dakar Regional Court were to uphold Senegal's requests in their entirety and sentence MIC and Sentel jointly and severally to pay all sums claimed by the State, MIC would be able to pay the sums required without placing its existence in jeopardy (Reply, no. 146).\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, it is correct that, strictly speaking, there is nothing preventing both sets of proceedings from taking place more or less simultaneously, a situation that has already occurred in other cases submitted to ICSID. This situation is admittedly far from perfect and may cause a range of practical difficulties, depending on the speed adopted by the Court or the Tribunal. For this reason, two scenarios must be considered:\n\na) It is probable that, if no specific measures are taken, the Dakar Regional Court will give its judgement before the arbitration proceedings have finished. It is admittedly possible that the party that would have lost, whether the Republic or Sentel, would file an appeal against that decision, or even an appeal to a higher authority after the decision of the Court of Appeal. According to the information given at the hearing of 9 November 2009, an appeal will suspend the enforcement of the judgement, unless the Dakar Regional Court orders provisional enforcement at the request of one of the parties, and such a request was made during the current proceedings.\n\nLeaving these aspects aside temporarily, it is conceivable that the judgement of the Dakar Regional Court might be rendered before the award of the Arbitral Tribunal.  \n The Tribunal is certainly not bound by the decisions taken by national courts4. It is however true that the purpose of these arbitration proceedings is liable to change, since the Claimants might, depending on the circumstances, wish to incorporate the outcome of the Senegalese proceedings into their allegations, with regard to the Concession, or even to the Treaty.\n\nPursuing both sets of proceedings in parallel would necessarily involve complications, misunderstandings or even serious resistance at the stage of enforcing the decision, if the Arbitral Tribunal were to find in favour of the Claimants.\n\nb) It is theoretically possible that the arbitration proceedings will end before all potential legal remedies in Senegal have been exhausted. The difficulty in this situation, if the decision is not equivalent to the rulings of the Senegalese courts, will be to have that decision accepted and followed, since it would then have priority over the aforementioned rulings.\n\nEither way, pursuing both sets of proceedings in parallel will generate difficulties, which would not necessarily be in the interests of either party, not to mention the misunderstandings or discontent that could occur as a result. The objective of the measure would thus be to guarantee the *status quo*.\n\nIn concrete terms, the response is heavily dependent on the time factor, which is why it is important to move onto examining the issue of urgency.\n\nDe facto, \"*The right to seek access to international adjudication must be respected and cannot be constrained by an order of a national court. Nor can a State plead its internal law in defence of an act that is inconsistent with its international obligations. Otherwise, a Contracting State could impede access to ICSID arbitration by operation of its own law*\", *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2, 16 October 2002, 18 ICSID Rev.-FIJL (2003), p. 300\n\n**4. The urgency of the decisions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIt is undisputed that, in order to be admitted, the provisional measures must also be urgent. It must be proven that if the measures are not ordered rapidly, there are serious risks that the rights of the applicants will be jeopardized5.\n\nIn the case in question, it is likely that, subject to the reservations expressed above, the Dakar Regional Court will rule before the Arbitral Tribunal. If the difficulties that have just been set out are to be avoided, a measure must be taken to prevent the arbitration proceedings from losing the essential part of their scope in practice.\n\nSuch a measure, which would be provisional in nature, must not be unduly extended, owing to the uncertainty it will create. For this reason, it must be of a limited duration only. This precaution is especially justified in the present case given that it seems that the Arbitral Tribunal could rule quickly on the central issue at this stage, namely the issue of its own jurisdiction. The fact that this decision implies suspending proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court should not seem unacceptable to the Respondent: according to the Respondent and if the Respondent is right, the illegal situation has been going on for several years now, and asking it to endure that situation for another couple of months is not going to cause it irreparable harm, especially since if it were to emerge that it was entirely within its rights, it would retain the right to seek additional pecuniary damages.\n\nSee in this sense, Passage through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark), Provisional measures, Order of 29 July 1991, I.C.J. Reports 1991, p. 12, para 23: *\"Whereas provisional measures under Article 41 of the Statute* [model of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention] *are indicated \"pending the final decision\" of the Court on the merits of the case, and are therefore only justified if there is urgency in the sense that action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is given.*\"\n\n**D. Consequences**\n-------------------\n\n49.\n\nSince the conditions have been met, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts on principle the Application for provisional measures. According to the text of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, an arbitral tribunal is entitled to issue \"*recommendations*\". It has nevertheless been held in certain decisions issued by tribunals formed on the basis of that Convention that the phrasing used does not prevent an arbitral tribunal from ordering such measures6. According to the Arbitral Tribunal, the question may remain undecided, since the nature of the measure required in the present case is scarcely compatible with imposing an injunction on the Parties:\n\na) Suspending the proceedings may not be done unilaterally by the Respondent, since this can be done only by the Dakar Regional Court, on which this Tribunal has no power to command. What is possible, on the other hand, is to recommend to the Respondent that it request the Dakar Regional Court in a joint letter with the other Party to agree to suspend proceedings, in the interests of both sets of proceedings. This is the approach that was taken when applying for the hearing of 23 September 2009 to be postponed, and it was implemented perfectly.\n\nb) The Arbitral Tribunal is confident that the Respondent, which is aware of what is at stake, will agree to follow this new recommendation, and that it will not be necessary to order it to do so. The understanding displayed by the Republic of Senegal thus far foresees that it will react in the same way to this recommendation.\n\nc) Even if this were not the case, the Arbitral Tribunal is aware of the fact that, if the recommendation were not followed, any injunction it could issue - presuming that it had the power to do so - would not in any event be suitable for forced execution.\n\nFor these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal will issue a recommendation.\n\nSee Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (Cambridge 2009), Article 47, paras. 1522 and *Pey Casado*, cited above, paras. 17-24.\n\n50.\n\nAs has been said above, if the Application is to be partially granted, the Arbitral Tribunal feels that the effects of its recommendation should be of a limited duration.\n\nThe crucial question in the case in question is the issue of whether the Tribunal itself has jurisdiction to rule on the requests for relief that have been submitted to it. If it were to decide that it had no jurisdiction, the measures would automatically lapse, and the Respondent could pursue the proceedings before the Senegalese judicial authorities. If, on the other hand, it were to decide that it did hold jurisdiction, it would be appropriate to re-examine the situation and decide, on request by one of the parties or on its own initiative, whether or not its recommendation should be extended or modified.\n\nFor this reason, the duration of the provisional measures must be limited to the decision that this Arbitral Tribunal will take as to its own jurisdiction.\n\n51.\n\nIn accordance with the decisions taken in the Order of 14 September 2009 (see ch. 3), the Arbitral Tribunal will have to decide, once it has received the reply from the Claimants, whether it intends to address all issues simultaneously or whether the issue of its jurisdiction should be resolved in the first place. In light of the developments connected with the provisional measures requested, however, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that it is justified in the present case in beginning by ruling on the objections raised to its own jurisdiction. It is important that the relationships that exist or that may exist between the pending proceedings be clarified as quickly as possible. The objections made by the Respondent require a decision to be taken quickly, even if they cannot be admitted in the absence of an in-depth examination.\n\nDuring the hearing of 9 November 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal considered, together with the Parties, what the potential timetable might be if it were to decide to rule first and foremost on the objections raised to its own jurisdiction; it seems that the pace contemplated is rapid, which should enable the Arbitral Tribunal to decide before the summer. In its opinion, this finding also has the potential to ensure that the recommendation it is issuing to both parties, although chiefly to the Respondent, is acceptable.\n\nAs a result, and without waiting for the reply from the Claimants, the Arbitral Tribunal decides to bifurcate the proceedings, and that it will begin by ruling on the objections raised by the Respondent with regard to its own jurisdiction, in accordance with the timetable it had contemplated during the hearing of 9 November 2009 (Transcript of the hearing of 9 November 2009, English version, pp. 153-157). The details of this timetable will be confirmed by a procedural order that will be sent to the Parties as soon as this decision has been notified.\n\n**E. The other applications**\n-----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants have made other submissions in addition to those concerning the suspension of the proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court (see no. 36 above). The Arbitral Tribunal deems that it is not currently necessary to rule on the issue, in view of the scope of the recommendation issued to the Parties.\n\n**On these grounds, the Tribunal recommends the following:**\n\n**1. The Respondent is invited to send jointly with Claimant 2, an application to the Dakar Regional Court to have the pending proceedings in Senegal suspended.**\n\n**2. This measure shall be valid until the decision of this Arbitral Tribunal is taken concerning its own jurisdiction.**\n\n**3. In modification to the Order it issued on 14 September 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it will rule in priority on the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent; the timetable for this stage of the proceedings will be communicated to the Parties in an Order that will be sent to them once this decision has been notified, on the basis of the timetable envisaged during the hearing of 9 November 2009.**\n\n**4. The other applications will, if necessary, be examined later, upon the express request of the Claimants.**\n\n**5. The Tribunal reserves its ruling on the costs of the proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2010-07-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

It has its registered address at Sockholm 26, 1993 LM Barendrect, the Netherlands (Claim. 22.12.08, exhibit C-26).\n\n2.\n\nThe second Claimant, **Sentel GSM** (hereinafter referred to as \"Sentel\", or \"Claimant 2\") is a limited company with a share capital of 60,000,000 CFAF, organized and existing under Senegalese law (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 11; Claim. 12.02.10, exhibit C-50). It has operated a mobile telephony network in Senegal (\"Tigo\") since 1999 (Claim. 14.12.09, no. 6).\n\n3.\n\nBoth Millicom and Sentel are part of the *Millicom International Cellular S.A.* Group (hereinafter referred to as \"MIC\"), a company established under Luxembourg law in 1990. It arose from the merger between Millicom, an American company, and Industriforvaltnings AB Kinnevik, a Swedish company, both active in the mobile telephone sector (Claim.14.12.09, exhibit C-42). MIC is not a party to these arbitration proceedings.\n\nMIC is a global telecommunications company. Via its subsidiaries it provides telecommunication services in sixteen countries, in Asia, Latin America and Africa (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 12). Millicom (Claimant 1) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MIC, and Sentel (Claimant 2) is a wholly-owned (less one share) subsidiary of Claimant 1 (see no. 83 below).\n\nClaimant 1 and Claimant 2 are jointly referred to as the \"Claimants\" in this decision.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the **Republic of Senegal** (hereinafter referred to as \"Senegal\", \"the Republic\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\nB. SUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n-----------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn March 9, 1998, the Republic of Senegal launched a call for tenders for \" *l'autorisation d'\u00e9tablissement et d'exploitation de syst\u00e8mes mobiles terrestres cellulaires num\u00e9riques de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications sur le territoire national* \" (Claim. 14.12.09, exhibit C-34). Terms and Conditions were drawn up at this time (\" *Cahier de Charges relatif \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement d'un r\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie publique terrestre sur le territoire national* \", Claim. 14.12.09, exhibit C-43 *).*\n\n6.\n\nIn the month of April 1998, a consortium named \"Sentel gsm\" tendered a bid entitled \" *Proposition pour un r\u00e9seau de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications* \" (Claim. 14 12.09, exhibit C-42). The Consortium tendering the bid was comprised of MIC to which, in particular, the Kinnevik Group belongs (\" *R\u00e9sum\u00e9 administratif* \", p. 4, exhibit C-42), and Groupe Soserca/C.F.I. Soserca S.A. is a 100 percent Senegalese insurance company formed in 1978, whereas C.F.I. is a real estate company founded in 1926. Mr. Pape Abdoul Ba is the Chairman and Managing Director of Groupe Soserca/C.F.I. (Claim.14.12.09, exhibit C-42, \" *R\u00e9sum\u00e9 administratif* \", ch. 2, p. 6).\n\n7.\n\nOn 18 June 1998, the Minister of Telecommunications informed the representatives of MIC that their bid had been provisionally accepted (letter of 18.6.98, Claim. 14.12.09, exhibit C-44). Negotiations were carried out in June and July 1998. They lasted approximately three weeks (Mr. Rosh Statement, p. 5) and were carried out based on a draft prepared by the Respondent (\" *Projet de* *Concession entre l'Etat du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'exploitation d'un r\u00e9seau* *public de radiot\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile cellulaire num\u00e9rique GSM au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal* \" hereinafter the \"Draft\", Claim. 14.12.09, exhibit C-41).\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 July 1998, the Republic of Senegal granted Sentel a concession for its mobile telephony services entitled: \" *Convention de concession entre l'Etat du* *S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sentel GSM S.A. pour l'exploitation d'un r\u00e9seau public de radiot\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile cellulaire num\u00e9rique GSM au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal* \" (hereinafter the \"Concession\"; Claim. 11.11.08, exhibit C-2).\n\nThe Concession was concluded \" *entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et la soci\u00e9te Sentel GSM S.A., filiale du Groupe Millicom International Cellular (MIC), \u00e9lisant domicile au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal* [...]\" (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 8). It was signed for the Concessionaire by Mr. Youval Rosh, the Managing Director of Sentel GSM, and by Mr. Peter Macnee for the Chairman of Millicom International Cellular. It should be noted that at the time of signing the Sentel limited company had not yet been formally created but that the Concession had already been entered into in its name.\n\nThis Concession was concluded under the Senegalese Telecommunications Code of 1996, which was in force at the time (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 8). It granted Sentel the right to operate a (first) mobile telephony network in Senegal. Sentel undertook to abide by the terms and conditions of operation (Article 2) and to pay a part of the licence fee to the Respondent (Article 9).\n\nThe term of the Concession was set at twenty years, beginning as of the publication of the Decree approving it (Article 1). As \" *D\u00e9cret no. 98-719 portant approbation de la Concession entre l'Etat du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sentel* \" was published on 2 September 1998 (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 18, exhibit C-6), the Concession was intended to lapse on 2 September 2018.\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 July 1998, \"Sentel GSM\" was created in Dakar (Resp. 15.01.10, exhibit R-32; Claim. 22.12.08, C-26) and was registered the following day (Claim. 22.12.08, exhibit C-23). Its share capital is 60,000,000 CFAF, divided into 6,000 shares of 10,000 CFAF each. Its shareholders were the following (Resp. 15.01.10, exhibit R-32; Claim. 22.12.08, exhibits C-26 and C-23; Claim. 12.02.10, exhibit C-50):\n\n- \"Tucan Corporation NV\", a company domiciled in the Netherlands Antilles, represented by Mr. Youval Rosh, which thereafter became \"Millicom Senegal NV\" (4,498 shares),\n\n- Mr. Peter Macnee (one share),\n\n- Mr. Mark Lewis (one share), and\n\n- Mr. Pape Abdoul Ba (1,500 shares).\n\nThe shareholding of the company and its subsequent changes shall be described in detail and discussed further on (see no. 83 below).\n\n10.\n\nSince 1999, Sentel operated the Concession and has provided mobile telephone services to the Senegalese population under the \"Tigo\" brand (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 19).\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 July 2000, Sentel was given a formal warning by the Respondent for serious breaches of the Concession (Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-6). The document accused Sentel of having failed to pay the licence fee due on 1 January 2000; of being responsible for blatant violations of its obligation to provide technical, administrative and financial information; and of failing to respect the schedule for the radio electric coverage of the National Territory (Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-6). According to the Respondent, Sentel was given one month to respond to the allegations made against it (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 13).\n\n12.\n\nOn 29 September 2000*,* Mr. Bernard Sambou, bailiff, acting for the Respondent, visited the premises of Sentel to serve notice that, in accordance with Article 7.4 of the Concession, the Concession was being formally terminated, since Sentel had failed to comply within the period allotted to it in the formal warning and had failed to remedy the defects of which is was accused (Resp. 05.10.09, nos. 14 and 15).\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 October 2000, Sentel informed the Judicial Officer of Senegal via Mr. Aloyse Ndong, bailiff that it was formally contesting the reasons set out in the notice served on 29 September 2000 (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 16; exhibit R-8).\n\n14.\n\nOn 17 January 2001, the Respondent passed *\"D\u00e9cret no. 2001-23 mettant fin \u00e0 la convention de concession entre l'Etat du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et la soci\u00e9te SENTEL GSM S.A.* \" (Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-3), intended to be the final stage in the proceedings terminating the Concession (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 17). This text was not however published at the time in the Official Journal *.* According to the Respondent, it was nonetheless announced in the press (Transcript 09.11.09, p. 26). According to the Claimants, this Decree was merely a draft which was never promulgated (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 20).\n\n15.\n\nOn 13 March 2001, the Managing Director of Sentel filed an administrative appeal (\" *recours gracieux* \") with the President of the Republic of Senegal against Decree no. 2001-23 of 17 January 2001. He contested therein the reasons for termination and emphasized that Sentel had respected all the terms and conditions of use of the Concession (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 21; exhibit R-11). On 15 March 2001, the Managing Director of Sentel sent to the Judicial Officer of Senegal a \"preliminary application\", the contents of which were identical to the contents of the filing submitted to the President of the Republic of Senegal (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 22; exhibit R12).\n\nAccording to the Respondent, neither of these letters received any response from the authorities to whom they were addressed. According to the Respondent, who is relying on Article 729 of the Senegalese Code of Civil Procedure, the silence kept for over four months by the authorities is equivalent to a decision of dismissal (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 23; exhibit R-21).\n\nAlso according to the Respondent, Sentel allegedly accepted the end of the Concession, since it was fully aware of Decree no. 2001-23 (\" *D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 200123\"*) and had failed to bring any court proceedings (\" *recours contentieux* \") in respect of that Decree. This situation is alleged to have become definitive on 17 August 2001 (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 25).\n\n16.\n\nOn 27 December 2001, the new Senegalese Telecommunications Code came into force (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 22; Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-4). Its transitional provisions include *inter alia* the following:\n\n\" *Les titulaires de concession d'\u00e9tablissement et d'exploitation de r\u00e9seaux de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications ouverts au public et de fourniture de services de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications en place \u00e0 la date d'entr\u00e9e en vigueur du pr\u00e9sent Code, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de plein droit de l'exploitation des r\u00e9seaux et services de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9s.*\n\n*Ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient, en outre, des droits d'utilisation des fr\u00e9quences radio\u00e9lectriques relatives \u00e0 l'exploitation de leurs r\u00e9seaux et services vis\u00e9s ci-dessus. Cependant, ils sont soumis aux nouvelles conditions relatives aux licences notamment au paiement de contre partie financi\u00e8re, de redevances et de* *contributions pr\u00e9vues dans les cahiers de charge pr\u00e9vues par le pr\u00e9sent Code. Toutefois, pour les besoins de la mise en \u0153uvre du pr\u00e9sent Code, l'ART* [Agence de R\u00e9gulation des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications] *peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des modifications des assignations de fr\u00e9quences existantes.*\n\n*Dans un d\u00e9lai de six mois, un cahier des charges, approuv\u00e9 par* *d\u00e9cret, fixera les nouvelles conditions dans lesquelles les services de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications seront rendus.* \" (Article 76).\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 August 2002, Senegal and MIC concluded an agreement (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 26), the content of which is as follows:\n\n\" *Le Groupe Millicom International adh\u00e8re \u00e0 la politique de l'Etat du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal relative \u00e0 la modernisation et la r\u00e9gulation du secteur des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et traduite r\u00e9cemment par la promulgation d'une nouvelle loi sur les t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, la naissance d'une Agence de R\u00e9gulation des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications et l'annonce de l'arriv\u00e9e prochaine d'un nouvel op\u00e9rateur.*\n\n*Ainsi, soucieuse de se conformer \u00e0 ce nouveau processus, le Groupe Millicom International accompagn\u00e9 de sa filiale Sentel a inform\u00e9 l'Etat du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal de sa volont\u00e9 de n\u00e9gocier de bonne foi les nouvelles conditions mutuellement acceptables devant r\u00e9gir ses op\u00e9rations au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.*\n\n*A la suite de cet engagement, le groupe Millicom International, \u00e0 travers sa filiale Sentel continuera d'op\u00e9rer en toute l\u00e9galit\u00e9 sous le cadre juridique de la Convention de 1998.* \"\n\nThis agreement, with respect to the scope of which the Parties have differing opinions, was signed by Mr. Abdoulaye Balde for Senegal and by Mr. David Kimche for MIC (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 22; Resp. 05.10.09, no. 28; exhibits C-9; exhibit R-13).\n\n18.\n\nThroughout this period and despite the documents that were served to it, Sentel has continued to operate the Concession, developing its service and extending its subscriber base (Resp. 05.10.09, nos. 51 *et seq.* ; Transcript 01.04.10, French version, p. 25, English version, p. 56; Claim. 12.02.10, exhibit C-48, p. 2). Sentel claims that it also regularly paid Senegal a part of the licence fee in connection with the subscriptions it received during this period, in accordance with the Concession.\n\n19.\n\nOn 28 February 2008, a \"credit facility agreement\" was entered into between MIO and Sentel. The lender (MIO) granted a loan to Sentel in the amount of US$ 19,115,250 (Claim. 12.02.10, exhibit C-48).\n\n20.\n\nOn 24 September 2008, the Respondent wrote to MIC inviting it to submit a tender for a second licence, informing it that a reasonable tender would be around two hundred million USD (Claim. 11.11.08, exhibit C-13). This amount corresponded to the amount that \"Sudan Telecom Company Ltd. (Sudatel)\" had accepted to pay, when the latter obtained a full licence in the autumn of 2007 (*Decree no. 2007-1333 of 7 November 2007,* Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-15). Correspondence was subsequently exchanged (Claim. 11.11.08, exhibit C-14 and Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-16).\n\n21.\n\nOn 10 October 2008, Sentel submitted a tender stipulating the payment of twenty-one million USD, in preparation for the improvement of the network covered by the Concession (Claim. 11.11.08, exhibit C-7).\n\nThe Respondent informed MIC by letter dated 22 October 2008 that it rejected this offer (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 29). It added: \"[...] *le Gouvernement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre fin \u00e0 cette situation provisoire. Aussi je vous informe que, faute par vous de vous ressaisir et de nous proposer un montant de contrepartie financi\u00e8re tenant compte du prix plancher que repr\u00e9sente le versement effectu\u00e9 par Sudatel pour une 3\u00e8me licence, la publication du d\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2001-23 du 17 janvier 2001, dont vous trouverez ci-joint une copie, interviendra au Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, le vendredi 31 octobre 2008*.\" (Claim. 11.11.08, exhibit C-15). Another exchange of correspondence took place following this (Claim. 11.11.08, exhibits C-19 and C-20 and Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-17).\n\n22.\n\nOn 3 November 2008, Decree no. 2001-23 terminating the Concession (see no. 14 above) was published in the Official Journal (Resp. 05.10.09, exhibit R-3).\n\nThat same day, the Respondent issued a press release stating that it had brought legal proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court requesting it to ascertain the termination of Sentel's licence (Claim. 11.11.08, exhibit C-17).\n\n23.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, the Respondent brought proceedings against Sentel and MIC (which is not a party to these proceedings) before the Dakar Regional Court (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31A). It requested the Court on the one hand to order Sentel to cease and desist its illegal activity immediately and on the other hand to compel Sentel and MIC to pay damages for the harm that the two companies had caused the State, on the grounds that they allegedly used false promises to ensure that Senegal allowed Sentel to continue operating under a provisional framework since 2000 (Resp. 05.10.09, nos. 59 and 60).\n\nIt must be noted that on the same day, Millicom International Operations (MIO) and Sentel, the two Claimants, instituted these arbitration proceedings before ICSID (see no. 26 below).\n\nHence, Claimant 1 (MIO) is not a party to the proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court whereas MIC, which is a party to the proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court, is not party to these arbitration proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nThe proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court continued as follows in parallel to this proceeding:\n\n- On 28 January 2009, MIC and Sentel submitted their requests for relief to the Dakar Regional Court (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31B). They confined themselves to contesting the Court's jurisdiction, and did not submit any arguments on the merits of the case. According to them, Article 11 of the Concession grants exclusive jurisdiction to international arbitration institutions, such as the OHADA Arbitration Court, ICSID or the ICC in Paris (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31B, p. 6).\n\n- On 10 February 2009, the Republic of Senegal submitted its response (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31C). With regard to jurisdiction, the Respondent replied to the objections of MIC and Sentel by alleging that Article 11 of the Concession would not contain an arbitration clause, and that, if it did, the clause would not be valid, and that in any event it would fall to the Court before which proceedings were brought to rule on its own jurisdiction.\n\n- On 11 March 2009, MIC and Sentel submitted their reply, in which they confined themselves to confirming their jurisdictional objection to the Dakar Regional Court, without making any submissions as to the merits (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31D).\n\n- On 7 April 2009, the Republic of Senegal filed its summary submissions in its reply (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31E). It maintained its previous submissions with respect to the issue of jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court.\n\n- On 13 May 2009, MIC and Sentel filed their summary submissions in their rejoinder (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31F). They once again raised the lack of jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court in favor of ICSID.\n\n- On 27 May 2009, the Republic of Senegal made additional submissions with respect to the jurisdictional objection (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31G). It concluded that the Dakar Regional Court has jurisdiction.\n\n- On 24 June 2009, MIC and Sentel indicated that they did not intend to reply to the Republic of Senegal's latest submissions on the grounds that they were merely a repetition of previous submissions. They stated that they were upholding all of their requests, allegations and claims as they had been set out in their previous written submissions (Claim. 24.08.09, exhibit C-31H).\n\n- On 22 July 2009, the Dakar Regional Court, according to the statements of the Respondent, is alleged to have closed the proceedings (Transcript 09.11.09, French version, pp. 48 and 49, English version, p. 134).\n\nThe Dakar Regional Court had set a hearing for 23 September 2009. Under the rules of the Senegalese Code of Civil Procedure, during this hearing the parties would have been informed that the judgment was being deliberated, which meant that the Court could issue its decision on any date to be communicated to the parties. Following the joint interventions of the two Parties to this proceeding, recommended by this Arbitral Tribunal during the first session held on 7 September 2009 (see below no. 31), the Dakar Regional Court accepted to postpone the hearing until 23 December 2009.\n\nTwo successive postponements were thereafter accepted under the same conditions (see nos. 40 and 45 below):\n\n- one on 23 December 2009, postponed to 26 May 2010 (e-mail from Mr. Sermier, dated 23 December 2009),\n\n- the other on 23 May 2010, postponed to 28 July 2010 (letter from Mr. Sermier, dated 28 May 2010).\n\n25.\n\nNotwithstanding the letters sent to it and the proceedings that were brought, Sentel continues to operate the Concession.\n\nC. SUMMARY OF ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS\n-------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, the date on which the Respondent brought proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court (see no. 23 above), the Claimants jointly submitted a \" **Request for Arbitration** \" (hereinafter the \"Request for Arbitration\") to the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as the \"Secretariat\").\n\nIn that Request they made the following requests for relief:\n\n\" *The Claimants request the following relief:*\n\n*(i) a declaration that the Respondent has violated Articles 3, 4 and 8* *of the Treaty;*\n\n*(ii) a declaration that the Respondent has violated the Licence, as well as applicable rules of Senegalese and international law;*\n\n*(iii) an order that the Respondent make full reparation to the Claimants for the injury or loss to their investment arising out of the Respondent's violation of any of the Treaty, the Licence, and applicable rules of Senegalese and international law, such full reparation being in the form of damages or compensation paid to the Claimants in an amount to be determined, including interest thereon;*\n\n*(iv) compensation for the moral damages done to the Claimants, in an amount to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal;*\n\n*(v) an order that the Respondent pay the costs of these arbitration proceedings including the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimants including but not limited to the fees of their legal counsel, experts and consultants as well as the Claimants' own employees, on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable commercial rate; and*\n\n*(vi) any other relief the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances.* \"\n\nThey based their claims,\n\n- with regard to Claimant 1, on Article 10 of the \" *Accord relatif \u00e0 l'encouragement et la protection des investissements entre le Royaume des Pay-Bas et la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal du 3 ao\u00fbt* 1979\" (hereinafter the \" *Accord* \"), and\n\n- with regard to Claimant 2, on Article 11 of the Concession,\n\n- moreover, with regard to both Claimants, on the \"C *onvention (of Washington) of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States* \" (hereinafter the \"ICSID Convention\" or the \"Washington Convention\").\n\n27.\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Secretariat invited the Claimants to provide additional information about Sentel's incorporation in Senegal, Sentel's representation, Millicom's ownership of Sentel, Millicom's status as a \"national\" in connection with the *Accord* and the consent of Senegal to submit this dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\nOn 5 December 2008, the Respondent invited the Secretariat to refuse to register the Request for Arbitration in the ICSID Arbitration Register on the grounds that the Centre lacked jurisdiction. On 19 December 2008, the Claimants replied to the queries from the Secretariat in a document entitled \"Observations on the jurisdiction of the Centre\". On 31 December 2008, the Secretariat registered the Request for Arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nOn 14 January 2009, the Claimants proposed a method for constituting the Arbitral Tribunal. Following an exchange of correspondence dated 19 January, 23 February, 26 February and 2 March 2009, the Parties agreed to constitute a tribunal of three members, the Respondent and the Claimants each appointing an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators thereby appointed, nominating a president. On 1 April 2009, the Claimants appointed Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r as an arbitrator, who accepted his appointment. On 7 April 2009, the Respondent appointed Judge Ronny Abraham as an arbitrator, who accepted his appointment. On 5 June 2009, the two co-arbitrators appointed Professor Pierre Tercier as president of the Arbitral Tribunal, who accepted his appointment. On 12 June 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted and this proceeding was deemed to have begun.\n\n29.\n\nOn 24 August 2009, the Claimants sent the Arbitral Tribunal an application for provisional measures (\" **Provisional Measures Application** \"), in which they requested the Arbitral Tribunal in particular to prohibit the Respondent from continuing the proceeding brought before the Dakar Regional Court, and in the alternative, to invite the Respondent to stay such proceedings during the present proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nOn 27 August 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties to discuss the Provisional Measures Application submitted by the Claimants and the agenda for the first session that it intended to hold. On 28 August 2009, following a telephone conference between the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, the President invited the Respondent to apply to the Dakar Regional Court to postpone the hearing scheduled for 23 September 2009 (see above no. 24). On 1 September 2009, the Respondent informed the Arbitral Tribunal by letter that the Application submitted by the Claimants was the Claimants' latest tactic to gain time, but that it would not be opposed to postponing the hearing.\n\n31.\n\nOn 7 September 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held its **first session** with the Parties, in Paris. It discussed various procedural issues with them, stating that it would settle them in its first procedural order (see Minutes of the session, p. 14).\n\nWith respect to the Provisional Measures Application, the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged that the Respondent was not opposed to a joint letter being drafted with the Claimants in order to apply to have the hearing scheduled for 23 September 2009 postponed. The Parties furthermore agreed that whichever of them would subsequently win would not execute any decision by the Dakar Regional Court (see Minutes of the first session, p. 15). That same day, the Respondent confirmed by letter the undertaking it had made. Following the intervention of the Parties, the hearing scheduled for 23 September 2009 was in fact postponed (see no. 24 above).\n\n32.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its **Procedural Order no. 1**, in which it ruled as follows:\n\n\" ***1.***\n\n*- In principle, hearings of the Tribunal will take place in Paris, unless the Parties agree on another venue and inform the Arbitral Tribunal in a timely fashion.*\n\n***2.***\n\n*- The proceeding will be conducted simultaneously in French and in English. All documents from the Arbitral Tribunal or the Centre will be written in both languages and all hearings will be subject to simultaneous interpretation.*\n\n*- Each Party is entitled to write its submissions (with annexes) and its correspondence in the language of its choice without having to provide a translation into the other language;*\n\n*-*  *The Arbitral Tribunal will decide at a later stage and in accordance with its assessment on the allocation of costs generated by this decision.*\n\n***3.***\n\n*- The Parties are invited to file a first round of written submissions limited to objections to jurisdiction;*\n\n*- The Respondent is invited to submit its memorial on jurisdiction by October 29, 2009, at the latest;*\n\n*- The Claimants are invited to file their counter-memorial within forty-five days upon receipt of the first submission, or by December 14, 2009, at the latest;*\n\n*- Upon receipt of the counter-memorial, the Arbitral Tribunal will decide if it continues to address this issue as a preliminary matter or if it intends to address the case altogether;*\n\n*-*  *In either case, the Arbitral Tribunal will fix a timetable after consultation with the Parties.*\n\n***4.***\n\n*-*  *The Parties' undertakings with regard to the proceeding pending before the Court in Dakar are noted*\n\n***5.***\n\n*- The Respondent has until October 5, 2009, to respond to the request for provisional measures;*\n\n*- If they so wish, the Claimants may file their comments on this response within ten days upon receipt of the response;*\n\n*- If it so wishes, the Respondent may file its observations on these comments within ten days upon their receipt;*\n\n*- A hearing will take place in Paris on November 9, 2009, to hear the Parties' oral arguments on this issue.* \"\n\n33.\n\nOn 5 October 2009, the Respondent submitted its \" ***M\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse sur la demande de measures conservatoires*** \". It concluded, in particular \" *\u00e0 ce qu'il plaise au Tribunal arbitral rejeter dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 la demande de mesures conservatoires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par MIO et Sentel.* \"\n\n34.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, the Respondent submitted its \" ***M\u00e9moire sur l'incomp\u00e9tence*** \" (see no. 52 below in respect of the requests for relief).\n\n35.\n\nOn 9 November 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal held **a hearing on the provisional measures** in Paris with the Parties (see Transcript 09.11.09). The representatives of the Parties were given the opportunity to submit their arguments orally and to respond to questions from the Arbitral Tribunal. Following this hearing, the representatives of the two Parties stated that they did not wish to make any new applications with regard to this stage of the proceedings.\n\n36.\n\nOn 7 December 2009, t he Arbitral Tribunal rendered its **Procedural Order no. 2** in which the text of the corrected transcript from the hearing held on 9 November 2009 was approved (Transcript 09.11.09), based on the proposals made and positions taken by the Parties concerning the draft that had been submitted to them.\n\n37.\n\nOn 9 December 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered its \" **Decision on the Application for provisional measures submitted by the Claimants on 24**\n\n**August 2009** \" in which it was recommended:\n\n\" *1. The Respondent is invited to send jointly with Claimant 2, an application to the Dakar Regional Court to have the pending proceedings in Senegal suspended.*\n\n*2. This measure shall be valid until the decision of this Arbitral Tribunal is taken concerning its own jurisdiction.*\n\n*3. In modification to the Order it issued on 14 September 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it will rule in priority on the objections to jurisdiction raised by Respondent; the timetable for this stage of the proceedings will be communicated to the Parties in an Order that will be sent to them once this decision has been notified, on the basis of the timetable envisaged during the hearing of 9 November 2009.*\n\n*4. The other applications will, if necessary, be examined later, upon the express request of the Claimants.*\n\n*5. The Tribunal reserves its ruling on the costs of the proceedings.* \"\n\n38.\n\nOn 14 December 2009, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered its **Procedural Order no.** **3,** in which it decided:\n\n\" *1. As agreed at the first session, the Claimants will file their counter-memorial on jurisdiction by December 14, 2009.*\n\n*2. The Respondent will file its reply on jurisdiction by January 15, 2010.*\n\n*3. The Claimants will file their rejoinder on jurisdiction by February 12, 2010.*\n\n*4. A conference call will be held with the President of the Tribunal at a date to be determined to discuss with the Parties the organization of the forthcoming hearing.*\n\n*5. A hearing will take place in Paris on March 31 and/or April 1, 2010, it being specified that if the hearing lasts only one day, it will be held on April 1, 2010.* \"\n\n39.\n\nOn 14 December 2009, the Claimants submitted their \" **Counter-memorial on jurisdiction** \" (see no. 52 in respect of the requests for relief).\n\n40.\n\nOn 23 December 2009, the Respondent's counsel informed the Arbitral Tribunal that the Dakar Regional Court upheld the Respondent's request and postponed the matter to 26 May 2010.\n\n41.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, the Respondent submitted its \" ***M\u00e9moire en r\u00e9plique sur l'incomp\u00e9tence*** \" (see no. 52 below in respect of the requests for relief).\n\n42.\n\nOn 12 February 2010, the Claimants submitted their \" **Rejoinder on jurisdiction** \" (see no. 52 below in respect of the requests for relief).\n\n43.\n\nOn 1 April 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal held **the principal hearing on questions of jurisdiction** in Paris with the Parties. No witnesses were heard (see no. 49 below). The Parties' counsel were given the opportunity to present oral arguments. Following such hearing the Parties stated that they had no other applications to make concerning this phase of the proceeding (Transcript 01.04.10, French version, p. 58, English version, p. 140).\n\n44.\n\nOn 19 April 2010, the President of the Arbitral Tribunal invited the Parties' counsel to formulate their submissions concerning the costs of the proceeding for the case where it lacks jurisdiction. The Claimants did so in a letter dated 30 April; the Respondent in a letter dated 30 April 2010. On 7 May 2010 Claimants' counsel formulated objections to the list submitted by the Respondent.\n\n45.\n\nOn 11 May 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal requested the Respondent to request postponement of the hearing scheduled for 26 May 2010 before the Dakar Regional Court, in order to allow it sufficient time to render (in two languages) its decision on jurisdiction. The Respondent again accepted such request and informed the Arbitral Tribunal that the hearing of the Dakar Regional Court was scheduled for 28 July 2010 (letter of 28 May 2010 from Mr. Sermier; see no 24 above).\n\n**II. THE LAW**\n---------------\n\nA. IN GENERAL\n-------------\n\n**1. The arbitration proceeding and constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration on 11 November 2008 (see no. 26 below). This Request was registered by the Secretariat of ICSID on 31 December 2008 following receipt of additional information requested to the Claimants (see no. 27 above).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 12 June 2009 (see no. 28 above). Neither Party has raised any objections in this regard.\n\n47.\n\nThe proceedings have been conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules.\n\nIn its Procedural Order no. 3 (see no. 38 above), the Arbitral Tribunal decided to rule specially and firstly on the issues involving its own jurisdiction. Accordingly, in this phase of the proceeding the Arbitral Tribunal shall rule on such issues only, deferring examination of the issues on the merits to a subsequent date in the event that it were to find it had jurisdiction.\n\n48.\n\nAs stated earlier (see no. 37 above), the Arbitral Tribunal already ruled on an application by the Claimants for provisional measures. The Parties had ample opportunity, both at that phase as well as the present phase, to make written and oral arguments.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants produced the testimony of six witnesses with their written submissions:\n\n- Mr. Pape Abdoul Ba, the founder of SOSERCA (\" *Attestation* \" of 10 December 2009; \" *Seconde Attestation* \" of 12 February 2010),\n\n- Mr. Youval Rosh, Senior Managing Director of Sentel from June 1998 to the year 2000 (\" *Attestation* \" of 9 December 2009; \" *Seconde Attestation* \" of 12 February 2010),\n\n- Mr. Kemal Shefik, who worked for Netcom, a MIC group company, and who took part in preparing Sentel's tender (\" *Witness Statement* \" of 9 December 2009),\n\n- Mr. Marc Beuls, CEO of MIC from 1 January 1998 to 1 March 2009, and a member of Sentel's board of directors from 2002 to 2003 (\" *Witness Statement* \" of 12 February 2010),\n\n- Mr. Kevin Koch, \"General Manager\" of Sentel since April 2008 (\" *Witness Statement* \" of 12 February 2010), and\n\n- Mr. Lars Svenningsson, \"Corporate Secretary\" of MIC since July 2007 (\" *Witness Statement* \" of 12 February 2010).\n\nThe Respondent waived producing witness statements. It also expressly waived cross-examination of the Claimants' witnesses who had submitted written witness statements.\n\n50.\n\nFollowing the hearing held on 1 April 2010 the Parties expressly confirmed that they had no objections with respect to the proceedings up until then (Transcript 01.04.10, French version, p. 58, English version, p. 140).\n\n51.\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal in its Procedural Order no. 1 (see no. 32 above), the entire proceeding was conducted simultaneously in French and English. Furthermore, this decision was drafted in one of the languages and then translated into the other; consequently, both versions shall be deemed authentic.2\n\nNote of the Arbitral Tribunal: Texts that were originally drafted in French are hereinafter kept in their original language. However, for ease of reference, the Accord will also be referred to in its translated version in English.\n\n**2. The submissions of the Parties and the structure of the decision**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***2.1. The submissions of the Parties***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn their final versions, the Parties make the following requests for relief (the numbers in brackets have been added by the Arbitral Tribunal in order to facilitate the references thereto):\n\nFor the Respondent (Resp. 15.01.10, no. 393):\n\n\" *Pour les raisons d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es dans son d\u00e9clinatoire de comp\u00e9tence et dans le pr\u00e9sent m\u00e9moire, la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal demande au Tribunal arbitral de :*\n\n*a.* [Resp. 1] *Se d\u00e9clarer incomp\u00e9tent pour examiner la demande de Sentel et la demande de MIO ;*\n\n*b.* [Resp. 2] *Condamner ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique du* *S\u00e9n\u00e9gal les frais de l'arbitrage ainsi que les frais engag\u00e9s pour assurer sa d\u00e9fense.* \"\n\nFor the Claimants (Claim. 14.12.09, no. 422):\n\n\" *For the foregoing reasons, the Claimants request the following relief:*\n\n*(i)* [Claim. 1] *a declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to decide the claims before it brought by Sentel ;*\n\n*(ii)* [Claim. 2] *a declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to decide the claims before it brought by MIO;*\n\n*(iii)* [Claim. 3] *without prejudice to any final determination of the* *merits of the parties' dispute, an order that Senegal pays all costs incurred in relation to the objections to jurisdiction it raised,* *including the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimants including but not limited to the fees of their legal counsel, experts and consultants as well as the Claimants' own employees, on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable commercial rate;*\n\n*(iv)* [Claim. 4] *any other relief the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances; and*\n\n(v) [Claim. 5] *order in respect of the procedure for the next phase of this case.* \"\n\n***2.2. The subject matter and structure of the decision***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nSave for the requests for relief concerning the determination and allocation of costs and expenses of the arbitration, the sole subject matter of this decision is to decide on the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent concerning the claims instituted against it by the Claimants. The competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to so judge is undeniable, arising from Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention pursuant to which \"[ *t* ] *he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence* \" *.*\n\nAs stated above (see no. 37 above), the Arbitral Tribunal decided to give priority to this issue: if it finds it has jurisdiction with respect to at least one of the claims, the proceeding shall continue; in the opposite case it shall end.\n\n54.\n\nBased on the submissions the Arbitral Tribunal is justified in examining the issues in the following order:\n\n- the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of MIO, Claimant 1 (B below),\n\n- the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of Sentel, Claimant 2 (C below),\n\n- the determination and allocation of costs and expenses (D below), according to the conclusions that the Arbitral Tribunal shall reach concerning the first two issues,\n\n- the determination in respect of the continuation of the proceeding (E below).\n\nB. THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL IN RESPECT OF MIO\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The issue**\n----------------\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction in this matter in respect of Claimant 1, MIO, which allegation is contested by the Claimants.\n\nThe Respondent in fact makes the following request for relief [Resp. 1]:\n\n\"[...] *la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal demande au Tribunal arbitral de:*  \n*Se d\u00e9clarer incomp\u00e9tent pour examiner* [\u2026] *la demande de MIO\"*\n\nThe Claimants put forward the following request for relief [Claim. 2], requesting that the Arbitral Tribunal make:\n\n\" *a declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to decide the claims before it brought by MIO* \".\n\n56.\n\nAs concerns MIO, the Claimants base their allegations on Article 10 of the *Accord,* which is worded as follows:\n\n\" *La Partie Contractante sur le territoire de laquelle un ressortissant de l'autre Partie Contractante effectue ou envisage d'effectuer un investissement, devra consentir \u00e0 toute demande de la part de ce ressortissant en vue de soumettre, pour arbitrage ou conciliation, tout diff\u00e9rend pouvant surgir au sujet de cet investissement au Centre institu\u00e9 en vertu de la Convention de Washington du 18 mars 1965 pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements entre Etats et ressortissants d'autres Etats.* \"  \n (\" *The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national of the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment shall assent to any request on the part of such national to submit, for arbitration or conciliation, any dispute that may arise in connection with that investment, to the centre established by the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States.* \")\n\n57.\n\nWhen the conditions of this Article are fulfilled, an investor alleging having been injured may rely on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, whose first paragraph (sentence 1) is worded as follows:\n\n\" *The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.* \"\n\na) It is traditionally deduced therefrom, sometimes presented in different ways due to the inevitable cross-referencing between them, that an arbitral tribunal to which a request is made based on such provision combined with the arbitration clause provided for in a treaty, has jurisdiction under the following conditions:\n\n- (1) the claimant has consented in writing to the arbitration,\n\n- (2) the State against which the action is brought has also agreed thereto in writing,\n\n- (3) the claimant is a national of the other Contracting State,\n\n- (4) it asserts a legal dispute that falls within the scope of the arbitration clause of the treaty, and\n\n- (5) this dispute arises directly out of an investment.\n\nb) The following conditions do not appear disputed and cannot be disputed:\n\n- Claimant 1 consented in writing to the arbitration (condition 1). A long line of case law holds that such consent necessarily ensues from the request submitted by it to the Centre (in particular Chr. Schreuer et al. The ICSID Convention, a Commentary, 2nd edition, Cambridge 2009, article 25, nos 416 *et seq.* with references). Indeed, such measure cannot be understood otherwise.\n\n- The Respondent does not dispute that Claimant 1 is a national of the other Contracting State, that is, the Netherlands where it is registered (condition 3). However, Respondent disputes that the protection extends to it, but for other reasons.\n\n- Claimant 1 asserts a legal dispute (condition 4); it bases its action on the fact that the Respondent violated the rules of the *Accord*, in particular the prohibition on expropriation by terminating the Concession that had been granted to Sentel, which it indirectly owns. These facts are presumably not established at this stage, but they are at least alleged; the Arbitral Tribunal cannot rule on them as it has not carried out any investigation.\n\nc) The Respondent, however, asserts that the other conditions necessary for the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal have not been fulfilled, namely that:\n\n- it did not give its written consent to an action of the type which is brought against it (condition 2) (Resp. 29.10.09, nos. 17 *et seq.*), which issue shall be examined below under number 2; and\n\n- Claimant 1 has not proved that it made a protected investment (condition 5) (Resp. 29.10.09, nos. 137 *et seq.*), which issue shall be examined below under number 3.\n\n58.\n\nThe answer to the issues posed requires that the Arbitral Tribunal interpret the *Accord* and the ICSID Convention. It must do so by applying the \"Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969\" (hereinafter the \"Vienna Convention\"), to which the two States have acceded: the Netherlands on 9 May 1985, and Senegal on 11 May 1986.\n\nThe basic principle expressed in Article 31, paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention states that \" *[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose* \" *.* This principle, just as the other rules supplementing it, applies in a general manner to the interpretation of treaties, without it being necessary to make distinctions. Undoubtedly its first aim is the interpretation of treaties in order to resolve difficulties that could be generated by a provision, in relations between the States that are bound by it. Nothing, however, prevents it from also being raised by third parties, to which a treaty grants particular rights, as in the case at hand, the *Accord* and the ICSID Convention.\n\n59.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimant invokes the most favored nation clause as expressed in Article 3 of the *Accord* and solutions established by other bilateral treaties entered into with Senegal, notably those entered into with Korea and the United Kingdom (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 371; Claim. 12.02.2010, nos. 33 and 228; Transcript 01.04.10, French version, pp. 39-43, English version, pp. 96-107). The Respondent deems that this clause cannot be invoked in order to extend jurisdictional protection (Resp. 29.10.2009, nos. 94-109; Resp. 15.01.2010, nos. 332 *et seq.* ; Transcript 01.04.10, French version, p. 11, English version, p. 18). The Arbitral Tribunal shall examine this argument only if the others do not suffice as a basis for its jurisdiction.\n\n**2. The existence of Senegal's consent to the arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***2.1. In general***\n---------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal concurs with the Respondent (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 19) that no presumption exists according to which a State would have consented to an ICSID arbitration. It is up to the party who so alleges to prove it and to the Arbitral Tribunal to convince itself thereof, *ex officio* if needed.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, two arguments, both based on the *Accord*, militate against a finding that Senegal accepted to submit itself to ICSID jurisdiction in the present case:\n\n- firstly, because consent would not arise solely from conclusion of the *Accord* but would require a specific manifestation in relation to the instituted proceeding; a specific consent would be missing in the present case (number 2.2 below);\n\n- secondly, because the *Accord* would acknowledge the right of recourse to ICSID arbitration to natural persons only, to the exclusion of juridical persons, which MIO undeniably is (number 2.3. below).\n\n***2.2. The requirement of specific consent***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\n*a) According to the Respondent*, no special consent was given for this arbitration. It bases its argument on the text of Article 10 of the *Accord*, asserting that in ratifying the *Accord* Senegal did not agree to submit its itself, in a general and abstract matter, to all proceedings that potential investors might bring against it, but that it would be necessary that it specifically consents to each of them when such request is made to it (Resp. 29.10.2009, nos. 29 *et seq.*).\n\nIt argues indeed that the text provides that the State, here Senegal, \"[...] *devra* *consentir \u00e0 toute demande de la part de ce ressortissant en vue de soumettre* [un diff\u00e9rend] *, pour arbitrage ou conciliation* [\u2026]\". It deduces therefrom that a national who intends to act must first make a request to the State and that it would dispose of discretionary power to consent or not consent thereto (Resp. 1.01.2010, no. 316).\n\n*b) According to the Claimants*, the Article cannot be interpreted otherwise than as a generic consent given by Senegal to submission to the Centre of all requests that could be made against it (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 352; Claim. 12.02.2010, no. 198).\n\n62.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the interpretation of the provision according to the principles of the Vienna Convention requires all factors that express and explain the content thereof be taken into account. There is no hierarchy amongst such factors; they combine with each other and complete each other so as to give it the meaning that objectively best corresponds to the solution of the issue posed. In the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal relies on the following factors:\n\n63.\n\n*a) The wording of Article 10* is not unequivocal. Even if it is in principle possible to agree in a Treaty that an action is subjected to the prior consent of the contracting State, it seems appropriate to give the clause the meaning given by the Claimants. In the most restrictive version, the use of the verb \" *devra* \" (\"shall\") (\" *devra consentir* \" *) (* \"shall assent\") may be understood as meaning that it would certainly afford the Contracting State the power to specially decide, in view of \" *la demande* \" (\"the request\") that the party which intends to act would make to it. Even in such hypothesis, however, it is prescribed that the State not only \" *pourra* \" (\"may\") but \" *devra* \" (\"shall\") give its consent. Nothing in the wording leads to the conclusion that such decision could be left up to the discretion of the State.\n\nIt is more likely that in spite of the wording of the rule, Senegal's ratification of the *Accord* entails consent to the ICSID arbitration system. The Arbitral Tribunal does not see why it would be necessary, as the Respondent asserts (Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 312), to adopt a two-step procedure pursuant to which, before submitting a request, the party intending to act would have to request authorization from the Contracting State which it would have no right to refuse, unless otherwise specifically stated. It is more reasonable to view this as a unilateral offer and a commitment by Senegal to submit itself to ICSID jurisdiction; the request of Claimant 1 constitutes the \" *demand* e\" (\"request\") and amounts to acceptance of the offer made by the State; it does not create such consent, it consummates it.\n\n64.\n\n*b) The origin of the rule*, according to the Claimants, confirms this interpretation (Claim. 14.12.09, nos. 359 *et seq.*). Indeed, the former Article 5 *ter* of the *Accord de 1965 sur la coop\u00e9ration \u00e9conomique* (as amended in 1972) provided for a moral obligation only that the text of Article 10 of the *Accord* has elevated to a legal obligation. This rule undoubtedly primarily establishes an interState obligation (Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 318), but there is no reason why the establishment by the new rule of its mandatory nature could not be extended to investors, who are precisely those for whom the provision concerning the resolution of disputes is intended.\n\n65.\n\n*c) The spirit of the rule* confirms this interpretation. The purpose of a treaty such as that in question is indeed to guarantee efficient and full protection. This purpose is made clear, in particular, by Articles 3 and 4 of the *Accord*, whose objective is \" *s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9grale* \" (\"full security\") (Article 4, paragraph 1). Such objective, however, cannot be truly attained unless investors, the primary beneficiaries of the protection, dispose of legal means enabling them to obtain compliance therewith. To admit the contrary would amount to making the *Accord* a \" *lex imperfecta* \" whose application in the end would be left to the discretion of the State benefiting from the investment, since it could give or refuse its consent as it pleases. This could not have been the intention of the Contracting Parties.\n\nMoreover, there is nothing extraordinary about the rule to the extent that it implies nothing else for the State involved except to agree to submit itself to an arbitration proceeding under the aegis of ICSID by independent arbitrators, in a proceeding during which it shall have every opportunity to defend its positions.\n\n66.\n\nOn the grounds that have just been set out, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that in ratifying the *Accord*, the Republic of Senegal gave its general consent to any arbitration that could be subsequently instituted against it in an ICSID proceeding under the conditions prescribed by Article 10.\n\n***2.3. Limitation of protection to natural persons***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\n*a) According to the Respondent,* even if its consent is deemed to have been given, it would not apply to juridical persons (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 53). The Respondent bases its argument also on the text of Article 10 of the *Accord* in order to assert that its consent would be limited to natural persons. It argues indeed that the text of Article 10 grants protection to a \" *ressortissant de l'autre* *partie\" (\"national of the other party\").*Article 1, paragraph 3 of the *Accord* provides a clear definition thereof: \" *le terme \u2018ressortissants' comprend \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'une et l'autre des Parties contractantes les personnes physiques ayant la nationalit\u00e9 de cette Partie contractante conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation de celle-ci.* \" ( \" *The term 'nationals' shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party in accordance with its law.* \"). As Claimant 1 is a company, it cannot rely on the rule for the resolution of disputes.\n\n68.\n\n*b) According to the Claimants,* on the contrary, the omission of any mention of companies was an inadvertency that it would be up to the Arbitral Tribunal to correct. The protection aimed at by Article 10 should encompass companies, in accordance with the structure of the *Accord,* its purpose and its origin. Regardless, Article 8 of the *Accord* establishes the principle of the most favored nation, which, in light of the treaties subsequently signed by Senegal, would be an additional reason to broadly construe it (Claim. 14.12.09, nos. 191 *et seq.*).\n\n69.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the following factors must be taken into account:\n\n70.\n\n*a) The text of Article 10 of the Accord,* combined with the definition provided in Article 1 would appear at first view at least to be clear: since the first Article mentions \" *ressortissants* \" (\"nationals\") only and the second unambiguously defines such notion, the solution appears obvious.\n\nNevertheless, contrary to what the Respondent appears to assert (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 64; Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 288), this conclusion, provided that it applies, is not conclusive in determining the meaning of the rule. Indeed, in accordance with Article 31, paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention, the \" *terms of the treaty* \" must be interpreted *\"in good faith* \" in accordance with the meaning to be given them \" *in their context and in light of its object and purpose* \". It follows therefrom that the text, even if apparently \"clear\", is not the only factor to be used in interpreting a rule, which assertion is confirmed by the following paragraphs of the provision listing the factors that the interpreting party may and must take into account \" *in addition to the text* \". Moreover, if needed, Article 32 of the Vienna Convention allows recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, in particular when the interpretation made in accordance with Article 31 \" *(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable* \".\n\nThe significance of the other factors available to the Arbitral Tribunal must be considered in light of these principles.\n\n71.\n\n*b) The function of Article 10 in the system of the Accord* is fundamental. A provision cannot be understood unless integrated into the body of the text of which it forms a part and constitutes one of the parts. The Article establishes the only means contractually agreed to by the Contracting Parties to guarantee to investors the effectiveness of the rest of the *Accord.* All the material provisions -excepting one which shall be discussed below - affirm the granting of special protection both to \" *ressortissants\"* (\"nationals\") (within the meaning of Article 1) as well as \" *soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'autre Partie* \" (\"companies of the other Party\"); all of them therefore place natural persons and companies on the same footing. It cannot be seen for what reason the principles extended to all investors, regardless of their nature, would justify judicial protection for natural persons only.\n\nThis function appears more clearly upon reading of other parts of the *Accord* :\n\n- The Preamble of the *Accord* expressly affirms the intention of the Contracting Parties \" *de cr\u00e9er des conditions favorables \u00e0 l'investissement* *de capitaux par des ressortissants et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'un des deux Etats* *sur le territoire de l'autre Etat* \" (\" *creating conditions favourable to capital investments by nationals and companies of one of the two States in the territory of the other State* \"), without being able to detect the least intent to restrict such purpose to natural persons. Quite to the contrary, this Preamble, intended to summarize the object and purpose of the *Accord,* clearly militates in favor of the contrary intent by excluding any difference between the two types of investors.\n\n- Article 4, paragraph 1 of the *Accord* is a perfect illustration of this, according to which \" *les investissements de capitaux effectu\u00e9s par des ressortissants*  *et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s* *d'une Partie contractante jouiront, sur le territoire de l'autre Partie Contractante, d'une protection et d'une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9grale\" (\"capital investments made by nationals*  *and companies*  *of one Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party* \") (underscored by the Arbitral Tribunal). It can be deduced therefrom (1) that there cannot be \" *protection et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9grale* \" (\"full protection and security\") unless the functioning of the *Accord* is armed with the possibility for every investor to go before an arbitral tribunal if he alleges to be the victim of a violation, and (2) that this \" *protection et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9grale\"* (\"protection and security\") must be guaranteed both to natural persons and companies, without differentiation.\n\n- It would also not be possible to reconcile the restrictive version of the Article with the text of Article 4, paragraph 2 of the *Accord* intended to protect \" *les ressortissants et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'une Partie Contractante* \" (\"nationals and companies of one Contracting Party\") against the risks of expropriation (sentence 1) and which expressly reserves in such context the possibility for (all) the specified entities to have recourse, in particular, to the proceedings provided for by Article 10 (sentence 3).\n\n*-* It is true that the same distinction is made by the text of Article 9 of the *Accord,* the provision immediately preceding Article 10, relating to tax treatment; this rule also appears reserved to natural persons only since the only mention therein is of \" *ressortissants* \" (\"nationals\"). This is not the place to interpret such provision. At any rate, this exception is not sufficient to explain why Article 10 would deprive companies, which are expressly protected by the remainder of the *Accord*, of the only means available to them to obtain recognition of their rights.\n\n*c) The object and the purpose of the rule* fully support this interpretation. The assimilation made in principle in the *Accord* between natural persons and juridical persons is fully understandable since one cannot see why an investment should be less protected depending on whether it is made by a natural person or a company. Furthermore, it would be established in practice that it is infinitely more frequent that investments made in the fields specified in the *Accord* are made by companies and not directly by natural persons. Furthermore, in its definition of juridical persons the *Accord* targets through them the \" *ressortissants* \" (\"nationals\") who directly or indirectly control them (see Article 1, paragraph 4, letter b). It would therefore be possible for a natural person holding a few shares in an investment company to act, whereas a company having the same shares would be prohibited from so doing.\n\nThe general purpose is to encourage investments, regardless of who takes the risk. It shall furthermore be noted in passing that it would be surprising at the very least that a text that is precisely intended by its nature to prohibit any form of unfounded discrimination establishes one as fundamental as that one.\n\n72.\n\n*d) The understanding of the rule* by the Kingdom of the Netherlands also confirms this analysis. Indeed, in support of their thesis, the Claimants invoked the \" *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* \" having surrounded the adoption of the *Accord* by the Dutch Parliament (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 358, \"Explanatory Memorandum\", Claim. 22.12.08, exhibit C-30). It results therefrom that this was understood as acknowledging an equivalent protection for natural persons and companies. It is not necessary for the Arbitral Tribunal to determine whether, as alleged by the Respondent (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 80; Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 325), no conclusive significance should be given to such documents since, although certainly linked to the adoption of the *Accord,* this was by one of the parties only. Nothing prohibits the Arbitral Tribunal from relying on them in order to confirm how this text was actually understood by one of the Contracting Parties.\n\n73.\n\n*e) Finally, the relation of Article 10 with the ICSID system of arbitration* allows for completion of the understanding of the rule by the connection it creates with the ICSID Convention. The term \" *ressortissant* \" (\"national\"), as used in the first and third lines of the provision, must be put back in its immediate context by taking into consideration all of the terms of the Article, which comprise one and the same sentence. The term \" *ressortissant* \" (\" national\") is used three times: the first two times to designate the person who, having made or intended to make an investment, may take the initiative to bring arbitration proceedings; the third time in the last line in the title of the Washington Convention which is reproduced. It is certain that the third time the term must encompass natural persons and juridical persons since what is mentioned are \" *ressortissants* \" (\"nationals\") within the meaning of the Washington Convention. It is indeed the definition given by this Convention which is relevant, of which Article 25(2) provides a broad definition.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the use of the term \" *ressortissants* \" (\"nationals\") in Article 10 must be understood in accordance with the general meaning of the Convention, and not the special meaning of Article 1, which is adapted to the other provisions of the *Accord.*\n\n74.\n\nFor these reasons, and without need to discuss the other arguments put forth by the Claimants in support of their position, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the protection afforded by Article 10 of the *Accord* extends to companies and, consequently, MIO may rely on it.\n\n***2.4. Conclusion***\n---------------------\n\n75.\n\nIt follows from the preceding discussion that the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the Republic of Senegal gave its consent to the actions brought against it by a company before an ICSID Arbitral Tribunal. From this angle, and subject to the other conditions that shall still be examined, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction to rule on the submissions of the Claimants in the present proceeding.\n\nFor such reason, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it would be superfluous to furthermore examine, but for the other arguments discussed, whether the same conclusion should not be deduced from the - disputed - consequences drawn from the application of the most favored nation clause.\n\n**3. The existence of a protected investment**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***3.1. In general***\n---------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction only if the action is based on the violation of the *Accord* relating to protected investments within the meaning of such *Accord* and the ICSID Convention.\n\n*a) According to the Respondent* (Resp. 15.01.10, nos. 272 *et seq.* in respect of Sentel and nos. 359 *et seq.* in respect of MIO), this condition is not fulfilled for two reasons above all; indeed, the Respondent argues that:\n\n- there would be no investment within the meaning of the texts on which the action is based, and\n\n- even if this were to be the case, Claimant 1 could not be deemed as being the investor.\n\n*b) According to the Claimants* (Claim. 12.02.10, nos. 156 *et seq.* in respect of Sentel and nos. 178 *et seq.* in respect of MIO) *,* these two objections do not withstand scrutiny.\n\nIt is therefore up to the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on this by successively examining:\n\n- if an investment exists within the meaning of the invoked texts (number 3.2 below.), and, if so,\n\n- if MIO's investment is protected (number 3.3. below).\n\n***3.2. The existence of an investment***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nDetached from the other aspects relating to other conditions, the issue to be settled is whether the services that Claimant 1 claims to have carried out in relation with the Sentel company in Senegal constitute an investment within the meaning of the applicable texts. The Claimants affirm this (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 338 *et seq.* ; Claim. 12.02.2010, nos. 29 and 178 *et seq.*), whereas the Respondent denies it (Resp. 15.01.10, nos. 369 *et seq.*).\n\n78.\n\n*a) The facts* are not disputed concerning this point. Initially, it was indeed the MIC company that directly or by its Group's companies, set up the Sentel company. The launching and operation thereof was largely financed by it. It was able to establish and operate a mobile telephone network in Senegal through its subsidiary. This is not the place to discuss whether the conditions under which the operation and application of the Concession were carried out met relevant requirements; if the Arbitral Tribunal asserts jurisdiction, this may be the subject matter of the phase devoted to examining the issues on the merits. At this stage it suffices to note that the provision of services as such is not disputed.\n\nIt is true that MIC made this investment through one of its Group's companies and that the shares on which this investment is based were thereafter partially transferred. The Arbitral Tribunal shall come back to this further on (see no. 83 below). This does not change the fact that with respect to the issue now under discussion the MIC Group companies were the founders and are still the shareholders of the Sentel company.\n\nIt is admitted that in order for an investment to be protected, it must fulfill both the definition of the special Agreement entered into between the two Contracting States as well as that of the ICSID Convention. This was held, for example, in the award of 24 May 1999 in the case *Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak* *Republic* (ICSID Case no. ARB/97/4, *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ* 251 (1999), pp. 14 *et* *seq.*, no. 68, exhibit CL-17).\n\n79.\n\n*b) The Accord's* definition of an investment is extremely broad. According to Article 1, paragraph 1, \" *le terme \u2018investissements de capitaux' comprend toutes* *les cat\u00e9gories de biens, y inclus toutes les cat\u00e9gories de droit* \" (\" *the term 'capital investments' shall comprise every kind of asset, including all kinds of rights* \"). A foreign company setting up and financing a mobile telephone company that will operate a mobile telephone network obviously comes within the definition. It is evident that the services are also made for the purpose of drawing \" *produits* \" (\"proceeds\") therefrom that Article 1, paragraph 2 designates as \" *les montants* *r\u00e9alis\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ou d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur l'investissement de capitaux* \" (\"the amounts realized from profit or interest on capital investment\").\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, there can be no doubt about this conclusion and no additional arguments are called for.\n\n80.\n\n*c) The ICSID Convention* also contains no definition of an investment. In general, in practice a broad concept is applied, even in decisions where special criteria have been used, such as those set out in the decision of 23 July 2001, *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case no. ARB/00/4, *Journal du droit international* 196 (2002), p. 124, exhibit CL-27). This is also not the place for the Arbitral Tribunal to discuss the relevance of each of these conditions, since it appears obvious that, regardless of the list relied on, they are all fulfilled in the present case:\n\n- there were contributions made by a party in the territory of Senegal; in the present case the setting up and financing of a company operating a mobile telephone network;\n\n- these contributions were made for a certain duration since the Concession was granted to the local company for twenty years (Article 1, paragraph 5 of the Concession);\n\n- these contributions were such as to generate income for the Concessionaire, and therefore indirectly for its shareholder or shareholders;\n\n- these contributions contained a certain risk, going beyond a mere business risk;\n\n- these contributions allowed for encouraging the economic development of Senegal through the concessionary company.\n\n81.\n\nFor these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the setting up of Sentel, and its financing and operation by Claimant 1 fulfill the conditions of an investment both by virtue of the *Accord* as well as the ICSID Convention.\n\n***3.3. The existence of a protected investment***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nEven if the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that an investment exists, it must also be in a position to confirm, for MIO to rely on the *Accord,* that it was in fact MIO that made all or part of the investment.\n\n*- According to the Respondent,* the investment was made by MIC, which is a Luxembourg company and not by MIO (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 125); moreover, even if it were to appear in fact that it is MIO that indirectly controlled Sentel, at no time did it inform the Respondent of this, contrary to what the Concession prescribes, pursuant to which the Concessionaire has such an obligation.\n\n*- According to the Claimants,* the investment was indeed made by a MIC Group company in which there was Dutch capital from the beginning (Claim. 12.02.2010, no. 233) and the only change that formally took place in the shareholding was formally notified to the Republic (Claim. 12.02.10, no. 171).\n\n83.\n\n*a) The facts* surrounding the financing and the direct or indirect shareholding of Sentel are not easy to reconstitute based on the file. According to the Arbitral Tribunal, the transactions appear to have been made under the following conditions:\n\n*The shareholding of Sentel* went through the following phases:\n\n- On 30 July 1998 (Resp. 15.01.10, exhibit R-32; Claim. 22.12.08, exhibits C-26 and C-23; Claim. 12.02.10, exhibit C-50), *SENTEL GSM* was created in Dakar. Its share capital was 60,000,000 CFAF, divided into 6,000 shares of 10,000 CFAF each. At the time of its creation the shareholders were the following:\n\n- for 4,498 shares, Tucan Corporation NV, a company incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles, which on 11 December 1998 became *Millicom Senegal NV*, a company also incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles;\n\n- for 1,500 shares, Mr. Pape Abdoul Ba;\n\n- for one share each, Mr. Peter Gordon Macnee (whose share was transferred on 9 October 1998 to Mr. Christophe Vicic), and Mr. Mark Christopher Lewis (whose share was transferred on 2 February 1999 to Mr. David Kimche).\n\n- On 14 March 2006, Sentel informed the Minister for Postal Services, Telecommunications and New Information Technologies and Communication of a change in the shareholding: \" *This change,* *which does not create any change in the control of the Sentel company, took place following the sale of 25% of the shares held by Mr. Abdoul Ba to the principal shareholder of Sentel gsm, Millicom Senegal N.V., pursuant to an agreement dated 14 March 2006* \" (Claim. 12.02.2010, exhibit C-46).\n\n- In 2007, according to the report of Price Waterhouse Coopers concerning Sentel, 5,999 shares of Sentel were held by Millicom Senegal N.V. and one share by Mr. Pape Abdoul Ba (Claim. 12.02.10, exhibit C-47, p. 26). *The role of MIO* in this structure went through the following phases:\n\n- *Millicom Senegal N.V.* (formerly Tucan Corporation NV), the principal shareholder of Sentel, belonged to Holland Intertrust (Antilles) N.V. from 21 May 1992 to 22 June 1993, then to Millicom Holding B.V, and since 9 December 1999 to MIC Africa B.V., whose registered office is in Rotterdam. On 2 August 2002, Millicom Senegal N.V. was the owner of 5,984 shares of Sentel, presumably following a transfer of part of Mr. Pape Abdoul Ba's shares.\n\n- *MIC Africa B.V*. (formerly named Keurslagerij B.V.), the principal shareholder of Millicom Senegal N.V., has authorized capital of 100 shares of 1,000 NLG each, of which only 40 have been issued and paid up. Twenty-five shares were issued as of 1987 and successively belonged to Mr. H. Veenstra from 1978 to 29 January 1997, to the Towerbridge B.V. company up until 4 December 1998 and to the Cardinal Holding B.V. company up until 29 April 1999.\n\n- *Millicom Holding B.V.* (having its registered office at Westblaak 89, 3012 KG, Rotterdam) then became the owner of the 25 shares, as well as 15 others issued on 10 June 1999.\n\n- On 3 February 2000, the 40 shares were transferred to *Millicom International Operations S.A*. (registered office in Luxembourg) pursuant to a \"deed of distribution and transfer\".\n\n- On 13 December 2000, the *Millicom International Operations B.V.* company (having its registered office at Locatellikade 1, 1076 AZ, Amsterdam), became owner of the 40 shares pursuant to a \"deed of issue and contribution\".\n\n*b)* In summary, it appears that Sentel is wholly owned (less one share):\n\n- by *Millicom Senegal N.V.*, a company incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles,\n\n- which is wholly owned by *Millicom Africa B.V.*, whose registered office is in Rotterdam,\n\n- which is wholly owned by MIO, which also has its registered office in Rotterdam.\n\nThus, within the MIC Group, MIO is the general structure to which the business operating company in Africa (Millicom Africa B.V.) belongs, to which the business operating company in Senegal (Millicom Senegal N.V.) belongs, and which is the owner of Sentel.\n\n*c) MIO's indirect control of Sentel* is undeniable. MIO is a Dutch company within the meaning of Article 1(4)(a) of the *Accord*. As the Netherlands is a Contracting State to the Washington Convention, MIO is a national of another Contracting State as required by Article 25 of the Washington Convention.\n\nIt is true that such control is indirect only since it goes through the African operating company then through the Senegalese operating company. But these two companies are also connected to the Netherlands; the first has its registered office in Rotterdam and the second in the Netherlands Antilles, which are also covered by Article 12 of the *Accord* (\" *En ce qui concerne le Royaume des Pays-Bas, le pr\u00e9sent Accord s'appliquera au territoire du Royaume situ\u00e9 en Europe et aux Antilles n\u00e9erlandaises.* \" (\" *In the case of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, this Agreement shall apply to the territory of the Kingdom in Europe and to the Netherlands Antilles\").*\n\n*d) As from the incorporation of Sentel,* its shares have been in the hands of companies connected to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The fact was public knowledge since it appears from Sentel's formation and incorporation documents. The transfers that took place were between entities that were nationals of the Netherlands, which fact was also public knowledge.\n\nMIC was indeed never the direct shareholder of Sentel, but always through other companies as intermediaries.\n\nMIO is the owner of the aforementioned shares since December 2000, that is, a period prior to the institution of proceedings before the Dakar Regional Court and before this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the purpose of MIO's acquisition of control of Sentel was very probably to \" *cr\u00e9er artificiellement la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI* \", for which reason its standing to bring an arbitration proceeding should not be recognized (Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 384). Violation of the principle of good faith -as a general principle of law - should lead the Arbitral Tribunal to sanction the conduct of the Claimants, as an investment must be made in good faith in order to be protected (Resp. 15.01.2010, nos. 385 *et seq*.).\n\nIt is a fact that the protection afforded by an agreement of the type which is invoked and by the ICSID Convention must be refused if contrary to good faith. The Arbitral Tribunal does not, however, deem it necessary to discuss here in detail situations in which such condition is fulfilled. It suffices, indeed, to find that, as from the creation of Sentel, its shares were held by subsidiary companies of the MIC Group, which were Dutch nationals that the transfers made involved only companies domiciled in the Netherlands, that these facts pre-date this proceeding by several years. Even if it is possible, or even likely that the choice of the subsidiaries was also made considering the protection that their domicile could afford them, this fact alone could not constitute an abusive solution, as long as circumstances have not been established which would demonstrate that such choice was made unknown to the other party and under artificial conditions; all conditions are not met in the present case.\n\n85.\n\nFor these reasons, and without need to discuss the other arguments put forth by the Claimants in support of their thesis, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that in the present case Claimant 1 made an investment entitling it to the protection afforded by the *Accord.*\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n86.\n\nIt follows from the preceding discussion that:\n\n***The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the action that Claimant 1 is bringing against the Republic of Senegal.***\n\nC. THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL IN RESPECT OF SENTEL\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The issue**\n----------------\n\n87.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal would not have jurisdiction to rule on the requests for relief of Claimant 2, which the Claimants dispute.\n\nThe Respondent makes the following request for relief [Resp. 1]:\n\n\" [...] *la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal demande au Tribunal arbitral de : se d\u00e9clarer incomp\u00e9tent pour examiner la demande de Sentel* [...] *.* \"\n\nThe Claimants make the following opposing request for relief [Claim. 1], inviting the Arbitral Tribunal to make:\n\n\" *a declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and is competent to decide the claims before it brought by Sentel* \".\n\n88.\n\nAs concerns Sentel, the Claimants base their action on Article 11 of the Concession, whose wording is the following (the brackets have been added by the Arbitral Tribunal to facilitate the references thereafter):\n\n\" [sentence 1] *Les parties feront tout leur possible pour r\u00e9gler \u00e0 l'amiable tout diff\u00e9rend r\u00e9sultant de l'ex\u00e9cution de la pr\u00e9sente convention.* [sentence 2] *Elles devront, au pr\u00e9alable si les lois et r\u00e8glements en vigueur le* *permettent, recourir \u00e0 tout organisme de conciliation de r\u00e9glementation et d'arbitrage comp\u00e9tent en mati\u00e8re de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications.* [sentence 3] *Il* *en sera de m\u00eame en cas de conflit entre op\u00e9rateurs notamment lors des accords d'interconnections.* [sentence 4] *Si le litige persiste, les parties* *pourront en d\u00e9finitive recourir \u00e0 l'arbitrage d'organismes internationaux tels que la cour d'arbitrage de l'OHADA, le Centre international de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends sur les investissements (CIRDI) ou la Chambre de Commerce international de Paris (CCIP) etc.* \"\n\nMaking use of the option which, according to them, this provision affords them, the Claimants seized this Arbitral Tribunal pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the text of which was reproduced above (see number 57 above). This Article indeed also allows an ICSID arbitration proceeding to be instituted provided that certain conditions are fulfilled.\n\n89.\n\nThe Parties' opinions totally differ concerning the fulfillment of these conditions. In particular, the Respondent disputes the fact that the rule of Article 11 of the Concession contains consent from the Republic of Senegal to an arbitration proceeding which, what is more, is an ICSID arbitration. Independently of this, it argues that in any event the conditions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are not fulfilled since Sentel is not a foreign investor.\n\nIt is therefore up to the Arbitral Tribunal to verify:\n\n- whether the Respondent validly consented to an arbitration proceeding of this type (number 2 below.), and if so,\n\n- whether Sentel is a foreign investor (number 3 below).\n\n**2. The existence of valid consent to the arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n***2.1. In general***\n---------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe first issue is therefore whether the 1998 Concession constitutes valid consent to the arbitration, which consent is necessary for Sentel's bringing an ICSID proceeding against the Respondent.\n\n91.\n\nThe Republic disputes this forthwith on the ground that the Concession would have ended as of 29 September 2000 and that the Claimants would have done nothing to object to this (Resp. 05.10.09, no. 24).\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal the argument does not withstand scrutiny:\n\n- Firstly, since it is undisputed that an arbitration clause is autonomous and that the end of a contract in which it is incorporated does not eliminate its effects; on the contrary, the arbitration which is agreed to therein also covers the principle and effects of the end of the contract. To admit the contrary would amount to depriving it of an important part of its practical effect since it would suffice for a party to abandon a contract in order to escape from it. This reasoning must apply also to the Concession.\n\n- Moreover, it has not at all been established that the Concession actually and validly ended; on the contrary, the issue is the crux of this dispute on the merits, and is disputed between the Parties; the Arbitral Tribunal might have to examine if it were to uphold its jurisdiction.\n\n92.\n\nAccording to the Respondent (Resp. 29.10.09, nos. 34 *et seq.* ; Resp. 15.01.10, nos. 15 *et seq.*), Article 11 of the Concession would not contain a real consent and, if this were the case, such consent would not be valid since it would be contrary to the mandatory rules of Senegalese domestic law. The Claimants maintain opposing opinions in this regard (Claim. 11.11.08, no. 43; Claim. 14.12.09, nos. 235 *et seq.* ; Claim. 12.02.10, nos. 37 *et seq.*).\n\nIt is therefore up to the Arbitral Tribunal to successively to examine:\n\n- whether Article 11 of the Concession contains consent by the Republic of Senegal to an ICSID arbitration (number 2.2. below) and, if so,\n\n- whether this consent is valid (number 2.3. below).\n\n***2.2. The existence of consent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n93.\n\na) *According to the Respondent*, Article 11 of the Concession does not constitute consent to arbitration but a \" *simple clause indicative qui se contente[rait] de pr\u00e9voir la possibilit\u00e9 d'un recours \u00e0 l'arbitrage, parmi d'autres proc\u00e9d\u00e9s, sans poser aucune obligation \u00e0 la charge des parties au contrat* \" (Resp. 29.10.2009, nos. 158 *et seq.* and no. 178; Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 67). The Parties did not agree either on the principle of recourse to arbitration nor on the arbitral body to be involved (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 176).\n\n*b) According to Claimant 2* on the contrary, Article 11 of the Concession could only be understood as a valid arbitration clause; the fact that there is ambiguous wording and above all the fact that it affords an option in respect of the choice of the institution is not an obstacle to its validity.\n\n94.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal relies on the following factors in reaching its conclusion:\n\n95.\n\n*a)*  *The origin of the rule* *.* The evidentiary proceeding established that the Parties began by negotiating their contractual relation based on a draft Concession prepared by the Respondent (hereinafter the \"Draft\", exhibit C-41, see no. 7 above). Concerning the provision in question, it provided for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court: \" *Si le litige persiste, le Tribunal r\u00e9gional de Dakar statuant en mati\u00e8re administrative sera comp\u00e9tent.* \" (last sentence of Article 7 of the Draft).\n\nDuring such negotiations the Claimants would have opposed the adoption of such provision. The issue would have been the subject of long discussions, which would have continued for several hours (one half day and a morning) (Mr. Rosh Statement, para. 17). The assertion seems plausible; otherwise one could not understand how it was possible for the Parties to go from the clear text of the Draft to the complex text of the Concession, without making numerous detours.\n\nIn particular, it was alleged that the Claimants refused to sign the Concession without a clause affording the Parties recourse to international arbitration (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 283; Claim 14.12.2009, no. 285; Transcript, 01.04.10, p. 27 citing the testimony of Mr. Rosh). The assertion was confirmed by two witness statements produced by the Claimants:\n\n- Mr. Rosh stated that: \" *Je suis certain qu'au moment des n\u00e9gociations, tant le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal que MIC entendaient conclure un engagement d'avoir recours \u00e0 l'arbitrage international ayant force obligatoire.* \" (Mr. Rosh Statement, para. 19);\n\n- Mr. Pape Ba, in turn stated: \" *Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairs sur le fait que nous ne voulions pas que les diff\u00e9rends soient port\u00e9s devant les juridictions de Dakar, car cela serait revenu \u00e0 faire du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u00e0 la fois un juge et une partie.* \" (Mr. Pape Ba Statement, para. 18).\n\nThe Respondent waived cross-examination of these witnesses; their statements appear plausible when comparing the version of the Draft with that of the final text and they were not formally contested by the Respondent. It results therefrom that indeed the Parties to the Concession Agreement agreed to eliminate the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court, of which no further mention is made, and accepted a solution that, following unsuccessful negotiations, makes exclusive reference to arbitration. It is difficult to conclude therefrom that the consent finally given by the Claimants amounted to leaving the Respondent the right to unilaterally to decide to refuse any form of arbitration, as it sees fit, and consequently to maintain the jurisdiction of the Dakar Regional Court.\n\nIndeed, the solution reached makes no further mention of State courts, but exclusively establishes two contractual means, both of which call upon, according to different methods it is true, conciliation bodies or bodies whose decisions are independent of any State structure and, *a fortiori,* Senegalese judicial authorities.\n\nThat said, it is evident that the text resulting from the negotiations is complicated, it mixes up the two procedures and, above all, it refers to arbitration in a manner which generated the controversies between the Parties to this proceeding.\n\nIn support of its thesis, the Respondent invokes the argument, which shall be examined later on (see no. 102 below) according to which its domestic rules prohibit it from being bound by an arbitration clause and that the purpose was to reserve what remained possible, namely recourse to a subsequent arbitration agreement (\" *compromis arbitral* \") to settle existing disputes (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 179). According to the Arbitral Tribunal, the argument is not decisive. The testimonies produced by the Claimants do not mention that that was the position taken by the Respondent during negotiations and that the text arrived at was the explanation thereof. On the contrary, they insist on the understanding of the rule that the individuals who directly and personally took part in the negotiation of the clause had of the rule (Mr. Pape Ba Statement, p. 4, Mr. Youval Rosh Statement, pp. 5-6; Mr. Kemal Shefik Statement, pp. 2-3). If the idea had been to exclude arbitration, whereas the entire spirit of the rule militates in favor of contractual solutions, in order to replace it by the mere reservation of a possible subsequent agreement, the text could and should have expressed this more clearly.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the origin of the rule, although not decisive, enables it to be established that the Claimants rejected a purely judicial solution and that they finally accepted a more complex, contractual solution.\n\n96.\n\n*b)*  *The system of the rule* *.* The dispute resolution system established by Article 11 of the Concession uses wording that is more and more widely used, which connects two complementary procedures over time (\"multi-tiers procedure\"):\n\n- *Firstly, negotiations*. It appears from the first sentence of the provision that, \" [l] *es parties feront tout leur possible pour r\u00e9gler \u00e0 l'amiable tout diff\u00e9rend r\u00e9sultant de l'ex\u00e9cution de la pr\u00e9sente convention* \" *.* The statement is a classic one and does not call for any special comment at this stage.\n\nIn reality, the rule is more precise and complete to the extent that, in the following sentence [sentence 2], it obligates \" *au pr\u00e9alable* \" the Parties to turn, if permitted by law, to specialized bodies which would be competent to settle the dispute by conciliation and arbitration. \" *Elles devront, au pr\u00e9alable si les lois et r\u00e8glements en vigueur le permettent, recourir \u00e0 tout organisme de conciliation de r\u00e9glementation et d'arbitrage comp\u00e9tent en mati\u00e8re de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications.* \". The significance of this last rule escapes the Arbitral Tribunal since it does not see what kind of body this would be; it would apparently follow from the rules governing telecommunications since it is furthermore specified in the following sentence [sentence 3], that the method would also apply to disputes between operators, which issue at first view is unrelated to the purpose of the Concession: \" *Il en sera de m\u00eame en cas de conflit entre op\u00e9rateurs notamment lors des accords d'interconnections.* \"\n\nWithout wishing to go further in the analysis of this rule which is not in question, two things can be deduced therefrom: on the one hand, it establishes contractual methods for the settlement of disputes outside of State procedures and, on the other hand, it affirms, at least at first view, that disputes arising between the Parties may be settled by arbitration without the State being able to rely on the prohibitions that it raises vis a vis the Claimants.\n\n- *Arbitration thereafter*. In its last sentence [4], Article 11 treats arbitration as a natural supplement in case of a breakdown in negotiations; it is necessary but it suffices that \" *le litige persiste* \". The procedure apparently comes within the scope of the prolongation and spirit of the negotiation procedure, without any reference to a judicial procedure which the Respondent today alleges would be the only procedure available absent an additional agreement between the Parties.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the system apparently selected by the Parties establishes a two-tier procedure, both of which are contractual, without any reference to a judicial solution.\n\n97.\n\n*c)*  *The wording of the rule.* As stated, the decisive part of the rule is the last sentence which reads as follows: \" *Si le litige persiste, les parties pourront en d\u00e9finitive recourir \u00e0 l'arbitrage d'organismes internationaux tels que la cour d'arbitrage de l'OHADA, le Centre international de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends sur les investissements (CIRDI) ou la Chambre de Commerce international de Paris (CCIP) etc...\"*. Several of the terms or expressions used call for comments:\n\n- \" *pourront recourir* [\u2026] *\u00e0 l'arbitrage* \". The possibility indicated in the rule is understood by the Claimants as an option afforded to each of the Parties to initiate an arbitration proceeding, even without the agreement of the other (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 239 *et seq.* ; Claim. 12.02.2010, no. 22 and no. 43), whereas the Respondent understands it as a possible option, not afforded to one party individually but to both Parties mutually, to enter into an agreement for the purpose of resolution of the dispute (Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 68).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal must concur with the Claimants that in the second version the rule is devoid of any practical significance. Without wanting to make any judgment, the Arbitral Tribunal does not see why and how the Republic of Senegal would agree to prefer arbitration over its own courts in a situation that became contentious. The practical, financial and psychological advantages clearly argue in favour of a judicial procedure. It is actually the choice made in its dispute with Sentel and MIC.\n\nMoreover, the chosen wording does not establish such intent. The text does not provide that the Parties could \" *convenir* \" to have recourse to arbitration, but that they could \" *recourir* \" thereto, which implies that an additional agreement is not necessary. The solution provided is not presented as one of the options of an alternative of which the other would remain a judicial procedure which, in spite of the fact that according to the Respondent constitutes the normal procedure, is not even mentioned although it was still in the Draft. The Claimants also raise the fact that other provisions of the Concession provide the Parties with the possibility to provide for a further agreement, albeit in other contexts, whereas this is not the case in an area as essential as the resolution of disputes.\n\n- \" *les parties* \" *.* The Respondent makes an argument based on the fact that the text does not entitle each party (singular) of such right, but both parties (plural), which would establish that a concerted action by the two Parties is necessary. The argument is not decisive since the plural may also be understood as a right given not only to the two Parties, but unilaterally to each of them.\n\n- \" *en d\u00e9finitive* \" *.* The expression, which means \"when all is said and done\" (\" *en fin de compte* \"), does not only signify the fact that this is a subsequent phase (already expressed by \" *si le litige persiste* \"), but the last phase, which would end a dispute. It is difficult to reconcile this wording with the idea that recourse to arbitration would be merely a possibility dependent on the agreement of the other Party.\n\n- *the listing of the arbitration bodies.* The text clearly indicates that what is involved is not an *ad hoc* arbitration but institutional arbitration. On the other hand, it does not designate a particular body but lists several. According to the Respondent, the clause is a pathological clause to the extent that it lists several different institutions.\n\nNothing, however, prevents an arbitration clause from affording several options, from amongst which the party initiating the proceeding has the right to choose. The solution is current practice in investment treaties and its validity is not disputed since it is not contrary to the spirit of arbitration, especially since the mentioned bodies are all highly reputed. In the present case, Claimant 1 made use of this right by deciding to go to ICSID arbitration, which solution is expressly mentioned by the clause. Accordingly, it is not necessary to decide whether the choice by a party of an arbitration body which is not mentioned by the clause would be covered by it.\n\n- *The open nature of the clause* expressed at the end of the sentence by *\"etc... \"* is invoked by the Respondent to establish that in any event the rule is incomplete and that it necessarily calls for a choice which the Parties could only make by means of an additional agreement. It cannot be denied that the wording is special even if it does not necessarily militate in favor of the suggested solution since this choice would in any event be limited to [international arbitration] *organisms* of an equivalent type and quality as those bodies which are mentioned.\n\nIn the view of the Arbitral Tribunal, the wording of the rule is awkward and leaves lingering doubts, but it does not unequivocally conflict with the results of the interpretation that the other factors dictate.\n\n98.\n\n*d)*  *The basis of the rule* *.* The Arbitral Tribunal cannot fail to take into account the international trend in respect of dispute resolution in agreements of the type involved, in particular given the general evolution that has occurred and is continuing. Three aspects may be pointed out in this respect:\n\n*- The classic nature of the clause.* Even if arbitration had been considered to be an exceptional system for a long time, the recent evolution establishes that on the contrary this system has become the usual method of dispute resolution in international commerce. For such reason the requirements laid down in the wording of the clause which provides for the application thereof are not as strict as they might have been before. What matters, in fact, is ensuring that the parties have sufficiently clearly manifested their intention to submit themselves to arbitration and not to State courts. The fact that a clause is not absolutely clear, the fact that it contains omissions or uncertainties, does not suffice to make it inoperative.\n\n- *The presumption in favor of arbitration.* Even if the expression may appear excessive, we can indeed speak, in case of serious doubts, of a presumption in favor of arbitration. This must, however, be assessed according to the specificities of the case. The principle will be more easily admitted if the parties involved are experienced in international business practices or if the nature of the agreement objectively calls for a solution of this type, provided always that the terms and conditions provided guarantee adequate protection of the parties.\n\nIn the present case, it is evident that what is involved is an agreement binding the Parties, who cannot be unaware of the importance, nature and risks of arbitration; the agreement in which the clause is inserted is of considerable importance, justifying recourse to a perfectly neutral mechanism for resolution of disputes. Even though it might appear differently, the business relation is international in nature for which recourse to arbitration appears adequate. As has been seen, due to its origin, system and wording, the clause can be understood as expressing the intent of the Parties to submit to arbitration.\n\n- *The pathological nature of the clause.* In extension of the first principle arbitral tribunals and State courts, very much encouraged by learned writers, developed simple therapies to correct the imperfections of clauses referred to as pathological (\" *in favorem arbitrii* \"). It is necessary but it suffices *per se* that the principle of arbitration be recognized and that the additions and corrections may be made without distorting the original intent of the parties.\n\nIn the present case the Respondent raises two essential ambiguities:\n\n- The first is in respect of the \" *caract\u00e8re \u00e9ventuel* \" (\"possible nature\") of the clause and the use of the verb \" *pouvoir* \" (\"can\") ; the Arbitral Tribunal has indicated the reasons for which the clause could and should be interpreted differently. The defect does not affect the recognition of the principle of the arbitration.\n\n- The second is in respect of the \" *caract\u00e8re optionnel* \" (\"optional nature\") of the clause, which allows the party at whose initiative the action is taken to choose the institution under whose aegis the arbitration shall be carried out. It has been held for some time now that the existence of a choice is not contrary to the system, to the extent that at least each of the contemplated solutions affords a guarantee that is adequate. In the present case, the three specified institutions entirely fulfill these conditions and the choice of ICSID cannot reasonably call for any comment. The list is not exhaustive; even in such form, the choice of another institution could be envisaged if it afforded guarantees that were comparable to the other mentioned institutions. The issue, however, is not posed in the present case.\n\n- *The effectiveness of the clause.* Contrary to the Respondent (Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 114), the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that preference must be given to the version which gives the rule real significance. In case of a dispute, it is always possible for parties to agree to submit it to arbitration, but it is obvious and the mention thereof superfluous if it is not accompanied at least by a moral, conditional or even legal commitment. If the meaning was indeed the Respondent's one, it is hard to see why, following several hours of negotiations, the Claimants would have accepted a solution that grants them a prior guarantee of negotiation only, which obviously entails no mandatory effect for those parties who submit themselves to it.\n\n99.\n\nThe solution reached by the Arbitral Tribunal corresponds largely to *international case law* and other decisions taken by other courts and tribunals in cases that are very comparable. Contrary to the assertion of the Respondent (Resp. 15.01.2010, nos. 71 and 115; Resp. 05.10.2010, nos. 73-141), it cannot be seen why these decisions could not be invoked in the present case, since they all concern arbitration clauses included in agreements. In particular, the Arbitral Tribunal sees no reason why the fact that the present proceeding was instituted in the context of ICSID would justify any different conclusions. These decisions were amply commented on and approved by *doctrine.* In order to spare itself from a detailed review, the Arbitral Tribunal refers to one of the main authorities, Gary Born, in his most recent and undoubtedly complete publication (G. BORN, *International Commercial Arbitration*, Vol. I, London 2009, pp. 570 *et seq.*). More particularly, it is confirmed therein that in international matters there is a presumption of validity of clauses which is justified by contemporary tendencies in respect of methods of dispute resolution, which are very favorable to arbitration.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the preceding arguments justify confirmation of the intent of the Parties to submit to ICSID arbitration if one of them takes the initiative for the action according to such procedure.\n\n100.\n\nFor these reasons, and without it being necessary to discuss the other arguments put forward by the Claimants in support of their thesis, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that in spite of the doubts justified by its wording, Article 11 can and must be understood as consent by the Republic of Senegal to ICSID arbitration proceeding.\n\n***2.3. The validity of the consent***\n--------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThere is also the issue of whether Article 11 of the Concession, as construed by the Arbitral Tribunal, validly binds the Republic of Senegal.\n\nIn this respect, the Parties also maintain diametrically opposed positions.\n\n*a) According to the Respondent* (Resp. 29.10.09, nos. 164 *et seq.* ; Resp. 15.01.2010, nos. 148 *et seq.*) *,* it would have been prohibited by Senegalese law from binding itself to an arbitration clause, and the international principles established in the area of international arbitration do not change this fact.\n\n*b) According to the Claimants* (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 89 *et seq.* ; Claim. 12.02.2010, nos. 105 *et seq.*), it would be inaccurate to assert that Senegalese domestic law is an obstacle to the validity of consent given by the Republic and that in any event the principles applied in international matters allow it to be ignored.\n\n102.\n\nIt is undisputed that, as expressly provided in Article 12, the Concession is governed first of all by Senegalese law. According to the Respondent, the law of Senegal in force at the time of the Concession excluded the possibility for the Republic of Senegal to validly enter into an arbitration clause concerning the subject matter of the Concession since it concerns prerogatives of public power, partially in any case (see in particular Article 11 of the Senegalese *Code sur les obligations administratives*, *law n\u00b0 65-51 of 19 July 1965* ; Article 10 of the Senegalese *Code des obligations administratives* ; Article 819-29 of the *Code de proc\u00e9dure civile*, in the version given it by *Decree n\u00b0 98-492 of 5 June 1998* ; Article 826-3 of the *Code des obligations civiles et commerciales*, *law n\u00b0 98-30 of14 April 1998).*\n\nThis conclusion is disputed by the Claimants. They furthermore note that Senegalese law has evolved over the last few years and that it is more and more amenable to the possibilities afforded the Republic to be bound by arbitration clauses (see Article 12 of the *Code des investissements* ; Article 136 of the *Code des march\u00e9s publics*).\n\n103.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, these rules are not decisive due to the principles developed in the area of international arbitration in this regard.\n\na) The Arbitral Tribunal starts from the assumption that this proceeding involves *an international arbitration.* The Respondent admittedly objects that Sentel is a company registered in Senegal (see no. 2 above). The Arbitral Tribunal will explain below (see no. 109 below) that this connection is formal in nature, required for the operation of the Concession, but that in reality the stakes are foreign due to the control that the MIC Group companies exercise over Sentel. Independently of this argument, it must be pointed out that even for the Respondent, the Concession is international in nature; it itself brought its action before the Dakar Regional Court not only against Sentel but also against MIC, which it deems bound by the Concession. Moreover, the very wording of Article 11 of the Concession expressly refers to \" *l'arbitrage d'organismes internationaux* \", mentioning institutions therein which are all international and of which certain, in particular ICSID, presupposes a foreign element.\n\nb) *The principle* today is firmly established in international arbitration that a State is prohibited from invoking its own domestic law in order to avoid arbitration and its capacity to enter into arbitration clauses. Such an attitude would violate the principles of good faith and of \" *international public policy* \". This rule has been admitted in various cases by international courts and tribunals as well as by numerous learned writers of doctrine (reference in relation with Claim. 14.12.2008, nos. 109 *et seq.*). Thus a famous award of 1971 held: \" *L'ordre public* *international s'opposerait avec force \u00e0 ce qu'un organe \u00e9tatique, traitant avec des personnes \u00e9trang\u00e8res au pays puisse passer ouvertement, le sachant et le voulant, une clause d'arbitrage qui met en confiance le co-contractant et puisse ensuite,* *que ce soit dans la proc\u00e9dure arbitrale ou dans la proc\u00e9dure d'ex\u00e9cution, se pr\u00e9valoir de la nullit\u00e9 de sa propre parole.* \" (ICC Case no. 1939 [1973] *Rev. Arb*. 145; exhibit CL-59). It has thereafter been regularly upheld (for example, *Cour* *d'Appel de Paris, 1\u00e8re chambre, section C, 17 December 1991* ; *Gatoil International Incorporate v. la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 National Iranian Oil Company*, no. 901957; exhibit CL-54; *Cour d'Appel de Paris, 1\u00e8re chambre, section C, 24 February 1994*, *Minist\u00e8re tunisien de l'Equipement v. soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bec Fr\u00e8res* [1995] *Rev. Arb.* 275; exhibit CL-56).\n\nThis solution has itself been confirmed by doctrine (for example J. PAULSSON, May a State Invoke its Internal Law to Repudiate Consent to International Commercial Arbitration? Reflections on the *Benteler v. Belgium Preliminary Award* [1986] 2 *Arb. Intl*. 90, exhibit CL-58). In other words, the domestic law of the State that invokes it in order to dispute the validity of an arbitration clause is \"irrelevant\" (GAILLARD/SAVAGE (eds.), *Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration*, The Hague 1999, p. 61, exhibit CL-55).\n\n104.\n\nIn the present case it has already been found above that the Parties spent a long time negotiating Article 11 of the Concession (see no. 7 above). It has also been confirmed that the intent of the Claimants at the time of such negotiations was to insert an arbitration clause (see no. 95 above). The Claimants also alleged that during such negotiations the Respondent never invoked a prohibition against arbitration clauses. The Respondent waived \"cross examining\" the Claimants' representatives who were present at the time of such negotiations, and it has not adduced any evidence that would establish the contrary.\n\n105.\n\nFor these reasons, and without it being necessary to discuss the other arguments put forward by the Claimants in support of their thesis, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that even if domestic law prohibited the Republic of Senegal from being bound by an arbitration clause, this argument cannot be raised against Claimant 2 in the present case.\n\n***2.4. Conclusion***\n---------------------\n\nIt follows from the preceding discussion that:\n\n***The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the action that Claimant 2 is bringing against the Republic of Senegal.***\n\n**3. Sentel as investor**\n-------------------------\n\n***3.1. The issue***\n--------------------\n\n106.\n\nIn order for ICSID and the Arbitral Tribunal constituted to settle a dispute under its aegis to have jurisdiction, the conditions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must also be fulfilled.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal shall not discuss again whether Sentel made an investment within the meaning found within such context; it suffices, in this respect, to refer to the discussion devoted thereto concerning the same subject relating to the indirect control that MIO exercises over Sentel (see no. 79 above).\n\nOn the other hand, a special verification must be made as to whether the Convention may be invoked in a proceeding brought by Sentel. In order to do so, the conditions of Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention must also be fulfilled and a *\"national of another Contracting State\"* must exist.\n\n107.\n\nAs juridical persons are involved, the letter b of the same Article provides the following definition:\n\n\" *any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.* \"\n\nOnly the second hypothesis must be analysed here since Sentel is indisputably registered in Senegal. We must therefore ascertain:\n\n- that it is controlled by foreign interests (see number 3.2. below), and\n\n- that the State party to the dispute consented to it acting on such basis (see number 3.3.below).\n\n***3.2. The control of Sentel***\n--------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Parties maintain fundamentally different opinions concerning this issue.\n\n*a) According to the Respondent* (Resp. 29.10.2009, no. 186, nos. 121 and 188; Resp. 15.01.2010, no. 209 and nos. 250 *et seq.*), Sentel would be a Senegalese company registered as such in the territory of Senegal and would not fulfill the conditions laid down by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Parties would have expressly desired and agreed to this by setting up the company. In addition, it would not been established that Sentel was under foreign control.\n\n*b) According to the Claimants,* on the contrary, Sentel would be registered in Senegal solely for purposes of performance of the Concession. It would always been and is still controlled by foreign companies, of which the Respondent would always been informed. Furthermore, Respondent would have admitted submission to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, in particular by agreeing to Article 11 of the Concession. Lastly, at no time would Sentel have acted in bad faith in respect of the constitution of its capital and the information it furnished the Respondent.\n\n109.\n\nThe idea that is at the basis of Article 25(2)(b) (second hypothesis) is obvious. For purposes connected to an investment in a foreign State, it may be expedient, necessary or even required that a company be incorporated in the territory of the other Contracting State. If a strict and formal interpretation of nationality were adhered to, it would not be possible in such cases to have recourse to the dispute resolution mechanisms afforded by the ICSID Convention since all the parties would be nationals of the same State.\n\nHowever, the need to be protected may be at least as necessary if the company is in fact controlled by foreign interests. This is why in such case it may be necessary to extend protection. Without this addition, the Convention would have failed in its primary purpose since it would deprive investors that are forced *de facto* or *de jure* to have recourse to a local company from being protected (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 143 *et seq.*).\n\nIt is from this point of view that the first condition for application of the rule must be understood: that the company be controlled by foreign interests. The notion must be interpreted broadly. It is necessary, but it suffices that the major part of the means made available to the local company come from foreign funds. This indirect control by means of financing most often entails indirect powers of management assumed by those who have made the investment.\n\nIt would therefore have to be verified whether this condition was fulfilled in respect of Sentel. The Arbitral Tribunal may, however, limit itself to referring back to the facts and arguments that it set forth above relating to MIO's status (see no. 83 *et seq.* above). It is evident that as from the beginning, Sentel was for the most part held by foreign interests pertaining to nationals of ICSID Contracting States.\n\nThe entire issue thus becomes that of whether the Republic gave its consent.\n\n***3.3. The Respondent's consent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nIn order that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be invoked, it is lastly necessary that the State being sued gave its consent in order that a company, though a national of the same State but controlled by foreign interests, can sue it on this basis.\n\nThis implies first of all that the Respondent had knowledge thereof, and then agreed to submission to international arbitration.\n\n111.\n\nIn the view of the Arbitral Tribunal, the facts that have been established make it clear that the State could not have been unaware that Sentel was under foreign control:\n\na) *Since the tender* and the initial negotiations, the Republic of Senegal could not have been unaware that the Sentel company, which was in the process of being incorporated, was under foreign control since it was part of the Millicom Group and was under the control of MIC (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 165 *et seq.* ; Claim. 12.02.2010, nos. 115, 127 *et seq.*). Messrs. Ba and Rosh maintain this position (cited Statements in Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 166 *et seq*.). According to the tender, \" *la r\u00e9ussite de Sentel gsm [serait] une \u00e9tape importante de la strat\u00e9gie d'expansion sur le continent africain, adopt\u00e9e par MIC* \" (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 177); the tender is an integral part of the Concession (Annex 3) (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 180).\n\nb) After having been selected as the successful bidder, MIC was required to set up *a Senegalese company* in order to obtain the Concession, which was provided for by the 1996 *Code des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications*, appended to the Concession (Annex 4) (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 157). Indeed, Senegal and MIC could not have legally entered into a concession agreement without MIC setting up a local company, since this is expressly required by Article 6 of the *Code des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications* (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 158; Claim. 12.02.2010, no. 121). It was clearly stated in the bid documents that this company would be set up and controlled by foreign interests connected to the MIC Group.\n\nc) *The terms of the Concession* themselves indicate the foreign control since mention is made of \" *la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sentel gsm SA, filiale du group Millicom International Cellular (MIC)*.\"\n\nd) *In the tender process,* Senegal stated that it was looking for a foreign investor, which could alone satisfy the requirements of the bid; as evidenced by the fact that an \" *exp\u00e9rience dans le d\u00e9veloppement des r\u00e9seaux des Pays Tiers* \" was expressly mentioned among the major criteria used in evaluating the bids (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 169 *et seq.*). The Sentel company was to become a member of the Millicom Group (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 156).\n\ne) The fact that the shareholding within the Group could have changed over the years is irrelevant in this respect and changes nothing to the basic finding, since it was well known from the beginning that Sentel was predominantly held by companies domiciled in the Netherlands or regions connected thereto (see no. 83 *et seq.* below). ICSID case law does not require that the nationality of such interests be mentioned in the agreement concerning nationality (Claim. 14.12.2009, nos. 140 *et seq.*).\n\nf) Senegal confirmed by its *correspondence* its knowledge of the foreign control of Sentel. The Senegalese government continued to deal with MIC even following Sentel's incorporation, which would confirm that it had knowledge of MIC's control of Sentel (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 183).\n\n112.\n\nIn order for the provision to be applied it implies not only the existence of control, but also that the parties agreed to it, which implies the consent of each of them. Sentel's consent is not in question; it must now be verified whether the Republic also gave its consent. It disputes it, the Claimants affirm it.\n\n113.\n\nIt is undisputed that consent need not be in any special form. Consequently, consent may not only be explicit but also implicit. Consent in respect of nationality could be contained in the agreement concerning the investment or in a \" *compromis* \"or joint request under Article 1(2) of the Institution Rules. Such consent appears to exist when a State enters into an agreement with a local company containing an ICSID clause.\n\n114.\n\nFor this purpose, it appears in light of the circumstances that by its behavior the party involved manifested its consent or, failing this that its behavior justified that the other party had been convinced that it consented.\n\n- An initial argument resides in the fact that the Concession makes express reference in Article 11 to the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal, the mention of which makes no sense unless it is admitted that the Republic gave its consent to an action in accordance with the ICSID procedure (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 190; Claim. 12.02.2010, nos. 16 and 115). As in the decision in the *LETCO v. Liberia* case (Claim. 14.12.2009, no. 189), no argument can be made - and the Respondent did not raise any - based on the fact that MIC could also be a party to the Concession and that in respect of it the condition of nationality would be fulfilled in any event.\n\n- The Respondent alleges that it was by design, and precisely to avoid such risk, that the Republic of Senegal required that the Concession be concluded with a company specially set up in Senegal for such purpose and incorporated in Senegal (Resp. 29.10.2009, nos. 188 *et seq.* ; Resp. 15.01.2010, nos. 208 and 372). The argument is not convincing since the requirement of incorporation in Senegal was imposed by the Republic for reasons which are undoubtedly understandable, but nothing allows it to be concluded therefrom that this in fact amounted to intent to exclude recourse to an ICSID arbitral tribunal. On the contrary, it is due to the requirements of this sort, which are relatively common in practice, that with respect to nationality, the notion of protected investor had been extended by Article 25(2)(b) *in fine.* The fact that the incorporation also provided certain benefits for the Claimants is not an obstacle thereto.\n\n***3.4 Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n115.\n\nIn light of the preceding discussion:\n\n***The Arbitral Tribunal finds that it also has jurisdiction to entertain the action brought by Sentel against the Republic.***\n\nD. COSTS AND EXPENSES\n---------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn their pleadings, each of the Parties makes requests with respect to the costs and expenses of the arbitration.\n\nThe Respondent [Resp. 2] requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:\n\n\" *condamner ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s* [les Demanderesses] *\u00e0 payer \u00e0 la* *R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal les frais de l'arbitrage ainsi que les frais engag\u00e9s pour assurer sa d\u00e9fense.* \"\n\nThe Claimants [Claim. 3] are expecting from the Arbitral Tribunal,\n\n\" *without prejudice to any final determination of the merits of the parties' dispute, an order that Senegal pays all costs incurred in relation to the objections to jurisdiction it raised, including the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimants including but not limited to the fees of their legal counsel,* *experts and consultants as well as the Claimants' own employees, on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable commercial rate* \".\n\n117.\n\nIn light of such requests for relief the Arbitral Tribunal invited the Parties, following this phase of the proceeding, to submit their submissions concerning the costs of the arbitration. They have produced them.\n\n118.\n\nIn light of the decisions made in this decision by the Arbitral Tribunal, the proceeding shall continue on the merits at the initiative of the Claimants. It is therefore not necessary at this stage to decide on the allocation and apportioning of the costs and expenses.\n\nThe Claimants deem nevertheless that even in the hypothesis where the Arbitral Tribunal would find that it has jurisdiction, which hypothesis has been found here to be true, it must make a determination in respect of the costs and expenses generated by this jurisdictional phase.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that this is not appropriate. Firstly since it is difficult at this stage clearly to make the difference between the preparatory work and phases that are exclusively limited to jurisdiction. Thereafter and above all it is more natural that the Arbitral Tribunal makes decisions of this type at the end, taking all of the proceeding into account.\n\n119.\n\nIt ensues from this argument that:\n\n***The decisions concerning the determination and allocation of the costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be made by the end of the proceeding.***\n\nE. THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n-------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nIn their submissions the Claimants made two other requests for relief:\n\n\"[Claim. 4] *any other relief the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances; and*\n\n[Claim. 5] *order in respect of the procedure for the next phase of this case.* \"\n\n121.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not consider it necessary to order other measures with respect to the present decision.\n\nIt is true that the proceeding shall continue with respect to the merits and that the Arbitral Tribunal may jointly entertain both actions brought against the Respondent, one based on the Treaty and the other on the Concession, but based on the same facts. All Parties shall thus have the opportunity to make their cases in a complete manner and the Arbitral Tribunal shall decide after having carried out all necessary analysis.\n\nThe procedural rules in respect of this second phase and, in particular, the timetable, shall be determined in an additional procedural order that the Arbitral Tribunal shall render after consulting the Parties. Such order concerns the proceeding and is outside the scope of this decision.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, however, is not competent to influence the outcome of the proceeding brought before the Dakar Regional Court.\n\n122.\n\nConsequently:\n\n***The continuation of the proceeding shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal in an order after consultation with the Parties.***\n\n**On these grounds, the Tribunal decides as follows:**\n\n**1. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the action that Claimant 1 is bringing against the Republic of Senegal.**\n\n**2. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the action that Claimant 2 is bringing against the Republic of Senegal.**\n\n**3. The decisions concerning the determination and allocation of the costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be made by the end of the proceeding.**\n\n**4. The continuation of the proceeding shall be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal in an order, after consultations with the Parties.**"}]}
