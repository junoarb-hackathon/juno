Mr. Ioan Micula was born in Romania on 8 April 1957. He moved to Sweden in 1987 where he obtained Swedish nationality in 1992 after having renounced his Romanian nationality. According to Claimants, Mr. Ioan Micula is to be considered a Swedish national for the purpose of this arbitration.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Viorel Micula, Colinelor Street no. 48, Oradea, Bihor County, Romania (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 2\").

According to the Claimants, Mr. Viorel Micula is to be considered a Swedish national for the purpose of this arbitration.\n\n\u2022 Claimants 1 and 2 hold shares in the Corporate Claimants.\n\n2.\n\nThere are also three Corporate Claimants:\n\n\u2022 European Food S.A. with its registered office at 13 Septembrie Street, Stei, Bihor County, Romania, registered with the trade register under no. J5/892/1999, registration number 12457015 (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 3\").

Varujan Vosganian, Minister of Economy and Finance, and Mr. Bogdan Mirghis, Legal Advisor of the Ministry of Economy and Finance; Messrs. Brian King, Georgios Petrochilos and Boris Kasolowsky and Ms. Jacomijn J. van Haersolte-van Hof of the law firm of Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer, New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, and Mmes. Adriana I. Gaspar, Ana Diculescu-Sova and Manuela Nestor of the law firm of Nestor Nestor Diculescu Kingston Petersen in Bucharest.\n\n**II.** **procedural history**\n------------------------------\n\n**1.** **Initial phase**\n------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 2 August 2005, Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration dated 28 July 2005 (the \"Request\" or \"RA\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\"), accompanied by 14 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to C-14). In the Request, Claimants invoked the provisions of the Agreement Between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"), which entered into force on 1 April 2003 (Exh. C-1). They sought the following relief:\n\n73. Claimants request reinstitution of the legal framework as in force at the time of the approval of the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998, alternatively adequate compensation for the losses suffered up to the amount of EUR 450,000,000, plus lost profits and any further losses suffered by Claimants as a consequence of Respondent's actions described above.\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 August 2005, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to Romania.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 September 2005, the Request was supplemented by a Statement on the entry into force of the BIT with accompanying exhibits C-15 to C-19.\n\n10.\n\nOn 13 October 2005, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request as supplemented, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"). On the same date, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties of the registration of the Request as supplemented and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 10 January 2006, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties, Claimants elected to submit the arbitration to a Tribunal constituted of three arbitrators, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day they appointed Mr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria. On 7 February 2006, Romania appointed Dr. Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, a national of Germany. The Parties agreed to appoint Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy, a national of Switzerland and Brazil, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 September 2006, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Mrs. Martina Polasek, ICSID Counsel, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 November 2006, the Tribunal held the first session of the Tribunal in Paris, France. At the outset of the session, the Parties expressed agreement that the Tribunal had been duly constituted (Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had no objections in this respect. It was agreed that the applicable arbitration rules were the ones that entered into force on 1 January 2003. The remainder of the procedural issues set forth in the agenda of the session were discussed and agreed upon. In particular, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed upon a timetable for the submissions on the merits and reserved provisional hearing dates. It was agreed that if Respondent decided to raise any objections to jurisdiction or admissibility before the filing of its Counter-Memorial, the schedule would be revisited. It was also decided that the language of the proceedings would be English, and that the place of arbitration would be Paris, France. The audio recording of the session was later distributed to the Parties. Minutes of the first session were drafted and signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and sent to the Parties on 20 December 2006.\n\n**2.** **The written phase on jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable agreed during the first session, Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim on 9 March 2007 (C-Statement), accompanied by 125 exhibits (Exh. C-20 to Exh. C-144), as well as two witness statements. In their Statement of Claim, Claimants sought the following relief:\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal find that Romania has violated the BIT.\n\nClaimants request restitution of the legal framework as in force at the time of the approval of the EGO 24/1998, alternatively adequate compensation for the losses suffered up to the amount of EUR 450,000,000, plus lost profits and any further losses suffered by Claimants as a consequence of Respondent's actions described above. The exact amount will be specified at an appropriate point during the proceedings.\n\nClaimants request reimbursement of their costs and expenses including the costs of the present proceedings.\n\nClaimants also request interest compounded quarterly on all monetary claims with the precise rate of interest to be specified at an appropriate time during the proceedings.\n\n(C-Statement, \u00b6 380-383)\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement of the Parties contained in Romania\u2019s letter of 20 June 2007, and the timetable set forth in the letter of 6 August 2007 from the Centre, Respondent raised objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in its Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility filed on 10 September 2007 (R-Mem.). The Objections were accompanied by 52 exhibits (Exh. R-1 to R-52) and 139 legal authorities (LA R-1 to R-139). An expert opinion of Mr. John Ellison of KPMG was also appended.\n\n16.\n\nThe Parties agreed that the Tribunal should consider Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility as a preliminary question pursuant to Rule 41(4) of the 2003 Arbitration Rules, and thus the Tribunal suspended the proceedings on the merits by letter of the Secretary of 9 October 2007.\n\n17.\n\nOn 14 January 2008, Romania filed a report of Mr. Donald Berlin in relation to Messrs. Micula's nationality (Exh. R-53). This report was not requested by the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule agreed upon by the Parties in Romania's letter of 4 October 2007 and reiterated in the Secretary's letter of 22 October 2007, Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 1 February 2008 accompanied by 59 exhibits (Exhibits C-145 to C-203). An additional witness statement from each individual Claimant, Messrs. Micula, was appended.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule agreed upon by the Parties and pursuant to the Secretary's letter of 22 October 2007, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (R-Reply) on 28 March 2008. A supplemental report by Mr. John Ellison of KPMG and a legal opinion of Professor John Dugard were also appended.\n\n20.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable set forth in the Secretary's letter of 22 October 2007, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (C-Rejoinder) on 30 May 2008 with Exhibits C-204 to C-220.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of 16 May 2008, the Secretary asked the Parties if they would be agreeable to the appointment of Mrs. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti of the law firm of L\u00e9vy Kaufmann-Kohler as Assistant to the Tribunal, which the Parties accepted. The Parties were informed by letter of 28 August 2008 that Mrs. Antonietti ceased her functions as of 31 July 2008.\n\n**3.** **The hearing on jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of 13 June 2008, the Tribunal was informed that Claimant 2 had retained the law firms of Dewey & LeBoeuf and Mu\u00a7at & Asociatii as counsel and requested the postponement of the forthcoming hearing scheduled on 19 and 20 June 2008. The Tribunal held a conference call with the Parties on 14 June 2008. As the Parties and the Tribunal were not able to find any suitable replacement dates, the hearing was scheduled as initially agreed.\n\n23.\n\nTherefore, on 19 and 20 June 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris, France. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Assistant to the Tribunal, the following persons attended the jurisdictional hearing:\n\n(i) On behalf of Claimants\n\n\u2022 Prof. Christoph Schreuer, University of Vienna  \n\u2022 Mr. Gerold Zeiler, Schonherr Rechtsanwalte  \n\u2022 Mrs. Ursula Kriebaum, Schonherr Rechtsanwalte  \n\u2022 Mr. Alfred Siwy, Schonherr Rechtsanwalte  \n\u2022 Mr. Eric Schwartz, Dewey & LeBoeuf  \n\u2022 Ms. Sabine Konrad, Dewey & LeBoeuf  \n\u2022 Mr. Christophe Guibert de Bruet, Dewey & LeBoeuf  \n\u2022 Mr. Alain Farhad, Dewey & LeBoeuf  \n\u2022 Ms. Andreia Dumitrescu, Mu\u00a7at & Asociatii  \n\u2022 Mr. Gelu Maravela, Mu\u00a7at & Asociatii  \n\u2022 Ms. Luminita Popa, Mu\u00a7at & Asociatii  \n\u2022 Mr. Ioan Micula  \n\u2022 Mr. Viorel Micula  \n\u2022 Ms. Oana Popa, employee of Claimants  \n\u2022 Mr. Ciprian Popa, employee of Claimants\n\n(ii) On behalf of Respondent\n\n\u2022 Mr. Brian King, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Mr. Georgios Petrochilos, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Mr. Michael Feutrill, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Mr. Boris Kasolowsky, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Mr. Moto Maeda, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Mr. Manuela Nestor, Nestor Nestor Diculescu Kingston Petersen  \n\u2022 Mrs. Johanna Garrido, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Mr. Matei Purice, Freshfields Bruckaus Deringer  \n\u2022 Ms. Emma Sultan, observer.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal heard oral testimony from Claimants 1 and 2.\n\n25.\n\nMessrs. King, Kasolowsky, Pretrochilos, and Feuitrill addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Respondent. Messrs. Schreuer, Zeiler and Schwartz and Ms. Kriebaum addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Claimants.\n\n26.\n\nThe jurisdictional hearing was audio recorded and a *verbatim* transcript was prepared and delivered to the parties (Tr.). At the end of the hearing, Romania asked for the opportunity to raise an objection to Mr. Viorel Micula's standing given the circumstances of the acquisition of his Swedish nationality. It was agreed that Romania may make an application to that end, which Romania ultimately declined to do on 18 July 2008 as will be seen below.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions on jurisdiction and admissibility and the oral arguments delivered in the course of the jurisdictional hearing. In the following sections, the Tribunal will summarize the Parties\u2019 positions (III), present its analysis (IV), and set forth its decision on jurisdiction and admissibility (V). Before doing so, a brief summary of the factual background is provided in so far as it is necessary to rule on Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections.\n\n**4.** **The project and the dispute**\n--------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe dispute submitted to the Tribunal stems from the introduction of a series of investment incentives (hereafter the \"incentives\") for the development of certain disfavoured regions of Romania and from the subsequent partial withdrawal or amendment of those incentives.\n\n29.\n\nOn 30 September 1998, Romania adopted Emergency Government Ordinance No. 24/1998 (\"EGO 24/1998\", Exh. R-5 or C-40) which laid down the foundation for the designation of \"disfavoured regions\" and the issuance of Permanent Investor Certificates. According to Claimants:\n\n[A] Disfavoured Region is an area that meets at least one of the following requirements: (i) the production in this area focuses on only one industry that employs more than 50% of the employed labour force; or (ii) the area is a mining region where employees were dismissed due to the restructuring of the mining activities; or (iii) dismissals affected more than 25% of the population living in this area; or (iv) the unemployment rate in this area exceeds the national unemployment rate by at least 25 percent; or (v) the infrastructure of this area is either inexistent or underdeveloped.\n\n(C-Statement, \u00b6 73)\n\n30.\n\nEGO 24/1998 was subsequently approved and amended by Law No. 20/1999 of 15 January 1999 (Exh. C-39).\n\n31.\n\nIncentives were offered to investors making investments in disfavoured regions. EGO 24/1998, as approved and amended by Law No. 20/1999, included the following incentives:\n\n\u2022 an exemption from customs duties on machinery, tools, installations, means of transportation and other goods imported into Romania as well as a VAT exemption on these goods if they had been manufactured in Romania with a view to performing and conducting investments in the disfavoured regions (i.e., Machinery Related Incentive, Article 6(1)(a));\n\n\u2022 a full refund of the customs duties on raw material, spare parts and components necessary for achieving the investor's own production in the region (i.e., Raw Material Related Incentive, Article 6(1)(b));\n\n\u2022 an exemption from the payment of profit tax during the existence of the investment in the disfavoured region (i.e., Profit Tax Related Incentive, Article 6(1)(c));\n\n\u2022 an exemption from the payment of taxes collected for improvements to the land or for conversion of agricultural land to industrial land (i.e., the Agricultural Land Related Incentive, Article 6(1)(d)); and\n\n\u2022 preferential subsidies from a special State development fund (i.e., Subsidies, Article 6(1)(e)).\n\n32.\n\nThe incentives above mentioned were to benefit privately owned Romanian legal entities, private entrepreneurs and family associations that were set up after the date of designation of the disfavoured region, to have their registered seat in the disfavoured region, and operate therein.\n\n33.\n\nOn 25 March 1999, Romania designated, by Decision No 194/1999 (Exh. C-31), the \u00a7tei-Nucet a disfavoured region for a period of ten years, starting on 1 April 1999. The \u00a7tei-Nucet region is located in Bihor County in the north-western part of Romania. The primary industry was a mining and oil industry. The boundaries of the disfavoured region were extended to include Draganesti (where some plants of the Corporate Claimants are located) on 29 November 2000 (Exh. C-32).\n\n**4.1 The investment**\n----------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe three Corporate Claimants are mainly engaged in food production in the disfavoured region of \u00a7tei-Nucet. They made greenfield investments that required the purchase or importation of machinery as well as the purchase of raw materials, including raw materials imported from other states, including EU Member States. According to Claimants, they have invested over EUR 200 million in Romania in land, buildings, equipment and means of transportation. Claimants also claim to have created nearly 2,000 new jobs (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 34).\n\n35.\n\nMore particularly, Claimant 3 is said to have made an investment of at least EUR 170 million in production facilities in the disfavoured region. Claimant 3 owns and operates:\n\n\u2022 A plant for the production of food and sauces located in \u015ftei;\n\n\u2022 A plant for the production of emulsions and syrup flavours located in Draganesti;\n\n\u2022 A facility for the production of beer and purification of water in Draganesti;\n\n\u2022 A facility for the transformation of electricity in Draganesti;\n\n\u2022 A facility for the production of syrup made of sugar;\n\n\u2022 A facility for the production of vinegar;\n\n\u2022 A plant for the production and bottling of fruit juice, mineral water, and other liquids.\n\n(C-Statement, \u00b6 145)\n\n36.\n\nSimilarly, Claimant 4 is said to have made an investment of at least EUR 18 million in production facilities in the disfavoured region. Claimant 4 owns and operates:\n\n\u2022 A flour mill located in \u015ftei;\n\n\u2022 A corn mill with hammers located in Pantasesti.\n\n(C-Statement, \u00b6 153)\n\n37.\n\nLastly, Claimant 5 is said to have made an investment of at least EUR 10 million in production facilities in the disfavoured region. Claimant 5 owns and operates:\n\n\u2022 A packaging facility located in Draganesti;\n\n\u2022 A typography plant.\n\n(C-Statement, \u00b6 167)\n\n38.\n\nClaimants 1 and 2 are the sole shareholders of Claimants 4 and 5. They are also the majority shareholders of Claimant 3. In order to qualify for benefit from EGO 24/1998, the three Corporate Claimants were required to obtain Permanent Investor Certificates. These certificates specified the nature of the incentives as well as the period of validity. The Permanent Investor Certificates obtained by Claimants were issued by the North-West Regional Development Agency in June 2000 and in May 2002, and are valid until April 2009. Specifically,\n\n\u2022 Claimant 3 holds Permanent Investor Certificate No. 524 issued on 1 June 2000 that is valid until 1 April 2009 (Exh. C-42);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 4 holds Permanent Investor Certificate No. 1664 issued on 17 May 2002(according to Claimants) that is valid until 1 April 2009 (Exh. C-43);\n\n\u2022 Claimant 5 holds Permanent Investor Certificate No. 1663 issued on 17 May 2002 that is valid until 1 April 2009 (Exh. C-44).\n\n39.\n\nThe nature and extent of the rights attached to the Certificates are disputed by the Parties. Respondent argues that the Corporate Claimants are not entitled to demand that the list of incentives included in EGO 24/1998 be available until 2009 without any modification (R-Mem., \u00b6 18). More specifically, it is Respondent's argument that the Corporate Claimants have an entitlement to receive the benefits that Romanian law, especially EGO 24/1998, as amended from time to time, will make available. Claimants argue that a State may possibly have all latitude to amend its legislation under its own domestic law. However, this would not be the case in international law as unilateral commitments will bind States and investors may rely on such unilateral commitments (C-C.Mem, \u00b6 14,15).\n\n**4.2 Romania\u2019s accession to the EU**\n-------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2007, Romania moved towards membership of the EU and completed the steps towards its accession to the EU on 1 January 2007.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to Romania, EGO 24/1998 contained provisions that conflicted with European law and consequently Romania had to make amendments to it (R-Mem., \u00b6 26). For example, Respondent submitted that exemption from customs duties and taxes would be considered State aid incompatible with the common market, in the context of EU competition policy and, therefore, inconsistent with Romania's EU obligations.\n\n**4.3 The changes in the legal framework**\n------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nGovernment Ordinance No. 75/2000 of 16 June 2000 changed the initial refund of customs duties on raw material to an exemption, but excluded customs duties on imported spare parts and components from the exemption (Exh. C-45). Law No. 621/2001 (Exh. C-46) reinstated the customs duties exemption on imported components as of 19 November 2001. In addition, Ordinance No. 75/2000 also restricted the award of subsidies to the financing of special programs approved by the Government.\n\n43.\n\nGovernment Ordinance No. 75/2000 was approved by Law No. 621/2001 of 7 November 2001, but also amended through the reinstatement of the Raw Material Related Incentive.\n\n44.\n\nIn 2002, the Machinery Related Incentive was abolished, effective 1 June 2002, by Law No. 345/2002 (Exh. C-47).\n\n45.\n\nLater that year, Law No. 414/2002 (Exh. C-48) abolished the Profit Tax Related Incentive, effective 1 July 2002. Investors that had obtained a Permanent Investor Certificate prior to 1 July 2002 were grandfathered under the law. The Profit Tax Related Incentive was later reintroduced on 1 January 2004 by Law No. 507/2004 (Exh. C-52). The Raw Material Related Incentive was abolished as of 23 December 2002 through Law No. 678/2002 (Exh. C-49).\n\n46.\n\nIn 2003, all State aid control functions were allocated to the Competition Council. Romania passed Law No. 239/2004 of 7 June 2004 which required that all State aid, including subsidies, be made subject to State aid requirements with effect from 11 June 2004. Law No. 239/2004 further amended the 1998 Ordinance, setting an upper limit for permitted State aid in disfavoured regions, in order to harmonise Romania\u2019s legislation with the *acquis communautaire.* The upper limit corresponded to the maximum amount of State aid (\"intensity\"), as referred to in the Regional State Aid Regulation approved by the Competition Council (Exh. C-50). Government Ordinance No. 94/2004 of 26 August 2004 abolished the Raw Material Related Incentive, the Agricultural Land Incentive, and the Subsidies. These incentives were effectively cancelled three months after the entry into force of Government Ordinance No. 96/2004 (3 September 2004), i.e., they were terminated on 3 December 2004 (Exh. C-51).\n\n47.\n\nLaw No. 507/2004 of 17 November 2004 approved, but also amended Government Ordinance No. 94/2004*.* Law No. 507/2004 reintroduced temporarily the incentives terminated by Government Ordinance No. 94/2004, but abolished them definitively three months after its own entry into force (22 November 2004), i.e., they were terminated on 22 February 2005 (Exh. C-52).\n\n48.\n\nThese events are at the origin of the dispute submitted to this Tribunal.\n\n**III.** **positions of the parties**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1.** **Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, Respondent has put forward the following main contentions:\n\n(i) Claimants do not have a sufficient legal interest to pursue their claims under the BIT and their claims must be dismissed. Claimants have suffered no actual loss, which renders their claims hypothetical and thus inadmissible.\n\n(ii) Claimants 1 and 2 have not demonstrated Swedish nationality. In particular, there are serious doubts as to the compliance by Claimant 2 with the residence conditions required under Swedish law to acquire Swedish nationality. In any case, Claimants cannot invoke Swedish nationality in a claim against Romania where the Claimants have no effective link to Sweden but maintain effective links to Romania.\n\n(iii) The claim for restitution of the legal regime as in force at the time of the approval of EGO 24/1998 is inadmissible.\n\n(iv) There has been no expropriation of an investment in the sense of Article 1 of the BIT.\n\n(v) The alleged violations of the BIT took place prior to its entry into force and are outside the temporal scope of the BIT.\n\n50.\n\nOn the basis of these arguments, Respondent requests the following relief:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, and those that will be added in further submissions as may be directed by the Tribunal, Romania respectfully requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISS Claimants' claims in their entirety; and\n\n(b) ORDER Claimants to pay in their entirety the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre and the fees and expenses incurred by Romania in defending against Claimants' claims. (R-Reply, \u00b6 139)\n\n**2.** **Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, Claimants have developed the following arguments:\n\n(i) Claimants have shown a *prima facie* case with regard to both liability and actual damages.\n\n(ii) They are \"investors\" in the sense of Article 1(2)(a) of the BIT and \"nationals of another Contracting State\" -Sweden- under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(iii) There is an investment for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT.\n\n(iv) The dispute is within the *ratione temporis* scope of the BIT.\n\n(v) The claim for restitution is admissible and the discussion of remedies is premature.\n\n52.\n\nIn reliance on these arguments, Claimants request the following relief:\n\nClaimants request that\n\n(i) the Tribunal find that the dispute is within the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\n(ii) dismisses all of Respondent's objections to the admissibility of the claims, the jurisdiction of ICSID, and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\n(iii) make the necessary order for the continuation of the proceedings on the merits. (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 265)\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address some introductory matters (1). Then, it will address Respondent\u2019s objections with respect to the nationality of Claimants (*ratione personae*) (2), the nature and existence of the dispute (*ratione materiae*) (3), and the application in time of the BIT (*ratione temporis*) (4). Finally, the Tribunal will review the objection to the admissibility of the claim for restitution (5).\n\n**1.** **Introductory matters**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1.1 Provisions relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is determined by the provisions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT.\n\n55.\n\nThe relevant provision of the ICSID Convention is Article 25(1), which reads as follows:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that both States relevant for the purposes of this dispute are Contracting States of the ICSID Convention. Respondent is a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention since 12 September 1975. Sweden is a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention since 29 December 1966.\n\n57.\n\nThe relevant provision of the BIT is Article 7, which provides for ICSID arbitration in the following terms:\n\n(1) Any dispute concerning an investment between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If any such dispute cannot be settled within three months following the date on which the dispute has been raised by the investor through written notification to the Contracting Party, each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of the dispute, at the investor's choice, for resolution by international arbitration to either:\n\n(i) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, (the Washington Convention); or\n\n(ii) an ad hoc tribunal set up under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The appointing authority under the said rules shall be the Secretary General of ICSID.\n\n[...]\n\n**1.2 Applicable standard**\n---------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent has raised various objections and has framed some of them as objections to admissibility rather than objections to jurisdiction. There is no dispute between the Parties as to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide the jurisdictional and admissibility challenges brought by Respondent pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. However, the Parties are at odds regarding the standard to be applied to Respondent's objections.\n\n***1.2.1 Parties \u2019 positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn addition to objections in connection with the nationality of Messrs. Micula and the application in time of the BIT, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to raise a case on the merits, resulting in \"pathological\" claims (R-Reply, \u00b6 7). Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to demonstrate actual harm. Consequently, Respondent submits that the Tribunal should on a *prima facie* basis dismiss the case (R-Reply, \u00b6 7). Citing ICSID jurisprudence, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should apply two tests: first, a narrow test as to whether there is a legal dispute, and second, a broader test \"*as to whether the claim advanced has arguable merits\"* (R-Reply, \u00b6 10). According to Respondent, where no more than a hypothetical injury is asserted, the second test is not met. Respondent contends that this broader test includes the question of the frivolous and abusive nature of the claim (R-Reply, \u00b6 15). It concludes that the relevant inquiries are two, namely:\n\n[F]irst, a tribunal has to satisfy itself that the legal arguments advanced by the claimant, including the construction of any relevant treaty or other legal instrument, are plausible. Second, it has to satisfy itself that the pleaded facts are capable of sustaining the cause of action advanced by the claimant within the plausible legal framework. (R-Reply, \u00b6 16, footnote omitted)\n\n60.\n\nClaimants agree that ICSID practice requires them to present a claim that is *prima facie* plausible (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 4). However, they submit that the test is not whether the claim is sound, but rather whether \"*the allegations made by the claimant are capable of constituting violations of law, provided the facts are proven correct at the merits stage*\" (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 5). During the jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal should not examine the accuracy of the factual allegations made, particularly with regard to the alleged absence of harm (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 20).\n\n***1.2.2 Tribunal\u2019s analysis***\n-------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe text of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that four conditions must be met for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction: (i) the dispute must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) the parties must have expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration in writing, (iii) the dispute must be a legal one, and (iv) it must arise directly out of an investment.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is also contingent upon the terms of the document in which consent to arbitration is contained, in this case the BIT. The Tribunal needs thus to be satisfied that the terms of Article 7 of the BIT, and by extension the terms of Article 1 (which defines the terms \"investor\" and \"investment\"), have been complied with.\n\n63.\n\nObjections can be framed as matters of jurisdiction or as matters of admissibility, depending on the context in which they are raised. The Tribunal concurs with Respondent that an objection to jurisdiction goes to the ability of a tribunal to hear a case while an objection to admissibility aims at the claim itself and presupposes that the tribunal has jurisdiction. If a tribunal finds a claim to be inadmissible, it must dismiss the claim without going into its merits even though it has jurisdiction. It is disputed whether the concept of admissibility is helpful in ICSID arbitration.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that when an objection relates to a requirement contained in the text on which consent is based, it remains a jurisdictional objection. If such a requirement is not satisfied, the Tribunal may not examine the case at all for lack of jurisdiction. By contrast, an objection relating to admissibility will not necessarily bar the Tribunal from examining the case if the reasons for the inadmissibility of the claim are capable of being removed and are indeed removed at a subsequent stage. In other words, consent is a prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In this proceeding, as it will be shown in the course of the Tribunal's analysis, the vast majority of Respondent's objections are actually objections to jurisdiction.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal understands its duty to determine its jurisdiction, including through examination of the jurisdictional requirements, *sua sponte,* if necessary, as it has an obligation to reject a claim if the record shows that jurisdiction is lacking. Or, put differently, a tribunal can rule on and decline its jurisdiction even where no objection to jurisdiction is raised if there are sufficient grounds to do so on the basis of the record. However, a tribunal's duty to ascertain jurisdiction *sua sponte* does not include an obligation to re-open the evidentiary proceedings, far less to launch its own investigation, unless there are compelling reasons to do so (such as where it has been impossible for a party to have made such an investigation itself or where the other party has concealed relevant facts or evidence).\n\n66.\n\nIt is also common ground that the jurisdictional stage is not the appropriate time to enter the merits of the case. Indeed, it is not for the Tribunal to examine the claim in detail at the stage of jurisdiction1. The Tribunal concurs with Claimants that a tribunal need not go beyond determining whether the facts alleged by a claimant, if established, are capable of constituting violations of the provisions that are invoked. However, when a jurisdictional issue hinges on a factual determination that may also relate to the merits of the claims, the Tribunal must proceed to a determination of the facts that are presented to it to the extent necessary for jurisdictional purposes. Therefore, a tribunal can make definitive factual findings at the jurisdictional stage too. For example, a tribunal must determine the nationality of a claimant in order to establish its jurisdiction *ratione personae* in a definitive manner. On the other hand, a tribunal which is satisfied that there is an existing investment out of which the legal dispute directly arose might not be required to determine in a definitive manner the exact composition or extent of the investment. Such examination can be left for the merits stage when dealing, for example, with a claim of expropriation. Thus, apart from any findings of fact necessary for jurisdictional purposes, a tribunal will only make a *prima facie* determination as to whether the facts are capable of constituting violations of the provisions that are invoked. In ICSID arbitrations, a new rule introduced as from 10 April 2006 (Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules) is not directly applicable here but, nevertheless, makes it clear how to file objections to the manifest lack of legal merit of a claim and how an arbitral tribunal should dispose of such objections2.\n\n*See Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Jurisdiction of 25 September 1983, \u00b6 38, Exh. C-205.\n\n*See Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25), Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules of 12 May 2008.\n\n67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s reliance on the *Teleno*XXXX*r3* case in support of its argument that it is necessary to establish an arguable claim on the merits at the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings beyond a *prima facie* showing that the facts are capable of constituting violations of the provisions that are invoked is inapposite. The facts of the *Telenor* case differ significantly from this case. Under the applicable treaty, the jurisdiction of the *Telenor* tribunal was limited solely to claims for expropriation. Yet, claimant failed to assert a claim of expropriation in either the request for arbitration or in the memorial. The *Telenor* tribunal was forced to determine whether the facts as asserted could, *prima facie*, support a claim of expropriation. The tribunal concluded that Telenor had failed to adduce a *prima facie* case of expropriation. *Telenor* is therefore a case to be distinguished on the basis of the specific facts and legal issues of the matter.\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications AS v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15), Award of 13 September 2006, 21 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 603 (2006).\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to review and analyze Respondent\u2019s specific objections.\n\n**2.** **Objections related to the parties to the arbitration** ***(******ratione personae******)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nWhether Claimants are nationals of another Contracting State requires a twofold investigation in this case. First, the Tribunal must determine whether Messrs. Micula are Swedish nationals (2.1). Second, the Tribunal must determine whether the three Corporate Claimants, which have the nationality of Respondent because they are constituted under the laws of Respondent, are \"investors\" of Sweden under the BIT and \"nationals of another Contracting State\" under the ICSID Convention because they are controlled by nationals of Sweden (2.2).\n\n**2.1 Nationality of Messrs. Micula**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***2.1.1 Parties \u2019 positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n***a) Respondent\u2019s position***\n------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants have failed first to discharge their burden of proof to establish that Messrs. Micula had and have Swedish nationality continuously from the date of the alleged injury to the close of this arbitration (R-Mem., \u00b6 170; R-Reply, \u00b6 90) in accordance with Swedish law. In passing, Respondent claims that Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, which requires that the investor held the nationality at the date of consent as well as on the date on which the request is registered, does not exclude application of customary international law on continuous nationality (R-Reply, \u00b6 100). Similarly, the BIT, which must be read against the background of customary international law, cannot be said to exclude customary international law rules on continuous nationality (R-Reply, \u00b6 101).\n\n71.\n\nBesides, Respondent submits that Messrs. Micula's Swedish nationality would not be opposable to Romania as it is not their effective nationality. It maintains that \"*a state with which the injured party (or here, an 'investor') has overwhelmingly stronger links than the state under the nationality of which a claim is being raised is entitled to defeat that claim on the basis of those overwhelming links (and the absence of any material links with the state of nationality)\"* (R-Mem., \u00b6 187).\n\n72.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the rule of effective nationality applies even when there is only one nationality at stake as confirmed in the *Nottebohm* case (R-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 188-191) where the International Court of Justice held that an individual who has no genuine or effective link with a state could not invoke the nationality of that state against another state, with which that individual has a longstanding and close connection. Respondent asserts that the decision on jurisdiction in *Siag v. Egypt*, which held that the rule of effective nationality applies only in situations involving dual nationality, \"*is not good authority*\" (R-Reply, \u00b6 115). Respondent asserts that this holding is incorrect for three reasons: (i) it is in contradiction of the *Nottebohm* principle, (ii) this aspect of the tribunal\u2019s decision was *obiter dicta*, and (iii) the interpretation was based on a flawed reading of prior decisions (R-Reply, \u00b6 115).\n\n73.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the rule of effective nationality applies both under the BIT and the ICSID Convention (except in the case of dual nationality specifically provided in Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention quoted below at \u00b6 83) as confirmed by Professor Dugard\u2019s legal opinion (Exh. R-53) (R-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112). In the view of Respondent, the effective nationality of a claimant must be taken into account not only at the time of the acquisition of the nationality but also thereafter, i.e., on a continuous basis (R-Reply, \u00b6 120).\n\n74.\n\nIn this case, Respondent argues that Messrs. Micula\u2019s Swedish nationality is ineffective and was solely obtained \"*to advance their purposes\"* (R-Mem., \u00b6 241). Looking at whether a genuine connection exists, the Respondent concludes on the basis of an investigative report (Exh. R-53) that Messrs. Micula permanently reside and physically remain almost constantly in Romania. It also finds that their professional and economic interests, as well as their cultural, social and family ties are in and with Romania. As a result of these strong and continuous links with Romania, Messrs. Micula are barred from invoking their Swedish nationality with respect to Romania (R-Reply, \u00b6 96).\n\n75.\n\nHaving cross-examined Messrs. Micula, Respondent reserved at the hearing the right to apply to the Tribunal for leave to make an objection regarding the validity of the acquisition of Swedish nationality by Mr. Viorel Micula on the ground of fraud towards or patent error(s) on the part of the Swedish authorities. In support of the possibility that such objection might lead to a finding of lack of jurisdiction, Respondent referred to the *Soufraki* case (Tr., p. 196). According to Respondent, such an objection, if presented, would strike at the root of the nationality, and would be in lieu of the \"inopposability\" objection4. Romania wrote to the Tribunal on 4 July 2008 as agreed at the close of the hearing and asked for an extension of time until 18 July 2008 to make any application for leave to object to Viorel Micula\u2019s acquisition of Swedish nationality. In its letter, Romania cast doubt as to his compliance with the five-year residence requirement for grant of nationality under Swedish law between February 1989 (date of his permanent residence permit) and 23 February 1994 (acquisition of nationality). Not only did Romania question the intent of Mr. Viorel Micula to reside in Sweden but it contended that he \"*did not as a matter of fact 'habitually\u2019 reside in Sweden after some time in 1992 at the latest\u2019*XXXX*5**.* Moreover, Respondent argued that the validity of the renunciation of Romanian nationality was a condition of validity of the acquisition of the Swedish nationality6. Mr. Viorel Micula\u2019s renunciation was based on the fact that he resided in Sweden and that he had no interest in returning to Romania, which, according to Respondent, both proved to be incorrect. On 11 July 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal agreed to grant Romania\u2019s application for an extension of time until 18 July 2008 in order to file its submission with regard to Mr. Viorel Micula\u2019s Swedish citizenship. By letter of 18 July 2008, Romania wrote that it was not at this stage *\"in a position to proffer cogent evidence of its own that Mr Viorel Micula (a) could not have complied with the five-year residence requirement under Swedish law or (b) obtained approval of his application to renounce his Romanian nationality on a false premise*XXXX*\"7*although doubts subsisted. It was therefore not seeking leave to make an application to submit an objection on those bases.\n\nRomania's letter, 4 July 2008, \u00b6 2.\n\n*Loc. cit.*, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Loc. cit*., \u00b6 6(k).\n\nRomania's letter, 18 July 2008, p. 1.\n\n***b) Claimants\u2019 position***\n----------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Messrs. Micula had Swedish nationality on the relevant dates for the purposes of the ICSID Convention, i.e., date of consent and date of registration of the Request. It is only necessary to establish that Messrs. Micula have been granted Swedish nationality in accordance with Swedish law, which is the law applicable pursuant to Article 1(2)(a) of the BIT, to fulfil the positive nationality requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (C-C.Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 112 and 120). Messrs. Micula also satisfy the definition of an investor under Article 1(2)(a) of the BIT (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 177). As held by the *Soufraki ad hoc* Committee, if the claimant submits *prima facie* evidence of his nationality, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 134). The documents presented to the Tribunal, including certificates of naturalization for both Messrs. Micula (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 192), establish Swedish nationality and were not rebutted by Respondent (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 140).\n\n77.\n\nClaimants also submit that it is not contested that on the relevant dates Messrs. Micula were no longer Romanian nationals (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 122; C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 244). It is also not contested that Messrs. Micula obtained Swedish nationality in accordance with Swedish law and that they have continuously held Swedish nationality since (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 135). These two facts have been confirmed in a letter of April 2007 from the Swedish Migration Board to Respondent, sent upon Romania's request (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 194-196; Exh. C-247).\n\n78.\n\nAdditionally, Claimants maintain that the ICSID Convention does not contain a continuing nationality requirement, which is in addition highly doubtful under customary law (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 125). In any event, Messrs. Micula were Swedish nationals at the time of the alleged BIT violations and continuously ever since (C-C. Mem., \u00b6 127).\n\n79.\n\nFurther, contrary to what Respondent asserts, the effective nationality principle under customary international law is not applicable to this case, as it only applies to situations of dual nationality (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 172, \u00b6 192, \u00b6 203; C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 170 and \u00b6\u00b6 219-224). Therefore, the *Nottebohm* principle does not apply in this case. As confirmed by various ICSID tribunals, the ICSID Convention leaves no room for the application of the effective nationality principle, or of customary international law: nor does the BIT which only refers to Swedish law (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 185; C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 166). Swedish law, the only applicable law, does not require an effective link such as permanent residence for the continuation of citizenship (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 247).\n\n80.\n\nIn any event, under customary international law, effective link is only required at the time of the acquisition of the nationality, not later on (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 198; C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 209). At that time, Messrs. Micula had lived in Sweden for several years and had substantial bonds there and they still have \"a bond of allegiance and effective ties to Sweden\" (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 215). The case is thus to be distinguished from the *Nottebohm* case, which was silent on the issue of a continued effective link (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 223).\n\n81.\n\nContrary to what Respondent argues, Claimants maintain that Messrs. Micula's nationality is not a nationality of convenience (C-C.Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 249-254; C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 226). The links with Sweden are real and numerous (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 228-237).\n\n82.\n\nRegarding the late application of Romania as to the invalidity of Mr. Viorel Micula's acquisition of Swedish law, Mr. Viorel Micula relies on the decision taken by Sweden and Claimants underline that the high burden of proof lies with Respondent to show why this decision should not be considered dispositive. Mr. Viorel Micula further denied the facts asserted in Romania's allegations. The other Claimants sided with Mr. Viorel Micula on this issue. On 31 July 2008, Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants (Claimants 1, 3, 4 and 5) answered Respondent\u2019s letter of 18 July 2008. They recalled that the burden is on Romania to show that Mr. Viorel Micula did not fulfil the requirements for lawfully obtaining Swedish nationality, what such requirements were, and in the event such requirements were not satisfied, what the consequences would be under Swedish law. It is not clear whether Claimants 1, 3, 4 and 5 aver that the Tribunal should not investigate these issues *sua sponte*.\n\n***2.1.2 Tribunal\u2019s analysis***\n-------------------------------\n\n***a) Applicable rules***\n-------------------------\n\n83.\n\nPursuant to Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute.\n\n84.\n\nArticle 1(2)(a) of the BIT defines investors in this respect as:\n\na) any natural person who is a citizen of a Contracting Party in accordance with its Laws;\n\n***b) Applicable test***\n------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIn accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal must determine whether Messrs. Micula were Swedish nationals at the time of their consent to arbitration, i.e., at the date of the Request, as well as on the date of the registration of the Request by the Centre (the so-called positive requirement). The Tribunal must also determine that Messrs. Micula were not Romanian nationals on either of these dates (the so-called negative requirement). Under the BIT, the Tribunal must examine whether Messrs. Micula were Swedish nationals in accordance with Swedish law.\n\n86.\n\nIt is not disputed by the Parties that as a general principle it is for each State to decide in accordance with its law who is its national. This is a well established principle of international law8 and, as just recalled, is consistent with the provision of Article 1(2)(a) of the BIT. It is also well established in ICSID jurisprudence that the domestic laws of each Contracting State determine nationality9. Thus, in this case, the Tribunal must determine the nationality of Messrs. Micula under the national law of the State whose nationality they claim to have, i.e., Swedish law.\n\n*See* International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with commentaries*, 2006, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2006, vol. II, Part Two, under Article 4, p. 31 [hereinafter *Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection*]. See also the *1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws*.\n\n*See Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7) [hereinafter *Soufraki*], Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for the Annulment of the Award of 5 June 2007, Exh. RL-76. \u00b6 60; *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/15), Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 April 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 143 and 146, Exh. RL-80 [hereinafter *Siag*].\n\n87.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the role of international law in the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 1 of the BIT with respect to nationality. The Tribunal is of the opinion that in interpreting the BIT, i.e., an instrument between two sovereign States, it may take into account, as directed by Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, any relevant rules of international law. The Tribunal is also mindful of the role of international law when nationality is acknowledged for international purposes. Indeed, it is well established that the acquisition of nationality must not be inconsistent with international law10. The burden of proving that nationality was acquired in a manner inconsistent with international law lies with the party challenging the nationality. In that respect, there exists a presumption in favour of the validity of a State's conferment of nationality11. The threshold to overcome such presumption is high.\n\n*See Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection*, Article 4, p. 31.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 34.\n\n88.\n\nIn making its determination, the Tribunal will be mindful of Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights according to which everyone has the right to a nationality, and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.\n\n89.\n\nRomania's arguments are two-fold: on the one hand Romania argues that Swedish nationality albeit acquired legally is not \"opposable\" to Romania given the genuine connection that exists between Messrs. Micula and Romania, and conversely given the lack of effective ties with Sweden. On the other hand, Romania has raised doubts in connection with the validity of Mr. Viorel Micula's acquisition of Swedish nationality. The Tribunal will address the latter objection dealing only with Mr. Viorel Micula prior to dealing with the objection common to the two individual Claimants.\n\n90.\n\nRespondent does not argue that Ioan Micula did not comply with Swedish law when he acquired Swedish nationality on 22 October 1992 (Exh. C-245). Indeed, it is clear from the record that Ioan Micula was married to a Swedish national (of Finnish origin) since 1988, that he held a residence and work permit from October 1987 to October 1989 and thereafter a permanent resident permit (Exh. C-251) until the day of his naturalization, and that his naturalization was obtained in full compliance with the applicable Swedish law. As stated by the Swedish Migration Board on 3 April 2007 in its answer to Romania\u2019s investigation (Exh. C-247), it decided on 12 September 1991 that Ioan Micula would be granted Swedish citizenship if he renounced his Romanian nationality within two years from that date. Conversely, it is not disputed that Ioan Micula\u2019s renunciation of his Romanian nationality on 27 August 1992 was valid and made in compliance with Romanian law. Nor is it disputed that Mr. Ioan Micula did not seek to re-acquire Romanian nationality, as he was eligible to do on the basis of repatriation.\n\n***c) Acquisition of Swedish nationality by Mr. Viorel Micula***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIt is correct, as asserted by Claimants, that Romania\u2019s doubts regarding the acquisition of Swedish nationality by Mr. Viorel Micula were articulated belatedly, namely on the occasion of his cross-examination on 20 June 2008, notwithstanding the fact that the Request was submitted in August 2005. The Tribunal also notes that Romania has not raised a formal objection regarding the acquisition of Viorel Micula\u2019s Swedish nationality. Regardless, nationality is an objective jurisdiction-requirement of the ICSID Convention and the Tribunal must make sure that this requirement is satisfied. For this reason, the Tribunal will examine this issue. It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider Mr. Viorel Micula (or his brother) to be a Swedish national for the purpose of the ICSID Convention and the BIT if it were shown that he had obtained Swedish nationality by fraud or material error, in other words in a manner inconsistent with international law.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the applicable law in 1994 was the Swedish Citizenship Act of 1950. According to Section 6(1) of this Act, as amended in 1992 (Exh. C-186) and thus applicable to the case of Ioan Micula, and as subsequently amended in 1995 and thus applicable to the case of Viorel Micula (Exh. C-187), naturalization of an alien requires satisfaction of three prerequisites. The candidate must have been at least 18 years old, he must have lived in Sweden for at least five years, or three years if married to a Swedish national, and must have led a respectable life. The requirement at stake in this proceeding is the five years of residence in Sweden from the date of obtaining a resident permit until the acquisition date. The record is unhelpful on what is required to satisfy the residence requirement and the requirement that the applicant \"have led a respectable life\". The Tribunal also understands that Swedish law contains no provision on the withdrawal of Swedish nationality due to residence abroad (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 137).\n\n93.\n\nViorel Micula left Romania in 1987. According to the State Migration Board, he entered Sweden on 7 January 1989. Prior to this entry, documents of the Swedish Migration Board (Exh. C-258-259) show that in 1988 his applications for residence and work permits were denied three times. However, he obtained a permanent resident permit and travel document in Sweden on 23 February 1989 (footnote 225 C-Rej., Exh. C-259) and was declared a refugee on the same date, a decision that was later revoked in January 1990. The Swedish Migration Board decided on 23 February 1994 that Viorel Micula would be granted Swedish citizenship if he renounced his Romanian nationality within two years from that date (Exh. C-247). Viorel Micula renounced his Romanian nationality on 17 January 1995 (Exh. C-193). He was granted Swedish nationality on 8 February 1995. Viorel Micula did not request to re-acquire his former Romanian nationality.\n\n94.\n\nRomania casts doubt on whether Viorel Micula fulfilled the requirement of five years' residence in Sweden. Thereby, Romania questions the decision taken by the Swedish authorities when they naturalized Viorel Micula on 8 February 1995 (Exh. C-185). They took that decision because they were satisfied that he had spent the required period of time in Sweden. The Tribunal is mindful of the analysis and conclusions of the tribunal and the *ad hoc* committee in the *Soufraki* case and of the authorities quoted by the *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki* to the effect that it has the power and the duty to examine the existence of the treaty-required nationality. In doing so, it might be that the Tribunal would not necessarily defer to the views of national authorities12 at least if there has been fraud13 or an error (as alleged in the *Soufraki* case). This said, it is also clear that the State conferring nationality must be given a \"margin of appreciation\" in deciding upon the factors that it considers necessary for the granting of nationality14. For the Tribunal, it is not merely a question of probative value of a certificate of naturalization (which the Tribunal accepts to be *prima facie* evidence that is especially convincing against the backdrop of two States having friendly relations and sharing common membership of the EU). Rather, the question is: under which conditions is it appropriate for the Tribunal to overcome the sovereign decision taken by Sweden? It is worth recalling that such decision was made in 1995 in a context unrelated to the present claim. Under what circumstances can the Tribunal question the decision of the Swedish immigration authorities which, after investigation, decided that Viorel Micula had satisfied the Swedish requirements for naturalization? The Tribunal underlines at this juncture that there are no reasons of real importance to doubt the accuracy and thoroughness of the inquiry that was made by the Swedish authorities at the time. This case differs clearly from the *Soufraki* case where the Italian authorities that delivered a certificate of nationality were not aware of the loss of the Italian nationality by Mr. Soufraki. This case also differs from other international law precedents that involve nationality in the context of diplomatic protection, such as where the State granting the nationality is a party to the dispute and asserts claims based on its own determination of nationality15.\n\n*Soufraki,* \u00b6\u00b6 58 ff.\n\nFraud was not alleged in the *Soufraki* case but has been dealt with in the *Ellias Assad Flutie* case, the US-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission pursuant to the Protocol of February 17, 1903, between the United States of America and the Republic of Venezuela, Decision of 1904, IX Reports of International Arbitral Awards, p. 148 (no standing of Mr. Flutie as his naturalization was improperly granted since he had no intent to reside permanently in the US and did not reside during the continued term of five years) [hereinafter the *Flutie* case]. Fraud was also mentioned in the *Flegenheimer* Case, Italian-United States Conciliation Commission, 20 September 1958, 14 Reports of International Arbitral Awards, p. 327, \u00b6 38, as a motive for rejection of a certificate's *prima facie* probative value. In addition, as put by *Oppenheim's International Law*, R Jennings and A Watts (eds), 9th edn, 1996, p. 855, Exh. RL-78: \"*this power of investigation is one which is only to be exercised if the doubts cast on the alleged nationality are not only manifestly groundless but are also of such gravity as to cause serious doubts with regard to the truth and reality of that nationality*\"*.*\n\n*See Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection*, commentary under Article 4 \u00b6 (7), referring to the advisory opinion of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Proposed Amendments to the Naturalization Provisions of the Political Constitution of Costa Rica, 79 I.L.R. 283, pp. 302-303, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n*See* McLachlan, Shore, Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration*, Oxford 2007 5.10 p. 135 and fn. 16 with a reference to the *ELSI* case.\n\n95.\n\nIn these conditions, the Tribunal would only be inclined to disregard the decision of the Swedish authorities if there was convincing and decisive evidence that Viorel Micula\u2019s acquisition of Swedish nationality was fraudulent or at least resulted from a material error. It is for Respondent to make such a showing. For this purpose, casting doubt is not sufficient. The fact is that Respondent has presented only limited evidence, none of which is sufficient to make the necessary showing. Respondent has pointed to Mr. Viorel Micula\u2019s hesitations and inaccuracies under cross-examination by counsel for Respondent. Some of his answers may have left the feeling that his memory was selectively failing him, but they are not a basis to question the validity of the Swedish authorities\u2019 decision to naturalize him or even to question the convincing evidentiary value of the certificate that the Swedish Migration Board issued to Respondent. The record does not include any elements which should lead the Tribunal to investigate facts that are not before it. Nor do Respondent's allegations of facts lead to the need for opening a fact-finding procedure. Given the factual evidence presented by Respondent, the Tribunal, in its letter of 11 July 2008, directed Respondent how to proceed in the event that Respondent believed that it needed additional supplemental documentary production - an option that Respondent chose not to pursue.\n\n96.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that, contrary to the situation in the *Soufraki* case, Respondent has not met the burden of proof to establish grounds for the Tribunal to question Mr. Viorel Micula's nationality, and that, rather, Mr. Viorel Micula has established a strong and convincing case that he has been a national of Sweden during the period relevant to this dispute. The burden thus shifted to Respondent to establish that the Swedish decision was unfounded on the basis of the existing facts. Romania has not done so and the Tribunal sees no good reason to open an investigation.\n\n97.\n\nRomania itself admits that it cannot proffer cogent evidence. As the Tribunal is mindful, Romania asserts that it was unable to locate the records for entries to and exits from the country and such of the Bihor County police concerning persons residing in that county for the period 1989-1995. This said, the Tribunal is unconvinced by Romania's justification that it is prevented from collecting this information due to the reduced number of staff available during the summer vacation period. Romania had three years to investigate this matter. The doubts it raised belatedly do not appear to be novel and are reflected in the letter it sent to the Swedish Migration Board in 2007 (Exh. C-247). It also submitted a report in January 2008 entitled \"citizenship investigation\" which focused on the Swedish aspect of Messrs. Micula's nationalities (Exh. R-53). While the Tribunal understands that Romania underwent drastic changes since 1989 and that its administration might be overwhelmed, casting doubts without adducing evidence is insufficient. In the circumstances, there are no bases to take a decision that would in effect render Mr. Viorel Micula stateless.\n\n***d) Opposability of Swedish nationality to Romania***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nIt is clear for the Tribunal that there is one, and only one, nationality involved in this case: Swedish nationality. It has not been disputed that Messrs. Micula have renounced their Romanian nationality. Therefore, in the view of the Tribunal, a view that appears to be shared by Respondent, the relevant question is not about the choice of one nationality over another because the first is dominant or the second in ineffective. Rather, as presented by Respondent, the relevant question is whether Messrs. Micula held Swedish nationality at certain times relevant to this dispute. Respondent suggests that Messrs. Micula had genuine connections with Romania, the Respondent in this arbitration, the State in which the investment was made, and the State of their former nationality. The Tribunal must therefore determine whether there is some room for the *Nottebohm*XXXX*16* test of genuine connection in this particular case; in other words, whether the Swedish nationality of Messrs. Micula is not effective and cannot be opposed to Romania because of their strong links with Romania and the lack of genuine and effective links with Sweden.\n\n*Nottebohm (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)*, 18 November 1953, [1955] ICJ Reports 111, Exh. RL-72.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the role of a genuine or effective link with the state of nationality is disputable in public international law, and is indeed disputed, particularly in the case of a single nationality. It seems clear that, as put by the Special Rapporteur of the ILC on Diplomatic Protection in his first report, \"*the Nottebohm requirement of a 'genuine link\u2019 should be confined to peculiar facts of the case and not seen as a general principle applicable to all cases of diplomatic protection\"*XXXX*17**.* He added *\"[t]he suggestion that the Nottebohm principle of an effective and genuine link be seen as a rule of customary international law in cases not involving dual or plural nationality enjoys little support18.* Indeed, the International Law Commission considered incorporating such a requirement in the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, but ultimately decided against it and did not include such a requirement in Article 4 of the Draft Articles, which covers cases where there is only one nationality19. The fact that the genuine link test was omitted in the context of diplomatic protection is especially noteworthy because it is in the context of diplomatic protection that States may have a particular vested interest in relying on or disregarding a nationality that lacks foundation in reality. There is thus a clear reluctance in public international law to apply the genuine link test where only a single nationality is at issue, such as the case at hand.\n\nJR Dugard, *First Report on Diplomatic Protection*, 7 March 2000, A/CN.4/506, \u00b6 110.\n\n*Loc. cit*., \u00b6 111.\n\nThe commentary under *Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection*, Article 4 reads as follows:  \n(5) Draft article 4 does not require a State to prove an effective or genuine link between itself and its national, along the lines suggested in the *Nottebohm* case, as an additional factor for the exercise of diplomatic protection, even where the national possesses only one nationality. Despite divergent views as to the interpretation of the case, the Commission took the view that there were certain factors that served to limit *Nottebohm* to the facts of the case in question, particularly the fact that the ties between Mr. Nottebohm and Liechtenstein (the Applicant State) were \"extremely tenuous\" compared with the close ties between Mr. Nottebohm and Guatemala (the Respondent State) for a period of over 34 years, which led the International Court of Justice to repeatedly assert that Liechtenstein was \"not entitled to extend its protection to Nottebohm vis-\u00e0-vis Guatemala\". This suggests that the Court did not intend to expound a general rule applicable to all States but only a relative rule according to which a State in Liechtenstein's position was required to show a genuine link between itself and Mr. Nottebohm in order to permit it to claim on his behalf against Guatemala with whom he had extremely close ties. Moreover, it is necessary to be mindful of the fact that if the genuine link requirement proposed by *Nottebohm* was strictly applied it would exclude millions of persons from the benefit of diplomatic protection as in today's world of economic globalization and migration there are millions of persons who have moved away from their State of nationality and made their lives in States whose nationality they never acquire or have acquired nationality by birth or descent from States with which they have a tenuous connection. (Footnotes omitted, Exh. C-203)\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal must nonetheless examine whether there is any room for the *Nottebohm* requirement of a \"genuine link\" in this proceeding. There is little support for the proposition that the genuine link test has any role to play in the context of ICSID proceedings20. The ICSID Convention requires only that a claimant demonstrate that it is a national of a \"Contracting State\". In fact, Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention does not require that a claimant hold solely one nationality, so long as its second nationality is not that of the State party to the dispute. The Tribunal agrees with the conclusion of the tribunal in *Siag* that the regime established under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not leave room for a test of dominant or effective nationality21. No previous ICSID tribunal appears to have ever ruled to the contrary and Respondent has not supplied any convincing evidence to the contrary22. In fact, Respondent has not convinced the Tribunal to hold otherwise.\n\nThis said, the Tribunal notes that Aaron Broches mentioned in his Hague lecture, \"*It is necessary to realize, however, that the Legal Committee abstained from defining 'nationality' and that there was a general recognition that in the course of ruling on their competence Commissions and Tribunals might have to decide whether a nationality of convenience* [referring to the Nottebohm case] *or a nationality acquired involuntarily by an investor could or should be disregarded*\"*,* in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, Recueil des cours, Volume No. 136, 1972, p. 358, Exh. RL-109. He had previously stated, in the *Chairman's Reports on the Preliminary Draft of the Convention*, that \"*it should be noted that the significance of nationality in traditional instances of espousal of a national's claim should be distinguished from its relatively unimportant role within the framework of the Convention. In the former case, the issue of nationality is of substantive importance as being crucial in determining the right of a State to bring an international claim, while under the Convention, it is only relevant as regards the capacity of the investor to bring a dispute before the Center*\"*.* Doc. Z11, 9 July 1964, \u00b6 116, Exh. RL-73.\n\n*Siag,* para. 198.\n\n*See Champion Trading Company, Ameritrade International, Inc, James T Wahba, John B Wahba and Timothy T Wahba v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9), Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 October 2003, p. 17, Exh. RL-110; *Siag*, \u00b6\u00b6 196-198; *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 18 April 2008, \u00b6 93, Exh. C-243 (albeit regarding corporate claimants).\n\n101.\n\nIt is also doubtful whether the genuine link test would apply pursuant to the BIT. The Contracting Parties to the BIT are free to agree whether any additional standards must be applied to the determination of nationality. Sweden and Romania agreed in the BIT that the Swedish nationality of an individual would be determined under Swedish law and included no additional requirements for the determination of Swedish nationality. The Tribunal concurs with the *Siag* tribunal that the clear definition and the specific regime established by the terms of the BIT should prevail and that to hold otherwise would result in an illegitimate revision of the BIT23.\n\n*Op. cit*., \u00b6 198 and 201; see *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Award of 8 May 2008, \u00b6 414. Exh. C-244*op. cit*., \u00b6 415 [hereinafter *Pey Casado v. Chile*].\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that once naturalized, Messrs. Micula had no need to entertain closer links to Sweden (beyond those links resulting from their Swedish nationality itself) than any other national of Sweden. The record does not show that there would be any limitations on a Swedish citizen to leave Sweden, to migrate or to take a foreign residence or that such circumstances should have any effect on his nationality.\n\n103.\n\nIn addition, there is a major difference between the *Nottebohm* case and the case at hand. In *Nottebohm,* Guatemala never conferred its nationality upon Mr. Nottebohm, and argued that, given his relationship with Guatemala and Germany (his former nationality), he remained an enemy and was not to be treated as a Lichtenstein national. Here, Romania itself has agreed to Messrs. Micula's Swedish nationality when it accepted their renunciation of Romanian nationality. Romania does not even allege that this was in error or that it was fraudulently misled to accept such renunciation. Respondent cannot now argue that Messrs. Micula had insufficient ties to Sweden or even that such ties have tapered off subsequently. Messrs. Micula are not currently Romanian nationals and, therefore, their Swedish nationality cannot become less effective or less dominant than their Romanian nationality (or any other nationality for that matter, given that Messrs. Micula have only Swedish nationality). Even if dual nationality were not a prerequisite for applying the *Nottebohm* test, *Nottebohm* cannot be read to allow or require that a State disregard an individual's single nationality on the basis of the fact that this individual has not resided in the country of his nationality for a period of time.\n\n104.\n\nFinally, even if there were some room for the application of the genuine link test in this case, Mr. John Dugard, expert for Respondent, pointed out that when dealing with a single nationality, the threshold for the Respondent State to show that the test is applicable is higher than in the cases of dual nationality and the use of the test should be limited to exceptional circumstances. In the Tribunal's view, the links of Messrs. Miculas with Sweden are not of such nature as to require that the Tribunal question the effectiveness of the Swedish nationality of Messrs. Micula or its opposability to Romania. Messrs. Micula have assets in Sweden. Mr. Ioan Micula's in-laws are living in Sweden and his two daughters are Swedish nationals. Messrs. Micula intend to retire in Sweden and they pay into pensions funds to that effect. The fact that they presently reside in Romania is not a decisive factor. Indeed, it is clear that they have done so in order to run their business, and as testified by Mr. Viorel Micula they could live in another country if they had their business located somewhere else.\n\n105.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal rejects Romania\u2019s argument that the Swedish nationality of Mr. Ioan Micula and Mr. Viorel Micula cannot be opposed to Romania because of purported tenuous links with Sweden.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that Mr. Ioan Micula and Mr. Viorel Micula are and have been Swedish nationals at all times relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this dispute.\n\n**2.2 Nationality of the three Corporate Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe position of the Parties as to the nationality of the three Corporate Claimants hinges upon the Tribunal's determination of the nationality of Messrs. Micula.\n\n108.\n\nPursuant to Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and **any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention**. (Emphasis added)\n\n109.\n\nRelevant parts of Article 1(2) of the BIT define an investor as:\n\nb) legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organised under the law of a Contracting Party and which have their seat in the territory of that same Contracting Party; and\n\nc) legal entities wherever located which are effectively controlled by citizens of a Contracting Party or by legal entities having their seat in the territory of that Contracting Party.\n\n110.\n\nArticle 7(3) of the BIT provides:\n\n3. For the purpose of this Article and Article 25(2)(b) of the said Washington Convention, any legal person which is constituted in accordance with the legislation of one Contracting Party and which, before a dispute arises, is controlled by an investor of the other Contracting Party, shall be treated as a legal person of the other Contracting Party.\n\n111.\n\nPursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the relevant date for determining the nationality of the Corporate Claimants is the date of the consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, i.e., the date of the Request, namely 28 July 2005.\n\n112.\n\nClaimant 3 is a Romanian joint stock company established on 30 November 1989. Respondent does not dispute that Claimant 3 was held on 1 February 2007 (Exh. C-25) at more than 93% by Messrs. Micula. The rest of the shares were held by Rieni Drinks SA, a Romanian company (6.5%). The excerpt from the Register of the Ministry of Justice dated 27 May 2005 (Exh. C-7) shows that the Miculas each held 46.7289% and Rieni Drinks 6.5415%.\n\n113.\n\nClaimants 4 and 5 were established as Romanian limited liability companies on 21 February 2002. Claimants 1 and 2 each hold 50% of the shares (Exh. C-7, dated 27 May 2005).\n\n114.\n\nOn 31 July 2008 Counsel for Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants submitted, for each of the three Corporate Claimants, excerpts from the Romanian commercial registry showing the status of each of these three companies as of 25 June 2008, as well as their corporate biographies from 1 July 2005 on. These documents confirm the above conclusions.\n\n115.\n\nTherefore, Claimants 3 to 5 were held by nationals of another Contracting State at the time of consent to arbitration in accordance with the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 7(3) of the BIT. Respondent has not disputed these facts.\n\n116.\n\nAccordingly, the dispute is between an ICSID Contracting State, Romania, and nationals of another ICSID Contracting State, Sweden.\n\n**3.** **Objections related to the nature of the dispute** ***(******ratione materiae******)***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nRespondent's objections can be summarized as follows: the dispute does not relate to an investment and is only hypothetical. The Tribunal will examine these two objections in turn.\n\n**3.1 Existence of an investment**\n----------------------------------\n\n***3.1.1 Parties \u2019 positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n***a) Respondent\u2019s position***\n------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Messrs. Micula's shareholding in the Corporate Claimants as well as the Corporate Claimants' material and immaterial assets appear to have the characteristics of an investment. Respondent also *\"does not take issue with the admissibility of the claims under Article 2 of the BIT* (R-Reply, \u00b6 57).\n\n119.\n\nHowever, Respondent objects to the notion that investment incentives listed in EGO 24/1998 can be expropriated, as those incentives only create potential entitlements and are not private rights (R-Mem., \u00b6 97). It submits that the incentives are not investments in themselves (R-Mem., \u00b6 99). To support its position, Respondent underlines that Article 1(1) of the BIT requires that the investment must be an asset invested in the territory of Romania (R-Mem., \u00b6 103). Respondent further denies that the incentives and the investor certificates could be considered licences or concessions under the BIT.\n\n***b) Claimants\u2019 position***\n----------------------------\n\n120.\n\nClaimants contend that they have made an investment for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT.\n\n121.\n\nClaimants assert that, with regard to Article 4 of the BIT, *\"[a]s an integral part of the overall investment operation, the facilities are susceptible of expropriation\"* (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 81). In addition, *\"[r]ights conferred unilaterally upon the investor can form important elements of the investment without the investor having contributed to their 'creation or maintenance\u2019*\" (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 82). They can also be described as \"claims to money\" or as \"any kind of asset\" (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 83) or business concessions in the sense of specific privileges or abatement (Tr. pp. 163-164).\n\n***3.1.2 Tribunal\u2019s analysis***\n-------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nRespondent argues in essence that there can be no claim for expropriation of the incentives since incentives are not investments.\n\n123.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal considers that it need only determine whether there is an investment for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT.\n\n124.\n\nIt is not disputed by Respondent that Messrs. Micula\u2019s shareholding in the Corporate Claimants, as well as the Corporate Claimants\u2019 material and immaterial assets, have the characteristics of an investment (R-Mem., \u00b6 95). The fact that Respondent presents its argument as an objection to admissibility further supports the fact that it acknowledges the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this respect.\n\n125.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is satisfied, and Respondent does not argue otherwise, that the investments made by the Corporate Claimants as described above (see \u00b6\u00b6 34-38) qualify as investments for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, it would be hard to argue that the ownership and operation of plants for the production of food and related services, which involves a substantial commitment of resources over a significant period of time, is not an investment under any reasonable definition of the term. In the same vein, the Tribunal is satisfied that the shareholding of Messrs. Micula qualifies as investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that there was an investment for the purposes of the BIT. The investments fall within the scope of the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1 of the BIT, which reads as follows:\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement\n\n1. \"investment\" shall mean any kind of asset owned or controlled invested directly or indirectly by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:\n\na) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as mortgage, lien, pledge, usufruct and similar rights;\n\nb) shares, debentures and other forms of participation in companies;\n\nc) claims to money and other rights relating to any performance having an economic value;\n\nd) intellectual property rights, technical pro- cesses, trade names, know-how, goodwill and other similar rights;\n\ne) business concessions conferred by law, administrative decisions or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources; and\n\nf) goods that under a leasing agreement are placed at the disposal of a lessee in the territory of one Contracting Party by a lessor being an investor of the other Contracting Party.\n\nA change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent has not suggested that these investments were not made in the Romanian territory or in accordance with Romanian law. The investment certificates issued by Romania (Exh. C-42 to C-44) provide evidence that these investments were properly made.\n\n128.\n\nHaving established that Claimants have made investments in the territory of Romania out of which this dispute arises, the Tribunal does not need to establish at this stage whether the incentives as such are considered investments capable of expropriation. Be that as it may, investments do include income expectations and such income will of necessity be less if an investor is deprived of incentives. In passing, the Tribunal notes that expropriation is only one of the BIT causes of action upon which Claimants rely in relation to their investment.\n\n**3.2 Alleged absence of compensable harm**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal will summarize the Parties\u2019 positions prior to setting out its analysis.\n\n***3.2.1 Parties \u2019 positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n***a) Respondent\u2019s position***\n------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nAccording to Respondent, harm is a necessary component of any claim and of all causes of actions that can be raised under the BIT (R-Reply, \u00b6 20). Absent the certitude of harm already suffered, or certain to be suffered in the future, Claimants lack standing to bring a claim (R-Mem., \u00b6 93). Only Sweden would have standing to invoke the BIT without a showing of specific and actual harm to itself or its nationals (R-Mem., \u00b6 87). For a dispute not to be merely theoretical, there must be a relief to which Claimants are entitled (R-Reply, \u00b6 22), or - put differently - that damage has occurred or been quantified (R-Reply, \u00b6 25). Respondent maintains that there can be no breach without injury (R-Mem., \u00b6 79). According to Respondent, Claimants have not shown anything but hypothetical harm resulting from Respondent\u2019s actions allegedly in violation of the BIT.\n\n131.\n\nIn addition, according to Respondent, the necessary showing of harm was to be made by the time of the Statement of Claim pursuant to the Minutes of the First Session24 (R-Mem., \u00b6 94). Respondent argues that Claimants violated the terms of the Minutes of the First Session by not providing in the Statement of Claim all evidentiary materials or the legal and factual basis for their damages claim and method of calculation (R-Reply, \u00b6 33). In the view of Respondent, the damages model provided by Claimants is irrelevant. Most importantly, there is no evidence that any Corporate Claimant paid customs duty, VAT, profit tax or any other tax from which they would have been exempted had EGO 24/1998 not been modified (R-Reply, \u00b6 37). Even if some customs duties would have been paid by European Food for EUR 27,600, this falls short of the EUR 450 million claimed (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 44). Respondent has submitted a report by Mr. Ellison of KPMG, which maintains that it cannot be established that any loss has been suffered (Exh. R-1).\n\nItem 14(II) of the Minutes of the First Session reads:  \na. Each party's submission shall contain a full statement of the relevant party's case, together with the formal relief claimed from the Tribunal and all evidential and legal materials upon which that party relies in support of its case, including documentary evidence, witness statements, and expert reports. At the session, the President clarified that each submission should include specific allegations and an indication whether the submitting party agrees with the other party's allegations and the reasons therefore.  \nb. As an exception to Item 14(II)(a) above, the Claimants will not be required to provide with the Memorial any expert reports on the amount of damages claimed, provided that the legal and factual bases for their damages claim and the method of its calculation are described in the Memorial.\"\n\n***b) Claimants\u2019 position***\n----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nBy contrast, Claimants point out that \"*[*t*]he Tribunal cannot establish the financial consequences of an illegality before it has examined the facts and their legal consequences*\" (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 22). At this juncture, Claimants are under no obligation to prove their financial losses, which will be properly addressed at the merits stage (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 24).\n\n133.\n\nIn any event, Claimants allege that they have suffered a financial loss. For example, it is clear that Claimant 3 paid customs duties on the import of tomato paste from Greece and hops pellets from Germany (Exh. C-166, C-167, C-214, C-215). These products would not have been subject to customs duties if the incentives were in place. Hence, Claimants have suffered damages because the customs duties resulted in lowered profits. In addition, due to the revocation of the incentives granted, the costs for the import of raw material increased to such an extent that Claimants had to stop the production of certain products (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 66). To support further their position, Claimants have submitted two expert reports by Deloitte (Exh. C-168 and C-223) setting out a damages model that compares the profits Claimants actually made to the profits they would have made had the incentives not been withdrawn. Hence, there was no violation of section 14(II) of the Minutes of the First Session.\n\n134.\n\nClaimants also put forward that the primary relief being sought is restitution of the existing legal framework. Claimants maintain that they do not need to establish the existence of a compensable harm.\n\n***3.2.2 Tribunal\u2019s analysis***\n-------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nRespondent's primary argument in this proceeding is that \"*the Claimants have failed to state a claim in their Memorial because they have not made any showing of existing or certain future harm from the measures complained of*\" (Respondent's Opening Statement, p. 4). For the Tribunal, this argument actually relates to the question of whether there is a dispute. Respondent contends there is only a hypothetical dispute because Claimants have not suffered any harm. The issue of whether a dispute exists is a question of jurisdiction, to which the Tribunal will turn shortly. The issue of the extent of damages, however, is a separate question that the Tribunal reserves for consideration for the merits phase.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that the present dispute is of a legal nature25 and that it arose directly out of an investment for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The \"dispute\" was first notified by Claimants to Respondent on 13 September 2004 pursuant to Article 7(1) of the BIT for the purpose of entering into amicable discussions (Exh. C-8 to C-12). No amicable solution was found (Exh. C-13 and C-14). The conditions set forth in Article 7(1) and (2) of the BIT are therefore met.\n\n*See* \u00b6 26 of the *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention* according to which: \"*The expression legal dispute has been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dispute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation.*\"\n\n137.\n\nIt is also clear to the Tribunal that the dispute is not merely hypothetical. Indeed the dispute as framed and presented by Claimants relates to the effect of certain regulatory changes on their business. The changes in the regulatory framework are not disputed by Respondent. Whether Claimants are entitled to any incentives is a matter to be determined at the stage of the merits. Suffice it to note here that Claimants have made a *prima facie* case of entitlement: European Food SA has shown that it was entitled to a profit tax exemption (Exh. C-34), the extent of which remains to be determined. Moreover, Claimants argue that there is no mention in the BIT of the need for the investor to have incurred any loss or damage to pass the jurisdictional threshold - a requirement that does exist in other investment treaties, such as Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA (C-C.Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 33-36). The Tribunal would agree with such argument provided Claimants aver having incurred a loss or damage, which they do.\n\n138.\n\nIn so far as the existence of harm relates to the existence of a dispute, the Tribunal now turns to the specific issue of whether Claimants failed to show actual or future harm. The Tribunal is unconvinced by Respondent\u2019s arguments to that effect. It is not disputed that some imports have occurred and Claimants have paid some import taxes. It is also undisputed that at least some of the incentives were terminated prior to the termination of Claimants\u2019 Permanent Investor Certificates. In fact, it cannot be denied that Claimants 3 to 5 established *prima facie* the existence of a financial loss in connection with payment of customs duties, which Respondent conceded at the hearing (Tr., pp. 27-28).\n\n139.\n\nIndeed, Claimants have adduced two customs declarations dated 3 May 2005 and 22 December 2005 in which Claimant 3 imported tomatoes from Greece (Exh. C-166 and C-214 and 215 for the proof of payment) and hops pellets from Germany (Exh. C-167). There are also on record for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 various declarations and proof of payment by Claimant 3 of customs duties in connection with the import of tomato paste from China, apple concentrate from Israel, meat barrels from China and potato granules from Germany (Exh. C-218). Declarations are also on record for Claimant 4 with regard to the import of rice debris from Egypt during the course of 2005, 2006 and 2007 (Exh. C-219). Finally, one declaration in the name of Claimant 5 has been provided in connection with the import of polyethylene in 2006 (Exh. C-220).\n\n140.\n\nIn these circumstances, and on the basis of the facts as asserted, the Tribunal finds that the revocation of the incentives listed in EGO 24/998 is capable of having caused in the past, or causing in the future, harm to Claimants. The extent or existence of actual harm suffered by one or more of the Claimants, if Respondent is held liable, need not be addressed at this stage.\n\n141.\n\nFinally, while Claimants could have presented more substantial reports on the harm allegedly suffered than they did, the Tribunal does not find that, based on the evidence presented, they failed to comply with the terms of the Minutes of the First Session. Claimants did properly describe in broad terms the various items of damages they alleged to have suffered. Respondent does not assert that it was unable to understand what Claimants are claiming, and out of which alleged specific breaches of the BIT their damages allegedly arise. This will suffice at this juncture. More specific claims as to the quantification of damages and losses will be part of the second phase of this arbitration.\n\n**4.** **Application** ***ratione temporis*** **of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe BIT dated 29 May 2002 (Exh. C-1) entered into force on 1 April 2003, subsequent to the required notifications between the two Contracting States (Exh. C-17 to C-19). The Parties disagree as to the scope of its application in time.\n\n**4.1 Parties\u2019 positions**\n--------------------------\n\n***4.1.1 Respondent\u2019s position***\n---------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nAccording to Respondent, some of the incentives that were allegedly expropriated were revoked or amended before the BIT entered into force on 1 April 2003. Based on the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, Respondent submits that amendments to EGO 24/1998 effective prior to 1 April 2003 cannot be part of a claim under the BIT. Indeed, the term \"dispute\" in Article 7(1) must be read in respect of alleged breaches of the substantive obligations set forth in the BIT (R-Reply, \u00b6 72). This is consistent with Article 9(1) of the BIT, the purpose of which is to exclude from the scope of the application of the BIT disputes that have arisen before 2003 (R-Reply, \u00b6 73). Thus, Article 7(1) can only apply to disputes that arise after 1 April 2003, the date of its entry into force. Disputes regarding incentives revoked prior to 1 April 2003 could not be said to have arisen after that date.\n\n144.\n\nRespondent objects to Claimants' argument that the Tribunal should apply customary international law to actions prior to 1 April 2003. According to Respondent, Claimants' construction to the contrary would result in the concurrent application of the substance of the BIT and of customary international law. Romania requests that this construction be ruled inadmissible as untimely since it was not included in the Request for Arbitration, Statement of Claim or Counter Memorial of Claimants (R-Reply, \u00b6 74). In addition, Respondent argues that Claimants have not articulated their claim based on a breach of customary international law (R-Reply, \u00b6 78). Such a claim, namely a claim for violation of rights under customary international law, should, in any event, be raised by a State as a claim for diplomatic protection. Therefore the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction as the national having suffered harm as a result of the breach would not have a right of compensation; that right belongs to the state. Indeed, in the context of a diplomatic protection claim the Corporate Claimants would have no standing, as they are Romanian, and the individual Claimants would have no right of action for indirect damages (Tr. p. 70, lines 18-22).\n\n145.\n\nRespondent also objects to the alternative argument of Claimants that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is established on the basis of a continuing and composite breach. In Respondent's view, there is no continuing or composite breach since there was no repetitive breach of any primary obligation. Indeed, each of the acts of revision or amendment of the incentives was a single act at one point in time (R-Reply, \u00b6 84). In addition, the obligations allegedly breached were not continuous prior to and after the entry into force of the BIT, hence the violation cannot be ongoing. Respondent raises the same objections to the alternative composite breach theory. It argues that under that theory, the primary obligation must remain in force for the entire course of the breaching conduct, which is not the case here (R-Reply, \u00b6 86).\n\n***4.1.2 Claimants\u2019 position***\n-------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nFor their part, Claimants consider that the term \"any dispute\" in Article 7(1) of the BIT must be read expansively and may include events that took place prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into force (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 58). There is a difference between temporal rules concerning the substance of a dispute and jurisdiction. Article 7(1) of the BIT covers any dispute concerning an investment and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not limited to events covered by the BIT\u2019s substantive rules (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 87).\n\n147.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tribunal has jurisdiction, for the purpose of Articles 7 and 9 of the BIT, if the dispute arose after the entry into force of the BIT, irrespective of whether events leading to the dispute occurred before the BIT\u2019s entry into force (C-C.Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 70 and 78; C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 99).\n\n148.\n\nEvents that took place prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into force would have to be judged in light of contemporaneous international law, i.e., customary international law (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 101). Claimants deny any change in the substance of their claim, as it is a mere extension of the basis of the applicable law (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 101). If this were to be considered as an amendment of the original claim, which it is not, it is not untimely and should be accepted under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 102). The application of customary international law as the law applicable to the substance of the dispute would not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on the BIT (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 109) and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n149.\n\nIn any event, Claimants maintain that Romania\u2019s breaches are also both continuing and composite and fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. They are of a continuing character since *\"[t]he revocation of the facilities took place through legislative provisions. Even those revocations that took place before the BIT\u2019s entry into force on 1 April 2003 continued to be in force after that date and continue to be in force today.* (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 126). The continuing application of a piece of legislation that remains in force is an example of a continuing act under Article 14 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (Tr., p. 256, lines 9-12). Similarly, the obligation to observe \"any obligation\" in Article 2(4) of the BIT is a continuing obligation, as is the prohibition of creeping expropriation (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130). The breaches are also of a composite nature under Article 15 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The revocation and amendments of the incentives were the first step of the process and are actually brought to full effect as wrongful acts when the authorities assess and collect the relevant tax or fee (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 140). There was and still is a series of actions as required by Article 15 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which requires that the Tribunal take into account the aggregate effect of these actions.\n\n**4.2 Tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n***4.2.1 Preliminary consideration***\n-------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal must first decide Romania's request to declare Claimants' reliance on customary international law inadmissible for untimeliness. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's request. It notes that in their Counter-Memorial, Claimants already argued that *\"Romania's actions that took place before the BIT\u2019s entry into force were illegal under contemporaneous customary international law which in many respects is no different from the rules contained in the BIT\u2019.(C-C.Mem.,* \u00b6 64). Similarly, Claimants wrote:\n\n[...] This question may be relevant to determine whether it is necessary to demonstrate that some of Romania's expropriatory actions were illegal not only under the BIT but also under customary international law. But this is not a question that has any **influence** on jurisdiction in this case (C-C.Mem., \u00b6 79, emphasis in original).\n\n151.\n\nMoreover, Claimants have alleged breaches of the BIT pointing to specific conduct of Romania, including tampering with the incentives listed in EGO 24/1998 and the Permanent Investment Certificates, and made the corresponding prayers for relief. The Tribunal must decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties, possibly Romanian law and \"such rules of international law as may be applicable\", as required by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Therefore, pursuant to Article 42(1) the Tribunal will apply international law if necessary, and pursuant to Article 42(2) of the Convention the Tribunal will certainly apply residually international law if the other applicable rules are silent or obscure or are eventually determined not to apply *ratione temporis.* Without intending to determine at this stage what law will apply to the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal also notes that Article 9(2) of the BIT too makes it clear that international law may be applicable to a dispute under the BIT. According to Article 9(2), *\"This Agreement shall in no way restrict the rights and benefits which an investor or one Contracting Party enjoys under national or international law in the territory of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n152.\n\nThe fact that Claimants' argument was developed later in the proceedings is not a reason to bar it from the record. This said, it will be for Claimants to expand their claims accordingly during the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n***4.2.2 Tribunal\u2019s determination***\n------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nIn addition to Article 7 quoted above, the relevant text for the inter-temporal discussion of the BIT is Article 9. The two must be read together. Article 9 reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nApplication of the Agreement\n\nThis Agreement shall apply to all investments, whether made before or after its entry into force, but **shall not apply to any dispute concerning an investment which arose**, or any claim concerning an investment which was settled, **before its entry into force**. (Emphasis added)\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the time at which the dispute arose is the relevant and decisive question for purposes of determining the scope of the Parties\u2019 consent under Article 9 of the BIT and thus the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction26.\n\nAs put by the *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28), Decision on Jurisdiction of 1 February 2006, \u00b6 148, Exh. C-147 (incomplete document): \"*What is decisive of the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione temporis is the point in time at which the instant legal dispute between the parties arose, not the point in time during which the factual matters on which the dispute is based took place*\". In that case the dispute was deemed to have arisen after a tax assessment had been imposed. See also *Pey Casado v. Chile*, *op. cit.,* \u00b6 446.\n\n155.\n\nIt is not disputed among the Parties that the dispute as such arose after the entry into force of the BIT. Indeed, there is no record of stated disagreement between Claimants and Respondent before the date, on which Claimants notified Respondent of the existence of the dispute in April 2004. Thus, the dispute submitted to the Tribunal arose after the entry into force of the BIT and, therefore, falls within the scope of application of the BIT *ratione temporis.*\n\n156.\n\nRespondent\u2019s objection relies on the fact that some of the events giving rise to the dispute took place prior to the entry into force of the BIT. In that respect, the Tribunal notes that most of the incentives were revoked after the entry into force of the BIT, save for two of them: the Machinery Related Incentive and the Raw Material Related Incentive (for the production, processing and preservation of meat). Both incentives were revoked in 2002. These earlier revocations do not modify the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning as to the timing of the dispute. Under Article 9, the critical date is the date when the dispute arose rather than the date when events and actions that may have given rise to the dispute took place.\n\n157.\n\nBoth Parties concur that the BIT\u2019s substantive provisions apply only from the date of its entry into force and do not apply retroactively. This is a clear temporal rule embodied in Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The temporal application of the substantive provisions of the BIT is indeed different from the matter of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*XXXX*27**.* The Tribunal will examine alleged breaches of the BIT based on acts that preceded the entry into force of the BIT if *(i)* there is a violation of another rule different from the BIT, if and when applicable, or *(ii)* the violations are of continuing or composite character. Both these issues are properly considered at the merits phase.\n\n*See e.g.*, *Pey Casado v. Chile*, *op. cit*., \u00b6 427-429. *See also Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13), Decision on Jurisdiction of 29 November 2004, para. 176 (\"[O]ne must distinguish carefully between jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of an ICSID Tribunal (*i.e*., the existence of a dispute) and applicability *ratione temporis* of the substantive obligations contained in a BIT\").\n\n**5.** **Objection to the restitution claim**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe last of Respondent\u2019s objections relates to the remedy of restitution sought by Claimants. Claimants seek as primary relief the restitution of the legal framework in force at the time of the approval of the EGO 24/1998. Respondent argues that this claim is inadmissible.\n\n**5.1 Parties\u2019 positions**\n--------------------------\n\n***5.1.1 Respondent\u2019s position***\n---------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nFor Respondent, the restitution remedy is unavailable to Claimants as a matter of international law, and Claimants\u2019 prayer for relief must be confined to monetary damages (R-Reply, \u00b6 49).\n\n160.\n\nFirst, Respondent notes that it would be absurd and unjust for Romania to reinstate an old regulatory regime that would likely breach the EC Treaty (R-Mem., \u00b6 162). According to Respondent that makes restitution essentially impossible, which rules it out as an available remedy. Respondent also argues that ordering restitution would go beyond providing a remedy to Claimants because it would have an *erga omnes* effect and would thus entitle other eligible investors to the relevant incentives, exemptions and subsidies (R-Mem., \u00b6 164).\n\n161.\n\nSecond, Romania has not undertaken any obligation to take or maintain a specific regulatory regime (R-Mem., \u00b6 147). Claimants were not granted any specific individual rights under EGO 24/1998; rather they were only eligible to obtain certain incentives.\n\n162.\n\nThird, Respondent maintains that the restitution sought would not flow directly from the causes of action. Claimant should show that there is a link, a *nexus,* between the cause of action and any reparation attendant to it: restitution may be a form of reparation under international law but why should it be appropriate or possible as a remedy in this very case?\n\n163.\n\nFinally, Respondent questions whether specific performance can be ordered in investment cases and argues that in any event \"*no form of restitution can be awarded (whether by way of order or declaration) when that would impinge on the state\u2019s regulatory sovereignty* (R-Mem., \u00b6 156).\n\n***5.1.2 Claimants\u2019 position***\n-------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nClaimants maintain that Respondent merely states that restitution is unavailable and has not proven that it is impossible or that it would involve a disproportionate burden compared to monetary compensation (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 71).\n\n165.\n\nIn any event, Claimants argue that they have requested restitution, and alternatively adequate monetary compensation, for the losses suffered, leaving it to the Tribunal to determine which form of relief is appropriate at the merits phase (C-Rejoinder, \u00b6 78).\n\n**5.2 Tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n166.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, a tribunal has the power to order pecuniary or non-pecuniary remedies, including restitution, i.e., re-establishing the situation which existed before a wrongful act was committed28. As Respondent itself admits, restitution is, in theory, a remedy that is available under the ICSID Convention (Tr. p. 56). That admission essentially disposes of the objection as an objection to jurisdiction and admissibility. The fact that restitution is a rarely ordered remedy is not relevant at this stage of the proceedings. Similarly, and contrary to Respondent's argument, the fact that such a remedy might not be enforceable pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention should not preclude a tribunal from ordering it. Remedies and enforcement are two distinct concepts.\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts*, annexed to the General Assembly Resolution 56/83, UN Doc A/RES/56/83, 12 December 2001, Article 35. See *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 January 2004, \u00b6\u00b6 79 to 81, Exh. RL-64.\n\n167.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal finds no limitation to its powers to order restitution in the BIT, the instrument on which the consent of the parties is based. While Article 4 of the BIT dealing with expropriation only mentions compensation, it does not rule out restitution. Moreover, the rest of the BIT provisions do not preclude a tribunal from ordering restitution, if and when appropriate, for a violation of other substantive provisions. Article 7 of the BIT contains no further limitations to the Tribunal\u2019s powers in that respect.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does have the powers to order restitution, both under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and thus cannot uphold Respondent\u2019s objection as an objection to jurisdiction and admissibility. Ultimately, whether restitution is an appropriate remedy, and whether restitution or compensation should be ordered, are questions properly addressed at the merits phase of the proceedings. It is premature to discuss this issue at this juncture. It requires, in any event, a showing by Claimants that Respondent violated the BIT.\n\n**6.** **Costs**\n----------------\n\n169.\n\nHaving concluded that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute and having dismissed all the Respondent\u2019s objections, the Tribunal reserves all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and of the Parties for subsequent determination.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n170.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above,\n\n\u2022 The objections of Respondent are dismissed.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration and rejects any objections as to the admissibility of the claims.\n\n\u2022 The decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the arbitration on the merits.\n\n24 September 2008"}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2013-12-11T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab", "Type": "Concurring Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Separate Opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nWhilst concurring with the outcome of this very thorough and lengthy award, I have difficulty with some interpretations of the law it provides. Without necessarily endorsing unreservedly all the others, I would like to single out one or two such areas.\n\n**I Legitimate expectations**\n-----------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Award bases the liability of Romania, mainly on its frustration, by its premature ending of the Tax Incentives Scheme, EGO 24, of the legitimate expectations of the Claimants, in violation of the Fair and equitable treatment standard stipulated in Article 2(3) of the BIT. According to the Award, in its exposition of the grounds, the acts, conduct and representations generating such \"legitimate expectations\" need not rise to the level of sources of legal obligations\n\n3.\n\nFor me, however, to deserve the qualifier \"legitimate\", the \"expectations\" must be based on some kind of legal commitment. Under general international law, responsibility cannot ensue without a prior breach of a legal obligation. The conduct or representation of the government has to bear the makings of an identifiable legal commitment towards the specific investor, before we can speak of a breach (or frustration) of legitimate expectations, calling for a remedy or compensation.\n\n4.\n\nSuch a commitment on the part of a government cannot transpire or be captured or condensed our of thin air; from general political statements, pep up talks of encouraging investments, but must bear the makings of real legal assurances and commitments.\n\n5.\n\nThis does not mean that such commitment must necessarily take the form of a formal or an explicit agreement. It can ensue from behaviour or conduct. But such conduct must be sufficiently concrete and specifically directed to the particular investor, to constitute an objective \"representation\" of a legal commitment, that can be objectively seen as generating legitimate expectations. Otherwise, any subjective perception (or self-interpretation) on the part of a potential investor or a favorable declaration or stance of a government, would be sufficient to trigger so called \"legitimate expectations\", that can be used (or rather abused) as a basis of an allegation of a breach of an obligation that does not exist; or as means of circumventing the prior essential condition of responsibility, which is the proof of the obligation whose breach gives rise to that responsibility.\n\n6.\n\n*In casu*, the \"Tax Incentives Scheme\" (EGO 24) does not constitute by itself (i.e. the legislation as such) a legal commitment by the Romanian Government towards the investors to whom it is addressed in general. However, the issue of a \"Permanent Investor Certificate\" (PIC) to an investor under this Scheme, in addition to specifying the other party (the addressee, *le destinataire*), establishes in my view, a synallagmatic or reciprocal relation of exchange of legal considerations - by imposing on the investor certain legal obligations if he invests and takes advantage of the incentives - which bear the makings of legal commitments on both sides.\n\n7.\n\nStill, this does not totally dispose of the matter. It remains to be determined the contents and extent of the commitments of the Romanian Government in this regard. For while the Scheme was adopted for 10 years, terminating in 2009, nowhere does it (or the complementary regulations including the PICS) contain the equivalent of a \"stabilization clause\" guaranteeing the freezing of its contents in terms of tax concessions throughout this period. In other words, all the PIC does it to confer on the investor the right to take advantage of the facilities provided under the Scheme, whatever they may be, at a given moment of time. The content of the Tax Incentives Scheme can change; and this variability of content has been recognized by the beneficiary investors, who did not contest earlier changes, whether in their favour or to their detriment. It can thus legitimately be argued that Romania did not violate any commitment towards PIC holders, as long as the Scheme continued to function until its term, with some incentives included in it; which was indeed the case here, as the \"profits tax exemption\" continued to run until the end of the term of the Scheme in 2009.\n\n8.\n\nIt could equally be legitimately argued that by reducing radically the contents of the Tax Incentives Scheme EGO 24, and more particularly by abolishing the Raw Materials Facility, four years before its term, the synallagmatic relationship of exchange of legal considerations (fastened by the PIC) becomes extremely skewed. Such severe imbalance cannot be without legal consequences including possibly a measure of liability.\n\n**II - Possible remedies including compensation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nSuch a severe imbalance between the exchanged legal considerations -be it in a commutative or synallagmatic formal contractual relationship, which is not the case here - gives place to a claim for the revision or the termination of the contract, on grounds of what is called in certain civil law jurisdictions \"l\u00e9sion\". The claim of revision involves the reduction of the obligations of the other party, to eliminate the substantial disparity between the exchanged considerations. It (or more so the termination of the contract) can be accompanied by a measure of compensation, depending on the reasons that led the first party to reduce its initial legal commitments, and the circumstances surrounding this reduction.\n\n10.\n\n*In casu*, the reduction, and particularly the early termination of the Raw Materials Facility, was motivated by the imperious necessity for Romania to join the European Union, which was an overriding national interest. I realize, however, that the Respondent has not invoked \"necessity\", as a ground for precluding wrongfulness (Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility), as Romania considers that it has acted rationally and reasonably; hence it did not commit a wrongful act at the face of it, that need to be exonerated by invoking necessity. That with which I agree, in the absence of the equivalent of a stabilization clause guaranteeing the freezing of the contents of the Scheme until its term and provided that Romania reduces proportionally the obligations of the PIC holders, to reestablish a semblance of balance between the exchanged considerations (which it claims it did, by not requiring the implementation of these obligations).\n\n11.\n\nThe Award, however, while conceding that Romania acted reasonably, in good faith, and in pursuit of an overriding national interest, does not find this as precluding responsibility for what it considers the frustration of legitimate expectations of the Claimants.\n\n12.\n\nAnother potential source of liability identified in the Award is the slackness of Romania in informing beneficiary investors of the inevitability of early termination of the raw materials facility. At the beginning, none of the major actors - the Romanian Government, the EU Commission, the Claimants - realized the absolute incompatibility of the raw materials facility with the EU law (as a \"hole in the tariff wall\"). This is because of the initially prevailing opinion that it may be covered by the \"Regional Aid\" exception in European law. The incompatibility became increasingly obvious as the negotiations and exchanges advanced. Thus, for a certain span of time starting at some point in 2003 and ending up on 31st August 2004, with the declaration that the raw materials facility would be terminated 90 days later (subsequently extended to February 22, 2005), part of Romanian authorities, particularly the regional ones, continued to reassure investors that the raw materials facility will be safeguarded one way or another; while another part of the Romanian Government, particularly those who were negotiating with the EU Commission (such as Mr. Orban, the Deputy Chief Romanian negotiator at the time, who testified before the Tribunal) became increasingly convinced that there was no way to save the raw materials facility.\n\n13.\n\nSuch situations of two parts of government speaking at cross-purposes, as well as hesitation or wavering, are usual occurrences, particularly in times of rapid (and rather disorderly) change. They can happen in the best of governments. I don't think we can speak here of lack of transparency, as does the Award, which considers it as a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. This is because there was no intent of dissimulation or hiding (and diplomatic negotiations are, by their very nature, confidential). It is rather a case of failure of communication and lack of synchronization and coordination between different parts of government. This leads to slackness in \"due diligence\" (or negligence) on the part of the government, by failing to inform investors as soon as one of its components reached the conclusion that it would not be able to safeguard the raw materials facility to the end of its term, in order to enable them to mitigate at the earliest the detrimental effect of this before-term termination.\n\n14.\n\nThe honest admission of Mr. Orb\u00e1n of the failure of communication within the Government and between the Government and PIC holders, in addition to the declarations of the Prime Minister until early 2005 that the government would try to safeguard what it can of the incentives (which it did to no avail), or convert them into Euro-compatible ones, and to negotiate and possibly compensate investors (which it did not), bear recognition of a measure of responsibility.\n\n15.\n\nThe measure of responsibility ensuing from this slackness or negligence, accompanying the taking of reasonable and lawful measures in the pursuit of legitimate overriding national interests, is limited. It is limited to actual ascertained loss, but does not include *lucrum cessans* according to general international law, in my opinion.\n\n16.\n\nHowever, Counsel for the Respondent considered that compensation as a general rule covers lost profits, though *in casu* those claimed are highly speculative. But the Award undertook a very tight and thorough calculation, dismissing indeed most of the claimed lost profits as speculative, which makes it difficult not to accept the result, particularly in the light of the admission of the principle by Counsel of the Respondent.\n\n17.\n\nIn sum, I concur with the pecuniary outcome of the Award, but on other legal grounds, briefly explained above."}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings effective 1\u00a0January 2003 |\n| BIT | Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden\u00a0and the Government of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated April 1, 2003 |\n| Claimant 1 | Mr. Ioan Micula |\n| Claimant 2 | Mr. Viorel Micula |\n| Claimant 3 | European Food S.A |\n| Claimant 4 | Starmill S.R.L. |\n| Claimant 5 | Multipack S.R.L. |\n| Commission | European Commission |\n| C-PHB | Claimants' Post-Hearing Submission dated May 13, 2011 |\n| C-Reply | Claimants' Reply dated December 22, 2009 |\n| C-SoC | Claimants' Statement of Claim dated March 9, 2007 |\n| EC | European Community |\n| EC Treaty | Treaty Establishing the European Community |\n| ECHR | European Court of Human Rights |\n| ECJ | European Court of Justice |\n| Commission's Written Submission | European Commission's Written Submission dated July 20, 2009 |\n| EFDG or EFDC | European Food and Drinks Group (or European Food and Drinks |\n| EGO | Companies) Emergency Government Ordinance |\n| ER | Expert Report |\n| Exh.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute arises from Romania's introduction and subsequent revocation of certain economic incentives, contained in Emergency Government Ordinance 24/1998 (\"EGO 24\"), for the development of certain disfavored regions of Romania. The Claimants claim that, in reliance on those incentives, and in reliance on the expectation that these incentives would be maintained during a 10-year period, they made substantial investments in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti disfavored region located in Bihor County in northwestern Romania. The Claimants further claim that Romania's premature revocation of these incentives was in breach of its obligations under the Agreement Between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"), which entered into force on 1 April 2003 (Exh. C-1), and caused damages to the Claimants, as described further below.\n\n**B. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThere are five claimants in this case: two individual persons (the \"Individual Claimants\" or \"Messrs. Micula\") and three companies (the \"Corporate Claimants\") owned directly or indirectly by the Individual Claimants.\n\n3.\n\nThe Individual Claimants are:\n\na. **Mr. loan Micula**, who is domiciled at Teatrului Street no. 1-2, Oradea, Bihor County, Romania (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 1\"). Mr. Ioan Micula was born in Romania on 8 April 1957. He moved to Sweden in 1987 where he obtained Swedish nationality in 1992 after having renounced his Romanian nationality.\n\nb. **Mr. Viorel Micula**, who is domiciled at Colinelor Street no. 48, Oradea, Bihor County, Romania (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 2\"). Mr. Viorel Micula is Ioan Micula's twin brother. He left Romania for Sweden in 1989. He obtained Swedish nationality in 1995 after having renounced his Romanian nationality.\n\n4.\n\nThe Corporate Claimants are:\n\na. **European Food S.A.**, with its registered office at 13 Septembrie Street, \u015etei, Bihor County, Romania, registered with the trade register under no. J5/892/1999, registration number 12457015 (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 3\" or \"European Food\"). Claimant 3 specializes in industrial manufacturing of food products.\n\nb. **Starmill S.R.L.**, with its registered office at 41 Dr\u00e4g\u00e4ne\u015fti, Pantasesti Village, Bihor County, Romania, registered with the trade register under no. J5/177/2002, registration number 14467201 (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 4\" or \"Starmill\"). Claimant 4 specializes in the manufacturing of milling products.\n\nc. **Multipack S.R.L.**, with its registered office at 41, Dr\u00e4g\u00e4ne\u015fti, Pantasesti Village, Bihor County, Romania, registered with the trade register under no. J5/178/2002, registration number 14467210 (hereinafter referred to as \"Claimant 5\" or \"Multipack\"). Claimant 5 specializes in the manufacturing of plastic packaging.\n\n5.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 24 September 2008 (the \"Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\"), the Tribunal found that the Individual Claimants and the Corporate Claimants (collectively, the \"Claimants\") are Swedish nationals for the purposes of this arbitration.\n\n6.\n\nMr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Kenneth R. Fleuriet, Reginald R. Smith and Craig S. Miles and Ms. Amy Roebuck Frey of the law firm of King & Spalding, London, Houston and Paris. They were previously represented by Mr. Eric A. Schwartz of the law firm of King & Spalding, as well as by Mr. Gerold Zeiler of the law firm of Sch\u00f6nherr Rechtsanw\u00e4lte OEG, Vienna, in cooperation with Prof. Christoph Schreuer as Of Counsel, of the University of Vienna.\n\n7.\n\nMr. Viorel Micula is represented in this arbitration by Prof. Emmanuel Gaillard, Dr. Yas Banifatemi and Ms. Veronika Korom of the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP, Paris. He was previously represented by Messrs. David Reed and Alex Bevan of Shearman & Sterling LLP, London, Messrs. Eric A. Schwartz and Alain Farhad of the law firm of Dewey & LeBoeuf, Paris, and Messrs. Gheorghe Mu\u015fat and Gelu Titus Maravela and Mrs. Luminita Popa of the law firm Mu\u015fat & Asocia\u0163ii, Bucharest.\n\n**2. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent is Romania (the \"Respondent\" or \"Romania\").\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by H.E. Daniel Chitoiu, Minister of Public Finances and Messrs. Cipriam Badea and Mr. Bogdan Mirghi\u015f, Legal Department of the Ministry of Public Finances; Messrs. D. Brian King, Georgios Petrochilos and Boris Kasolowsky of the law firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, New York, Paris and Frankfurt, and Mmes. Adriana I. Gaspar, Ana Diculescu-Sova and Manuela M. Nestor of the law firm of Nestor Nestor Diculescu Kingston Petersen in Bucharest.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. INITIAL PHASE**\n--------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 2 August 2005, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration dated 28 July 2005 (the \"Request\" or \"RFA\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\"), accompanied by 14 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to C-14).\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 August 2005, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to Romania.\n\n12.\n\nOn 21 September 2005, the Request was supplemented by a statement concerning the entry into force of the BIT with accompanying exhibits C-15 to C-19.\n\n13.\n\nOn 13 October 2005, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request as supplemented, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"). On the same date, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties of the registration of the Request as supplemented and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn 10 January 2006, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Claimants elected to submit the arbitration to a Tribunal constituted of three arbitrators, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day they appointed Prof. Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria. On 7 February 2006, Romania appointed Dr. Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, a national of Germany. The Parties agreed to appoint Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy, a national of Switzerland and Brazil, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 12 September 2006, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Mrs. Martina Polasek, ICSID Counsel, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nOn 10 November 2006, the Tribunal held the first session of the Tribunal in Paris, France. At the outset of the session, the Parties expressed agreement that the Tribunal had been duly constituted (Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had no objections in this respect. It was agreed that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules were the ones that entered into force on 1 January 2003. The remainder of the procedural issues set forth in the agenda of the session were discussed and agreed upon. In particular, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed upon a timetable for the submissions on the merits and reserved provisional hearing dates. It was agreed that if Respondent decided to raise any objections to jurisdiction or admissibility before the filing of its Counter-Memorial, the schedule would be revisited. It was also decided that the language of the proceedings would be English, and that the place of arbitration would be Paris, France. The audio recording of the session was later distributed to the Parties. Minutes of the first session were drafted and signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and sent to the Parties on 20 December 2006.\n\n**B. THE JURISDICTIONAL PHASE**\n-------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe proceedings in respect of the jurisdictional phase are described in detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, which was notified to the Parties on 25 September 2008 and makes integral part of this Award.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's objections on jurisdiction and admissibility and concluded that it had jurisdiction over the claims asserted by the Claimants for breaches of the BIT. Specifically, the dispositive part of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility stated:\n\nFor the reasons set forth above,\n\n\u2022 The objections of Respondent are dismissed.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration and rejects any objections as to the admissibility of the claims.\n\n\u2022 The decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the arbitration on the merits.\n\n(Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 170).\n\n**C. THE MERITS PHASE**\n-----------------------\n\n**1. Initial procedural steps**\n-------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 26 September 2008, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and revert to the Tribunal within six weeks from the date of notification of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility with joint or separate proposals concerning the timetable and other motions and suggestions for the proceedings on the merits.\n\n20.\n\nOn 29 September 2008, Messrs. Zeiler and Schreuer resigned as counsel for Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants effective 26 September 2008. On 30 September 2008, the Tribunal was advised that Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants would be henceforth represented by Messrs. Kenneth R. Fleuriet, Reginald R. Smith and Craig S. Miles of the law firm of King & Spalding, London and Houston.\n\n21.\n\nBy letters of 7 November 2008 (Claimants) and 13 November 2008 (Respondent), the Parties presented their proposals for the timetable on the merits. On the basis of the Parties' agreements and after considering their positions on the points in dispute, on 18 November 2008 the Tribunal fixed the procedural schedule for the merits phase. After further correspondence from the Parties, by letter of 2 December 2008 the Secretary confirmed the procedural schedule for the merits phase.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of 25 March 2009, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on certain time extensions to the time limits set in the Secretary's letter of 2 December 2008. By letter of the Secretary of 27 March 2009, the Tribunal confirmed the time extensions agreed by the Parties and set out the amended procedural schedule as follows:\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial - 6 April 2009\n\nClaimants' Reply (including full case on quantum and any accompanying expert reports) - 20 August 2009\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder (including any expert reports) - 27 November 2009\n\nPre-hearing Conference - 4 January 2010;\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 26 January 2010;\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 5 March 2010;\n\nHearing - 3-7 May 2010;\n\nHearing reserve days - 10-11 May 2010.\n\n23.\n\nOn 2 April 2009, the European Community (\"EC\") requested that it be allowed to file a written submission as a non-disputing party in this arbitration. On 7 April 2009, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file their observations on the EC's request by 7 May 2009.\n\n**2. The written phase on the merits**\n--------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural schedule agreed by the Parties and confirmed in the Secretary's letter of 27 March 2009, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits (\"R-CM\") on 6 April 2009. The Counter-Memorial was accompanied by:\n\na. Expert Report of Professor Rudolf Streinz (\"First ER of R. Streinz\")\n\nb. Exhibits R-59 through R-132\n\nc. Legal authorities RL-177 through RL-273.\n\n25.\n\nOn 7 May 2009, the Parties submitted their observations on the EC's request to file a written submission as a non-disputing party. The Claimants opposed that request. The Respondent submitted that the EC's request was one that could not be reasonably opposed, but in the event that the Claimants opposed that request, it requested the opportunity to provide a fuller response.\n\n26.\n\nAlso on 7 May 2009, Mr. Viorel Micula advised that the law firm of Dewey & LeBoeuf would no longer be representing him, although the firm of Mu\u015fat & Asocia\u0163ii remained as his counsel.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of the Secretary of 15 May 2009, having considered the Parties' positions and the applicable procedural rules, the Tribunal decided that it would allow the participation of the EC as a non-disputing party in the present case. The Tribunal noted that:\n\nIn doing so, the Tribunal is particularly sensitive to the fact that the European Community may bring a factual or legal perspective that could assist the Tribunal in the adjudication of the Parties' rights. In granting leave to the European Community to participate as a non-disputing party, the Arbitral Tribunal is mindful of the need to preserve due process and the good order of the proceeding. In particular, the European Community shall act as *amicus curiae* and not as *amicus actoris vel rei*. In other words, the non-disputing party shall remain a friend of the court and not a friend of either Party.\n\n28.\n\nIn light of this, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and agree on a procedure for the participation of the EC as a non-disputing party on or before 22 May 2009, and provided certain guidelines for that procedure. It also requested the Parties' comments on a draft letter to the EC by the same date.\n\n29.\n\nOn 18 May 2009, Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants submitted a request for a site visit pursuant to Article 43(b) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 37 of the 2003 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n30.\n\nOn 22 May 2009, all Parties submitted their observations on the Tribunal's draft letter to the EC concerning its *amicus* participation and the proposed procedure for such participation. Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants also expressed a concern at certain communications that had taken place between the Respondent and the EC, and requested an instruction from the Tribunal that Romania, its counsel and its expert refrain from any further communications with the EC about this case until after the hearing and the closure of the proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nOn 25 May 2009, the Respondent opposed Mr. Ioan Micula's and the Corporate Claimants' request for a site visit. It also argued that this request was being used to present an entirely new case on damages, which was impermissible at that stage of the proceedings.\n\n32.\n\nAlso on 25 May 2009, Dr. Claus-Dieter Ehlermann submitted his resignation as an arbitrator to the other members of the Tribunal and to the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID and indicated his grounds of personal nature for such resignation. On 26 May 2009, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 8(2), the Tribunal consented to Dr. Ehlermann's resignation and on that day notified the Acting Secretary-General of its decision. On that same day, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(1) and (2) and on behalf of the Acting Secretary-General, the Secretary notified the Parties of Dr. Ehlermann's resignation and the Tribunal's consent thereto, and of the resulting vacancy on the Tribunal. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 11(1), the Respondent was invited to promptly appoint an arbitrator to fill that vacancy. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(2), the arbitration proceedings were suspended until the vacancy created by Dr. Ehlermann's resignation had been filled. The Parties were also invited to inform the Tribunal, as soon as the vacancy had been filled, whether they would agree to maintain the existing procedural timetable.\n\n33.\n\nOn 4 June 2009, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that it was in the process of identifying a new arbitrator and that it was committed to attempting to preserve the current procedural schedule. Given that the question of the modalities of the EC's participation as an *amicus curiae* was still pending before the Tribunal and would likely impact the procedural schedule, the Respondent invited the Claimants to agree, and the Tribunal to approve, that\n\n(a) the stay on the proceedings be lifted insofar as the Tribunal's decision on the modalities of the European Community's participation as *amicus curiae* is concerned;\n\n(b) the Tribunal render that decision in its present, provisionally truncated formation, by consent of the parties.\n\n34.\n\nAt the invitation of the Tribunal, on 16 June 2009 Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants agreed with the Respondent's proposal that the Tribunal should proceed to rule on the modality of the EC's participation as an *amicus curiae*, notwithstanding the stay of the proceedings. The Claimants noted that they were not in a position to communicate their views as to the impact of the stay on the procedural timetable, but would do so once the Tribunal's vacancy was filled.\n\n35.\n\nOn 19 June 2009, Mr. Viorel Micula advised that he had retained as new counsel Messrs. David Reed, Alex Bevan and Emmanuel Gaillard of the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP, London and Paris, and accepted the Respondent's request for a partial lift of the stay of the proceedings.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of the Secretary of 25 June 2009, the Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement to partially lift the stay of the proceedings concerning the modalities of the EC's *amicus curiae* participation and issued its decision on those modalities, as set forth below. On that same day, the Tribunal informed the EC that it would be allowed to participate as a non-disputing party in this arbitration, specifying that the purpose of such participation would be to assist the Tribunal in its adjudicatory work. The Tribunal set forth the following procedure for the EC's participation:\n\n1. The European Community shall file a written submission on or before July 20, 2009. It shall send an electronic copy of the submission by e-mail to the Secretary of the Tribunal at mpolasek@worldbank.org and 15 (fifteen) hard copies of the submission by courier to the Secretary at ICSID, for transmission to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n2. The European Community's written submission shall not respond or comment upon the Parties' prayers for relief, but shall be focused on assisting the Tribunal in the determination of factual or legal issues at stake in the present dispute. It is expected that the scope of the Community's input will be limited to facts within its own knowledge and to European law rather than to any other facts or legal matters at issue in this arbitration. The Community may within this scope decide which facts and laws are relevant to the dispute.\n\n3. The European Community's written submission shall be limited in length (40 pages) and written in English.\n\n4. The European Community may file any relevant exhibits with its written submission within the scope described under paragraph 2 above. Any exhibit for which the original language is not English shall be submitted in the original language accompanied by a translation into English. If the document is lengthy and relevant only in part, it is sufficient if only the relevant parts, which must be precisely specified, are translated.\n\n5. The Tribunal may request the European Community to produce any document or evidentiary material that the Tribunal deems useful for the resolution of this dispute, or which has been requested by either Party.\n\n6. The European Community shall have access to the Parties' pleadings in their entirety as existing at this juncture, except for materials that have been designated as commercially confidential or legally privileged. Should a disagreement arise as to whether such materials have been so designated, the Tribunal will resolve such disagreement. The Secretary of the Tribunal will transmit electronic copies of the materials to the European Community at the latest by July 6, 2009.\n\n7. Any person who has participated in the elaboration of the European Community's written submission may be called to provide clarifications on that submission at the hearing, as may be required by the Tribunal of its own initiative or at the request of the Parties. Such clarifications will be given in the form directed by the Tribunal and under its control.\n\n8. The European Community will bear its own costs incurred in connection with its participation in the proceeding, including any costs relating to any appearance by the Community's representative(s) for examination at the hearing.\n\n9. The European Community shall indicate whether it had any direct contact with either Party to this arbitration concerning the subject matter of this arbitration and should as far as possible avoid any future contact in this respect.\n\n37.\n\nIn its letter to the Parties of 25 June 2009, the Tribunal also invited the Parties to comment on the Commission's Written Submission within two months from the date of receipt of that submission.\n\n38.\n\nOn 7 July 2009, the Secretary sent the EC two CD-ROMs containing the Parties' pleadings on the merits, including supporting documents, filed as of that date.\n\n39.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, in accordance with Articles 56(1) and 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 11(1) and (3), the Respondent appointed as its arbitrator Professor Georges Abi-Saab, a national of the Arab Republic of Egypt. The Respondent also agreed to maintain the current procedural timetable.\n\n40.\n\nOn 20 July 2009, the EC submitted its written submission as a non-disputing party, including 10 exhibits.\n\n41.\n\nOn 22 July 2009, the Secretary informed the Parties that the Tribunal had been reconstituted and the proceedings resumed. On 24 July 2009, the Tribunal proposed to the Parties that, subject to their reasoned objection by 7 August 2009, the acts accomplished by the Tribunal regarding the modalities of the EC's participation as a non-disputing party while the suspension of the proceeding was partially lifted were validated. In that same letter, the Tribunal also invited the Parties to state their views on the procedural timetable in consideration of the suspension of the proceedings.\n\n42.\n\nBy letters of 30 and 31 July 2009, all Claimants agreed to the validation of the acts taken by the Tribunal during the suspension of the proceedings with respect to the EC's *amicus curiae* submission and submitted their views on the procedural timetable. Specifically, the Claimants stated that they would require an extension of the time limits set out in the procedural timetable as a result of the suspension of the proceedings. On 7 August 2009, the Respondent submitted its comments on the new procedural timetable suggested by the Claimants.\n\n43.\n\nOn 7 September 2009 the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached an agreement on the procedural timetable. By letter of 14 September 2009, the Tribunal confirmed the procedural timetable agreed by the Parties, as follows:\n\nParties' responses to EC amicus brief - 16 November 2009\n\nClaimants' Reply - 14 December 2009\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder - 12 April 2010\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 10 June 2010\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 19 July 2010\n\n44.\n\nAfter consultation between the Parties and the Tribunal, on 19 October 2009 the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on the merits would take place between 8 and 19 November 2010, excluding the weekend.\n\n45.\n\nOn 16 November 2009, the Parties submitted their comments to the EC's *amicus curiae* submission. In addition, the Claimants expressed their concern that there may have been improper contact between the EC and the Respondent or its counsel, in violation of the Tribunal's instructions of 25 June 2009, and requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to produce copies of all records of communications between the Respondent or any of the Respondent's legal counsel and the EC since 1 January 2009 related to the subject matter of this arbitration.\n\n46.\n\nOn 23 November 2009, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide its comments to the Claimants' request for production of documents by 11 December 2009. This deadline was subsequently extended by agreement of the Parties to 16 December 2009.\n\n47.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, counsel for Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants informed the Tribunal that all Parties had agreed to extend the deadlines for their upcoming briefs. On 14 December 2009, the Secretary confirmed the amended procedural timetable as follows:\n\nRespondent's Reply to the Claimants' request for production of documents - 16 December 2009\n\nClaimants' Reply - 22 December 2009\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder - 28 April 2010\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 25 June 2010\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 4 August 2010\n\nHearing on the Merits - 8-19 November 2010\n\n48.\n\nOn 16 December 2009, the Respondent submitted its objections to the Claimants' request for the production of communications between the EC and the Respondent or its counsel.\n\n49.\n\nOn 22 December 2009, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits (\"C-Reply\"), which was accompanied by the following evidence:\n\na. Third Witness Statement of Mr. Ioan Micula (\"Third WS of I. Micula\")\n\nb. Third Witness Statement of Mr. VioreI Micula (\"Third WS of V. Micula)\n\nc.

Expert Report of Dr. James Fry (LMC) (\"First ER of J. Fry\")\n\np. Boston Consulting Group Report, originally filed as Exh. C-655 (\"First ER of BCG\")\n\nq. Claimants' Exhibits and Legal Authorities 271 to 675\n\n50.\n\nBy means of Procedural Order dated 8 January 2010, the Tribunal rejected the Claimants' request for the production of correspondence between the EC and the Respondent or its counsel. Specifically, the Tribunal found:\n\n6. That after deliberating on the arguments advanced by the Parties, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the documents requested by the Claimants are necessary or useful for the determination of the outcome of the dispute in this arbitration;\n\n7. That even if, for the sake of argument, the Tribunal were to accept the Claimants' allegations and find that the European Community cooperated with the Respondent in preparing its Submission, which the Respondent denies, such finding would not affect the Tribunal's conclusion that the requested documents lack relevance;\n\n8. That to the extent that the requested documents might be relevant for the purposes of establishing the objectivity of the arguments advanced by the non-disputing party in its Submission and the weight to be given to them by the Tribunal, this matter has already been adequately addressed in the Tribunal's letter of 25 June 2009, which, if necessary, provides the Claimants with the opportunity to examine at the hearing any person who has participated in the preparation of the Submission.\n\n51.\n\nOn 14 January 2010, the Claimants advised that they had found inadvertent errors and omissions in their Reply submission, and submitted corrected versions of their Reply Memorial, three witness statements and 29 exhibits, together with an errata sheet.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter of 5 February 2010, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that, in accordance with its obligations under the Treaty of Lisbon, it proposed to make available to the EC the Claimants' Reply and its annexes. The Respondent alleged that the Claimants' Reply represented a fundamentally new case, and that, as an EU Member State, it is obliged under the Treaty of Lisbon to notify the EU of any pending international litigation threatening to jeopardize a state's EU law obligations. By letters of 9 February 2010, the Claimants objected to the proposed disclosure, alleging, *inter alia*, that the *amicus curiae* phase of the arbitration had been concluded, that the Reply did not present a fundamentally new case, that such disclosure would violate the Tribunal's order of 25 June 2009, and that the Reply contained material that was commercially confidential to the Claimants.\n\n53.\n\nConsidering that the Respondent's proposed disclosure could raise issues of confidentiality and privilege, on 10 February 2011 the Tribunal invited the Parties to make brief submissions addressing (i) the content and scope of Respondent's legal obligation under the Treaty of Lisbon to notify the EU of any pending international litigation threatening to jeopardize a state's EU law obligations; (ii) whether the disclosure would possibly aggravate the dispute and/or adversely affect the conduct of the proceedings, and (iii) whether the disclosure would violate the Claimants' rights to confidentiality and/or privilege. The Parties filed their submissions on 19 February 2010. An additional submission was made by Mr. Viorel Micula on 22 February 2010.\n\n54.\n\nBy means of a Procedural Order issued on 3 March 2010 and pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39, the Tribunal recommended that the Respondent refrain from providing the EC with the full text of the Claimants' Reply and its exhibits, inviting it instead to provide the EC with the text of the Claimants' amended request for relief, as set forth in the Reply. In making its decision, the Tribunal took into consideration the role of the EC as an *amicus curiae*, the fact that the Claimants had withdrawn a claim and amended their prayers for relief, and issues of confidentiality, privilege, and possible aggravation of the dispute.\n\n55.\n\nOn 8 April 2010, following the Tribunal's recommendation, the Respondent notified the EC that the Claimants had withdrawn their request for restitution of the legal framework in force at the time of approval of EGO 24/1998.\n\n56.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the Respondent requested an extension of its time limit to file its Rejoinder on the merits, alleging, inter alia, that the Claimants' Reply was incomplete. On 25 March 2010, the Claimants objected to that request. After further correspondence among the Parties and a proposal from the Tribunal, the Parties and the Tribunal finally agreed on the following procedural calendar, as confirmed by the Secretary's letter of 12 April 2010:\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder - 11 June 2010\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 30 July 2010\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Expert Reports on Quantum - 10 September 2010\n\nHearing on the Merits and Quantum - 8-19 November 2010\n\n57.\n\nOn 9 April 2010, the Respondent made an application for production of documents. The Claimants objected to that request by letters of 19 and 26 April 2010. After further comments from the Parties (Respondent's letter of 27 April 2010 and Claimants' submissions of 29 April and 10 May 2010), on 27 May 2010 the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order ruling on the Respondent's request. The Parties further agreed on the timing for the Parties' comments on the documents produced (Respondent's letter of 3 June 2010). The Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement by letter of 7 June 2010 and invited the Parties to report on the production progress (which they did through the Claimants' letter of 10 June 2010).\n\n58.\n\nOn 13 April 2010, Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants renewed their request for a site visit. The Respondent objected to that request on 22 April 2010, and the Claimants submitted further comments on 26 and 28 April 2010. On 5 May 2010, having considered the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal concluded that a site visit would not enlighten the Tribunal at that stage in the proceedings, as any information gleaned from such visit would be either irrelevant for the resolution of the dispute or unnecessary given that the record supplied sufficient evidence, at least at that juncture. However, the Tribunal invited the Parties to renew the application for a site visit after the hearing on the merits if they continued to wish for one.\n\n59.\n\nOn 28 May 2010, Mr. Viorel Micula advised that Mu\u015fat & Asociatii no longer represented him as counsel.\n\n60.\n\nOn 11 June 2010, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder (\"R-Rejoinder\"), which was accompanied by the following evidence:\n\na. Expert Report of Professor Flavius Baias (\"ER of F. Baias\")\n\nb. Expert Report of Sir Francis Jacobs (\"ER of F. Jacobs\")\n\nc. Expert Report of Mr. Asger Petersen (\"ER of A. Petersen\")\n\nd. Rebuttal Expert Report of Professor Dr. Rudolf Streinz (\"Second ER of R. Streinz\")\n\ne. Expert Report of Agra CEAS Consulting, Mr. Conrad Caspari, in conjunction with F.O. Licht (\"ER of C. Caspari\")\n\nf. Expert Report of KPMG, Mr. John Ellison (\"First ER of J. Ellison\")1\n\ng. Expert Report of Dr. Bill Robinson (\"First ER of B. Robinson\")\n\nh. Witness Statements of Mr. Leonard Orban (\"WS of L. Orban\")\n\ni. Witness Statement of Professor Mihai Berinde (\"WS of M. Berinde\")\n\nj. Documentary evidence (Exhibits R-134 through R-203)\n\nk. Legal authorities (Exhibits RL-284 through RL-336).\n\nMr. Ellison also submitted an expert report during the jurisdictional phase that is not referred to in this Award.\n\n61.\n\nOn 22 July 2010, the Respondent submitted its comments on the documents produced by the Claimants in response to the Procedural Order of 27 May 2010. The Claimants submitted their comments on 3 September 2010. In the interim, the Parties further corresponded on the production of specific documents.\n\n62.\n\nOn 21 July 2011, Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants requested permission to submit four additional witness statements that would be relied upon by the Claimants' damages experts in their rebuttal expert reports due on 30 July 2010. On 22 July 2010, the Respondent objected to that request. The Parties submitted further comments (Claimants' letters of 23 and 26 July 2010 and Respondent's letter of 26 July 2010). After considering the Parties' submissions and in the exercise of the discretion granted to it under paragraphs 14(II)(c) and (e) of the Minutes of the First Session, by letter of 28 July 2010 the Tribunal granted the Claimants permission to submit, by 30 July 2010, new witness statements from the following persons: Messrs. Juan Gamecho, Mircea Halbac, Sorin Baciu and Cristian Balog. The Tribunal specified that these witness statements should be strictly limited to factual allegations that will be relied upon by the Claimants' damages experts in their rebuttal expert reports, and that the Claimants should make these witnesses available for crossexamination at the hearing.\n\n63.\n\nOn 30 July 2010 (by separate letters sent by counsel to Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants, on one hand, and counsel to Mr. Viorel Micula, on the other), the Claimants submitted the following rebuttal expert reports on quantum and additional witness statements:\n\na. Expert Reply Report of Professor Donald R. Lessard (\"Second ER of D. Lessard\")\n\nb. Expert Reply Report of Professor Jean-Benedict Steenkamp (\"Second ER of J. Steenkamp\")\n\nc. Expert Opinion of Professor Georghe Piperea (\"ER of G. Piperea\")\n\nd. Rebuttal Expert Report of Dr. James Fry of LMC International (\"Second ER of J. Fry\")\n\ne. Expert Report of Mr. Richard Boulton of LECG (\"ER of R. Boulton\")\n\nf. Rebuttal Expert Report of BCG (\"Second ER of BCG\")\n\ng. Witness Statement of Mr. Juan Gamecho (\"WS of J. Gamecho\")\n\nh. Second Witness Statement of Mr. Mircea Halbac (\"Second WS of M. Halbac\")\n\ni. Second Witness Statement of Mr. Sorin Baciu (\"Second WS of S. Baciu\")\n\nj. Second Witness Statement of Mr. Christian Balog (\"Second WS of C. Balog\")\n\nk. Exhibits and Legal Authorities C-680 to C-1034\n\n64.\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the Claimants submitted the rebuttal expert report of Mr. Chris Osborne of FTI Consulting.\n\n65.\n\nIn their letter of 30 July 2010, Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants also noted that the Claimants continued to suffer from acts of the Romanian state, including the initiation of forced execution proceedings against companies of the EFDG, that directly threatened their ability to continue their business activities and reserved their right to request interim relief from the Tribunal. The Claimants also objected to Section VI.G of the Respondent's Rejoinder, entitled \"Any Compensation Must Be Reduced by the Value of Benefits Received as a Result of Romania's EU Accession.\" The Claimants argued that this defense constituted a new legal theory that had been raised in the Respondent's Counter-Memorial and was thus untimely. In the event that the Tribunal was minded to accept it, the Claimants alleged that it should be rejected on the substantive grounds described in their letter.\n\n66.\n\nBy letter of 10 August 2010, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to (i) strike certain new evidence (specifically, certain expert reports or relevant parts of them, and new factual exhibits) filed by the Claimants with their rebuttal expert reports submitted on 30 July 2010 and 2 August 2010, as well as certain new legal submissions and allegations made by the Claimants in their letters accompanying such reports; (ii) grant it a four week extension to submit its rebuttal expert reports on quantum; and (iii) grant it the opportunity to comment on the Claimants' new evidence and allegations, to the extent that they are not stricken and, if necessary, to adduce responsive evidence. At the Tribunal's invitation, all Claimants commented on these requests by letters of 19 August 2010. The Respondent submitted further comments on 24 August 2010.\n\n67.\n\nBy means of a Procedural Order issued on 24 August 2010 and in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 34, the Tribunal declined to strike any evidence filed by the Parties at this stage of the proceeding, stating that it would decide in due time what weight to give to any such evidence. The Tribunal also granted the Respondent a two-week extension (until 24 September 2010) to submit rebuttal expert reports on quantum, and invited the Respondent to produce in advance of the new time limit whatever written evidence they were able to produce without disruption of their work. The Tribunal also ruled that, if the Respondent wished to present new witness statements, it should file a formal application pursuant to Paragraph 14(II)(c) and (e) of the Minutes of the First Session. The scope of any such witness statements would in any event be strictly limited to the factual allegations relied upon by the Respondent's damages experts in their rebuttal expert reports. Finally, the Tribunal ruled that the Respondent should respond to the new documents submitted by the Claimants together with its rebuttal expert reports on damages.\n\n68.\n\nBy letter of 14 September 2010, the Tribunal asked the Parties if they would be agreeable to the appointment of Ms. Sabina Sacco of the law firm of L\u00e9vy Kaufmann-Kohler as Assistant to the Tribunal, which the Parties accepted.\n\n69.\n\nOn 24 September 2010, the Respondent submitted its Observations on Claimants' Additional Evidence, together with the following evidence and rebuttal expert reports:\n\na. Factual Exhibits R-210 through R-229\n\nb. Legal Authorities RLA-337 through 346\n\nc. Reply Expert Report of Mr. Conrad Caspari (\"Second ER of C. Caspari\")\n\nd. Reply Expert Report of Mr. John Ellison (\"Second ER of J. Ellison\")\n\ne. Reply Expert Report of Dr. Bill Robinson (\"Second ER of B. Robinson\")\n\n**3. Procedural steps predating the hearing on the merits**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nOn 30 September 2010, the President of the Tribunal and the Parties held a prehearing telephone conference to discuss all outstanding matters with respect to the organization of the hearing on the merits and quantum. During that telephone conference, the Parties reached an agreement with respect to certain issues, but maintained disagreement on others (in particular the sequestration of the Messrs. Micula and the modality for the examination of certain witnesses and experts). In addition, the Respondent requested clarification from the Claimants with respect to their quantum case.\n\n71.\n\nOn 8 October 2011, all Parties identified the witnesses and experts they would call for cross-examination at the hearing and provided further comments on outstanding issues with respect to the hearing. After further correspondence from the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on these issues by means of a Procedural Order of 13 October 2010.\n\n72.\n\nBy letters of 15 October 2010, the Parties submitted proposed hearing schedules and discussed the need for oral closing submissions. The Claimants also requested that the Tribunal, of its own initiative, call Professor David Caron, Claimants' international law expert, to appear at the hearing for examination despite the fact that the Respondent did not call him for cross-examination. The Respondent provided further comments on 20 October 2010. The Tribunal ruled on these issues by letter of 22 October 2010. By letter of 28 October 2010, the Respondent expressed concerns with respect to the time allocation during the hearing and reserved its rights. On 1 November 2010, the Tribunal clarified that the ruling of 22 October 2010 contained a clerical error, and issued a corrected time allocation.\n\n73.\n\nOn 5 October 2010, the Secretary invited the representatives of the EC who had drafted the EC's *amicus* brief to provide clarifications on that submission at the hearing. On 13 October 2010, the relevant EC representatives confirmed they would attend the hearing. On 15 October 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties of the EC representatives' attendance and invited the Parties to confer in view of reaching an agreement with respect to the timing, scope and form of the EC's testimony. The Parties provided their comments on 22 and 25 October 2010. On 27 October 2010 the Tribunal issued directions with respect to the EC's participation at the hearing, which were communicated to the EC on 28 October 2010. On 3 November 2010, the Claimants [Viorel Micula] advised the Tribunal that due process required that the EC be treated as a hostile witness vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants, and required more time for their cross-examination. After hearing the Respondent's position, the Tribunal ruled on this matter during the hearing.\n\n74.\n\nBy letter of 1 November 2010, the Claimants alleged that Romanian tax enforcement officials had seized significant assets of the EFDG necessary for the continuation of the Claimants' business (in particular, production equipment and machinery) and were threatening to commence the forced sale of these assets as early as 8 November 2010. The Claimants advised that they would shortly file an application for provisional measures and for a temporary \"standstill\" order, and requested that their applications be heard during the first day of the hearing. After an invitation from the Tribunal, on 3 November 2010 the Respondent submitted preliminary comments on the Claimants' letter, to which the Claimants responded on the same date.\n\n75.\n\nOn 3 November 2010, the Claimants submitted an Application for Provisional Measures (\"Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures\") pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39, together with a request for an emergency temporary order.\n\n76.\n\nOn 5 November 2010, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimants' request for an emergency temporary order, requesting that it should be dismissed for the reasons stated in that submission. In that same letter, the Respondent proposed that the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures be addressed following, rather than during, the evidentiary hearing, preferably in December 2010, noting that there was no need to disrupt the hearing due to the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n77.\n\nOn 5 November 2010, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order in which it (i) denied the Claimants' request for an emergency temporary order, without prejudice to the Tribunal's authority to issue a different determination at a later stage in the proceedings if the circumstances should change; (ii) determined that it would address the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures after the hearing on the merits; and (iii) gave instructions with respect to briefing by the Parties.\n\n**4. The hearing on the merits and quantum**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nFrom 8 to 19 November 2010, the Tribunal and the Parties held a hearing on the merits and quantum in Paris, France. During the course of the hearing, the Parties made oral arguments regarding their merits and quantum cases, had the opportunity to examine the witnesses and experts that had been called to testify, and addressed several evidentiary and procedural issues. The EC representatives invited by the Tribunal provided clarifications to their written submission and answered the Parties' questions. The Tribunal was addressed by Messrs. Eric A. Schwartz, Reginald R. Smith and Kenneth R. Fleuriet and Ms. Amy R. Frey on behalf of Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants; by Messrs. Emmanuel Galliard and David Reed on behalf of Mr. Viorel Micula, and by Messrs. D.

An audio recording was made in English and Romanian and also distributed among the Parties.\n\n**5. Procedural matters following the hearing**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nBy the end of the hearing, the following evidentiary and procedural issues remained outstanding: (i) the Claimants requested that Mr. Mihai Berinde, who had to leave the hearing early, be made available for cross-examination at a later date, whether in person or via videoconference; (ii) the Claimants confirmed that their (or rather Mr. Ioan Micula's) application for a site visit was still in place; (iii) the form and time of the Parties' closing arguments remained outstanding, and (iv) the Respondent requested that the Claimants reformulate their request for relief in such a way that it identified each breach alleged and the specific relief requested on the basis of such breaches.\n\n83.\n\nOn 25 November 2010, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order ruling on the evidentiary and procedural matters that remained outstanding. Specifically, the Tribunal (i) decided that Mr. Berinde would not be called for oral examination, but specified that this would not prevent the Parties or the Tribunal from relying on Mr. Berinde's written testimony (and that the same would apply to the other called witnesses/experts that the Parties did not cross-examine at the hearing); (ii) gave instructions on further briefing with respect to the Claimants' application for a site visit; (iii) determined that the Parties should present oral closing arguments and gave instructions for a future hearing in that respect, but also invited the Parties to submit voluntary post-hearing briefs; and (iv) gave directions to the Claimants with respect to the submission of their amended request for relief. The Tribunal also gave further instructions to the Parties with respect to the review of the hearing transcript and audio tapes, and with respect to the Parties' briefs on provisional measures.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the more relevant procedural matters separately below.\n\n**a. The Claimants' Applications for Provisional Measures and the Respondent's Application for Revocation of Provisional Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nAs noted in para. 75 above, on 3 November 2010 the Claimants submitted an Application for Provisional Measures, as well as a request for an emergency temporary order. Specifically, the Claimants requested (Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 43):\n\na. \"an Order preserving the *status quo ante* by instructing Respondent to withdraw or otherwise cease and desist from enforcing the abovedescribed seizure orders, or from implementing any new such orders against any of the EFDG companies, prior to the Tribunal's issuance of its final award (and that the award itself deal with the matter as appropriate at that time, such as by maintaining the Order in place until Romania has satisfied the terms of the award in full); and\n\nb. an Order that Respondent refrain from taking any other measure against any of the EFDG companies that would aggravate or extend the existing dispute prior to the Tribunal's issuance of its final award.\"\n\n86.\n\nBy Procedural Orders of 5 and 25 November 2010, the Tribunal gave instructions with respect to briefing by the Parties. In accordance with these instructions, on 30 November 2010, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures. After further correspondence from the Parties and leave from the Tribunal, on 20 December 2010 the Claimants submitted a reply in support of their Application for Provisional Measures, and the Respondent submitted a rejoinder on 17 January 2011. At the invitation of the Tribunal, the Parties submitted further comments on 9 February 2011.\n\n87.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, the Tribunal issued a Decision on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Decision on Provisional Measures\"). In that Decision, the Tribunal recommended that the Respondent \"inform the Claimants, with a copy to the Tribunal, if it intends to proceed with the seal or forced sale of the seized assets or take any other tax collection measure that could have a similar effect, two months prior to the date in which it intends to implement such seal, sale or other measure, until this arbitration is completed or until reconsideration of this Decision.\" The Tribunal denied at that stage the remaining requests for provisional measures brought by the Claimants, and invited either Party to apply to the Tribunal for a reconsideration of the Decision if it should consider that the circumstances under which the Decision was made had changed (Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 98).\n\n88.\n\nOn 4 March 2011, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Romanian government had garnished Starmill's bank accounts to satisfy the payment of overdue taxes and associated penalties, in violation of \"the spirit, if not the letter, of the Tribunal's Decision [on Provisional Measures]\" (Claimants' letter of 4 March 2011, p. 1, or \"Claimants' Second Application for Provisional Measures\"). The Claimants requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to (i) lift the current garnishment of Starmill's accounts; (ii) replenish those accounts with any funds that have been transferred to the Government's accounts; (iii) refrain from garnishing the bank accounts of any of Claimants' companies in relation to the taxes and penalties covered by the Decision on Provisional Measures unless it provides the two months' advance notice required by the Decision, and (iv) clarify its position on the impending sale of Starmill's (and the other companies') seized physical assets (Second Application, pp. 3-4). By letter of 7 March 2011, the Tribunal stated that it understood this letter to be a new request for provisional measures, and invited the Respondent to comment.\n\n89.\n\nBy letter of 11 March 2011, the Respondent submitted its comments to the Claimants' letter of 4 March 2011, noting that it also considered the letter to be a new application for provisional measures and requesting that Claimants' request be denied with a full award of costs. The Claimants replied by letter of 17 March 2011, reiterating their first three requests for relief but denying that the 4 March letter constituted a new request for provisional measures. The Parties exchanged further correspondence setting out their positions (Respondent's letters of 23 and 31 March 2011, and Claimants' letters of 28 March and 13 and 22 April 2011).\n\n90.\n\nOn 27 May 2011, the Tribunal issued a Supplemental Decision on Provisional Measures (the \"Supplemental Decision on Provisional Measures\") in which it confirmed its Decision on Provisional Measures, with certain amendments. Specifically, the Tribunal recommended that the Respondent inform the Claimants, with a copy to the Tribunal, if it intended to proceed with the seal or forced sale of the seized assets or take any other tax collection measure (including garnishments of bank accounts) that could have a similar effect, two months prior to the date in which it intends to implement such seal, sale or other measure, until this arbitration is completed or until reconsideration of the Supplemental Decision. The Tribunal also recommended that the Parties seek to reach an agreement on a mutually acceptable security or assurance to be provided by the Claimants and that, conditioned upon that agreement, the Respondent should lift the current garnishments over Starmill's accounts. The Tribunal denied the Claimants' request that the garnished accounts be replenished. Once again, the Tribunal invited either Party to apply to the Tribunal for a reconsideration of this Decision if it should consider that the circumstances under which this Decision was made changed (Supplemental Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 80).\n\n91.\n\nOn 5 July 2011, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of further enforcement actions taken by the Respondent with respect to the Claimants' assets, and requested the Tribunal to confirm that the Supplemental Decision on Provisional Measures covered all assets of the EFDG companies seized by the Respondent at any time until the completion of the arbitration. In a letter of 12 July 2011, the Respondent agreed with the Claimants' interpretation. By letter of 22 July 2011, the Tribunal confirmed that the parties' interpretation concerning the scope of the Supplemental Decision was correct.\n\n92.\n\nOn 13 September 2011, the Respondent notified the Tribunal and the Claimants that it intended to take enforcement measures with respect to three EFDG companies: European Food, European Drinks S.A. (\"European Drinks\") and Transilvania General Import Export SRL (\"TGIE\"). The enforcement measures consisted of the seizure of further movable and immovable property of the three companies and the garnishment of their bank accounts for approximately EUR 55 million. The Respondent advised that the seized property would remain in the companies' control, to be used in their business. The Respondent attached the notices in respect of the enforcement measures to each of the three EFDG companies (\"Garnishment Notices\").\n\n93.\n\nOn 12 October 2011, the Respondent notified the Tribunal and the Claimants that, pursuant to Romanian tax law, two EFDG companies had been denied renewal of certain authorisations which enabled the companies to postpone the payment of customs and excise duties for goods imported into or manufactured in the EU if the goods were stored in \"fiscal warehouses\". The Respondent did not consider that the decisions to repeal and deny renewal of the authorisations were within the scope of the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal, but advised that it would voluntarily refrain from giving effect to the decisions until two months from the date of their communication.\n\n94.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, the Claimants submitted an Emergency Supplement to their Application for Provisional Measures (\"Claimants' Third Application\"), seeking the following emergency interim relief:\n\na. \"preventing the Respondent from proceeding with the garnishments of the bank accounts of European Food, European Drinks and TGIE as set out in the [Garnishment] Notices;\n\nb. ordering the Respondent to refrain from garnishing the accounts of any other EFDC company until the Tribunal issues its Final Award (collectively, the \u2018Garnishment Application'); and\n\nc. ordering the Respondent to refrain from repealing the fiscal warehouse authorizations of European Food and Scandic Distilleries until the Parties have fully briefed that issue and the Tribunal issues a decision with respect to it (\u2018Fiscal Warehouse Application').\n\nd. Insofar as any further briefing may be required on any of these issues or the Tribunal is not able to take up this application immediately, the Claimants further request that the Tribunal issue a temporary emergency order instructing the Respondent to refrain from the acts cited in the preceding paragraph until such time as the Tribunal is able rule upon this application.\"\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants clarified that they \"do not in this application request an order preventing the seizure orders as announced in the [Garnishment] Notices over additional assets up to an aggregate value of \u20ac55 million, provided that Romania continues to abide by the existing orders of the Tribunal regarding the seal and forced sale of those assets\" (Claimants' Third Application, \u00b6 25). The Claimants' Third Application was divided into two applications with separate briefing schedules: the Garnishment Application and the Fiscal Warehouse Application.\n\n96.\n\nOn 1 November 2011, the Claimants supplemented their Fiscal Warehouse Application, requesting the Tribunal to order the Respondent to refrain from repealing the fiscal warehouse authorizations until the final award.\n\n97.\n\nThe Parties and the Tribunal exchanged correspondence with respect to the briefing schedule and the timing of the enforcement measures. At the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent represented that the garnishments would not take effect before 25 November 2011, and that the decision regarding fiscal warehouse authorizations would not take effect before 12 December 2011 (Respondent's letter of 20 October 2011).\n\n98.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, in accordance with the agreed briefing schedule, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Claimants' Garnishment Application. On 16 November 2011, the Claimants wrote to rebut certain allegations made by the Respondent with respect to the Garnishment Application, and offered to produce the documentation supporting these allegations at the Tribunal's request. On 18 November 2011, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to produce such supporting documentation and also invited the Respondent to submit any documentation it deemed relevant. The Claimants produced the requested documentation to the Tribunal on 21 November 2011.\n\n99.\n\nOn 22 November 2011, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimants' letter of 16 November 2011, requesting the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants' Garnishment Application.\n\n100.\n\nOn 23 November 2011, the Tribunal issued the following temporary order concerning the Claimants' Garnishment Application (the \"Temporary Order on Garnishment\"):\n\n5.1. The Claimants' request for a temporary emergency order is granted, until the Tribunal is able to issue its final recommendation with respect to the Claimants' Third Application in its entirety. Specifically, until the Tribunal is able to hand down its final recommendation,\n\n(i) the Respondent shall refrain from proceeding with the garnishments of the bank accounts of European Food, European Drinks and TGIE;\n\n(ii) the Respondent shall refrain from garnishing the accounts of any other EFDC company.\n\n101.\n\nFollowing a further exchange of correspondence (Respondent's letters of 29 and 30 November and 8 December 2011, and Claimants' letter of 5 December 2011) on the Garnishment and Fiscal Warehouse Applications, on 16 December 2011 the Tribunal issued a Third Decision on Provisional Measures (\"Third Decision\"). The Tribunal made the following recommendations (Third Decision, \u00b6 109):\n\na. \"The Respondent shall refrain from proceeding with the garnishments of the bank accounts of European Food, European Drinks and TGIE as set out in the [Garnishment] Notices.\n\nb. The Respondent shall refrain from repealing the fiscal warehouse authorizations of European Food and Scandic Distilleries until the Tribunal issues its Final Award.\n\nc. The Tribunal otherwise confirms its (First) Decision on Provisional Measures of 2 March 2011. Accordingly, the Respondent shall inform the Claimants, with a copy to the Tribunal, if it intends to proceed with the seal or forced sale of the seized assets or take any other tax collection measure (including garnishments of bank accounts) that could have a similar effect, two months prior to the date in which it intends to implement such seal, sale or other measure, until this arbitration is completed or this Decision is reconsidered.\n\nd. The Parties shall continue to seek to reach an agreement on a mutually acceptable security or assurance to be provided by the Claimants.\n\ne. If either Party considers that the circumstances under which this Decision is made have changed, either Party may apply to the Tribunal for reconsideration of this Decision.\n\nf. The other prayers are dismissed.\n\ng. Costs are reserved for a later decision or award.\"\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal noted in its Third Decision that no additional security had been provided by the Claimants in respect of the lifting of the garnishment on Starmill's accounts, a condition that was imposed by the Tribunal in its Supplemental Decision. It did, however, note that the Micula brothers made a good faith offer of certain properties to satisfy their debts, and requested that the Claimants submit a formal valuation of these properties as soon as it was finalized. Although the Tribunal granted the Claimants' Garnishment Application, it repeated that it expected the Claimants to supply some form of security and recommended that the Parties continue to seek to reach an agreement on a mutually acceptable security or assurance.\n\n103.\n\nOn 14 March 2012, the Respondent asked the Claimants to produce the valuation report pursuant to the Tribunal's instructions in the Third Decision. On 30 March 2012, the Respondent repeated its request. Following further exchanges of correspondence (Claimants' letters of 17 April, 7 June and 11 July 2012 and Respondent's letters of 18 May, 21 June, 19 and 20 July 2012), the parties failed to reach a mutual agreement on security to be provided by the Claimants.\n\n104.\n\nOn 1 August 2012, the Respondent filed an Application to Revoke Provisional Measures (\"Respondent's Revocation Application\") seeking the revocation of the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal, or, in the alternative, the suspension of the provisional measures until the Claimants had posted security adequate to protect the Respondent's right to collect taxes owed by the eleven EFDG companies. The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal's Award provide that any amount awarded to any of the Claimants (whether as damages or costs) be subject to set-off against the EFDG companies' tax debts, including lawful interest and penalties. At the Tribunal's invitation, the Parties consulted and agreed on a briefing schedule to submit their comments on the Respondent's Revocation Application. The Parties informed the Tribunal of this briefing schedule on 17 August 2012.\n\n105.\n\nOn 28 September 2012, the Claimants submitted their observations on Respondent's Revocation Application. The Claimants opposed the Respondent's Application in its entirety and requested that the provisional measures remain in force until the date of the Award. In addition, the Claimants made three requests of their own: (i) that the Award provide that the Respondent be enjoined from any further tax collection measures until full payment of any damages awarded to the Claimants by the Tribunal, (ii) that the Tribunal declare that the Respondent cannot set-off tax debts as requested, and (iii) that the Respondent is ordered to pay all the Claimants' costs in relation to Respondent's Application.\n\n106.\n\nOn 8 October 2012, the Respondent submitted a request for production of the valuation reports in regard to the properties which the Claimants had offered to the Respondent as payment in kind to extinguish their existing tax debts. On 18 October 2012, the Claimants opposed production of the valuation reports, stating that the arbitral proceedings were not the appropriate forum to negotiate the details of a proposed payment in kind and that they were prepared to make the reports available to the Romanian authorities in direct meetings.\n\n107.\n\nOn 30 October 2012, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order in which it ordered the production of the valuation reports, if the Claimants confirmed that the relevant properties were offered as security for their tax debts owed to the Respondent, rather than as payment in kind. The Tribunal found that the reports were relevant and material to its assessment of the Claimants' good faith efforts to provide additional security to meet the requirement of proportionality, so that they were thus necessary for the determination of the Respondent's Revocation Application. On 9 November 2012, the Claimants confirmed that the properties were offered as payment in kind and not as security, but produced the valuation reports nonetheless. They also mentioned additional assets as potential security. Valuation reports concerning these additional assets were submitted on 23 November 2012.\n\n108.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Respondent filed its reply concerning its Revocation Application and, on 15 February 2013, the Claimants filed their rejoinder.\n\n109.\n\nOn 5 March 2013, the Claimants submitted their Fourth Application for Provisional Measures (\"Claimants' Fourth Application\"). The Claimants informed the Tribunal that, on 5 March 2013, Romania had seized brewery-related assets belonging to European Food and requested that the Tribunal order provisional relief to stop the seizure and forced execution of assets. The Claimants argued that the seizure violated the existing provisional measures because Romania had given no notice of the measures and planned a forced sale if the Claimants' tax debt was not paid within 15 days.\n\n110.\n\nAt the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimants' Fourth Application on 8 March 2013. It argued that the seizure of assets belonging to European Food did not constitute a violation of the provisional measures in place because no notice requirement applied to the seizure of assets and Romania did not intend to proceed with a forced sale of the assets. The Respondent contended that the seizure was justified because of time limitations on debt collection efforts under Romanian law. The Parties filed further comments by letters of 14 March 2013 (Claimants) and 21 March 2013 (Respondent).\n\n111.\n\nOn 27 March 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Decision on Provisional Measures (\"Fourth Decision\") concerning the Respondent's Revocation Application. The Tribunal concluded that the Claimants had made good faith attempts to reach an agreement with the Respondent regarding a mutually acceptable security and that the provisional measures preventing garnishment of the bank accounts of European Food, European Drinks and TGIE remained proportional. It further considered that the circumstances surrounding the fiscal warehouse authorizations had not changed to such an extent as to warrant the revocation, suspension or modification of the provisional measures in question. The Tribunal thus confirmed the existing provisional measures and dismissed Romania's request for revocation or suspension of those measures (Fourth Decision, \u00b6 119). It further ruled that the Claimants' request for post-award injunctive relief concerning Romania's tax debt collection measures, as well as the Parties' requests with respect to the set-off of tax debts against a pecuniary award in favor of the Claimants, would be deferred for determination in the Award.2\n\nThese matters are addressed in Section IX below\n\n112.\n\nOn 5 April 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fifth Decision on Provisional Measures (\"Fifth Decision\") concerning Claimants' Fourth Application. The Tribunal found that the mere seizure of assets without providing any notice that did not prevent the Claimants from continuing to use those assets did not, in and of itself, violate the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal. The Tribunal thus dismissed Claimants' Fourth Application and all other prayers for relief (Fifth Decision, \u00b6 39). The Tribunal also urged the parties to continue seeking a mutually acceptable agreement on security, as previously recommended (Fifth Decision, \u00b6 38).\n\n**b. The Claimants' Renewed Application for a Site Visit**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nOn 9 December 2010, the Claimants submitted a renewed application for a site visit, specifying which allegations a site visit would help prove or disprove and commenting on the Tribunal's authority to order it. On 17 December 2010, the Respondent objected to Claimants' application, stating that a site visit was unnecessary and would be procedurally unfair.\n\n114.\n\nAfter careful consideration of each Party's position and a review of the evidence in the record, the Tribunal concluded that a site visit was neither necessary nor useful for the resolution of the dispute. Accordingly, by Procedural Order of 20 January 2011 the Tribunal denied the Claimants' application for a site visit. In that same Procedural Order, the Tribunal gave further directions to the Parties with respect to oral closing arguments.\n\n**c. The Claimants' Revised Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nOn 20 December 2010, the Claimants submitted a revised request for relief (the \"Revised Request for Relief\").3 On 10 January 2011, the Respondent objected to the procedural propriety and content of the Revised Request for Relief and requested that the Tribunal reject specific evidence. The Parties exchanged further submissions on this matter (Claimants' letters of 31 January 2011 and 9 February 2011, and the Respondent's letter of 2 February 2011).\n\nThe Claimants' Revised Request for Relief is addressed in more detail in Sections IV.A and VII.A.1 below.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled on this matter by means of a Procedural Order issued on 6 April 2011. With respect to the procedural propriety of the Revised Request for Relief, the Tribunal declined to reject any evidence submitted by the Claimants, but found that the Claimants' reliance on certain quantum experts was new, and thus invited the Respondent to rebut these testimonies in writing or by further examination of those experts.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that there had been no prejudice to the Respondent as a result of the reformulation of the Claimants' expropriation case or of their claim for interest. However, it found that the Claimants' request that any damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants on a 50/50 basis, and in the alternative that any damages be awarded to all five Claimants, was a reformulation of the Claimants' case that raised several issues of procedure and merits. The Tribunal also requested the Parties to address the merits of the Claimants' damages case in their post-hearing briefs and gave further directions with respect to briefing. The Tribunal also noted that the Claimants' reformulation of their damages case could affect the procedural schedule for closing arguments. It thus invited the Claimants to confirm if they wished to maintain their request for an award of damages to be distributed to the Individual Claimants on a 50/50 basis. The Claimants provided this confirmation on 15 April 2011.\n\n**d. Post-hearing briefs and oral closing arguments**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal's Procedural Order of 25 November 2010 provided that the Parties would present oral closing arguments, setting as a tentative date 1-2 March 2011. It also provided that the Parties could submit voluntary post-hearing briefs.\n\n119.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that its Romanian counsel would not be available for a hearing on 1-2 March 2011. After consulting with the Parties, on 3 February 2011 the Tribunal determined that the hearing for the Parties' closing arguments would take place on 6 and 7 June 2011.\n\n120.\n\nAs mentioned in paragraph 116 above, on 6 April 2011 the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order that ruled on the Claimants' Revised Request for Relief and gave directions to the Parties with respect to further briefing. Following the Claimants' confirmation that they wished to maintain their reformulated damages case, at the Tribunal's invitation the Parties consulted on the next procedural steps. On 4 May 2011 they informed the Tribunal that they had reached an agreement with respect to post-hearing briefs, additional submissions on damages, the hearing schedule and cross-examination of experts.\n\n121.\n\nOn 12 April 2011, the Respondent requested leave to submit three new fact exhibits. After hearing both Parties' positions, on 29 April 2011 the Tribunal determined that the record was sufficiently complete on the subject matters of those documents insofar as such matters were relevant to the outcome of the dispute, and denied the Respondent's request.\n\n122.\n\nOn 6 May 2011, in accordance with its Procedural Order of 25 November 2010, the Tribunal submitted to the Parties a list of questions to be addressed in their closing arguments.\n\n123.\n\nOn 13 May 2011, the Parties submitted their written post-hearing briefs. On 27 May 2011, the Respondent submitted an additional submission with respect to the Claimants' Revised Request for Relief in accordance with the Tribunal's Procedural Order of 6 April 2011.\n\n124.\n\nOn 6 and 7 June 2011, the Parties and the Tribunal held a hearing in Paris. During the course of the hearing, the Parties presented their oral closing arguments and responded to questions from the Tribunal. The Tribunal was addressed by Messrs. Fleuriet, Gaillard, Reed and Schwartz, on behalf of the Claimants, and by Messrs. King, Petrochilos and Rubins, on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n125.\n\nThe following persons participated in the hearing:\n\nOn behalf of Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants :\n\nMr. Eric Schwartz King & Spalding  \n Mr. Ken Fleuriet King & Spalding  \n Mr. Ric Toher King & Spalding  \n Ms. Amy R.

Closure of the Proceeding and Submissions on Costs**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nOn 14 June 2013, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2), the Tribunal invited the Parties to file statements of costs by 12 July 2013, and their comments on the other Parties' statements of costs by 2 August 2013. The Parties were given the opportunity to inform the Tribunal if they saw a need for submissions on costs, rather than statements. By the same letter, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Parties subsequently agreed that they would file submissions on costs, but that they would not file any reply submissions.\n\n128.\n\nOn 19 July 2013, the Parties submitted their respective submission of costs, each requesting an award requiring the other party to bear the entirety of the expenses incurred by the parties, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the charges for the use of ICSID's facilities. The Claimants also requested compound interest on a costs award. The Claimants' submission was accompanied by an Annex and Exhibits C-1035 to C-1044. The Respondent's submission was accompanied by two declarations of co-counsel Nestor Nestor Diculescu Kingston Petersen and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, Exhibits R-245 to R-268 and Legal Authorities RL-375 and RL-376.\n\n129.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, the period of 120 days for the rendering of the award was extended pursuant to Rule 46 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n130.\n\nThe present dispute arises from Romania's introduction of certain economic incentives for the development of disfavored regions of Romania, and their subsequent revocation in the context of Romania's accession to the European Union (\"EU\").\n\n131.\n\nSpecifically, in 1998, Romania enacted Emergency Government Ordinance 24/1998 (\"EGO 24/1998\" or \"EGO 24\"), which made available certain tax incentives, including customs duties exemptions (called alternatively by the Parties the \"Incentives\" or the \"Facilities\"), to investors in certain disfavored regions who met the requirements set out in EGO 24/1998 and its implementing legislation. The Claimants claim that, in reliance on those incentives, and in reliance on the expectation that they would be maintained for a 10-year period, they made substantial investments in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti disfavored region located in Bihor County, northwestern Romania. The Claimants further claim that Romania's revocation of these incentives (effective 22 February 2005) was in breach of its obligations under the BIT and caused damages to the Claimants, as described further below.\n\n132.\n\nRomania does not dispute that in 1998 it passed EGO 24, which offered tax incentives to investors investing in disfavored regions, nor does it dispute that, effective 22 February 2005, it repealed most of the tax incentives offered under EGO 24, with the exception of a profit tax incentive. However, it denies that this revocation breached any of its obligations under the BIT. In addition, it argues that this revocation was necessary to comply with EU state aid obligations, which in turn was necessary for Romania to complete its accession to the EU.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants began to invest in Romania in 1991, and continued investing throughout the next two decades. During this time, Romania was undergoing its economic transition from communism to a market economy. As stated by the Respondent, during this time \"the factual record [...] portrays a government trying to pursue two policies that came into increasing conflict\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 103): one directed to the development of its disfavored regions, and another directed to obtaining accession to the EU.\n\n134.\n\nThere are, therefore, three main areas of factual inquiry for the Tribunal: the evolution of Romania's policy for the development of disfavored areas, the history of the Claimants' investments, and Romania's EU accession process.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal will first describe the evolution of Romania's policy for the development of disfavored areas, in particular the EGO 24 framework, up to the point at which the Claimants allege that they began investing in reliance on it (Section B). The Tribunal will then describe the Claimants' investments (Section C). It will then describe the main facts surrounding Romania's accession process, together with related events affecting the EGO 24 framework as that process developed (Section D).\n\n136.\n\nSections B, C and D are meant to give a general overview of the facts of the present dispute. They do not include all factual aspects which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from the extensive testimony of witnesses and experts at the hearing. The latter, as far as is relevant, will be discussed in the context of the Tribunal's analysis of the disputed issues.\n\n**B. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE DISFAVORED REGIONS**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Romania's efforts to attract investment in the early 1990s**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nAs noted by the European Commission in a 1997 report, \"[a]fter the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989, Romania found itself in a deep economic and social crisis\" (Exh. C-317). This was followed by several years of reforms directed at transforming Romania into a market economy with the ultimate objective of obtaining EU accession.\n\n138.\n\nIn this context, Romania undertook serious efforts to attract investment, both foreign and domestic. On 14 March 1990, Romania issued Decree Law 96/1990, entitled \"on certain measures for the attraction of foreign capital investment in Romania\" (Exh. R-134), which contained provisions regulating foreign investment in Romania and granted foreign investors certain tax benefits.\n\n139.\n\nThis Decree Law was replaced a year later by Law 35/1991 on foreign investment (\"Law 35\", enacted on 3 April 1991 and effective 10 April 1991, Exh. C-275). To \"induce foreign investment in Romania\", this law offered the following incentives for new investments made by foreign investors [later amended to include domestic investors] (Arts. 12-15):\n\na. An exemption from customs duties related to certain types of imported machinery, equipment and means of transportation;\n\nb. A two-year exemption from customs duties on imported raw materials;\n\nc. A profit-tax exemption ranging from 2 to 5 years, depending on the type of investment; and\n\nd. A profit-tax reduction for certain investments following the expiration of the profit-tax exemption.\n\n140.\n\nOn 5 August 1996, Romania passed Government Ordinance No. 27/1996 (\"GO 27/1996\", Exh. C-276), which offered certain benefits to individuals domiciled or working in some localities from the Apuseni Mountains and the Biosphere Reserve (also known as \"the Danube Delta\"). These benefits included a corporate profit tax incentive for investors ranging from 5 to 10 years, depending on the location of the investment.\n\n141.\n\nIn the following years, Romania began serious efforts to promote regional development, which was identified as \"one of the essential elements of the general strategy reform of Romania\" in Romania's Government Program for 1998-2000. One of the objectives of this regional development was \"[s]trengthening the ability of Romania to undertake responsibilities as a future member of the European Union.\" The program also stated that the Government defined a minimum set of priorities, \"achievement of which is in full compliance with the criteria and objectives of the National Program on the Accession of Romania to the European Union.\" (Annex 2 to Government Decision 6 issued 15 April 1998, Exh. C-567).\n\n142.\n\nIn this context, on 16 July 1998, Romania passed Law 151/1998 on Regional Development (the \"Regional Development Law\", Exh. C-392). Among its objectives was the \"diminution of existing regional imbalances by stimulation of a balanced development, by accelerated recovery of delays in the development of deprived zones as a result of some historical, geographic, economic, social, and political conditions, and prevention of the production of new imbalances.\" (Art. 1(a)). The methodological norms issued for Law 151 (Exh. C-392) stated that the objective of regional development was the improvement of the economic performance of certain development regions, and that such objective had the support of the Government and the EU (Art. 1).\n\n143.\n\nThe Regional Development Law divided the country into 8 development regions. The area in which the Claimants invested (the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti region in Bihor County) is located in the North West Regional Development Area, and was managed by the NW-Regional Development Agency (NW-RDA). A key objective of the NW-RDA was to \"increase[e] the living standard and long-lasting social-economic development of the region within a European context\", by *inter alia* increasing the attractiveness of the region, establishing a business environment and promoting longlasting development (Exh. C-393, Section III.2).\n\n144.\n\nAt the time of these reforms, unemployment levels in Bihor County were high. In its effort to restructure the mining industry, between 1997 and 2005 the Romanian government closed down over 500 uneconomic mines. By the end of 1998, approximately 100,000 miners were out of work. Unemployment was felt strongly in Bihor County, which had been dependent on mining for many years (Exh. C-319, C-320, C-321, C-325, C-566).\n\n**2. EGO 24/1998**\n------------------\n\n145.\n\nIt was in this context that on 30 September 1998 (effective 2 October 1998), Romania adopted Emergency Government Ordinance No. 24/1998 (\"EGO 24/1998\" or \"EGO 24\", Exh. R-5 or C-38). EGO 24/1998 established the legislative framework for the granting of certain incentives to investors investing in certain \"disfavored\" regions.\n\n146.\n\nEGO 24/1998 was subsequently approved and amended by Law No. 20/1999 of 15 January 1999 (effective 19 January 1999) (Exh. C-39), and a renumbered version containing the amendments made by Law 20 was republished on 8 November 1999 (Exh. R-68). It is on this republished version that the Claimants claim they relied. As a result, for the sake of simplicity, henceforth all references to EGO 24/1998 will refer to its reformulated version republished on 8 November 1999 (Exh. R-68).\n\n147.\n\nEGO 24/1998 provided that the Government could declare the creation of certain \"disadvantaged areas\", in response to proposals of the National Council for Regional Development (Art. 3). This declaration would be done by means of a \"government decision\", which would also approve (a) the period for which a geographical area would be declared a disadvantaged region, (b) the fields of interest for investments, and (c) \"the required financing and advantages provided by law, and granted to the investors\" (Art. 4). Article 5 provided that \"[a] geographical area may be declared a disadvantaged area for a period of at least 3 years, but for not more than 10 years, with possibility for extension, under the conditions of this Emergency Ordinance.\"\n\n148.\n\nArticle 6(1) went on to say that investors meeting certain requirements \"will be granted the following advantages for their new investments in these regions\", and proceeded to list the incentives:\n\nArt. 6. - (1) Privately held companies, Romanian legal entities, as well as small or family businesses, authorized pursuant to the Decree-Law no. 54/1990 concerning the organization and operation of free initiative-based economic activities that are headquartered and conduct business within the disadvantaged region, will be granted the following advantages for their new investments in these regions:\n\n(a) exemptions from payment of:\n\n- customs duties and value added tax on machinery, tools, installations, equipment, means of transportation, other goods subject to depreciation which are imported for the purpose of making investments in that region;\n\n- value added tax on machinery, tools, installations, equipment, means of transportation, other goods subject to depreciation manufactured domestically with the purpose of making investments in that region;\n\n[the \" ***Machinery Incentive*** \" or \" ***Machinery Facility*** \"]\n\n(b) refunds of customs duties on raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary for achieving the investor's own production in that region. The refunds will be made based on the approval by the regional development agencies of the companies' production sales documents. The funds necessary for the refund of the customs duties will be provided to the Agency for Regional Development from the Regional Development Fund. In case [of] unprivileged regions belonging to two or more administrative-territorial units, the funds necessary for the refund of the customs duties will be provided by the National Agency for Regional Development from the National Development Fund [the \" ***Raw Materials Incentive*** \" or \" ***Raw Materials Facility*** \"];\n\n(c) exemptions from payment of the profit tax during the existence of the disadvantaged region [the \" ***Profit Tax Incentive*** \" or \" ***Profit Tax Facility*** \"];\n\n(d) exemptions from payment of the taxes collected for the changes of the destination of the land or for the removal from the agricultural use of some plots of land that had been earmarked for the fulfillment of the investment [the \" ***Agricultural Land Incentive*** \" or \" ***Agricultural Land Facility*** \"][;]\n\n(e) preferred payments from the Special Development Fund of the Romanian Government, which was established pursuant to the Emergency Government Ordinance no. 59/1997 concerning the purpose of the funds collected by the State Property Fund during the privatization process of the companies where the State is a shareholder, with the purpose of:\n\n- encouraging the exports of the final products and/or for the industrial services, as the case may be;\n\n- guaranteeing external credits, within the annual limit set by the Ministry of Finance;\n\n- financing special programs, approved by Government Decision;\n\n- financing investment projects for companies through the state's participation in the share capital.\n\n[the \" ***Subsidies*** \"]\n\n2) The advantages and the financing stipulated in paragraph (1) letter e) is established through a Government Decision.\n\n149.\n\nArticle 8 provided the requirements for investors to qualify for the incentives: \"[t]he advantages stipulated in the present Emergency Ordinance are granted to businesses, privately held Romanian legal entities, as well as to small and family businesses, authorized according to Decree-Law No. 54/1990, who have their headquarters and conduct business in this area, if the investment made yields new jobs for the unemployed or for their family members who live in the disadvantaged area.\"\n\n150.\n\nArticles 7 and 9 set out investors' obligation to stay in the disadvantaged area for twice the period they received the incentives, as follows:\n\nArt. 7. - If an investment which is benefiting from the provisions of the present Emergency Ordinance is ***voluntarily liquidated in a period of time shorter than twice the period of time in which they enjoyed the advantages*** granted through the Government Decision to create the underprivileged area, ***the liquidator(s) is/are obligated first to pay the funds related to the advantages*** granted in accordance with the provisions of the present Emergency Ordinance, to the State Budget, the State Social Insurance Budget and the Special Funds Budgets from the funds resulting from the liquidation procedure.\n\n[...]\n\nArt. 9. - Businesses established in a disadvantaged area ***may voluntarily cease to operate in the respective area***, and those opening subsidiaries as legal entities in such an area may ***close them or move the location of their headquarters out of the disadvantaged area in a period shorter than the one provided in Art. 7 only if they pay the funds they owe*** to the State Budget, the State Social Insurance Budget and the Special Funds Budgets ***related to the advantages granted*** in accordance with the provisions of the present Emergency Ordinance.\n\n151.\n\nFinally, Article 15 provided that \"the Government will approve, through a decision, the methodological standards to be used for the implementation of this Emergency Ordinance.\"\n\n**3. Government Decision 194/1999 and the 1999 Methodological Norms**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nBy means of Government Decision 194/1999, dated 25 March 1999 (Exh. C-31, also C-280), Romania designated the \u015etei-Nucet region as a disfavored region for a period of ten years, starting on 1 April 1999. The \u015etei-Nucet region is located in Bihor County in the northwestern part of Romania, and its primary industry at the time was the mining and oil industry. GD 194/1999 also stipulated that all six incentives offered under EGO 24/1998 would be available to investors in the \u015etei-Nucet region while that region was designated disfavored, and set out the types of investments that could benefit from the incentives. Specifically, GD 194/1999 provided:\n\nArt. 1. - The mining area of \u015etei-Nucet, Bihor county, is established as a disfavoured region.\n\nArt. 2. - The geographical boundaries of the mining area of \u015etei-Nucet, Bihor county are represented by \u015etei and Nucet, as administrative-territorial units having a surface of 4,678 ha, according to annex no. 1.\n\nArt. 3. - The mining area referred to in art. 1 will be established as a disfavoured region for a period of 10 years.\n\nArt. 4. - During the existence of the disfavoured region, established according to this decision, the facilities under annex no. 2\\*) ***will be*** ***granted*** *.* [\"se acord\u00e2\" in the Romanian original]\n\n153.\n\nIn turn, Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 listed all of the incentives provided under Article 6(1) of EGO 24, with slightly amended language. Specifically, it stated:\n\nCompanies the majority of the share capital of which is privately owned, Romanian legal entities, as well as the private investors or family associations authorized pursuant to the \"Decree-Law no. 54/1990 on the organization and operation of economic activities based on free initiative\" that were set up after the date of establishment of the disfavoured region and have their registered seat and operate in the disfavoured region, will be granted the following facilities for new investments in these regions:\n\n(a) an exemption from payment of:\n\n- custom duties and value added tax on machinery, tools, installations, equipment, means of transportation, other goods subject to depreciation which are imported with a view to performing and conducting investments in that region;\n\n- value added tax on machinery, tools, installations, equipment, means of transportation, other goods subject to depreciation manufactured in the country with a view to performing and conducting investments in that region;\n\n(b) refund of custom duties on raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary for achieving the investor's own production in that region;\n\n(c) an exemption from payment of profit tax during the existence of the disfavoured region;\n\n(d) an exemption from payment of taxes collected for changes in the nature of land or for conversion of agricultural plots of land into industrial land for the implementation of the investment;\n\n(e) preferred payment of amounts available from the Special Development Fund at the disposal of the Romanian Government that was established pursuant to the \"Emergency Government Ordinance no. 59/1997 on the amounts collected by the State Property Fund during the privatization process of the companies in which the State is shareholder\" to - encourage the export activities for the final products and/or for the industrial services, as the case may be;\n\n- guarantee the external credits within the annual limit set by the Ministry of Finance;\n\n- finance special programs approved by Government Decision;\n\n- finance investment projects for companies through the state's participation in the share capital.\n\n154.\n\nOn 29 June 1999, Romania issued Government Decision No. 525/1999, which set out the methodological norms for the application of EGO 24/1998 (the \"1999 Methodological Norms\", Exh. R-6). (The 1999 Methodological Norms repealed a previous version issued in December 1998 which has not been relied upon in this arbitration).\n\n155.\n\nWith respect to the requirements for granting the incentives, Article 5 of the 1999 Methodological Norms provided:\n\n(1) The incentives provided by the law ***shall be granted*** [in Romanian, \"se acorda\"] pursuant to the certificate of investor in a disfavored area, which is issued, upon the business entity's request, by the Regional Development Agency under the jurisdiction of which the head office of such business entity is located.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(3) Business entities requesting the issuance of the certificate of investor in a disfavored area shall prove they meet the requirements set forth by the [EGO].\n\n(4) Emerging business entities, unable to produce evidence regarding the investment, the commissioning of the operations and the creation of new jobs, may request the issuance of a temporary certificate of investor in a disfavored area, for a maximum of 3 months. In case they do not bring, during this period, evidence of having met the requirements set forth by the [EGO], they shall be compelled to pay and return, respectively the equivalent value of all the incentives they have benefited of.\n\n(5) The temporary certificate shall be issued pursuant to the business entity's commitment regarding the investment and the creation of new jobs.\n\n[...]\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Individual Claimants claim to be the majority shareholders of a group of companies (the European Food and Drinks Group or \"EFDG\") engaged in food and beverage production in the disfavored region of \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti, Bihor County. The Corporate Claimants (European Food, Starmill and Multipack) are part of the EFDG, and are thus owned directly or indirectly by the Individual Claimants.\n\n157.\n\nThe evolution of the Claimants' investments can be separated in two phases: their initial investments (principally in the beverage production business), allegedly made in reliance on the incentive programs that predated EGO 24, and their investments (in the food and beverage production business), allegedly made in reliance on the EGO 24 incentives.\n\n**1. The Claimants' initial investments in reliance on previous incentive regimes**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Individual Claimants allege that their beverage business was initially developed in reliance on the incentive programs established by Law 35 and GO 27, predecessors to EGO 24. (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 62-124; Third WS of I. Micula \u00b6\u00b6 10-27). Law 35 (C-275) was enacted in 1991 to attract foreign investors to Romania by offering the incentives for new investments, including customs duties and profit tax exemptions (see \u00b6 139 above). GO 27/1996 (Exh. C-276) was enacted in 1996 to attract investments in Bihor County and other disadvantaged regions, and provided a corporate profit tax incentive ranging from 5 to 10 years, depending on the location of the investment (see \u00b6 140 above).\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimants claim that these incentives allowed them to produce a wide variety of beverages at a low cost. Law 35's encouragement of additional production activities and the Claimants' knowledge of advanced technologies enabled them to sell their beverages in a variety of different packages, including TetraPak and PET packaging. Capitalizing on this expertise, they began to produce intermediate products related to packaging (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 81-96, Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 10-24).\n\n160.\n\nAfter the success of their initial investments, Messrs. Micula expanded their beverage production business, building what would become an integrated system of production companies. All of the core companies, with the exception of the Corporate Claimants and Scandic Distilleries, were established under Law 35 (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 77, 81-96; Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6 29).4\n\nThe record shows the following with respect to the Claimants' incorporation or participation in companies during this period (1991-1997):\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimants claim that their business model was premised on the existence and specific form of the incentives. Because an investor could benefit from Law 35 incentives each time he created a new company, the Law 35 incentives encouraged the establishment of an expanding group of companies. New companies, and thus the expansion of Claimants' production business, were planned and created to coincide with the expiration of the incentives for older companies. The new companies and investments were integrated into the existing companies and investments, so that all companies functioned cooperatively to create, manufacture, package, and distribute products efficiently (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 77-80; Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; WS of M. Ban, \u00b6 27).\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants allege that this integration allowed them to realize an increased level of profit. They also state that profits were consistently re-invested to support the expansion of the business and to take advantage of the tax profit exemption under Law 35. Moreover, the raw materials customs duty exemption in Law 35 encouraged production activities, because it only applied to raw materials used to produce new end-products. It thus encouraged a proliferation of businesses that worked together to produce a variety of products, and provided a competitive advantage because the incentives allowed the companies to keep product prices low (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81, Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6 25).\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants claim that they were able to successfully expand their production activities by using savings from the incentives programs and their profits, which they consistently reinvested in the business. The Claimants claim that they followed this approach throughout the years: using the realized savings during the time in which the incentives were offered to reinvest and build facilities that were functional and profit-producing by the time the incentives expired. (C-Reply, \u00b6 96).\n\na. On 19 October 1990, Messrs. Micula allegedly incorporated the Romanian company Transilvania General Import Export S.R.L (\"TGIE\") (Claimants' \"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25). The Claimants allege that this company was set up to benefit from Law 35/1991, as it was originally set up for the five years for which Law 35 granted corporate profit tax exemptions (C-Reply, Note 102). The Tribunal notes however that Law 35 was enacted after TGIE's stated date of incorporation, so it understands the Claimants to be saying that TGIE was established to benefit from the earlier Decree Law 96/1990, which was later replaced by Law 35. That being said, the Tribunal also notes that, according to the information provided by the Bihor Trade Register Office (Exh. R-60) and TGIE's 1993 Fiscal Report (Exh. C-356), TGIE was assigned its trade register reference number in May 1991. TGIE's date of incorporation is therefore not established with certainty.\n\nb. From June 1993 to April 1995, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in ten Romanian companies, including European Drinks S.A. and Rieni Drinks S.A. (Claimants' \"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; R-CM, Figure 1, p. 7; Exh. R-60 and R-61).\n\nc. From November 1996 to July 1998, the Claimants incorporated or acquired an interest in three additional Romanian companies (Claimants' \"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; R-CM, Figure 1, p. 7; Exh. R-60 and R-61.)\n\nd. On 8 July 1997, the Claimants, through their company Edri Trading SRL purchased shares in SC Ipic Bucaresti S.A., a previously state-owned company which owned 88,000 square meters of land in Bucharest (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 31-36; Tr., Day 2, 211, Day 3, 133,141,145-150 (I.Micula); Exh. C-346; C-439).\n\n164.\n\nIn turn, the GO 27 incentives motivated the Claimants to relocate certain projects to Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti (in the Apuseni region of Bihor County, which was expressly covered by GO 27). In particular, the Miculas relocated the distillery for what would eventually become Scandic Distilleries from the Madaras region to Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 105110). Other companies developed new projects in Bihor County to realize GO 27 benefits (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 111-118).\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants claim that their beverage business was very successful. By 2001, they state that European Drinks held an estimated 55% of the total carbonated drink market in Romania and a 51% share of the bottled mineral water market (C-Reply, \u00b6 87).\n\n**2. The Claimants' investments in reliance on the EGO 24 incentives**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nAfter Romania's introduction of the EGO 24 incentives, the Claimants allege that they built a large, highly integrated food production platform in reliance on these incentives, in particular the Raw Materials Incentive. The Respondent disputes this reliance, the Claimants' description of their business plan and the Claimants' intention to build certain parts of the platform.\n\n167.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants allege that, starting in 1998, they expanded their business under a ten-year plan to capitalize on the EGO 24 incentives with the objective of building an integrated food platform, incorporating several companies in the process.5 In 1999 they incorporated European Food (Claimant 3), which as explained below was the first Corporate Claimant to benefit from the EGO 24 program (see paragraph 174 below). The Claimants state that they imported the majority of their raw material products through European Food, which brought them customs duties savings and allowed them to pursue a two-phase expansion plan (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 161-170).\n\nThe record shows the following with respect to the Claimants' incorporation or participation in companies during this period (1998-2007):  \n a. From June 1998 to December 1999, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in 23 Romanian companies, including S.C. European Food S.A., which was established as a Romanian joint stock company in \u015etei, Bihor county on 30 November 1999 (Exh. HEC-1).  \n b. During 2000, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in five other Romanian companies (\"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25), including Scandic Distilleries S.A., which was incorporated on 20 January 2000 (Exh. R-60).  \n c. During 2001, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in 3 Romanian companies (\"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; Exh. R-60).  \n d. During 2002, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in five Romanian companies, including S.C. Multipack S.R.L. and S.C. Starmill S.R.L., which were incorporated on 21 February 2002 (\"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; Exh. R-60).  \n e. During 2003 and 2004, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in four Romanian companies (\"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; Exh. R-60).  \n f. Between July 2005 and January 2007, Messrs. Micula incorporated or acquired an interest in three Romanian companies (\"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; Exh. R-60).\n\n168.\n\nThe first phase consisted in production of fast-moving consumer products new to the Romanian market, which had significant market potential and would generate quick cash flow. Together with the incentive savings, this approach would allow the companies to integrate vertically and achieve economies of scale. The companies could thereby save on operational costs and minimize waste and energy consumption.\n\n169.\n\nIn this context, in February 2002 the Claimants incorporated Starmill and Multipack (Claimants 4 and 5):6\n\na. Starmill was incorporated to establish integrated in-house grain milling facilities. It was designed to provide the milling capacity necessary for the planned brewery, but started as a corn mill which provided raw materials for the distillery. It was also responsible for the production of flour for several food products. According to the Claimants, through the use of the Raw Materials Incentive, Starmill would create cost efficiencies to help carry the businesses forward after the incentives expired. The Claimants claim that they made substantial investments for Starmill, including the purchase of land and construction (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 197-200).\n\nb. Multipack was incorporated to carry out the packaging and labeling for nearly all of the companies' products. The Claimants also allege that it relied heavily on the Raw Materials Incentive, and required substantial investments and created over 200 new jobs (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 201-204).\n\nStarmill and Multipack were incorporated on 21 February 2002 (\"Correct Timeline of Messrs. Micula's Investments\", C-Reply at page 25; Exh. R-60).\n\n170.\n\nThe second phase of the Claimants' alleged expansion plan was to build a brewery, the core capital expenditure for which would be funded by the profits from the other investments. According to the Claimants, the construction and integration of the brewery consisted of 4 components:\n\na. A state-of-the-art brewery with an initial capacity for 2M hectoliters/year, expandable to 6M.\n\nb. A malt plant, which would reduce the cost of malt by in-house manufacture;\n\nc. A canning plant, which would reduce packaging costs;\n\nd. A co-generation plant, which would use the biomass by-products of the brewery and other food and beverage production, and would save costs and produce revenue through sales back to the state of excess electricity.\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimants allege that in 2001 they started construction of the brewery (component (a) of paragraph 170 above), which was integrated into the other facilities of the companies. The first phase of construction was com pleted in 2003 and the second in 2006. (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 205-207).\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimants claim that they had plans to build the components identified in letters (b) through (d) of paragraph 170 above, but their completion was thwarted by cash-constraints caused by the revocation of the incentives. The Claimants further claim that the construction of these components began prior to the revocation of the incentives, but that none of these components was ever completed. The Respondent disputes all of these assertions (*See* Section VII below on Damages).\n\n**3. Permanent Investor Certificates**\n--------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nIn order to benefit from EGO 24, the Claimants allege that the three Corporate Claimants were required to obtain Permanent Investor Certificates (\"PICs\"), all of which were issued by the North-West Regional Development Agency. Prior to their issuance, the Claimants state that the Corporate Claimants could operate on the basis of a Temporary Investor Certificate (\"TIC\") for a period of 3 months (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 156-160; WS of M. Ban, \u00b6\u00b6 41-46).\n\n174.\n\nEuropean Food (Claimant 3) obtained its Temporary Investor Certificate on 9 December 1999 (Exh. C-442). It was then issued PIC No. 524 on 1 June 2000 (Exh. C-42, Exh. C-638), which stated that European Food\n\nis the beneficiary of the facilities under Government Decision no. 194/1999, in accordance with the provisions of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998, republished and subsequently amended, and in accordance with the provisions of Government Decision no. 728/2001 on the approval of the methodological norms for the application of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the disfavoured regions regime.\n\nThe present certificate is valid until 01.04.2009.7\n\nThe Tribunal observes that this cannot have been the original PIC, because it includes a reference to the 2001 Methodological Norms, which had not been issued at the time. The original PIC appears to be at page 1 of Exh. C-638, which has not been translated. This version also appears to state that European Food is the beneficiary of the facilities under GD 194/1999, in accordance with the provisions of EGO 24. However, it does not say \"republished and subsequently amended\", but rather appears to say \"approved and amended by Law 20/1999\", and adds a reference to the 1999 Methodological Norms (GD 525/1999).\n\n175.\n\nStarmill (Claimant 4) was issued PIC No. 1664 on 17 May 2002 (Exh. C-43), which stated that Starmill\n\nis the beneficiary of the facilities under Government Decision no. 194/1999, in accordance with the provisions of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998, approved and amended by Law no. 20/1999 and in accordance with the provisions of Government Decision no. 525/1999 on the approval of the methodological norms for application of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the disfavoured regions regime.\n\nThe present certificate is valid until 4/1/09\n\n176.\n\nMultipack (Claimant 5) holds PIC No. 1663 issued on 17 May 2002 (Exh. C-44), which stated that Multipack\n\nis the beneficiary of the facilities under Government Decision no. 194/1999, in accordance with the provisions of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998, republished and subsequently amended, and in accordance with the provisions of Government Decision no. 728/2001 on the approval of the methodological norms for application of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the disfavoured regions regime.\n\nThe present certificate is valid until 01.04.2009.\n\n177.\n\nThe legal nature and relevance of the PICs are disputed by the Parties.\n\n**D. ROMANIA'S ACCESSION PROCESS**\n----------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will set out the chronology of events leading up to Romania's accession to the EU. One of the key areas of tension between Romania and the EU during this process was the alignment of Romania's competition policy and state aid laws with the *acquis communautaire* (hereinafter the \" *acquis* \"), namely the European body of law as it existed at a given time and resulting from, without limitation, legal acts, court decisions or Commission's ordinances. In this process, the incentives granted under the EGO 24 framework became increasingly relevant, and were finally repealed. As a result, the Tribunal will include in this chronology the developments relating to this framework.\n\n**1. Early steps: the Europe Agreement and Romania's application for EU membership**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nOn 1 February 1993, Romania signed the Europe Agreement with the predecessor of the EU (the \"European Community\"8) and its Member States (Exh. R-10, C-565). The Europe Agreement, which was to enter into force on 1 February 1995, established an association between the European Community, its existing Member States and Romania and provided the legal framework for the accession process. Among its objectives was the promotion of Romania's economic development and its gradual integration into the European Community, in exchange for which Romania would have to work towards fulfilling certain conditions (Europe Agreement, Article 1).\n\nThe Tribunal will use the term \"European Community\" to refer to the predecessor of the EU that signed the Europe Agreement, formed by the European Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Coal and Steel Community.\n\n180.\n\nThe Europe Agreement covered many different areas of governance, including competition. With respect to state aid, Article 64 of the Europe Agreement provided:\n\nArticle 64\n\n1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Romania: [...] (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.\n\n2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86, and 929 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.\n\n3. The Association Council shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.\n\n4. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public aid granted by Romania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic situation of Romania, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of five years. [...]\n\nArticle 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community became Article 87 of the EC Treaty (Exh. RS-9; C-583), which provided:\n\n181.\n\nIn turn, Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty (which replaced Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community) (Exh. RL-177; C-583) provided:\n\nThe following may be considered to be compatible with the common market: (a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment; [\u2026]\n\n182.\n\nAnother of the aims of the Europe Agreement was to promote economic cooperation between Romania and the EC Member States. In this context, Article 74 of the Europe Agreement on investment promotion and protection provided:\n\nArticle 74 - Investment promotion and protection\n\n1. Cooperation shall aim to establish a favourable climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign, which is essential to the economic and industrial reconstruction of Romania.\n\n2. The particular aims of the cooperation shall be:\n\n- for Romania to establish and improve a legal framework which favours and protects investment;\n\n- the conclusion by the Member States and Romania of Agreements for the promotion and protection of investment [...]\n\n183.\n\nIn addition to establishing principles and rules of governance, the Europe Agreement provided that Romania would have to harmonize its existing and future legislation with that of the Community:\n\nArticle 69 - The Parties recognize that an important condition for Romania's economic integration into the Community is the approximation of\n\n1. Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.\n\n2. The following shall be compatible with the common market:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n3. The following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:\n\n(a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment; [\u2026]\n\nRomania's existing and future legislation to that of the Community.\n\nRomania shall endeavour to ensure that its legislation will be gradually made compatible with that of the Community.\n\nArticle 70 - The approximation of laws shall extend to the following areas in particular: [...] rules on competition [...].\n\n184.\n\nOn 21-22 June 1993, the European Council concluded at its meeting in Copenhagen that countries from Central and Eastern Europe which wished to become members of the European Union would have to satisfy the economic and political conditions required for membership (known as the \"Copenhagen criteria\"), including \"the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.\" The European Council also \"underlined the importance of approximation of laws in the associated countries to those applicable in the Community, in the first instance with regard to distortion of competition [...]\" (Exh. R-62).\n\n185.\n\nOn 1 February 1995, the Europe Agreement entered into force.\n\n186.\n\nOn 22 June 1995, Romania presented its application for EU membership. On 17 July 1995, Romania's application was submitted to the Commission, which pursuant to [the EC Treaty] was required to give a favorable opinion for accession negotiations to begin (Exh. C-317).\n\n187.\n\nIn its December 1995 meeting in Madrid, the European Council referred to the need, in the context of the pre-accession strategy, \"to create the conditions for the gradual, harmonious integration of the applicant countries, particularly through: the development of the market economy, the adjustment of their administrative structure, [and] the creation of a stable economic and monetary environment\" (Exh. C-317).\n\n188.\n\nThe European Commission, in an opinion dated 15 July 1997 (Exh. C-317), summarized the state of Romania's economy in 1995 as follows:\n\nRomania, with a population of 22.6 million, had in 1995 a gross domestic product (GDP) of ECU 93 billion (expressed in purchasing power parity); its population was about 6.5% of the Union's, while its economy was only about 1.5%. Per capita GDP is about 24% of the Union average.\n\n189.\n\nOn 10 April 1996 (effective 30 April 1996), Romania passed Law No. 21/1996 on competition (Exh. R-73). The purpose of this law was to \"protect, sustain and stimulate competition and a normal competitive environment in order to promote the interests of consumers.\" This law created the Competition Office and the Competition Council, which were tasked with overseeing the implementation of the law.\n\n190.\n\nOn 15 July 1997, the European Commission issued its Opinion on Romania's Application for Membership of the European Union (Exh. C-317). That Opinion concluded that, despite its post-communist reforms, Romania did not meet the Copenhagen criteria and thus was not yet ready to initiate accession talks. Specifically, the European Commission concluded that:\n\n- Romania has made considerable progress in the creation of a market economy, but it would still face serious difficulties to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium term;\n\n- despite the progress that has been made, Romania has neither transposed nor taken on the essential elements of the acquis, particularly as regards the internal market. It is therefore uncertain whether Romania will be in a position to assume the obligations of membership in the medium term. [\u2026]\n\n191.\n\nThe European Commission described Romania's economic situation in the preaccession context as follows (Section 2.2):\n\nRomania has made enormous progress since the beginning of the transition, although it cannot be considered, as yet, to be a functioning market economy. [\u2026]\n\nPolicy-making on economic issues has not always been coherent. As a result, progress towards macroeconomic stability has not been steady: recent years have been characterised by widely fluctuating performances in term of growth, inflation and unemployment. Economic agents do not necessarily perceive the macroeconomic environment to be stable enough to promote the necessary level of savings and investment (both domestic and foreign).\n\nIf fully implemented, the comprehensive programme of macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms announced by the authorities in early 1997 should radically transform Romania's economy and lay the foundations for healthy growth in the years ahead. But the implementation of the basic features of the programme, especially with regard to restructuring, will take many years. It is yet too early to assess whether the programme will be implemented fully and successfully. [\u2026]\n\nIn order to complete its transformation process successfully and prepare for EU membership, the country still needs to implement many, detailed and complex measures. [\u2026]\n\nIn the past, foreign investors have singled out the unpredictable evolution of the legal system and the different interpretation of double taxation treaties as obstacles to doing business in Romania. [\u2026]\n\n[T]he ability to withstand competitive pressure depends not only on the current structure of the economy, but also on the way in which it will develop in the near to medium-term future. In this respect, Romania offers a contrasted situation: the existing economic structure points to very important structural weaknesses, while the reforms that have been announced at the beginning of 1997 could have a very positive impact in a relatively short period of time, especially if rapid privatisation is achieved and foreign direct investment is forthcoming. However, in order to withstand competition within the Union both the industrial and agricultural sectors would need to undergo major structural transformation.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe current production base in industry relies to a large extent, although not exclusively, on sectors with very high energy intensity, or which are strongly dependent on imported raw materials, or have been the object of exercises of capacity reduction within the Union. [\u2026] The current structural reforms should aim at the restructuring of the very large state-owned *combinats*, which, in their present condition, would face strong competitive pressures from their western competitors.\n\nA diversification of the industrial base towards lighter industries, entailing the creation of a large number of new, small and medium-sized enterprises, and increased participation of foreign capital and know-how, will help Romania adjust to the restructuring of the large enterprises. Light industry is already well-developed in some sectors (wood products, leather, textiles) and has achieved good performances on exports markets.\n\nAlthough agriculture has been neglected in the last decades, it represents a potentially important source of comparative advantage for Romania [\u2026]. But the process of modernisation of the agricultural sector has just begun and will require a policy aiming at stimulating investments both in the farming sector and in the food industry.\n\nForeign direct investment has been low for a country the size of Romania: at the end of 1996 cumulative FDI per capita stood at ECU 50. With a few notable exceptions, FDI has not made a significant contribution to the modernisation of either industry or agriculture. This means that production in many sectors still relies on old and obsolete technologies. Increasing the chances that Romanian producers will be able to withstand competition of high-quality, high-standards EU goods, and improving the level of skills in the economy calls for much bigger inflows of FDI.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nRomania possesses a number of key advantages: its geographical location at the cross-roads of many trade routes and in particular as the sea-gate for accessing central European markets; the size of its population which will attract industries with economies of scale; the relatively young population which points to vast needs for durable goods; and its low level of labour costs. All these factors could make Romania a strong export base for accessing markets of smaller neighbours, especially for consumer goods.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe relative success which Romania achieved in macroeconomic stabilisation during 1995 and 1996 rested on very fragile foundations. In fact, given the very slow progress in structural reforms, the high growth rates of this period were not sustainable, and not compatible with the aim of integrating Romania in the European and world economy. This diagnosis was at the heart of the economic and social programme of the new government elected in November 1996.\n\nThe programme of macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms announced in February 1997 represents a very ambitious attempt to radically transform, in a relatively short period of time, the old economic structures and lay the foundations for a fully-functioning market economy. However, this is only a first step in the right direction and much remains to be done.\n\nA stable and predictable macroeconomic framework is the first key condition for laying the foundations of sustainable growth and modernisation of the microeconomic side of the economy. [\u2026]\n\nThe new Romanian authorities have already recognised the crucial role that foreign investors and international financial institutions will play in the success of their reform efforts. Restoring confidence among international investors and lenders and securing their medium-term investment in Romania calls for a stable macroeconomic framework, a sustained and credible commitment to structural reforms, a clear and broad political consensus over a medium-term strategy and the continuing legitimacy of reforms among the population. These conditions are indispensable to reduce political and economic uncertainty and so lay the foundations for successful investment planning.\n\n192.\n\nThe Commission concluded with respect to the economic conditions for accession (Section 2.3):\n\nRomania has made considerable progress in the creation of a market economy. The reorientation of economic policy since the recent change of government marks a change for the better, but much still needs to be done. While prices have been almost fully liberalised, property rights are not yet fully assured for land, the legal system is still fragile and policy-making on economic issues has not always been coherent. Further efforts to consolidate the legal and administrative framework, and to address persistent macroeconomic imbalances, are required to ensure a stable environment.\n\nRomania would face serious difficulties coping with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium term. It has recently made progress towards improving the competitive capacity of its economy, notably by addressing major distortions such as low energy prices, accelerating privatisation and beginning to wind up large loss-making state-owned firms. However, much of Romania's industry is obsolete, and agriculture needs to be modernised. The low levels of research and development, and of skills among the workforce also suggest that the economy needs a number of years of sustained structural reform.\n\n**2. Romania's initial efforts to align its state aid laws**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nOn 10 March 1998, the European Commission issued its Guidelines on Regional Aid, a set of criteria for assessing whether to allow regional aid under Article 87(3) of the EC Treaty (previously Article 92(3) of the Treaty establishing the ECC) (Exh. RJ-9). These Guidelines stated:\n\n1. Introduction [\u2026]\n\nRegional aid is designed to develop the less-favoured regions by supporting investment and job creation in a sustainable context. It promotes the expansion, modernisation and diversification of the activities of establishments located in those regions and encourages new firms to settle there. In order to foster this development and reduce the potential negative effects of any relocation, it is necessary to make the granting of such aid conditional on the maintenance of the investment and the jobs created during a minimum period in the less favoured region.\n\nIn exceptional cases, such aid may not be enough to trigger a process of regional development, if the structural handicaps of the region concerned are too great. ***Only in such cases may regional aid be supplemented by operating aid.***\n\n[\u2026]\n\n2. Scope\n\nA derogation from the incompatibility principle established by Article 92(1) of the Treaty may be granted in respect of regional aid only if the equilibrium between the resulting distortions of competition and the advantages of the aid in terms of the development of a less-favoured region (6) can be guaranteed. The weight given to the advantages of the aid is likely to vary according to the derogation applied, having a more adverse effect on competition in the situations described in Article 92(3)(a) than in those described in Article 92(3)(c) (7).\n\n3. Demarcation of regions\n\n[...]\n\nThe derogation in Article 92(3)(a)\n\n3.5. Article 92(3)(a) provides that aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment may be considered compatible with the common market. As the Court of Justice of the European Communities has held, 'the use of the words \"abnormally\" and \"serious\" in the exemption contained in Article 92(3)(a) shows that it concerns only areas where the economic situation is extremely unfavourable in relation to the Community as a whole' (12).\n\nThe Commission accordingly considers, following a tried and tested approach, that the conditions laid down are fulfilled if the region, being a NUTS (13) level II geographical unit, has a per capita gross domestic product (GDP), measured in purchasing power standards (PPS), of less than 75,0 % of the Community average (14). The GDP/PPS of each region and the Community average to be used in the analysis must relate to the average of the last three years for which statistics are available. These amounts are calculated on the basis of data furnished by the Statistical Office for the European Communities.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n4. Object, form and level of aid\n\n4.1. The object of regional aid is to secure either productive investment (initial investment) or job creation which is linked to investment. Thus this method favours neither the capital factor nor the labour factor.\n\n4.2. To ensure that the productive investment aided is viable and sound, the recipient's contribution (20) to its financing must be at least 25 %.\n\nThe form of the aid is variable: grant, low-interest loan or interest rebate, government guarantee or purchase of a State shareholding on favourable terms, ***tax exemption***, reduction in social security contributions, supply of goods and services at a concessionary price, etc.\n\nIn addition, aid schemes must lay down that an application for aid must be submitted before work is started on the projects.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nOperating aid\n\n4.15. Regional aid aimed at reducing a firm's current expenses (operating aid) is normally prohibited. Exceptionally, however, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 92(3)(a) provided that (i) it is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development and its nature and (ii) its level is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate (36). It is for the Member State to demonstrate the existence of any handicaps and gauge their importance.\n\n4.16. In the outermost regions qualifying for exemption under Article 92(3)(a) and (c), and in the regions of low population density qualifying either for exemption under Article 92(3)(a) or under 92(3)(c) on the basis of the population density test referred to at point 3.10.4, aid intended partly to offset additional transport costs (37) may be authorised under special conditions (38). It is up to the Member State to prove that such additional costs exist and to determine their amount.\n\n4.17. With the exception of the cases mentioned in point 4.16, operating aid must be both limited in time and progressively reduced. In addition, operating aid intended to promote exports (39) between Member States is ruled out.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n194.\n\nIn its Annual Report of 1998 regarding PHARE Program10 (Exh. C-391), the European Commission concluded:\n\nRomania meets the Copenhagen political criteria. Much remains to be done in rooting out corruption, improving the working of the courts and protecting individual liberties and the rights of the Roma. Priority should also be given to reform of the public administration.\n\nRomania has made very little progress in the creation of a market economy and its capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces has worsened.\n\nDespite progress made in transposition of key parts of the acquis, Romania has a long way to go in terms of additional legislative transposition, implementation and enforcement before the country will be able to assume the obligations of membership. (p. 61).\n\nThe Programme of Community aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Phare) is the main financial instrument of the pre-accession strategy for the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) which have applied for membership of the European Union. Since 1994, Phare's tasks have been adapted to the priorities and needs of each CEEC. The revamped Phare programme, with a budget of over EUR 10 billion for the period 2000-2006 (about 1.5 billion per year), has two main priorities, namely institutional and capacity-building and investment financing. Although the Phare programme was originally reserved for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, it is set to be extended to the applicant countries of the western Balkans (See http://europa.eu/ legislation\\_summaries/enlargement/ 2004\\_and\\_2007\\_enlargement/e50004\\_en.htm).\n\n195.\n\nThe EC's 1998 Annual Report also highlighted the importance of regional development in Romania (p. 63):\n\nCase study: regional development in Romania\n\nThrough a series of projects beginning in 1994, Phare is contributing to the creation of the institutional and legal framework for the development of regional policy in Romania, and to preparations for programmes to be implemented along the lines of the EU structural funds.\n\nUnder a 1994 Phare budget, EU and Romanian experts prepared an analysis of regional disparities in Romania, and drew up proposals for a legal and institutional framework for the development of regional policy.\n\nIn 1997, the conclusions of a Phare-financed study were published as a Green Paper on Regional Development, which proposed the establishment of a number of macro regions as planning units, based on associations of elected county councils. The Green Paper also defined a national framework for the development of regional policy and the financing of programmes.\n\nThe government adopted the main points of the Green Paper as its policy on regional development; consequently, a 1997 Phare budget was approved, providing support for institution building at national and regional level.\n\nIn 1998 a Law on Regional Development was passed, creating an appropriate institutional framework and establishing a National Agency for Regional Development and a National Fund for Regional Development.\n\nA 1998 Phare budget was approved, providing preliminary financial support for projects which would be proposed by the regions and financed out of the National Fund for Regional Development. Linked to this is technical assistance under the Special Preparatory Programme for Structural Funds, which provides further support and training to relevant institutions at regional and national level.\n\n196.\n\nIt is in this context that Romania adopted EGO 24/1998, which established the legislative framework for the incentives at issue in this arbitration. As noted in paragraph 145 above, the original version of EGO 24/1998 was passed on 30 September 1998 and entered into force on 2 October 1998.\n\n197.\n\nOn 22 March 1999, the Council of the EU issued Council Regulation (EC) No. 659/1999, which set out detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty with respect to the implementation of state aid measures and recovery of unlawful and incompatible state aid (Exh. R-128).11 Article 1 of this Regulation provided the following definitions:\n\n(b) \"existing aid\" shall mean: (i) all aid which existed prior to the entry into force of the Treaty in the respective Member States, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid which were put into effect before, and are still applicable after, the entry into force of the Treaty; [\u2026]\n\n(c) 'new aid' shall mean all aid, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid, which is not existing aid, including alterations to existing aid; [\u2026]\n\n(f) 'unlawful aid' shall mean new aid put into effect in contravention of Article 93(3) of the Treaty;\n\nArticles 88 and 89 of the EC Treaty (previously Articles 93 and 94 of the Treaty establishing the EEC) provided:  \n*Article 88 [previously Article 93]*  \n 1. The Commission shall, in cooperation with Member States, keep under constant review all systems of aid existing in those States. It shall propose to the latter any appropriate measures required by the progressive development or by the functioning of the common market.  \n 2. If, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that aid granted by a State or through State resources is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 87, or that such aid is being misused, it shall decide that the State concerned shall abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.  \n If the State concerned does not comply with this decision within the prescribed time, the Commission or any other interested State may, in derogation from the provisions of Articles 226 and 227, refer the matter to the Court of Justice direct.  \nOn application by a Member State, the Council may, acting unanimously, decide that aid which that State is granting or intends to grant shall be considered to be compatible with the common market, in derogation from the provisions of Article 87 or from the regulations provided for in Article 89, if such a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances. If, as regards the aid in question, the Commission has already initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the fact that the State concerned has made its application to the Council shall have the effect of suspending that procedure until the Council has made its attitude known.  \n If, however, the Council has not made its attitude known within three months of the said application being made, the Commission shall give its decision on the case.  \n 3. The Commission shall be informed, in sufficient time to enable it to submit its comments, of any plans to grant or alter aid. If it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 87, it shall without delay initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2.  \n The Member State concerned shall not put its proposed measures into effect until this procedure has resulted in a final decision.  \n*Article 89 [previously Article 94]*  \n The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may make any appropriate regulations for the application of Articles 87 and 88 and may in particular determine the conditions in which Article 88(3) shall apply and the categories of aid exempted from this procedure.\n\n198.\n\nUnder the Regulation, if the Commission considered that an existing aid scheme was not, or was no longer, compatible with the common market, it would consult with the Member State and issue a recommendation, which could consist in a substantive amendment of the aid scheme, the introduction of procedural requirements, or the abolition of the aid scheme. If the Member State did not accept the proposed measures, the Commission could initiate a formal investigation procedure (Articles 17-19, 4(4), 6-9 of the Regulation).\n\n199.\n\nOn 27 July 1999, Romania passed Law No. 142/1999 on state aid (the \"State Aid Law\", Exh. R-75), which granted the Competition Council a wide range of powers to regulate state aid in Romania, including the power to authorize or forbid the granting of state aid.\n\n200.\n\nIn its composite paper \"Reports on Progress towards Accession by each of the Candidate Countries\" dated 13 October 1999 (Exh. R-76), the EC noted that Romania had made \"some progress\" in aligning state aid laws.\n\n201.\n\nFor context, the Tribunal recalls that, during 1999, the following events relating to the EGO 24 framework and the Claimants' investments took place:\n\na. On 25 March 1999, by means of Government Decision No. 194/1999 (\"GD 194/1999\", Exh. C-31), Romania designated the \u015etei-Nucet region as a disfavored region for a period of ten years, starting on 1 April 1999, and stipulated that all six incentives offered under EGO 24/1998 would be available to investors in the \u015etei-Nucet region while that region was designated disfavored.\n\nb. As noted in paragraph 146 above, on 8 November 1999, Romania republished a renumbered version of EGO 24/1998 (Exh. R-68).\n\nc. On 9 December 1999, European Food obtained its Temporary Investor Certificate (Exh. C-442).\n\n**3. Romania and the EU begin formal accession negotiations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nOn 10 and 11 December 1999, the European Council met in Helsinki to take a series of decisions related to the EU's enlargement process. As reflected in the Presidency's Conclusions (Exh. R-11, C-318), the European Council decided to convene bilateral intergovernmental conferences in February 2000 to begin accession negotiations with Romania and other countries.\n\n203.\n\nIn February 2000, Romania began its formal accession negotiations with the EU. Chapter 6 was dedicated to competition policy.\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent's expert Prof. Streinz notes that in July 2000, \"[i]n accordance with its mandate under Article 106 of the Europe Agreement, the Association Council determined [...] to extend retroactively the application of Art. 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty to Romania for an additional period of five years.\" (First ER of R. Streinz, p. 7, note 22). According to Prof. Dashwood, this was done in Decision 4/2000 published in April 2001 (Exh. R-65; C-579).\n\n**4. The Decision of the Romanian Competition Council and amendments to the EGO 24 regime**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nOn 15 May 2000, the Romanian Competition Council, in the context of reviewing proposed amendments to EGO 24/1998, issued Decision No. 244/2000 (Exh. R-78), in which it determined, *inter alia*, that certain facilities provided under EGO 24/1998 distorted competition (specifically, the Raw Materials Incentive and the Components Incentive) and had to be eliminated. It stated:\n\nWhereas:\n\n3. Exemption from customs duties. on raw materials are deemed State aid for operating purposes and goes beyond the purpose of Emergency Government Ordinance No 24/1998 on Less-Favoured Areas, leading to distortion of competition. The granting of such facilities, subject to the conditions set forth in the Ordinance, solely to economic operators who make and register new investments puts the economic operators already in the market at a disadvantage, as was alleged before the Competition Council by both the Milling and Baking Industry Employers' Association and the Romanian Meat Association. Exemption from paying customs duties effectively stimulates imports to the detriment of domestic producers. Largescale importing of live pigs from Hungary and the mere slaughtering of these animals in Less Favoured Areas have occurred, with the meat being sold in the form of carcases and no significant degree of processing occurring. The cost of these products, which were subsidised in their country of origin and also benefited from the facilities provided by Emergency Government Ordinance No 24/1998, is lower and they are penetrating neighbouring markets, with the result that they are in competition with products produced outside Less Favoured Areas.\n\nThe Competition Council takes the view that the granting of these facilities is distorting competition within the market, and has also expressed this opinion in other similar cases.\n\n[...]\n\nOn the basis of Article 12(2) [unclear letter - possibly \"c\" or \"e\"], the Competition Council hereby takes the following.\n\nDECISION\n\nArticle 1. The aid scheme set forth in Article 6 of Emergency Government Ordinance No 24/1998 is authorised subject to the following conditions:\n\na) the provisions of Article 6(1)(b) of Emergency Government Ordinance No 24/1998 republished, concerning the reimbursement of customs duties on imported raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary for own production purposes within an area, and consequently, the proposed amendment concerning exemption from customs duties on raw materials shall be deleted;\n\n[\u2026]\n\nd) the methodological standards for the application of Emergency Government Ordinance No 24/1998 on Less Favoured Areas are to be submitted to the Competition Council for approval, in accordance with the provisions of Article 27(j) of Law No 21/1996.\n\nArticle 2. Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Law No 143/1999, the Competition Council may decide to suspend the State aid scheme if the aid provider fails to take the steps referred to in Article 1 of this Decision.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n206.\n\nIt was in this context that, on 1 June 2000, European Food was issued its PIC (see paragraph 174 above).\n\n207.\n\nOn 16 June 2000 (effective 1 July 2000), Romania passed Emergency Government Ordinance No. 75/2000 (\"EGO 75/2000\", Exh. C-45, R-81), which amended EGO 24/1998 in the following ways: (a) it provided for an exemption (rather than the refund originally contemplated) on customs duties on imported raw materials; (b) it excluded spare parts and components from the customs duty exemption, and (c) it amended the provisions regarding the award of funds under the Special Development Fund. It did not eliminate the Raw Materials Incentive and the Components Incentive, as recommended by the Competition Council.\n\n**5. Romania's progress towards accession in the period 2000-2001**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nOn 1 August 2000, the Romanian government presented a Position Paper on Chapter 6 (Competition Policy) (Exh. EC-1), in which Romania \"accepts the entire *acquis communautaire* in force on 31 December 1999, does not request transition periods or derogations and declares that it will be able to entirely implement it upon accession.\" However, Romania added that:\n\nRegarding the state aid rules and agreeing to the principles provided for in Art. 87 and 88 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, it is necessary to grant state aids to the sensitive sectors of economy and the deprived areas due to the difficulties confronting the Romanian economy during the transition to a market economy.\n\nIt is also obvious that, after accession, Romania's development level will not exceed the EU average, and, consequently, the whole territory of Romania will comply with the conditions laid down in Art. 87(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n\n209.\n\nIn this Position Paper, Romania gave a detailed description of EGO 24/1998, as amended by EGO 75/2000:\n\nRegional development. Deprived areas\n\nBased on the Romanian legislation, namely the Law on Regional Development no. 151/1998, eight development regions were established. Those regions correspond to the NUTS II level of the European classification. At that level, the programs and projects of regional development are funded through the National Fund for Regional Development that was established according to the Law no. 151/1998. The funds for these programmes are yearly allocated through the state budget as distinct item [sic] for the policy on regional development and also from other domestic and foreign resources. The National Agency for Regional Development administers, as provided for in the law, the National Fund for Regional Development by annual allocations of funds to the eight Funds for Regional Developments that were established in accordance to same law and are managed by eight Agencies for Regional Development. The funds allocated in this manner are granted to the recipients on competitive basis, such as tendering for regional development projects.\n\nThe Government Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the deprived areas (D areas) ensures a framework for granting state aid for the NUTS IV (villages) to NUTS III (counties) areas. Since July 1999 the majority of facilities granted to the investors within those areas became applicable after the Methodological Rules which were authorised by Government Decision no. 525/1999, came into effect.\n\nOn 16 June 2000, the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 75 amending the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998 was adopted, the main facilities granted to the investors acting within the D areas being the following:\n\n- customs duty and VAT exemptions for machinery, equipment, motor-vehicles, other capital assets which are imported for making investments within the area;\n\n- VAT exemption for the domestic machinery, equipment, motor-vehicles, other capital assets which are used for making investments within the area;\n\n- customs duty exemption for the raw materials imported for producing within the area; profit tax exemption during the existence of the 0 area;\n\n- fee exemption for the alteration of destination or driving out from agricultural use of lands necessary for the investment.\n\nIn accordance to the legislation in force, the terms under which the investors are deemed to benefit of the mentioned facilities are the following:\n\n- the facilities are granted only to the companies where the majority is owned by private shareholders, Romanian legal persons; to private undertakings or family associations which are licensed in accordance to the Law no. 54/1990;\n\n- the companies must have their headquarters and act within the D area;\n\n- the new investment to be made and registered within the financial records of the undertaking, after the qualification of [sic] as a D area;\n\n- the investment to be made within the interest fields which are covered by the Government Decision qualifying the area as D area;\n\n- through investment new jobs must be created for the unemployed people which live within the D area;\n\n- the goods for which facilities, such as fee exemption, must be used for investments/production within the D area;\n\n- the investment within the D area must be in function for a period twice as long as the period when the facilities were granted, otherwise, the investor is held to reimburse the amounts granted as facilities.\n\n210.\n\nOn 31 October 2000, at an Accession Conference with Romania, fifteen EU Member States and Romania adopted the first European Union Common Position on Competition Policy (\"EU Common Position 2000\", Exh. EC-2). In this Common Position, the EU stated:\n\nThe EU underlines the particular importance of the \"acquis\" under chapter 6 for the proper functioning of the internal market, including the creation of a level playing field for investment. The significance of the \"acquis\" is such that Romania has undertaken, under the Europe Agreement, to comply with the Community rules on competition. Thus, while welcoming Romania's statement that it accepts the \"acquis\" and will apply it as from the accession, the EU underlines that the \"acquis\" under chapter 6, in accordance with the Europe Agreement, has to be applied by Romania already now. In this context, the EU also underlines the importance of reinforcing the administrative capacity for effective implementation and enforcement of the \"acquis\". Therefore, the EU will conduct a general assessment of whether Romania has set up effective structures to enforce and apply the relevant substantive rules of the \"acquis\". Moreover, the full and immediate application of the \"acquis\" is also necessary in order to adapt companies well before the date of accession to be able to withstand the competitive pressures of the internal market resulting from the full and direct application of the competition \"acquis\" upon accession. It is inconceivable that the Romanian economy would be able to support the switching from one day to the next to the full and correct application of the \"acquis\".\n\n211.\n\nWith respect to the timely implementation of the Europe Agreement and the fulfillment of accession criteria in the state aid field, the EU invited Romania, *inter alia*, to\n\n- provide details regarding existing aid measures (i.e. those programs on the basis of which aid continues to be granted and which existed already before the entry into force of the present state aid law). In particular, Romania should explain which measures are envisaged for bringing such aid into line with the EU \"acquis\";\n\n- provide a more detailed analysis of the aid facilities in the so-called D areas of the country. In particular, Romania should explain what action, in light of the Community Guidelines on Regional Aid, the Competition Council has taken with regard to the Government Ordinances providing for these aid facilities.\n\n212.\n\nIn its Regular Report on Romania's progress towards accession dated 8 November 2000, the EC noted that:\n\nRomania has made further progress in the transposition in the *acquis* in this chapter.\n\nFurther alignment with the EC competition legislation and the improvement of the administrative capacity in this field is a short-term priority in the Accession Partnership.\n\nRomania's anti-trust legislation is largely in line with the *acquis*. During the period under consideration the legislative framework for anti-trust has been developed further by the adoption of secondary legislation. The anti-trust enforcement authorities have dealt with an increasing number of cases. The main challenge is now to ensure that the application and enforcement of the anti-trust rules is effective and that priority is given to such cases that concern the most serious distortions of competition. In order to achieve this, the administrative capacity of the Romanian Competition Council and Competition Office will need to be reinforced.\n\nAs concerns state aid the entry into force of the new state aid law on 1 January 2000 and the subsequent adoption of secondary legislation is an important step forward. However, the major challenge is to ensure that the legislation will be properly implemented and enforced. The recent adoption of the law on \u2018industrial parks' is a major concern.\n\nState aid reports have still to be submitted for the years 1998 and 1999. The latest report broadly follows the methodology and the presentation of the Community's Survey on State Aid. Additional work is needed in order to finalise a comprehensive state aid inventory covering all aid measures in operation in Romania.\n\nIn order to ensure a differentiation of maximum aid intensities in assisted areas, Romania still has to prepare a regional aid map in consultation with the Commission.\n\n213.\n\nOn 28 February 2001, Romania issued its Complementary Position Paper on Chapter 6 (Competition Policy) (Exh. EC-3). In this Complementary Position Paper, Romania explained the EGO 24/1998 incentive regime as follows:\n\nThrough the Emergency Ordinance no. 75/2000 modifying the Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the deprived areas, the following facilities may be granted to the investors within D areas:\n\n- customs duty and VAT exemptions for machinery, equipment, installations, motor-vehicles, other capital assets which are imported for making investments within the area;\n\n- VAT exemption for the domestic machinery, equipment, installations, motor vehicles, other capital assets, which are used for making investments within the area;\n\n- customs duty exemption for the raw materials imported for the own production within the area;\n\n- profit tax exemption during the existence of D area;\n\n- fee exemption for the alteration of destination or driving out from agricultural use of lands necessary for the investment.\n\nFacilities provided for by Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) no. 24/1998, amended by GEO no. 75/2000, are granted to undertakings operating within deprived areas, mention being made that in the deprived area co financing is approved only for projects selected by the National Agency for Regional Development (NARD) through public tender, nationwide, and within \"Special Programs\", as approved by decision of the Government, programs which have been notified to the Competition Council.\n\n[The] Competition Council analyzed the existing state aid scheme provided in GEO no. 24/1998; it found out that it seriously distorts competition, and thus issued Decision no. 244/15.05.2000 whereby it authorized with conditions the state aid scheme as contained in art. 6 of the GEO no. 24/1998. Providing for the elimination of art. 6 (I)(b) referring to refunding of customs duties for imported raw materials, spare parts and/or components dedicated to the own production in the deprived area, and for modification of art..6 (I)(c), mainly, the exemption from profit tax payment during the existence of the deprived area shall be done only for plowed-back profit. The modification of the existing state aid scheme contained in 311.6 of the GED no. 24/1998, referring to exemption from customs duty payment for imported raw materials, notified by NARD, has not been authorized by the Competition Council.\n\nGEO no. 75/2000 amending GED no. 24/1998 overlooked the conditions set by the Competition Council through Decision no. 244/15.05.2000, and maintained the facilities in art. 6 (l)(b) and (c) of GEO no. 24/1998. Although the Competition Council did not authorize the modification of the state aid scheme, GEO no. 75/2000 provides for exemption from payment of custom duties for imported raw materials for the own production in the deprived area.\n\nIn December 2000, the Competition Council has brought action at the Court of Appeals alleging failure to comply with Competition Council's Decision no. 244/15.05.2000 by the Government, which authorized, with conditions, the modification of the state aid scheme within GEO no. 24/1998, modification made through GEO 00.75/2000.\n\nThe request was made in front of the Court of Appeals to cancel GED no. 75/2000 and to recover the state aid.\n\nThe Government will made [sic] a study in order to assess the effects of enforcing this Ordinance, and further takes necessary measures.\n\n214.\n\nOn 10 April 2001, the EU-Romania Association Council adopted Decision 4/2000 (the \"Implementing Rules\", Exh. R-65), which prescribed the manner in which Article 64 of the Europe Agreement would be implemented by Romania.\n\n215.\n\nIn its Regular Report on Romania's progress towards accession dated 13 November 2001 (Exh. R-141), the EC provided the following assessment of Romania's competition policy:\n\nRomania has made considerable progress in creating a legal framework in this area that is broadly aligned with the Community *acquis*. However, additional efforts are necessary to complete the legal framework and ensure its adequate enforcement.\n\nAs regards anti-trust, Romania's legislation is largely in line with, and covers most of, the *acquis* provisions. However, further secondary legislation still needs to be adopted, to take account of the Commission's new vertical restraints policy and its policy on horizontal cooperation agreements. The Competition Council has broad powers to enforce competition rules but will need further reinforcements- especially in the form of training and IT equipment, in order to fulfil the tasks assigned to it. It is essential that the Competition Council could focus its resources more effectively on cases with most serious distortions to competition. A more deterrent sanctioning policy will also be required. Finally, general transparency, including an improved access of the public to relevant documents should be increased.\n\nAs regards state aids, the existing legislation covers the basic principles of state aid control. However, the field of application of this law is not comprehensive and numerous state aid measures are not notified to the competition authorities. Romania should rapidly adopt the required secondary legislation on state aids, which is currently being prepared. This is a precondition to any effective enforcement activities. A significant number of unaligned aid schemes remains such as the profit tax rate 5% on export earnings and the law on direct investment promotion. Moreover, implementation of state aid policy in sensitive sectors is still at an early stage. There are continuous problems with the monitoring of frequent waivers by public bodies of the accumulated debt.\n\nRomania has now formally adopted state aid reports for the period 1996 -1999 but has yet to finalise the state aid inventory. In addition, Romania's recent proposal for the regional aid map would allow aid intensities for regional investment aid of up to 50% net grant equivalent. In the area of state aids, both the Competition Office and the Competition Council require further strengthening in terms of human resources and training.\n\nIn addition to strengthening administrative capacity within the competition authorities, particular attention should also be given to intensifying the training of the judiciary in the specific fields of anti-trust and state aid. There is also a need to raise awareness amongst all market participants, and especially amongst administrations granting state aids, of the policy and legislative provisions in this area.\n\n216.\n\nThe EU Common Position issued on 21 November 2001 (the \"2001 EU Common Position\", Exh. EC-5) once again stressed \"the particular importance of the *acquis* under chapter 6 for the proper functioning of the internal market, including the creation of a level playing field for investment\", and reminded Romania that \"the *acquis* under chapter 6, in accordance with the Europe Agreement, has to be applied by Romania already now.\" The EU Common Position also stated:\n\nThe EU further notes that there are a number of existing as well as new incompatible aid schemes which have not been brought into line with the *acquis*. The EU notes that such schemes include in particular the new draft law on industrial parks, the fiscal facilities offered in the free areas which are set up under Law No. 84/1992, the reduced rate of corporate income tax of 5% for income from exports, and facilities provided under Emergency Ordinances no. 24/1998 and 75/2000 in the so-called \"D-areas\". The EU urges Romania to align the existing incompatible aid schemes without delay. (2001 EU Common Position, p. 4)\n\n217.\n\nHowever, the 2001 EU Common Position also stated:\n\nWith regard to aid which Romania wishes to operate beyond the date of accession, the EU invites Romania to draw up a list of those existing aid measures which the Competition Council considers as compatible with the *acquis*. The EU invites Romania to transmit this list to the Commission; Romania may continue to operate any aid which is included in the list and against which the Commission has not objected for the period for which the aid was approved by the Competition Council. A reference to the existing aid list and to the procedure for its establishment will be included in the Accession Treaty. (2001 EU Common Position, p. 4)\n\n**6. Further amendments to the EGO 24 Regime (2000-2001)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nOn 29 November 2000, by means of Government Decision No. 1199/2000 (Exh. C-32) Romania extended the boundaries of the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored region to include Dragane\u015fti, and specified that the entire region would remain disfavored until 31 March 2009.\n\n219.\n\nOn 26 January 2001, by means of Civil Decision No. 26 (Exh. C-582, R-140), the Bucharest Court of Appeals dismissed the Competition Council's application for the partial annulment of EGO 75/2000.\n\n220.\n\nOn 26 April 2001, Government Decision No. 728/2001 repealed the earlier methodological norms [for the implementation of] EGO 24/1998 and provided new methodological norms (the \"2001 Methodological Norms\", Exh. R-69, R-35).\n\n221.\n\nIn August 2001, Prime Minister Nastase announced a new policy in relation to the establishment of new disfavored regions and the time periods for which the zones would be declared disfavored. As reported by the press, he stated that \"for the existing zones, the current law shall be maintained\", although \"the economic and social status of the area shall be considered when allotting budgetary funds, with a view to balance facilities through the level of budgetary allotments\" (Exh. C-630).\n\n222.\n\nOn 7 November 2001, Romania passed Law No. 621/2001 (Exh. R-33, R-129), which amended EGO 75/2000 by, among others, reinstating the customs duties exemption on imported components.\n\n**7. Parallel developments in the EU and EGO 24 fronts (2002)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nIn its Regular Report on Romania's progress towards accession dated 9 October 2002, the EC noted that \"there are still a large number of incompatible fiscal aid schemes which need to be aligned\" (Exh. R-109).\n\n224.\n\nOn 19 February 2002, the High Court of Cassation of Justice of Romania rejected, on admissibility grounds, the lawsuit brought by the Competition Council for the partial annulment of EGO 75/2000 (Exh. C-643).\n\n225.\n\nOn 17 May 2002, Multipack and Starmill were issued their PICs (see paragraphs 175-176 above). Both PICs stated that they would be valid until 1 April 2009.\n\n226.\n\nOn 29 May 2002, Romania and Sweden signed the Bilateral Investment Treaty under which this arbitration is brought (Exh. C-1). Romania ratified the BIT through Law No. 651/2002 (Exh. C-15) enacted on 7 December 2002. The BIT entered into force on 1 April 2003.\n\n227.\n\nOn 1 June 2002, Romania passed Law No. 345/2002 (Exh. R-90), which abolished two of the incentives contemplated under EGO 24/1998, the Machinery Incentive and the VAT Incentive.\n\n228.\n\nIn June 2002, the Romanian Government issued a \"Report on the progress in preparing for the accession to the European Union September 2001-May 2002\", dated June 2002 (Exh. HEC-6), which stated that:\n\nAll existing State aid measures will be assessed, establishing their compatibility with the acquis in order to suggest measures eliminating or transforming the incompatible ones in compatibles [sic] aids, taking into account the legal and economic implication of the modification of any incompatible schemes on the already granted specific allocations.\n\nThis approach will be made according to the European Commission recommendation and will take into consideration [sic] following three steps: (i) closing the incompatibles [sic] schemes in order to stop potential future allocations; (ii) the modification of these scheme to reach the compatibility with the acquis; (iii) the identification of the solutions for the economic agents that received the State aid under the present schemes (e.g. Free areas, deprived areas etc). [...] (p. 132)\n\n229.\n\nMore specifically with respect to EGO 24, it stated that:\n\nRegarding the \"D areas\", the State aid granted in the present ***must*** **[]** ***be converted into a compatible State aid.*** The Ministry of Development and Prognosis started the technical debates with the beneficiary associations in order to identify solutions and to make, in 2 months, proposals for alteration of the present system of facilities. (p. 133)\n\n230.\n\nAt the same time, Romania's \"National Programme for Accession of Romania to the European Union\" dated June 2002 (Exh. HEC-7) stated that \"[t]he provisions of the normative acts on facilities granted for 'D areas' will be maintained till the moment of Romania's accession to the European Union\" (p. 148).\n\n231.\n\nOn 1 July 2002, Romania passed Law No. 414/2002 (Exh. C-48), which repealed the Profit Tax Incentive but grandfathered it for investors who held a PIC prior to the date in which this law entered into force. The Profit Tax Incentive was later reintroduced on 1 January 2004 by Law No. 507/2004 (Exh. C-52).\n\n232.\n\nOn 7 November 2002, Romania provided the EC with Additional Information on Chapter 6 - Competition Policy (Exh. EC-6). With respect to EGO 24, Romania merely informed the Commission that state aid for the D-areas was regulated by Law 621/2001, which approved EGO 75/2000, and informed the Commission of the amendment to the VAT and the repeal of the profit tax incentive (noting that it had been grandfathered for PIC holders).\n\n\"D area\" granted facilities\n\nPresently in Romania D areas are regulated by Law no. 621/2001 on the approval of Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) no. 75/2000 for the alteration of Government Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998, republished, on deprived area (OG no. 737 of 19th November 2001), GEO no. 75/2000 for the alteration of GEO no. 24/1998, republished and GEO no. 24/1998 on deprived areas, approved and modified by Law no. 20/1999.\n\nThe regime of the facilities granted in '\"D\" areas was changed by the recent entering into force of the law on VAT and of the law on profit tax.\n\nThe Law 345/2002 on VAT entered into force on 01.06.2002 and abrogated the facility of exempting from VAT payment granted for machines, outfits, installations, equipments, means of transport, other depreciable goods imported or produced in the country that were necessary for the investments in a D area. This facility was stipulated in Art. 6(1) of the GEO no. 24/1998 regarding the regime of the deprived areas.\n\nThe Law no. 414/2002 (OG no. 456/27.06.2002) on profit tax abrogated the facility of exempting undertakings acting in \"D\" areas from the payment of the profit tax. This facility was stipulated in Art. 6(1), let. c) of the GEO no. 24/1998 regarding the regime of the deprived areas.\n\nFor ensuring the legislative continuity, the legal persons that had obtained the permanent certificate of investor in \"D\" area before the Law no. 414/2002 entered into force, will further benefit from the profit tax exemption on the whole duration of existence of the deprived area, according to Art. 35, par. 3.\n\n233.\n\nOn 19 November 2002, Romania passed Law No. 678/2002 (Exh. C-49) which amended the Raw Materials Incentive by excluding from the customs duties exemption raw materials for the production, processing and preservation of meat.\n\n**8. Events leading up to the revocation of EGO 24**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nOn 7 April 2003, the Mission of Romania to the EU sent a communication to the Romanian Minister for European Integration and other state officials, including Mr. Orban and Mr. Berinde (Communication No. 1480, Exh. R-93). It stated:\n\nCommunity officials stated clearly that the ***negotiations on this chapter may be closed if, and only if, the following conditions*** (relating primarily to State aid, which was found to have the highest potential to distort the Internal Market) ***are met:*** new aid must comply strictly with the acquis, ***existing aid must be aligned or in the process of being aligned*** (including in terms of duration; the granting of transition periods may be considered depending on the outcomes of discussions between the competent institutions in Romania and the relevant operators), and ALL cases of non-notified State aid must be analysed and resolved.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Commission stated that it had asked all of the candidate countries to bring their tax breaks into line with the acquis communautaire, including those granted in Free Zones or ***Less Favoured Areas***, which entails either their withdrawal or their conversion into compatible aid. In the latter case, ***negotiations with a view to converting them into compatible schemes*** ***must be pursued directly by the Competition Council with the economic operators concerned.*** Only once this has occurred can the companies for which transition periods may be negotiated with the EU be identified.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n235.\n\nIn its Common Position dated 28 May 2003 (Exh. EC-8), the EU invited Romania to provide information on benefits granted in disfavored regions and urged Romania to close \"incompatible aid schemes for new entrants with immediate effect.\" More specifically:\n\nThe EU recalls that all fiscal aid provisions, (for example those included in the VAT Law; the ***Law on customs duties exemptions*** - including benefits for transactions undertaken by firms located in industrial parks, free zones and ***disadvantaged areas*** [\u2026]) ***should be subject to the*** ***approval by the Competition Council. In cases where the Competition*** ***Council assesses the respective measures to be incompatible with*** ***the State aid rules, the EU invites Romania to either***  ***end***  ***the measures or to***  ***align***  ***them with the acquis.***\n\nThe EU invites Romania to bring all incompatible aid measures in line with the acquis without delay and to continue to provide information on the progress made towards this goal. [\u2026]\n\nThe EU moreover invites Romania to provide information on individual benefits granted in the free zones and the disadvantaged areas and on any other individual tax benefits that have already been granted and which provide for tax benefits beyond Romania's target date for accession. ***The EU urges Romania to***  ***close***  ***incompatible aid schemes for new entrants with immediate effect.***\n\nIn this context Romania is further invited to present a ***plan outlining how it intends to***  ***convert***  ***the benefits that are incompatible with the acquis***  and to hold further technical consultations with the Commission to explore the possibilities for this conversion.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nWith regard to aid which Romania wishes to operate beyond the date of accession, the EU recalls it's invitation to Romania to draw up a list of those existing aid measures which the Competition Council considers as compatible with the acquis and to transmit this list to the Commission. The EU recalls that Romania may continue to operate any aid which is included in the list and against which the Commission has not objected for the period for which the aid was approved by the Competition Council. A reference to the existing aid list and to the procedure for its establishment will be included in the Accession Treaty.\n\nThe EU recalls that the ***existing aid measures*** are subject in accordance with Article 88(1) of the EC Treaty to the ***appropriate measures procedure***, under which the Commission can, in cooperation with the (future) Member State, propose changes to an aid measure for the future. To the extent that Romania wishes to benefit from this mechanism, the EU invites Romania to present the following to the Commission, every six months as from 1 January 2002, and up until the date of accession:\n\n(a) a list of all existing aid measures (both schemes and ad hoc aid) (i) which have been assessed by the Competition Council and (ii) which it found to be compatible with the *acquis* ; (b) any other information which is essential for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid measures referred to under (a).\n\nDetails on the precise format for this reporting have been provided by the Commission.\n\nThe EU underlines that all aid measures in Romania which are considered State aid according to the acquis and which are not included in this list shall be considered as new aid upon Romania's accession. After that date, application of such an aid measure will be conditional upon Romania's notification of it pursuant to Article 88 of the EC Treaty, and a decision of the Commission that the aid measure in question is compatible with the Common Market. As regards individual aid, no measures which continue to have effects after accession and which are incompatible will be acceptable.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n236.\n\nOn 23 December 2003, Law No. 571/2003 on the Fiscal Code (Exh. R-37) revoked Law 345/2002, thus reinstating the Machinery Incentive and the VAT Incentive.\n\n237.\n\nIn an interview on national TV conducted on 12 January 2004, Prime Minister Nastase indicated that the incentives regime provided by EGO 24/1998 could be terminated due to EU requirements. However, he also stated that the Government was examining whether some of the incentives would remain in place until 2007, noting that the Government had negotiated some transition periods with the EU and that they were trying to find \"elegant solutions\" (Exh. C-651). When asked to confirm if certain investors could benefit from the program until 2007, Minister Nastase stated that they would try to negotiate an extension that would allow the incentives to remain in place until that time. When asked what would happen to investors who had invested large amounts of money, the Minister stated that the Government was negotiating with each investor.\n\n238.\n\nOn 24 March 2004, Romania issued its Complementary Position Paper III on Chapter 6 - Competition Policy (Exh. EC-9). With respect to EGO 24/1998, Romania noted:\n\nThe Ministry of Administration and Interior elaborated a draft law for completing the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the regime of deprived areas. The draft provides that the facilities the undertakings that have an investor certificate and operate in deprived areas benefit from, will be granted below the maximum admitted intensity foreseen in the Regulation on regional aid. At present, the draft normative act is under inter-ministerial endorsement procedure.\n\nBy entering into force of the Fiscal Code, the fiscal facilities have been significantly diminished. In fact, ***the undertakings with investor certificate in the deprived areas will benefit from*** the exemption from the payment of the taxes perceived for changing the destination or removing from the agrarian circuit of certain fields designated to achieving the investment as well as ***the exemption from the custom duties payment for raw materials and imported components, excepting the import of the raw material for meat production, processing and preserving***. Also the undertakings that obtained before 1 July 2003 the permanent certificate of investor in the deprived area, will benefit from exemption from the profit tax payment related to the new investment, during the whole existing duration of the deprived area.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n239.\n\nIn May 2004, in an interview in Oradea, Bihor County (Exh. C-652), Prime Minister Nastase indicated that \"[s]ubsequent to 2007, when we want to be accepted in the European Union, these disfavored areas will no longer exist in Romania.\" When asked about compensation to investors in those areas, the Prime Minister answered that Romania would discuss these matters during its negotiations with the European Union and they would see if Romania was \"able to obtain some transition periods for them.\" The Prime Minister specified that \"there will be no fiscal incentives, there will be some compensation packages, established during direct negotiations.\" The Prime Minister also stated that the government would talk to the investors, and \"based on the conclusions of the negotiations of the Competition Chapter, we will negotiate with those who initially obtained these fiscal incentives\" (Exh. C-652, pp. 7-9 of translation).\n\n240.\n\nOn 7 June 2004, Romania passed Law No. 239/2004 to supplement EGO 24/1998 (Exh. R-147). This law subjected all state aid to a maximum intensity requirement.12 In other words, it provided that the EGO 24/1998 facilities could not exceed the thresholds of permissible state aid approved by the Competition Council. If investors exceeded the maximum permitted intensity, the facilities would cease to be granted.\n\nIn June 2004, Romania passed Law 239/2004, which made all State aid subject to a maximum-intensity requirement. According to a definition provided by the Respondent, \"[v]alid intensity is measured as the amount of aid in relation to the costs of production or the costs of investment of the company or project that receives the aid.\" P. Nicolaides, M. Kekelekis, P. Buyskes, State Aid Policy in the European Community (2nd edn 2005) (Exh. RL-179), p. 38.\n\n241.\n\nOn 31 August 2004, by means of Government Ordinance No. 94/2004 (\"GO 94/2004\", Exh. R-94), Romania repealed Article 6(1)b)d) and e) of EGO 24/1998, thus repealing/revoking the incentives provided under EGO 24/1998, including the Raw Materials Incentive, with the exception of the Tax Profit Incentive. The repeal was originally to become effective 90 days from the date of entry into force of GO 94/2004 (that is, on 3 December 2004). However, the date of repeal was subsequently extended to 22 February 2005 by means of Law No. 507/2004 of 22 November 2004 (Exh. C-52), which approved and amended GO 94/2004 to that effect. The substantiation report accompanying GO 94/2004 stated:\n\nIn order to meet the criteria in the Community rules on state aid, and also to complete the negotiations under Chapter No. 6 - Policy it is necessary to eliminate all forms of State aid in national legislation incompatible with the *acquis communautaire* in this area and, in this respect, it is proposed to repeal [\u2026] the provisions of Article 6 paragraph (1), letter (b), letter (d) and letter (e) of the Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the disadvantaged areas [\u2026]\n\n(Substantiation Report accompanying EGO 94/2004, 26 August 2004, Exh. R-95, pp. 12-13).\n\n242.\n\nOn 13 September 2004, the Claimants requested Romania to restore the tax incentive regime (Exh. C-8, ER of G. Piperea, \u00b6 5.3).\n\n243.\n\nOn 8 December 2004, the EU issued a Common Position (\"2004 EU Common Position\", Exh. EC-10), in which it welcomed the amendments to the regimes related to Free Trade Areas and Deprived Areas. In this context, the EU noted that Romania had requested two transitional periods, one with respect to the Profit Tax Incentive under EGO 24/1998 and another with respect to a royalty exemption under Law No. 84/1992. The EU accepted both transitional arrangements proposed by Romania. With respect to the Deprived Areas, this meant that investors holding a PIC granted prior to 1 July 2003 could continue to benefit from the Profit Tax Incentive for as long as the Deprived Areas continued to exist, under certain conditions (limited to 2008, 2009 or 2010, depending on the deprived area; net intensity of aid granted must remain below certain specified aid ceilings and the eligible costs must be defined in accordance with the Regional Aid Guidelines).\n\n244.\n\nOn 22 February 2005, the revocation of the EGO 24/1998 incentives (with the exception of the Profit Tax Incentive) became effective.\n\n245.\n\nAlso on 22 February 2005, the EC issued its Opinion on Romania's EU application (Exh. R-50) where it stated:\n\n(7) In joining the European Union, the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania accept, without reserve, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, and until its entry into force, the Treaty on European Union and the Treaties establishing the European Communities including all their objectives and all decisions taken since their entry into force, and the options taken in respect of the development and strengthening of those Communities and of the Union.\n\n(8) It is an essential feature of the legal order introduced by the Treaties establishing the European Communities and, at its entry into force, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe that certain of their provisions and certain acts adopted by the institutions are directly applicable, that the law of the Union takes precedence over any national provisions which might conflict with it, and that procedures exist for ensuring the uniform interpretation of the law of the Union; accession to the European Union implies recognition of the binding nature of these rules, observance of which is indispensable to guarantee the effectiveness and unity of the law of the Union.\n\n**9. Subsequent events**\n------------------------\n\n246.\n\nOn 25 April 2005, the Member States of the EU signed the Accession Treaty with Romania and Bulgaria (the \"Accession Treaty\", Exh. R-27). The Treaty was to enter into force on 1 January 2007 [i.e., this would be the date of accession]. However, pursuant to Article 4(3), the institutions of the EU could adopt before accession certain measures specified in the Protocol annexed to the Accession Treaty, which set out the conditions and arrangements for admission. Annex VII to the Accession Protocol (Exh. R-52, R-98), Section 4 on Competition Policy, subsection A on Fiscal Aid, set out the transitional period with respect to the Profit Tax Incentive referred to in the 2004 EU Common Position. With respect to the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored regions, it stated that Romania could continue granting the Profit Tax Exemption until 31 December 2009, subject to certain state aid intensity requirements and other conditions.\n\n247.\n\nOn 28 July 2005, the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration.\n\n248.\n\nOn 4 March 2006, the EC issued the Guidelines on National Regional Aid for 20072013 (Exh. C-298), which set out the principles according to which EU Member States could grant regional aid to disadvantaged areas. With respect to operating aid, the Guidelines provided:\n\nRegional aid aimed at reducing a firm's current expenses (operating aid) is normally prohibited. Exceptionally, however, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) provided that (i) it is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development and its nature and (ii) its level is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate (69). It is for the Member State to demonstrate the existence and importance of any handicaps (70). In addition, certain specific forms of operating aid can be accepted in the low population density regions and the least populated areas.\n\n249.\n\nOn 1 January 2007, the Accession Treaty entered into force and Romania became a Member State of the EU.\n\n**IV. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the Parties' positions. The Parties' detailed positions with respect to each claim are described in Section VI below (Analysis of the Claimants' Treaty Claims).\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants' case has evolved over time. Although its core elements remain unchanged, the focus of the Claimants' arguments has shifted, as has the structure of these arguments.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimants contend that \"[i]n the course of enacting, promoting and implementing the EGO 24 regime, the Respondent made unambiguous and binding commitments to foreign investors, the Micula brothers, that they would be granted a number of incentives for a 10 year period in return for making certain large investments in one of the poorest and least developed regions of Romania\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 1). The Claimants claim that, in specific reliance on these commitments, and in particular in reliance on the expectation that the incentives would last through the entire 10 year period, the Claimants invested massively in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti area, one of Romania's most remote and disfavored regions.\n\n253.\n\nIn the latest formulation of their case, the Claimants argue that Romania entered into these binding commitments through EGO 24; its implementing legislation, in particular GD 194/1999; and the issuance of Permanent Investor Certificates (PICs) to the three Corporate Claimants. The Claimants submit that these PICs certified that the Claimants had the right to receive the incentives until 1 April 2009, which was also the date in which \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti would cease to be considered a disfavored region.\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Romania's binding commitment to provide the incentives to the Claimants until 1 April 2009 gave rise to a right to receive those incentives until that date, or at least generated a legitimate expectation that they would benefit from those incentives until that date. The Claimants contend that Romania's revocation of these incentives effective 22 February 2005 (approximately 4 years before they were set to expire) breached that commitment or undermined that legitimate expectation.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Romania's premature revocation of the incentives was unfair and unlawful. While Romania argues that it was forced to revoke the incentives to comply with EU requirements, the Claimants assert that the incentives were in fact compatible with EU law, and no competent authority had issued a decision requiring Romania to terminate the incentives. The Claimants also complain that Romania did not attempt to negotiate with either the EU or the Claimants to find a solution that would mitigate the adverse effects on their business of the premature revocation of the incentives. The Claimants argue that, most egregiously, Romania revoked only the provisions of EGO 24 that established the incentives, while retaining those that set out the Claimants' obligations to remain invested in the \u015etei-Nucet- Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti region for twice the time they received the incentives.\n\n256.\n\nIn view of the above, the Claimants argue that Romania has breached the Claimants' rights under the Sweden-Romania BIT and under international law. Specifically, they contend that the premature revocation of the EGO 24 incentives:\n\na. Breached a clear commitment undertaken by Romania vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants, and therefore breached the BIT's umbrella clause contained in Article 2(4) of the BIT;\n\nb. Undermined the Claimants' legitimate expectations, upset the stability of the regulatory regime, lacked transparency and consistency, and was taken in bad faith, and therefore breached Romania's obligation under Article 2(3) of the BIT to afford the Claimants fair and equitable treatment;\n\nc. Impaired by unreasonable measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of the Claimants' investments, and therefore breached Article 2(3) of the BIT; and\n\nd. Expropriated without compensation the Claimants' right to receive the incentives and substantially deprived their entire investment of value, and therefore breached Article 4(1) of the BIT.\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimants claim that, because the early revocation of these incentives violated an obligation entered into by Romania vis-\u00e0-vis the investors (and thus breached the BIT's umbrella clause), the revocation also undermined the Claimants' legitimate expectations (and consequently breached the BIT's fair and equitable treatment standard). However, in the Claimants' view, even if the premature revocation of the incentives does not breach the umbrella clause (e.g., because the promise allegedly made by the Respondent does not rise to the level of an obligation protected by the umbrella clause), the Tribunal could still find a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard because the revocation upset the Claimants' legitimate expectations (Tr., Day 12, 126:22-128:6 (Reed)).\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the termination of the incentives was required under EU law. The Claimants allege that, to the contrary, the incentives were one of the factors that allowed Romania to accede to the EU in the first place. Indeed, the Claimants argue that Romania desperately needed economic development, particularly in certain distressed regions, to be able to join the EU. In their view, incentive programs such as EGO 24 greatly contributed to this development.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Romania has failed to show how the EGO 24 incentives conflicted with EU law and that Romania has not provided evidence that the EU required the termination of the incentives in order to obtain accession.\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimants specific arguments with respect to the alleged treaty breaches are discussed in Section VI below (Analysis of the Claimants' Treaty Claims).\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimants argue that these breaches caused substantial damage to the Claimants, as set out in Section VII below (Damages).\n\n262.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Claimants request the following relief:\n\nThe Claimants request an award be made granting the relief set out in paragraphs 1 to 6 below.\n\nAny damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to the individual Claimants, Ioan Micula and Viorel Micula, to be divided between them on a 50:50 basis.\n\nIn the alternative, any damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to all five Claimants.\n\n1. A declaration that Romania has violated the Sweden-Romania Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"Treaty\") and customary international law by:\n\n1.1 failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants' investments (Article 2(3) of the Treaty) by treating the Claimants' investments in a manner that was inconsistent, ambiguous, and not transparent;\n\n1.2 failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants' investments (Article 2(3) of the Treaty) by violating the Claimants' legitimate expectations regarding their investments;\n\n1.3 impairing the Claimants' investments through unreasonable and discriminatory measures (Article 2(3) of the Treaty);\n\n1.4 failing to observe obligations entered into with the Claimants with regard to their investments (Article 2(4) of the Treaty); and\n\n1.5 expropriating the Claimants' investments without the payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation (Article 4(1) of the Treaty).\n\n2. Damages for the following losses suffered by the Claimants:\n\n**A. Expectation losses**\n\n2.1 Losses suffered as a result of the increased cost of raw materials following revocation of the incentives provided by Emergency Government Ordinance 24/1998 (\"Incentives\") and the lost opportunity to build a sugar stockpile in 2009, comprising:\n\n(a) increased costs of sugar in the amount of RON 85.1 million;\n\n(b) increased costs of PET in the amount of RON 6.3 million;\n\n(c) increased costs of raw materials other than sugar and PET in the amount of RON 17.5 million; and\n\n(d) lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in 2009 in the amount of RON 62.5 million.\n\n2.2 Financial penalties incurred but not yet paid as a result of the Claimants being financially constrained due to the losses incurred as a result of the revocation of the Incentives in the amount of RON 63.65 million as 30 September 2010 unless these financial penalties are waived by the Respondent and a declaration that the Respondent shall waive or reimburse all additional financial penalties imposed or assessed until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n2.2A Financial penalties paid by the Micula brothers' companies in the period 1 April 2005 to 30 September 2010 in the amount of RON 40 million.\n\n2.3 Lost profits on sales of finished goods following revocation of the Incentives of no less than RON 427 million.\n\n2.4 Lost profits on sales of Sugar Containing Products (\"SCPs\") following revocation of the Incentives in the amount of RON 492.3 million.\n\n2.5 Lost profits incurred as a result of the Claimants' inability to complete their incremental investments following revocation of the Incentives comprising:\n\n(a) a malt plant in the amount of RON 28 million;\n\n(b) a cogeneration [p]lant in the amount of RON 712.6 million; and\n\n(c) a canning [p]lant and subsequent sales of private label beer in the amount of RON 720.4 million.\n\n2.6 In the alternative to paragraphs 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 above, lost profits on sales of finished goods following revocation of the Incentives in the amount of RON 2423.2 million.\n\n**B. Reliance losses**\n\n2.7 In the alternative to the losses described in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2A, and 2.3 to 2.6 above, but not 2.2, the amounts lost by the Claimants as a result of investing in reliance on the Incentives in the amount of RON 811 million.\n\n3. An award of interest on the damages payable pursuant to paragraph 2 above calculated in the following manner:\n\n3.1 For losses as described in paragraphs 2.1(a) to (c) above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR (Romanian Interbank Offer Rate) plus 5% from 1 March 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.2 For losses as described in paragraph 2.1(d) above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 July 2010 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.3 For penalties as described in paragraph 2.2A above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 July 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.4 For losses as described in paragraph 2.3 above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 May 2008 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.5 For losses as described in paragraph 2.4 above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 March 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.6 For losses as described in paragraph 2.5 above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 30 September 2009 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.7 For losses as described in paragraph 2.6 above, interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 15 August 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.8 For the amounts lost by the Claimants as a result of investing in reliance on the Incentives as described in paragraph 2.7 above, interest to be applied compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 January 2002 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.9 The ROBOR rate to be applied in relation to paragraphs 3.1 to 3.8 above is to be the average annual rate for each year or part thereof.\n\n4. The total amount of damages payable by the Respondent comprising the amounts set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 to be received net of any tax obligations imposed by Romania on the proceeds.\n\n5. All costs incurred by the Claimants in relation to these proceedings, including but not limited to the Claimants' lawyers' fees and expenses, experts' fees and expenses, and all costs of ICSID and the Tribunal.\n\n6. Any further relief that the Tribunal may deem fit and proper.\n\n(Claimants' Revised Request for Relief, footnotes omitted)\n\n263.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:13\n\n[...]\n\nb. provide in the Award that Romania is enjoined from any further tax collection measures of any kind in respect of the Claimants and the EFDC until such a time as the damages awarded by the Tribunal have been paid in full, and include a pecuniary alternative in case of nonperformance;\n\nc. issue a declaration that Romania is not entitled to set-off tax debts of the EFDC against an Award in favor of Claimants;\n\nd. order Romania to pay all of Claimants' costs in responding to this Application, including reasonable lawyers' fees and other costs; and\n\ne. grant any other relief that the Tribunal may deem fit and proper in these proceedings.\n\n(Claimants' Rejoinder on the Respondent's Revocation Application, \u00b6 75).\n\nThese additional requests were made in the context of the Respondent's application to revoke the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal. As noted in paragraph 111 above, the determination of these matters was deferred to the final Award.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThe Respondent rejects each of the Claimants' claims under the BIT.\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the key question in this case is \"who bore the risk of regulatory change: the state or the investors who benefitted from the existing regulatory regime\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 9).\n\n266.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the BIT does not require the Contracting States to tailor their laws and regulations to the preference of foreign investors, nor does it establish liability for every regulatory change that has a negative impact on the foreign investors' businesses. To the contrary, investment protection treaties accord host states considerable deference in relation to regulatory policy. As a result, the Respondent argues that where a state has exercised its sovereign powers to regulate in a general, non-discriminatory way to advance public welfare (including by legislative changes), such conduct is not an \"expropriation\", \"unfair and inequitable treatment\", or otherwise in breach of the provisions of an investment protection treaty. Absent a clear commitment from the state to stabilize a regulatory framework, states are usually free to change their laws.\n\n267.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent argues that businessmen know this, and factor regulatory risk into their business plans. According to the Respondent, the Claimants did not do so because they thought they had a special status that protected them from any regulatory changes.\n\n268.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent notes that it is undisputed that the modification of the facilities that had been granted pursuant to EGO 24/1998 was a generally applicable act. The Respondent also argues that it was compelled to curtail the facilities as an essential precondition to accession to the EU. Accordingly, the Tribunal should give deference to Romania's action when applying the substantive provisions of the BIT (R-CM, \u00b6 92).\n\n269.\n\nBuilding on this fundamental premise, the Respondent makes four main arguments.\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s first line of argument is that three (and possibly four) of the Claimants' claims fail because the Claimants have not proven that Romania made a binding promise to the Claimants that the facilities under EGO 24, either in their totality or the Raw Materials Facility individually, would remain unchanged until 2009. The Respondent argues that the Claimants' ability to establish the existence, terms and duration of this promise is an essential condition for the following three claims (although it is not a sufficient condition for the success of any of them) (Tr., Day 13, 60:2-65-7; 73:3-83-25 (Petrochilos)):\n\na. First, the existence of such a promise is the basis for the Claimants' assertions regarding their legitimate expectations, including their expectation of legal stability, and is therefore necessary for proving this aspect of the Claimants' fair and equitable treatment claim.\n\nb. Second, the existence of such a promise is necessary to establish the existence and scope of an obligation under Romanian law, the breach of which could result in the breach of the umbrella clause.\n\nc. Third, the existence of such a promise is allegedly what gave rise to the Claimants' right to the facilities, which Claimants assert has been expropriated.\n\n271.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' claims relating to an asserted lack of transparency and consistency in the regulatory regime are based on the notion that the Claimants were entitled to receive some kind of an advance notice or warning from Romania that the Raw Materials Incentive would change, because Romania had allegedly promised that the incentive would remain in place until 2009.\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants must prove two distinct components of this promise: (i) that the EGO 24 facilities would remain unchanged until 2009, and (ii) that the promise was contained in an instrument which either conferred individual rights on them, or was otherwise one on which they could legitimately rely as securing some form of entitlement that was specific to them and that would remain in place even in the case of a general legislative or regulatory change.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that, to establish any of these claims, the Claimants must prove that Romania's promise was binding under Romanian law:\n\na. With respect to the fair and equitable treatment claim, the Respondent argues that the Claimants must show that, after exercising due diligence, they legitimately and reasonably relied on an instrument which a reasonable investor, properly advised by Romanian lawyers, would have understood as an assurance of the immutability of the EGO 24 facilities.\n\nb. With respect to the umbrella clause and expropriation claims, the Respondent argues that the Claimants must show that they had an actionable vested right existing under Romanian law which was breached or expropriated.\n\n274.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants' claims fail because they have failed to establish the existence of a binding promise under Romanian law.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent's second line of argument is that, regardless of the existence of a promise, either the Claimants did not rely on the existence of that promise to make their investments, or any such reliance was unreasonable. The Respondent argues that, given the lack of reliance, the Claimants' fair and equitable treatment claim fails, even if a promise existed. In this respect (and as noted below), the Respondent argues that the Claimants' case hinges on the credibility of their witnesses, and their testimony is neither credible nor reliable (Tr., Day 13:19-43 (King)).\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s third line of argument is that the remaining claims (namely, the Claimants' other fair and equitable treatment claims and their claims that Romania impaired the Claimants' investments through unreasonable measures) fail because Romania's actions were reasonably related to a rational policy, which was EU accession. The Respondent also argues that the actions giving rise to the Claimants' assertions of lack of transparency and inconsistency in the regulatory regime were, in fact, reasonable and consistent with the BIT.\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent advances further arguments with respect to each of the Claimants' claims, which will be addressed in the specific analysis of each of the Claimants' claims in Chapter VI.\n\n278.\n\nFinally, as discussed in Section VII below, the Respondent challenges the Claimants\u2019 case on quantum.\n\n279.\n\nIn addition to these four main arguments, the Respondent challenges the credibility and reliability of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses. The Respondent argues that this lack of credibility and reliability was exposed during the November 2010 hearing on the merits, and that this is the reason why the Claimants shifted the focus of their case. Specifically, the Respondent argues that while the Claimants originally focused on their legitimate expectations claim (which requires proof of the Claimants\u2019 subjective reliance on their alleged expectations and of the reasonableness of that reliance), after the hearing on the merits the Claimants shifted their focus to their claims related to the umbrella clause, expropriation and transparency. According to the Respondent, these are \"claims that have nothing to do with the Claimants in particular\", and the Claimants shifted their focus to them because they believe that \"these are claims that might survive without the need to rely on the doubtful words of the Miculas and their employee witnesses\" (Tr., Day 13, 30:21-31:2 (King)).\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent has stated that its challenge to the credibility and reliability of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses extends to \"all aspects that the Claimants have asserted\" (Tr., Day 13, 62:6-8). However, given that the Respondent acknowledges that the umbrella clause, expropriation and transparency claims are premised on objective rather than subjective factors, it seems that the Respondent\u2019s challenge to the credibility and reliability of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses is directed principally to the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations claim and their damages case.\n\n281.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that, despite the Claimants\u2019 shift in focus, this is not and has never been a case about transparency; it has only become so because the hearing undermined the Claimants\u2019 previous case theory (Tr., Day 13, 19-43 (King)).\n\n282.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\"(a) DISMISS the Claimants' claims in their entirety; and\n\n(b) ORDER the Claimants to pay in their entirety the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre and the reasonable fees and expenses incurred by Romania in defending against the Claimants' claims.\"\n\n(Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 354).\n\n283.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:14\n\n\"[...]\n\nc. if any amount is awarded to any of the Claimants, whether as damages, arbitration costs, or otherwise, explicitly provide in the award that the amount awarded is subject to set-off against the tax debts of all eleven EFDG companies, including lawful interest and penalties;\n\nd. grant any other relief the Tribunal considers just and proper.\"\n\n(Respondent's Reply regarding its Revocation Application, \u00b6 41)\n\nThese additional requests were made in the context of the Respondent's application to revoke the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal. As noted in paragraph 111 above, the determination of these matters was deferred to the final Award.\n\n**V. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over this dispute was addressed in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, which makes integral part of this Award. In that Decision, the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration and rejected any objections as to the admissibility of the claims (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 170).\n\n285.\n\nSpecifically, in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility the Tribunal found that:\n\na. The Tribunal's jurisdiction is determined by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT.\n\nb. Regarding jurisdiction *ratione personae*, the Tribunal rejected Romania's argument that the Individual Claimants\u2019 Swedish nationality could not be opposed to Romania because of purported tenuous links with Sweden. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that Messrs. Micula are and have been Swedish nationals at all times relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. As for the three Corporate Claimants, the Tribunal resolved that they were held by nationals of another Contracting State at the time of consent to arbitration, in accordance with the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 7(3) of the BIT.\n\nc. Regarding jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, the Tribunal found that the investments made by the Corporate Claimants qualified as such for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. In the same vein, the Tribunal was satisfied that the shareholding of Messrs. Micula qualified as an investment under the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal also held that there was an investment for the purposes of the BIT. Further, the Tribunal expressed no doubt that the dispute was of a legal nature, arising directly out of an investment, for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Moreover, the Tribunal understood that the dispute was not merely hypothetical and that the Claimants had made a *prima facie* case of entitlement.\n\nd. Regarding jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, the Tribunal found that the dispute arose after the entry into force of the BIT and therefore fell within the scope of application of the BIT *ratione temporis*.\n\ne. The Tribunal also rejected the Respondent's objection related to the remedy of restitution sought by the Claimants, ruling that the Tribunal had powers to order restitution both under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n**B. APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------\n\n286.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n287.\n\nThe Parties note that the BIT does not contain a choice of law clause (C-SoC, \u00b6 170; R-CM, \u00b6 72; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 230). Accordingly, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention directs the Tribunal to apply the host state's law (here, Romanian law) and \"such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The Parties agree that, in the case of conflict between Romanian law and international law, international law should take precedence (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 172; R-CM, \u00b6 72).15\n\nSee, e.g., *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Desarrollo de Santa Elena SA v Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No ARB/96/1), Award, 17 February 2000 (hereinafter *\"Santa Elena v. Costa Rica\"*), \u00b6\u00b6 64-65; *LG&E Energy Corp, LG&E Corp, LG&E International Inc. v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006 (hereinafter *\"LG&E v. Argentina\" or \"LG&E\"*), \u00b6 94; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Resubmission Proceeding, Award, 5 June 1990, \u00b6 40.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"where the basis of jurisdiction is a BIT and the claims put forward are based on the BIT, it is established practice to accept the BIT's substantive rules as the applicable law\" (C-SoC, \u00b6 170). The Respondent appears to agree, noting that \"the interpretation of the BIT must be guided by relevant principles of international law\", and adding that \"[i]ts actual text is of course the starting point\" (RCM, \u00b6 73;). Indeed, the Respondent contends that the rule of international law of primary significance to the Claimants' case is Article 2(3) of the BIT (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 230).\n\n289.\n\nThe Parties disagree however on the role of other rules of international law in this dispute. The Claimants contend that no international law principle displaces the terms of the BIT or otherwise excuses Romania's treaty breaches. In turn, the Respondent argues that the BIT must be interpreted in light of the context in which it was concluded, and should be consistent with Romania's and Sweden's other relevant international law obligations, including in particular Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement and the EC Treaty. Romania argues that, in any event, the Parties intended EU law to prevail.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses the Parties' positions below, as well as comments made by the European Commission in its capacity as *amicus curiae*.\n\n**1. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimants contend that EU law does not displace the terms of the BIT (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 515-555; ER of D. Caron; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 86-95). The Claimants argue that there is no conflict of treaties that could make EU law prevail over the BIT, but even if there were, the BIT should prevail (Section (a) below). The Claimants further contend that the Respondent\u2019s attempts to interpret the BIT in accordance with EU law should be rejected (Section (b) below). In any event, the Claimants contend that EU law requirements would not justify or excuse breaches of the BIT (Section (c) below).\n\n**a. There is no conflict of treaties, and even if there were, the BIT should prevail**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there is no conflict of treaties in this case because the Accession Treaty and the EC Treaty were not in force vis-\u00e0-vis Romania at the time it entered into the BIT, or at the time when the breaches of the BIT occurred. Thus, the Claimants assert that:\n\nEverything here in this case is crystallised prior to the accession of Romania to the EU. The BIT was entered in force before, the breach predates the accession and hence the right to be compensated predates accession. [...] [T]he only element which postdates accession is the payment: the payment of a sum of money which represents the consequences of the breach which predates accession (Tr., Day 12, 141 (Gaillard)).\n\n293.\n\nThe Claimants also note that the Commission expressly concludes that the BIT has been neither superseded nor terminated by Romania\u2019s accession to the EU pursuant to Article 59 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n294.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the only treaty with which the BIT could be deemed to be in conflict is the Europe Agreement. The Claimants deny that such a conflict exists, but if such a conflict were deemed to exist, they submit that the BIT should prevail:\n\na. First, under the preservation of rights provision in Article 9(2) of the BIT, the BIT prevails over external provisions, except to the extent that the latter would be more favorable to the investor than the provisions of the BIT.\n\nb. Second, the BIT prevails as *lex posterior* pursuant to Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (the \"VCLT\")16 because none of the requirements for Article 30(3) to apply is met (in particular, the Europe Agreement and the BIT were not entered into between the same parties, nor do they have the same subject matter).\n\nc. Third, the BIT prevails as *lex specialis*, because it is the treaty with a more precisely delimited scope of application. In addition, the Claimants argue that there is no evidence of Romania's and Sweden's common intention to give precedence to EU law and subordinate the BIT to it. Indeed, the Claimants note that, in the few instances where Romania has intended to give precedence over a BIT to a particular source of law, it has done so expressly.\n\nArticle 30(3) of the VCLT provides: \"When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\"\n\n**b. Romania's interpretation of the provisions of the BIT is flawed**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that Romania misapplies Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT in an attempt to supplant the BIT with EU law. Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT provides: \"There shall be taken into account, together with the context: [\u2026] (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\" According to the Claimants, Romania's attempt to \"interpret\" the BIT by taking into account EU law as part of the \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" is an improper attempt to displace the BIT and apply EU law instead. Relying on Prof. Caron's expert opinion, the Claimants argue that:\n\na. An \"interpretation\" cannot be construed to abrogate express language in the BIT;\n\nb. The meaning of the terms \"shall be taken into account\" should be understood to mean that an interpreter of the treaty has the discretion to consider relevant rules of international law, not that such rules must be incorporated into the treaty, and\n\nc. The \"relevant rules of international law\" are only those that are in place at the time of the violation.\n\n296.\n\nAs a result, the Claimants argue that, for purposes of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, the Tribunal could \"take into account\" the Europe Agreement, which existed at the time the BIT entered into force and at the time Romania breached the BIT's provisions (subject to the additional requirement of the Europe Agreement being \"between the parties\", which the Claimants deny). However, the Tribunal cannot take into account the Accession Agreement or the EC Treaty, as Romania had not entered into either at the time it concluded the BIT. Therefore, in the view of the Claimants, if the Tribunal seeks to determine the relevant state aid requirements that applied to Romania, the Tribunal should refer to the regime existing under the Europe Agreement, rather than the post-accession regime.\n\n**c. EU law requirements would not justify or excuse breaches of the BIT or international law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimants submit that even if Romania was required by EU law to repeal the EGO 24 incentives prior to their planned expiration in 2009, this would not justify or excuse breaches of the BIT and international law.\n\n298.\n\nThe Claimants note that, according to Art. 12 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the \"ILC Articles\"),17 \"[t]here is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character.\" In the Claimants\u2019 submission, the relevant international obligations here are those contained in the BIT. Romania would breach those obligations even if its actions were required by EU law. Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles, \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\"\n\nArticles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission (lLC) in 2001. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants have included a complete version of the ILC Articles, with commentaries, at Exh. C-592 (ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of Its Fifty-third Session, UN GAOR, 56th Sess., Supp. No. 10, at 43, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), and that the Respondent has done the same at Exh. RL-8 (International Law Commission, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries\", [2001-II(2)] Yearbook of the International Law Commission 59). The Tribunal understands that all of these versions are identical and will use them indistinctly. The Tribunal further notes that, by Resolution 53/83 of 12 December 2001, the UN General Assembly took note of the ILC Articles and \"commend[ed] them to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action.\" All references to the ILC Articles themselves in this Award are to the version to which the UN General Assembly referred in Resolution 53/83. All references to the commentary to the Articles are to the version adopted by the ILC.\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, for all of their claims except their fair and equitable treatment claim, the obligation to compensate arises irrespective of the rationale for the adoption of the internationally wrongful act. In their view, Romania\u2019s reasons for adopting the measure could only be relevant if Romania were trying to avail itself of one of the circumstances precluding wrongfulness described in Chapter V of the ILC Articles, i.e., force majeure (Article 23), duress (Article 24), or necessity (Article 25). Thus, for their expropriation and umbrella clause claims, the Claimants argue that Romania\u2019s \"EU law defense\" should be assessed after the Tribunal has decided whether there is liability under the BIT, to determine if the reasons for Romania\u2019s actions qualify as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants note that Romania has not expressly invoked Articles 23-25 of the ILC Articles, but in any event the Claimants submit that none of them applies. In particular, Romania has not proven the \"necessity\" of its alleged compliance with its EU law obligations in the terms of Article 25.\n\n301.\n\nEven if the doctrine of \"necessity\" applied, the Claimants contend that Romania would still be required to compensate them. Article 25 only provides an excuse for an act by a state; it does not affect a state\u2019s obligation to pay compensation for damages caused by that act (even if excused). Indeed, according to the Claimants ILC Article 27(b) leaves open whether a state relying on a circumstance precluding wrongfulness should nonetheless be expected to make good any material loss suffered.\n\n302.\n\nIn contrast, the Claimants submit that Romania\u2019s EU law defense is relevant to the determination of whether Romania has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard. As explained in further detail below, the Claimants argue that EU law is part of the factual matrix against which the Tribunal must determine whether the Claimants\u2019 expectations were legitimate and, specifically, whether they were reasonable (Tr., Day 1, 159-164, 170-177 (Gaillard)). Thus, the Tribunal must assess Romania\u2019s EU law defense during the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of whether Romania has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n**2. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the BIT must be interpreted in light of the context in which it was concluded, and should be consistent with Romania's and Sweden's other relevant international law obligations, including in particular Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement and the EC Treaty. Romania argues that, in any event, the Parties intended EU law to prevail (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 72-84; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 226-258; Tr. Day 13, 50:18-51:24 (King)).\n\n**a. The BIT must be interpreted consistently with EU law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent does not dispute that the substantive rules of international law applicable to this dispute are those contained in the BIT. However, it argues that the BIT cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. Citing *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, the Respondent argues that an investment protection treaty \"is not a self-contained closed legal system limited to provide for substantive material rules of direct applicability, but it has to be envisaged within a wider juridical context [...].\"18 In this respect, the Respondent argues that the BIT must be interpreted in light of the context in which it was negotiated and concluded between Romania and Sweden. In Romania's submission, this context should take into account the purpose for which it was concluded (Article 31(1) of the VLCT), as well as the circumstances of its conclusion (Article 32 of the VCLT). Romania argues that the conclusion of the BIT was a direct consequence of the Europe Agreement, in the context of Romania's accession to the EU and adoption of the *acquis.*\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Award, 27 June 1990 (hereinafter *\"AAPL v. Sri Lanka\"),* \u00b6 21.\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that, pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, when interpreting a treaty, the \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" must also be taken into account. According to Romania, this includes the rules of international law existing at the time the BIT is being interpreted (that is, today). Thus, in Romania's submission, the Europe Agreement and the EC Treaty fall under the category of relevant rules of international law that should be considered when construing the BIT. In this respect, Romania notes that the ILC has stated that \"[i]t is a generally accepted principle that when several norms bear on a single issue they should, to the extent possible, be interpreted so as to give rise to a single set of compatible obligations.\"19\n\nInternational Law Commission, \"Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of its 58th Session\", UN Doc A/61/10 (2006), Exh. RL-187, p 408.\n\n306.\n\nSpecifically, Romania claims that \"the BIT should be interpreted as part of a harmonious set of treaty obligations that Romania and Sweden have entered into, starting with the 1993 Europe Agreement and continuing, all pursuant to that same initial instrument with the BIT and the accession treaty [...] [T]he Europe Agreement indeed called on Romania to negotiate BITs with EU countries\" (Tr., Day 13, 51 (King)). The Respondent submits that, if the BIT is construed in that light, no conflict between the various instruments arises.\n\n307.\n\nRomania contends that, in the present case, such a \"systemic\" interpretation of the BIT is of special importance. It submits that the treatment of foreign investors that Sweden and Romania intended to mandate through the BIT cannot be divorced from Romania\u2019s obligations under the Europe Agreement and the EC Treaty. The Respondent argues that Sweden, together with the other EU Member States, expected Romania to take all reasonable measures to comply with the EU treaties, and in particular expected Romania to abolish EGO 24.\n\n308.\n\nIn view of the above, the Respondent contends that all substantive obligations contained in the BIT must be interpreted in a manner consistent with EU law. This includes in particular Article 64 of the Europe Agreement and Article 87 of the EC Treaty.\n\n**b. In any event, the Contracting Parties to the BIT intended European law to prevail**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, in the unlikely event that the Tribunal should find Romania\u2019s obligations under EU law and the BIT impossible to reconcile, any conflict ought to be resolved in favor of EU law.\n\n310.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent argues that where conflicts arise between competing rules of international law which cannot be resolved by systemic interpretation, the intention of the relevant States determines which of the competing rules takes precedence. According to the Respondent, in the present case the common intention of Romania and Sweden is clear: they intended the BIT to be subordinated to EU law. As EU law contains more specific rules on state aid, EU law should prevail by application of the principle *lex specialis derogat generali*.\n\n311.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that it concluded the BIT with Sweden precisely in furtherance of its obligations to the EU and the EU Member States. It would thus be irrational to suppose that Sweden and Romania intended the BIT to circumvent or otherwise weaken EU law. Indeed, for Sweden this would mean breaching the EC Treaty.\n\n312.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that the European Court of Justice (\"ECJ\") has ruled that EU law takes precedence over all pre-accession bilateral treaties concluded between Member States (Exh. RL-197 to RL-200).\n\n**c. EU law is relevant to the determination of wrongfulness**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, contrary to the Claimants' contentions, EU law is relevant to the determination of whether it breached the BIT.\n\n314.\n\nSpecifically, Romania argues that the rights and obligations of Romania and Sweden under the Europe Agreement and, eventually, the Accession Treaty, are not only rules of international law that the Tribunal should take into account when interpreting the BIT, but are relevant in at least three ways: (i) as the factual motivation for the change in Romanian law that is the basis of the Claimants' allegations; (ii) as binding rules of Romanian law, having been incorporated into Romanian law, and (iii) as factual circumstances to take into account as part of the consideration of what would have constituted fair and equitable treatment (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 227).\n\n315.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that it was indeed \"necessary\" for Romania to repeal EGO 98 in order to either comply with EU law or accede to the EU. However, the Respondent submits that \"necessity\" is not the test; the question is whether Romania's course of action was reasonable (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 99). The Tribunal understands Romania's position to be that the requirements of EU law play a role in determining whether Romania breached the standards of the BIT that require the state to act reasonably, in particular, the fair and equitable treatment obligation and the obligation not to impair the Claimants' investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. The Tribunal also understands that Romania is not invoking Articles 23, 24 or 25 of the ILC Articles to plead that there are circumstances precluding wrongfulness that would excuse any liability under the BIT.\n\n**3. The Commission's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nIn its capacity as *amicus curiae*, the European Commission submitted comments on the law applicable to this dispute.\n\n317.\n\nThe Commission's position in this respect is similar to that of the Respondent. The Commission submits that the interpretation of the BIT should take into account the BIT's European context and origin. It notes that the ECJ has recommended interpreting intra-EU BITs in the light of EU law (ECJ Case 26/62, *Van Gend en Loos* [1963], ECR 3). The Commission also submits that the parties to the Europe Agreement intended that any future BIT should subscribe to the same logic regarding state aid law. Therefore, the Tribunal should take into account the EU's state aid rules when interpreting specific BIT provisions. The Commission further contends that Article 30(3) of the VCLT directs the Tribunal to apply the EU's state aid law rather than provisions of the BIT that would prove incompatible with the EC Treaty.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nThere is no dispute among the Parties that the primary source of law for this Tribunal is the BIT itself. The disagreements lie in the role of other rules of international law, in particular rules arising from treaties established under EU law to which Romania and Sweden are parties.\n\n319.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal notes that there is no real conflict of treaties. In the time period relevant to this dispute, the relevant rules of international law applicable to Romania and Sweden were the Europe Agreement (which entered into force on 1 February 1995) and the BIT (which entered into force on 1 April 2003). The Accession Treaty was not signed until 25 April 2005, and entered into force on 1 January 2007 (date on which the EC Treaty also entered into force with respect to Romania) (ER of F. Jacobs, \u00b6 12). Thus, from 1 February 1995 to 1 January 2007, Romania was in a negotiating phase during which it declared that it accepted the *acquis* but it was not properly subject to EU law, with the exception of its international obligations under the Europe Agreement itself. As a result, EU law was not directly applicable to Romania.\n\n320.\n\nThe relevant question then becomes whether EU law plays a role in the interpretation of the BIT. To answer that question, the Tribunal needs to address three points.\n\n321.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the BIT does not contain any reference to EU accession or to the EU. Further, the Accession Treaty did not contain any references to the BIT, let alone seek to modify any of the BIT's provisions. To recall, the Europe Agreement entered into force on 1 February 1995, the BIT entered into force on 1 April 2003, and the Accession Treaty was signed on 25 April 2005, and entered into force on 1 January 2007 (on which date the EC Treaty also entered into force with respect to Romania). The Tribunal cannot therefore assume that by virtue of entering into the Accession Treaty or by virtue of Romania's accession to the EU, either Romania, or Sweden, or the EU sought to amend, modify or otherwise detract from the application of the BIT.\n\n322.\n\nSecond, Article 31(1) of the VCLT provides that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" Article 31(2) expressly notes that such context comprises, *inter alia*, the text of the treaty, including its preamble and annexes. The Preamble of the BIT states that the Contracting Parties have agreed on the terms of the BIT:\n\n*desiring* to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both States and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,\n\n*recognizing* that the promotion and protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives [...]\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal must interpret the BIT in light of these overarching goals, which the Parties do not dispute.\n\n324.\n\nLikewise, it is undisputed that one of the goals of the Europe Agreement, which predated the BIT, was to promote economic cooperation between Romania and the EC Member States. In this context, Article 74 of the Europe Agreement on investment promotion and protection provided:\n\nArticle 74 - Investment promotion and protection\n\n1. Cooperation shall aim to establish a favourable climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign, which is essential to the economic and industrial reconstruction of Romania.\n\n2. The particular aims of the cooperation shall be:\n\n- for Romania to establish and improve a legal framework which favours and protects investment;\n\n- the conclusion by the Member States and Romania of Agreements for the promotion and protection of investment [...]\n\n325.\n\nThis suggests that the BIT was part of Romania's strategy to develop economically in order to obtain accession.\n\n326.\n\nThat being said (and this is the third point), the Tribunal will interpret each of the various applicable treaties having due regard to the other applicable treaties, assuming that the parties entered into each of those treaties in full awareness of their legal obligations under all of them. In other words, there is no reason to assume that Sweden and Romania had any intent to defeat their obligations under any of the applicable treaties when they entered into each of them and the Tribunal must interpret each treaty - in particular, the BIT - according to that intent of the parties.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, factually, the general context of EU accession must be taken into account when interpreting the BIT. In particular, the overall circumstances of EU accession may play a role in determining whether the Respondent has breached some of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this regard that the Parties appear to agree that EU law forms part of the \"factual matrix\" of the case. In particular, the Parties agree that the question of EU law may be relevant to determining whether Romania acted fairly and equitably with respect to the Claimants' investments in accordance with Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Tribunal concurs. The overall context of EU accession in general and the pertinent provisions of EU law in particular may be relevant to the determination of whether, *inter alia*, Romania's actions were reasonable in light of all the circumstances, or whether Claimants' expectations were legitimate.\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal also sees merit in the Claimants' suggestion that, in theory, EU law could also possibly come into play as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under ILC Articles 23, 24 or 25. However, as noted above, the Respondent has not put forth a case of force majeure, duress or necessity. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not address the relevance of EU law in this context.\n\n**C. THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ARBITRAL AWARD AND EU LAW**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe Respondent and the Commission contend that any payment of compensation arising out of this Award would constitute illegal state aid under EU law and render the Award unenforceable within the EU. Prior to determining whether it is useful for the Tribunal to decide this question (Section 4 below), the Tribunal will set out the Parties\u2019 positions. As this point was first raised by the Respondent and second by the Commission, the Tribunal will address the Respondent\u2019s position first (Section 1 below), then the Commission\u2019s position (Section 2 below), and finally the Claimants\u2019 position (Section 3 below).\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nThe Respondent contends that an award of damages in the present case would constitute impermissible state aid (R-CM, \u00b6 78 (note 142); First ER of R. Streinz, \u00b6\u00b6 29-34; Second ER of R. Streinz, \u00b6\u00b6 21-24; ER of F. Jacobs, \u00b6\u00b6 45-49; 50(4) and (5); Respondent's observations on Commission\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 3).\n\n332.\n\nRelying on Professor Streinz\u2019s expert opinion, the Respondent argues that an award of damages for the abolition of the EGO 24 regime would amount to the granting of new state aid by Romania to the Claimants. For such new state aid to be granted, Romania must first seek and obtain prior approval from the Commission, which in the opinion of the expert would most likely be denied.\n\n333.\n\nProfessor Jacobs, another of the Respondent\u2019s experts, confirms that the payment of compensation in lieu of aid must be regarded as equivalent to a payment of the relevant aid itself. Such a payment in this case would amount to a payment of new state aid and could not be made without the European Commission being informed pursuant to Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty. Prof. Jacobs also states that, as a matter of EU law, an award of compensation in lieu of aid in respect of the period 2007-2009, and possibly in respect of earlier years as well, may be denied enforcement in the EU on grounds of public policy.\n\n**2. The European Commission's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe Commission submits that \"[i]f the Tribunal rendered an award that is contrary to obligations binding on Romania as an EU Member State, such award could not be implemented in Romania by virtue of the supremacy of EC law, and in particular State aid rules\" (Commission\u2019s Written Submission, \u00b6 125(4)).\n\n335.\n\nIn particular, the Commission submits that \"any award requiring Romania to reestablish investment schemes which have been found incompatible with the internal market during accession negotiations, is subject to EU State aid rules\", and \"[t]he execution of such award can thus not take place if it would contradict the rules of EU State aid policy.\" The Commission notes that in the *Eco Swiss* case,20 the ECJ held that the competition rules of the EC Treaty are part of the public order which national courts must take into account when they review the legality of arbitral awards under the public policy exception recognized by the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (Commission\u2019s Written Submission, \u00b6 121).\n\nECJ, Case C-126/97 *Eco Swiss v. Benetton* ECR [1999] 1-3055, \u00b6\u00b6 35-41.\n\n336.\n\nThe Commission acknowledges that Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that each Contracting State shall automatically recognize and enforce an ICSID award within its territory as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. However, it contends that if a national court in the EU were asked to enforce an ICSID award that is contrary to EU law and EU state aid policy rules, the proceedings would have to be stayed under the conditions of Article 234 of the EC Treaty so that the ECJ may decide on the applicability of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, as transposed into the national law of the referring judge. The Commission notes that \"the ICSID Convention is not binding on the EC under Article 300(7) EC, as the terms of the Convention do not allow the EC to become a Contracting Party to it\" and concludes that, \"[a]ccordingly, the ICSID Convention does not form part of the EC legal order.\" However, the Commission adds that it \"sincerely believes that such a conflict between the BIT, the ICSID Convention, and EC law can be avoided through a contextual interpretation of the BIT or the application of Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention, as the case may be\" (Commission's Written Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 122-124).\n\n**3. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimants argue that issues regarding enforcement of an award are irrelevant to the Tribunal's decision on the substance of the Claimants' claims. In particular, the Claimants deny that considerations relating to the enforcement of the Award should affect the interpretation of the BIT or the Tribunal's decision as to whether Romania has breached certain provisions of the BIT (Claimants' comments on the Commission's submission, \u00b6\u00b6 167-170; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 270-278; ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6\u00b6 92-100).\n\n338.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that, contrary to the Respondent's and the Commission's contention, an award of damages in the present arbitration could not be characterized as a grant of state aid, since the payment of damages would result from the Tribunal's determination that Romania breached the BIT. The Claimants rely on the opinion of Prof. Dashwood, who asserts that an award of damages cannot be equated with the granting of state aid and consequently would not involve any conflict between Romania's obligations under the BIT and its present obligations as a Member State of the EU.\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that Romania was not bound by EU state aid laws when it breached the BIT. The purpose of any award of damages would be to compensate the Claimants for the harm resulting from the Respondent's unlawful conduct, which occurred before Romania joined the EU and became bound by EU law. According to the Claimants, a payment for a breach that predates Romania's EU accession cannot violate EU law.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters. It is thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been rendered. It will thus not address the Parties' and the Commission's arguments on enforceability of the Award.\n\n341.\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal notes that Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, which are reproduced below, apply in any event to the Award:\n\nArticle 53\n\n(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.\n\nArticle 54\n\n(1) Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.\n\n(2) A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.\n\n(3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS OF THE CLAIMANTS' TREATY CLAIMS**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nIn the latest presentation of their argument, the Claimants contend in the first place that, by revoking the EGO 24 incentives before they were due to expire, Romania violated an obligation entered into by Romania vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants and thus breached the BIT's umbrella clause. However, even if the premature revocation of the incentives does not breach the umbrella clause (e.g., because the promise allegedly made by the Respondent does not rise to the level of an obligation protected by the umbrella clause), the Claimants argue that the Tribunal could still find a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard because the revocation undermined the Claimants' legitimate expectations (Tr., Day 12, 126:22-128:6 (Reed)). In view of this alternative argument, the Tribunal will first address the Claimants' umbrella clause claim. If necessary, it will then move on to the Claimants' remaining claims.\n\n**A. UMBRELLA CLAUSE**\n----------------------\n\n343.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the BIT provides in relevant part:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has entered into with an investor of the other Contracting Party with regard to his or her investment.\n\n**1. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimants contend that through the EGO 24 framework and the related PICs, Romania entered into an obligation with the Claimants with regard to their investment. As a result, they argue that, by revoking the Raw Materials Incentive before it was due to expire, the Respondent breached the BIT's umbrella clause, contained in Article 2(4) of the BIT.\n\n345.\n\nSection (a) below addresses the Claimants' position with respect to the nature and scope of the BIT's umbrella clause. Section (b) sets out the Claimants' position with respect to the existence of a specific obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants. Section (c) sets out the Claimants' arguments with respect to the Respondent's alleged breach of that umbrella clause.\n\n**a. Nature and scope of the BIT's umbrella clause**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the purpose of umbrella clauses (such as Article 2(4) of the BIT, also called \"undertakings clauses\") is to put the host state's compliance with commitments assumed vis-\u00e0-vis investors under the protective \"umbrella\" of the relevant treaty. This protection is extended to the state's commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the investor independently of whether a violation of the other provisions of the treaty has occurred, with the result that any violation of an assurance given by the host state becomes a violation of the treaty. As a result, claims raised under an umbrella clause are additional to and independent of claims based on unfair and inequitable treatment, unreasonable or discriminatory measures, treatment less favorable than required by international law and expropriation (C-SoC, \u00b6 286).\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, unless a treaty expressly provides otherwise, an umbrella clause is not limited to contractual obligations or undertakings, but may cover unilateral undertakings by the host state, including obligations arising from legislation and regulations (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 289-299; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 461-468; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 6-14).\n\n348.\n\nIn support of this contention, the Claimants argue that there is no justification to interpret Art. 2(4) of the BIT narrowly. First, pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, treaty provisions are to be interpreted in accordance to their ordinary meaning. Relying on *SGS v. Philippines21*, *Eureko v. Poland22*, *CMS v. Argentina23*, *LG&E v. Argentina* and *Enron v. Argentina24*, the Claimants contend that the ordinary meaning of the relevant terms supports the binding nature of the clause, as well as its comprehensive scope. The Claimants rely in particular on *Eureko v. Poland*, where the language of the umbrella clause at issue was very similar to the umbrella clause in the Sweden-Romania BIT (\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party\"). In that case, the tribunal held that:\n\nThe plain meaning\u2014the \"ordinary meaning\"\u2014of a provision prescribing that a State \"shall observe any obligations it may have entered into\" with regard to certain foreign investments is not obscure. The phrase \"shall observe\" is imperative and categorical. \"Any\" obligations is capacious; it means not only obligations of a certain type, but \"any\"\u2014that is to say, all\u2014 obligations entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.25\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004 (hereinafter *\"SGS v. Philippines\"***).**\n\n*Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland*, Partial Award, 19 August 2005 (hereinafter \" *Eureko v. Poland\"*).\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/8) *,* Award, 12 May 2005 (hereinafter *\"CMS v. Argentina\"*).\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Award, 22 May 2007 (hereinafter *\"Enron v. Argentina\")*.\n\n*Eureko v. Poland*, \u00b6 246.\n\n349.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants note that the tribunal in *Enron v. Argentina* held that \"[u]nder its ordinary meaning the phrase \u2018any obligation' refers to obligations regardless of their nature\", noting that \"[t]ribunals interpreting this expression have found it to cover both contractual obligations such as payment as well as obligations assumed through law or regulation.\"26\n\n*Enron v. Argentina*, \u00b6 274, (citing *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), Award, 9 March 1998, \u00b6 29; *SGS v. Philippines*, \u00b6\u00b6 127-128; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, \u00b6 166; *LG&E v. Argentina*, \u00b6 175).\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this is all the more so when the legislation or regulations are specifically designed to induce investors to invest in reliance on those assurances. The Claimants point out that the tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* found that laws and regulations that targeted foreign investors and applied specifically to their investments gave rise to \"obligations\" under the meaning of the relevant treaty's umbrella clause.27\n\n*LG&E v. Argentina*, \u00b6 175.\n\n351.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants contend that the Contracting States could have chosen to draft the BIT's umbrella clause more restrictively (for example, limiting it to contractual obligations), and chose not to do so.\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the wording of Article 2(4) makes it a particularly narrow umbrella clause, to the extent that it requires that an obligation be \"entered into with an investor of the other Contracting Party\". In the Claimants' view, this language does not set it apart from other umbrella clauses, as all umbrella clauses require that there be a party to whom the obligation is owed (i.e., the investor). Similarly, the Claimants argue that there is no real distinction between the term \"obligations\" and \"undertakings\" for these purposes: when someone undertakes to do something, he or she becomes obliged to do that thing.\n\n353.\n\nSecond, the Claimants argue that the umbrella clause must be interpreted in a manner that gives it substantive meaning. Relying on *Eureko v. Poland*, they contend that\n\nIt is a cardinal rule of the interpretation of treaties that each and every operative clause of a treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than meaningless. It is equally well established in the jurisprudence of international law, particularly that of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice, that treaties, and hence their clauses, are to be interpreted so as to render them effective rather than ineffective.\n\nIt follows that the effect of Article 3.5 [the umbrella clause] in this proceeding cannot be overlooked, or equated with the Treaty's provisions for fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment, deprivation of investments, and full protection and security. On the contrary, Article 3.5 must be interpreted to mean something in itself.28\n\n*Eureko v. Poland*, \u00b6\u00b6 248-249.\n\n354.\n\nThird, the Claimants also argue that the binding force of obligations unilaterally assumed by the host State is supported by the binding nature of the consent to international arbitration granted by host states through their national legislation, and is in accordance with the treatment of unilateral undertakings in customary international law (citing the *Nuclear Tests Cases29*).\n\n*Nuclear Tests Cases (Australia/New Zealand v. France)*, Judgment, 20 December 1974, ICJ Reports 1974 (hereinafter \" *The Nuclear Tests Cases\"*).\n\n355.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that there is no way in which EU law can limit the breadth of this umbrella clause. EU law is only part of the factual matrix of the case, and thus the only role it could play in relation to an umbrella clause claim is when any factors precluding wrongfulness come to be examined.\n\n356.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's arguments, the Claimants acknowledge that there is no dispute that umbrella clauses only protect specific obligations. However, as explained below, the Claimants submit that Romania entered into a specific obligation with the Claimants.\n\n**b. The EGO 24 regime gave rise to a specific obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, through the EGO 24 regime, Romania entered into a specific obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants, which consisted of Romania's undertaking with respect to the Claimants to maintain the incentives in the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored region for the full 10-year period provided by GD 194/1999, which the Claimants argue was stabilized for 10 years (C-SoC, \u00b6 300; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 467-468; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 624; Tr., Day 12, 70-91 (Reed), 163-164 (Gaillard)).\n\n358.\n\nAlthough the Claimants acknowledge that, taken on its own, EGO 24 is a general and non-specific piece of legislation, they argue that \"the regime as a whole and its specific application to the Claimants gives rise to a specific obligation\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 15).30\n\nThe Claimants had initially argued that Romania had entered into obligations towards foreign investors, including the Claimants, when it granted the incentives on the basis of EGO 24, GD 194 and GD 1199, and that these were the obligations protected under the umbrella clause (C-SoC, \u00b6 300). The Claimants have since clarified that the obligations allegedly breached by the Respondent do not arise solely from provisions of a general legislative framework; they arise also from specific commitments and obligations undertaken by Romania in the form of the PICs granted to each of the Corporate Claimants (C-Reply, \u00b6 466).\n\n359.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, this specific obligation arises primarily from the content of EGO 24 and its implementing legislation. The Claimants claim that, properly construed, EGO 24, read in conjunction with the implementing measures (in particular, GD 194/1999, the Methodological Norms and the PICs), contained a clear and unequivocal undertaking to provide PIC holders such as the Corporate Claimants with the Raw Materials Incentive until 1 April 2009. According to the Claimants, this undertaking arises from the following features of the EGO 24 regime:\n\na. EGO 24 was specifically targeted to persons who invested and conducted business within specific disfavored regions. To benefit from the incentives offered by EGO 24, investors had to be headquartered and conduct business in the disfavored area and had to create new jobs there for the unemployed (EGO 24, Articles 6 and 8).\n\nb. These disfavored regions were created by government decisions (such as GD 194/1999 and GD 1199/2000), which set out a specific geographic scope and a specific period for which that region would be considered disfavored, as well as the incentives that would be made available in that area and the types of investments that could benefit from them (EGO 24, Articles 3 and 4).\n\nc. To take advantage of the incentives, investors were required to make a specific application for an investor certificate (either temporary or permanent), which required them to submit a detailed investment plan. If they wished to undertake new investments or activities, they needed to submit a new investment plan.\n\nd. Investors were awarded a PIC that set out the period for which it was valid and the fields of activity for which it was valid. PICs were required for investors to obtain the incentives, and had to be presented to the Romanian authorities every single time that investors wished to take advantage of the incentives.\n\ne. Investors assumed obligations in exchange for the incentives. In particular, they were required to employ persons living in the disfavored area (EGO 24, Article 8); they were required to undertake investments prior to obtaining the PIC and, after receiving the PIC, they had to maintain their investments in the disfavored region for twice the period of time they enjoyed the incentives (EGO 24, Articles 7 and 9).\n\n360.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that the existence of Romania's specific obligation was evidenced by Romania's conduct, in particular its promotion of the EGO 24 regime and the extensive monitoring that PIC holders were subjected to throughout the period during which they received the incentives.\n\n361.\n\nIn view of the above, the Claimants contend that \"the entire EGO 24 regime was far more than a general legislative scheme. Instead it was a specific scheme targeted to specific investors in specific regions for specific periods of time. Further the rights granted were given in exchange for investors undertaking specific obligations, carrying out investments specified in investment plans and receiving specific PICs by which the investors' rights were granted (and conversely from which the Respondent's obligations arose)\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 16). Relying on the testimony of Mr. Neculai Liviu Marcu, the Claimants add that \"[t]he specific purpose of that regime was to entice investors to invest in the least developed areas of Romania; areas in which they would not otherwise invest\" (*Id*. *See* also WS of N. Marcu, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Tr., Day 7, 51-53).\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the fact that Romania's undertaking is not contained in one particular document is irrelevant. It is plain from EGO 24 itself that it did not stand alone; it required and expressly provided for implementing measures to be taken by the Romanian Government. Articles 3 and 4 of EGO 24 required government decisions to declare and delineate disfavored areas, determine the period of time for which each disfavored zone is to be declared, and determine the eligible investments and the incentives which would be granted to investors. In addition, Article 15 required methodological norms to be established by government decision.\n\n363.\n\nNonetheless, the Claimants contend that the basic scheme of the incentives program was set out in EGO 24 (Exh. R-68). Disfavored areas had to satisfy the conditions set out in Article 1. They could be declared for a period of between 3 and 10 years at the discretion of the government authorities. The incentives that could be granted were set out in Article 6, but it was the government decision for each disfavored area that would determine which incentives were available in that area. In turn, Article 8 provided that, to benefit from the incentives, companies had to be headquartered and conduct business in the disfavored area and had to create new jobs there for the unemployed. Articles 7 and 9 provided that investors would have to refund the incentives if the investments were not maintained in the disfavored area for twice the period during which they had been eligible to receive the incentives.\n\n364.\n\nAlthough the Claimants concede that EGO 24 did not spell out that the incentives available within the disfavored area would be maintained for the entire period for which the disfavored area had been declared disfavored, this is, in the Claimants' submission, the only sensible interpretation of EGO 24. Indeed, they argue that it is also the way it was interpreted by the Romanian Government, as evidenced by the government decisions that implemented EGO 24.\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimants rely in particular on GD 194/1999 (Exh. C-280, also C-31), which is the government decision that declared \u015etei-Nucet a deprived zone (Article 1). Article 3 provides that the period for which \u015etei-Nucet shall be declared a deprived zone is 10 years. Article 4 then states that \"[d]uring the period of existence of the deprived zone [...] there shall be granted the facilities provided in Annex No. 2.\" In turn, Annex No. 2, which forms part of GD 194/1999, sets out that investors shall benefit from all of the facilities provided for in Article 6 of EGO 24. As a result, the Claimants argue that Article 4 of GD 194/1999 explicitly ties the period during which the incentives are granted to the period of existence of the deprived zone.\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimants find additional support in the fact that the language of Article 4 in 37 of the 38 government decisions which declared disfavored areas between 1998 and 2003 is either identical or virtually the same as the language of Article 4 of GD 194/1999 (Table contained at Tab 5 of Vol. 1 of the Claimants' documents for the closing hearing (Shearman & Sterling)). They note that 20 of these 37 government decisions, including GD 194/1999, were signed by Mr. Nicolae Staiculescu, who testified that the incentives were to be offered for the entire period during which the area was a disfavored region (WS of N. Staiculescu, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22).\n\n367.\n\nThe Claimants also note that Mr. Marcu, who was the president of the National Agency for Regional Development, submitted similar testimony:\n\nWe interpreted Article 4 as a firm pledge, commitment on behalf of the government to maintain the zone for a ten-year period in order to persuade investors that we were meaning what we were saying and to give them incentives to invest bigger sums of money in those areas to fulfil the needs of those regions, for example. This created employment, provided social protection through income and also social protection for the families of the miners. (Tr., Day 7, 15:2-9 (Marcu))\n\n368.\n\nThe Claimants argue that neither Mr. Staiculescu nor Mr. Marcu's testimony was challenged at the hearing on that point.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimants find further support in the Methodological Norms issued through GD 728/2001 (Exh. R-35, R-69), which define the period in which companies are deemed to have benefitted from the incentives for purposes of the obligation to repay the incentives if they are voluntarily liquidated or cease operations under Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24, as \"the period between the moment when the certificate of investor in the disfavored area was obtained and the moment when the disfavored area ceases to exist\" (Article 1(f) of GD 728/2001, as translated in Exh. R-69). In the case of temporary investor certificates, \"followed by the procurement of the certificate of investor in disfavored area, the period is calculated from the moment the provisional certificate of investor is obtained until the disfavored area ceases to exist\" (*Id*.). Further, Article 5 of GD 728/2001 (as translated in Exh. R-35) confirms this when it states that \"[t]he business entities which obtained the certificate of investor in the disfavored area and which perform activities from fields of interest other than those provided under annex no. 1 shall continue to benefit from facilities under the law, until the expiry of the period for which the disfavored area was declared.\"\n\n370.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is thus clear from EGO 24, read in conjunction with the methodological norms, that the incentives were to be granted for the entire period between the date of the granting of the investment certificate (temporary or permanent), and the expiry of the disfavored area, which in the case of \u015etei-Nucet was 1 April 2009. This was further evidenced by the PICs issued to the Corporate Claimants, which expressly stated that the certificate holder benefitted from the incentives under GD 194/1999 and that the certificate was valid until 1 April 2009.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that this interpretation is the only one that makes sense from a teleological standpoint. According to the Claimants, if the incentives could have been revoked at any time, they would have been ineffective in incentivizing investment, because investors would have lacked the certainty that they would have needed to commit funds.\n\n372.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's contentions, the Claimants submit that the implementing measures (such as GD 194/1999 and the PICs) did not go beyond what was authorized in the primary legislation (EGO 24). They argue that the only sensible interpretation of EGO 24 is that it authorized the grant by government decision of a predetermined list of incentives for a period between 3 and 10 years. The Claimants contend that this was confirmed by Prof. Baias, the Respondent's expert on Romanian law, who testified that when GD 194/1999 was adopted, it was not in conflict with EGO 24. Rather, his position was that it became in conflict with the modified version of EGO 24 when the incentives were revoked, because GD 194/1999 was not modified accordingly (Tr., Day 5, 264:5-266-2 (Reed/Baias)).\n\n373.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Prof. Baias's testimony confirms that, at the time when GD 194/1999 was enacted, it provided that the incentives set out in Annex 2 were being granted for the full period until 1 April 2009, and that it neither contradicted nor added to EGO 24. This proves that, at the time that the investments were made, the Claimants had a clear and unambiguous commitment from the Romanian State that the incentives would be granted for 10 years. There was nothing unlawful or improper in that commitment, and any contradiction only arose when the incentives were repealed prematurely.\n\n374.\n\nThe Claimants also deny that the various amendments made to the EGO 24 regime demonstrate the absence of such a commitment by the Romanian State. Even if significant amendments were made to the EGO 24 regime to the investors' detriment, they were done in a way to protect existing investors' rights, or in order to address specific problems in relation to specific industries or in relation to Romania's tax regime.\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the absence of a stabilization clause did not mean that Romania could renege on its commitment. Contrary to the Respondent's contention, the *Parkerings v. Lithuania31* case does not require a stabilization clause to prevent a state from amending its legislation. In the Claimants' view, the *Parkerings* tribunal cites a stabilization clause as one (but not the only) type of measure pursuant to which a state can promise to freeze or stabilize an existing regulatory framework. The Claimants submit that an express promise enshrined in the legislation to keep a particular regulatory framework in place for a defined period of time also constitutes such an undertaking. In other words, the Claimants submit that, in agreeing to provide certain incentives for ten years, the state in effect agrees not to change the law before then. According to the Claimants, an additional promise that the state will not renege on its earlier promise would be superfluous.\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8), Award, 11 September 2007 (hereinafter *\"Parkerings v. Lithuania\"* or *\"Parkerings\"*),\n\n376.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's reliance on Decision 130/2003 of the Constitutional Court of Romania (Exh. RL-214) is misplaced, because it deals with incentives granted under Law 35 and not the incentives granted under EGO 24. It is thus a matter of pure speculation what the Constitutional Court would have found if it had been dealing with EGO 24.\n\n377.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants reject Prof. Baias' opinion that it is possible to extrapolate from Decision 130/2003 what the Constitutional Court would have decided in a case dealing with EGO 24. The Claimants argue that Prof. Baias based his opinion on the premise that Law 35 and EGO 24 were \"more or less identical\" (Tr., Day 6, 27:9-10), when in fact there are key differences between Law 35 and EGO 24 which according to the Claimants go to the root of the Constitutional Court's reasoning in Decision 130/2003. The Claimants contend that Law 35 provided positive discrimination in the form of incentives for foreign investors investing anywhere in Romania, without requiring the investor to fulfill any requirements. Unlike EGO 24, Law 35 did not require the investor to invest in a disfavored area, nor did it require it to create any particular number of new jobs or employ the unemployed. It was not even necessary to obtain an investor certificate; all that was required was proof that the investor was foreign. The Claimants argue that the Constitutional Court decided that the repeal of Law 35 incentives did not breach the rule of law because it merely did away with positive discrimination and put foreign investors on a level playing field with domestic competition.\n\n378.\n\nTo the contrary, the Claimants argue that, to qualify for the incentives under EGO 24, the investor was required to show that it had met its side of the bargain. This included fulfilling all the obligations mentioned above, in addition to submitting an investment plan, undergoing an on-site inspection and various monitoring procedures during the lifetime of the investments. Thus, in the Claimants' submission, Decision 130/2000 is of no assistance and of no relevance to an analysis of EGO 24.\n\n**c. Romania breached the BIT's umbrella clause**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nIn view of the above, the Claimants contend that, by revoking the Raw Materials Incentive effective 22 February 2005, Romania breached a specific obligation it had entered into with respect to the Claimants' investments, and as such violated the BIT's umbrella clause.\n\n**2. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it has breached the BIT's umbrella clause. It contends that the Claimants' umbrella clause claim does not comport with the plain text of Article 2(4) of the BIT, and is inconsistent with established jurisprudence on the application of umbrella clauses. In particular, the Respondent argues that the regulatory acts upon which the Claimants rely created no \"obligation\" enforceable through Article 2(4). Thus, the necessary predicate of Article 2(4) - an enforceable obligation under Romanian law - is absent. The Respondent argues that Romania never \"entered into\" any obligation specifically with the Claimants, and nothing in the relevant Romanian legal texts suggests that Romania undertook to freeze its regulatory regime for ten years (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 175-188; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 104-120, 203-206; Tr., Day 13, 75-134 (Petrochilos)).\n\n381.\n\nSection (a) below addresses the Respondent's comments with respect to the nature and scope of the BIT's umbrella clause. Section (b) sets out its comments on the existence of an obligation covered by the umbrella clause. Section (c) addresses its arguments on the absence of a breach of the umbrella clause.\n\n**a. Nature and scope of the BIT's umbrella clause**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the umbrella clause contained in Article 2(4) of the BIT is one of the narrowest used in investment treaties. According to the Respondent, its formulation limits the scope of the provision in the following ways:\n\na. It is limited to \"obligations\", and does not cover \"undertakings\".\n\nb. The obligations must have been \"entered into with an investor\". It is not open to obligations or undertakings \"related to an investment\", as do the majority of umbrella clauses.\n\nc. The obligations must be specific (i.e., entered into with a specific investor), and thus it does not cover general obligations.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent notes that there is debate on whether umbrella clauses elevate municipal law rights to the international law realm, or simply provide an international remedy to enforce rights that remain in their essence and scope creations of national law. However, it argues that the Claimants' case fails under either proposition. This is because, according to the Respondent, generally-applicable regulatory and legislative acts, standing alone, do not give rise to the kind of obligations covered by umbrella clauses (even under those more broadly formulated). In the Respondent's view, umbrella clauses only protect contractual or quasi-contractual obligations.\n\n384.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the writings of Dr. F.A. Mann, Dr. Shihata, Prof. Dolzer and Ms. Stevens, Prof. Gaillard and Prof. Schreuer, noting that in their view umbrella clauses mainly or exclusively protect contractual commitments. The Respondent also relies on *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, where the tribunal, faced with an umbrella clause broader than the present one (applying to obligations \"with regard to investments\"), found that\n\nIt should be clear that this umbrella clause does not come into play when the breach complained of concerns general obligations arising from the law of the host State.... Therefore, the provisions of the [disputed legislation] cannot be a source of obligations that Argentina has assumed specifically with regard to the Claimant's investment company and which are protected under the BIT's umbrella clause.32\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/9), Award, 5 September 2008 (hereinafter *\"Continental Casualty v. Argentina\"*), \u00b6\u00b6 300 and 302.\n\n385.\n\nTo the contrary, the Respondent contends that there is no authority for the Claimants' position that legislative or regulatory acts, standing alone, can constitute \"obligations\" enforceable through an umbrella clause. They note that most decisions applying umbrella clauses have involved contractual obligations entered into by the state, and in the few cases where tribunals have found a breach of provisions due to a legislative change (such as *LG&E v. Argentina*), the state had provided separate and specific commitments to investors in which it guaranteed that a particular legislative regime would not change. Specifically, it argues that, in *LG&E v. Argentina,* the tribunal's determination that the dismantling of the regulatory regime in the gastransmission sector resulted in the breach of the (broadly-worded) umbrella clause turned upon specific assurances that Argentina had given investors that the regulatory environment would remain stable.\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimants' reliance on *CMS v. Argentina* is misplaced, noting that the part of that award dealing with umbrella clauses was subsequently annulled by an ICSID *ad hoc* committee. The Respondent argues that the *CMS v. Argentina* annulment committee reversed the tribunal's findings with respect to whether umbrella clauses can, as a matter of principle, extend to general legislative acts, in the following terms:\n\n[I]t seems clear that Article II(2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently of the BIT itself (i.e. under the law of the host State or possibly under international law). Further they must be specific obligations concerning investment. They do not cover general requirements imposed by the law of the host State.33\n\n*CMS v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 25 September 2007, \u00b6 95a.\n\n387.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the drafting of the umbrella clause applicable in this case reinforces the inadmissibility of a claim based upon regulatory acts. It argues that, by limiting the scope of the provision to obligations \"entered into with\" qualifying investors, the drafters of the BIT intended it to apply exclusively to contractual or quasi-contractual obligations (e.g., those arising from an individual license granted by the state), which are created and enforceable under domestic law. Unilateral instruments such as laws and regulations, which are per se liable to change, cannot be understood to have been \"entered into\" with anyone.\n\n**b. Romania did not enter into a specific obligation with the Claimants**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that, whatever the scope of the BIT's umbrella clause, the claim fails because there is no \"obligation\" that may trigger the application of the clause. The Respondent contends that, in order to be elevated to the protection of the umbrella clause, this obligation must have given the Claimants an actionable vested right under Romanian law.\n\n389.\n\nRelying on *SGS v. Philippines* and *Eureko v. Poland,* the Respondent submits that the obligation that is protected under the umbrella clause has a proper law (usually domestic law), and its nature does not change by being enforced under the treaty. Therefore, to be actionable under the treaty, the obligation must have been actionable under domestic law. For this, the alleged obligation must have constituted a vested right under domestic law, which the Respondent argues was the case in *Enron v. Argentina* and *LG&E v. Argentina*. However, it argues that it is not the case here.\n\n390.\n\nContrary to the Claimants' contentions, the Respondent argues that under Romanian law the Romanian State was under no obligation to make all of the facilities available to the Claimants for 10 years. The Claimants have identified no contractual or quasicontractual obligations of any kind that might have been entered into and owed to them in relation to the facilities, nor have the Claimants alleged any assurances or other unilateral undertakings by Romania directed to them specifically. As a result, the Claimants had no vested right to the facilities.\n\n391.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' case as to the source of that alleged obligation (and corresponding right) has changed over time, but all of those theories fail. The Respondent also contends that if Romania had decided to bind itself to regulatory stasis for ten years, it would have done so in one clear instrument, through an appropriate organ, and that instrument would contain clear terms with respect to the promise of stability and its duration. This obligation cannot be implied from a patchwork of documents and a selection of surrounding circumstances.\n\n392.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent contends that none of the regulatory acts invoked by the Claimants (EGO 24/1998, GD 194/1999 and GD 1199/2000), whether alone or in conjunction with the PICs, created obligations \"entered into\" with the Claimants.\n\n393.\n\nFirst, the source of the obligation could not have been EGO 24. The Respondent concedes that \"there is no doubt that EGO 24 set forth a generalized entitlement that could be claimed by qualifying investors\" (Tr., Day 13, 85:7-10 (Petrochilos)). Article 4(c) of EGO 24 stated that a government decision would determine the facilities \"provided by law\" that would be granted to investors (which confirms that the source of the entitlement is EGO 24). But it contained no promise as to the length of time the facilities would remain available, nor any stabilization language (unlike its predecessor, Law 35, which did contain express stabilization language). The Respondent further argues that, under Romanian law, general laws such as EGO 24 do not confer individual vested rights (as was confirmed by the Romanian Constitutional Court in Decision 130/2003).\n\n394.\n\nSecond, the Respondent notes that the Claimants' latest theory seems to be that GD 194/1999, read together with the PICs, creates an obligation for the State. However, according to the Respondent this is impossible as a matter of Romanian law. Relying on the expert opinion of Prof. Baias, it argues that these were subsidiary normative or administrative instruments issued to implement and administer EGO 24 and Law 20/1999, which could not modify or contradict the authority of a government ordinance or a law, and as such could not have granted an entitlement beyond what EGO 24 authorized. In particular, they could not have imposed significant, long-term obligations on the State that the authorizing statute did not impose. As a result of the hierarchy of Romanian laws, the Government, implementing the law through the government decision, could not have bound the legislature not to change the law. And once EGO 24 was modified, GD 194/1999 could not have had a broader field of application than the modified EGO 24. Thus, no prudent investor in Romania could have understood Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 as freezing the facilities there listed. For the same reason, because EGO 24 created no vested right but only a general entitlement, neither could GD 194/1999 or the PICs create such a vested right.\n\n395.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' theory has no support from their Romanian law expert, Prof. Mihai. Considering that the nature of GD 194/1999 and the PICs has become the cornerstone of their expropriation, umbrella clause and fair and equitable treatment cases, the Respondent considers it notable that Prof. Mihai made no mention of either instrument in his expert report.\n\n396.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the PICs could have been the source of an investor's right to the EGO 24 incentives. For the Respondent, the correct interpretation is that the PICs were merely administrative tools that certified the holders' eligibility to obtain the facilities; the source of the right was EGO 24. Specifically, the Respondent argues that Article 5 of the GD 525/1999 published on 8 July 1999 (Exh. R-6),34 which approved the 1999 Methodological Norms for the application of EGO 24, stated that the \"incentives provided by the law shall be granted pursuant to the certificate of the investor in a disadvantaged region\". Such a certificate was to be issued by the relevant Regional Development Agency, upon an investor's request. According to the Respondent, the language of Article 5 makes it explicit that the PICs merely certified eligibility to \"incentives provided by the law\". That law was EGO 24, as approved by Law 20, neither of which contained any provision concerning their duration nor any restriction on the government's ability to amend or repeal them.\n\nThe Respondent notes that GD 525/1999 replaced an earlier version of the methodological norms, contained in GD 907 of 1998, published on 22 December 1998.\n\n397.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this conclusion was reaffirmed by a subsequent version of the Methodological Norms, adopted by GD 728/2001 (Exh. R-35). Article 4(1) of these Methodological Norms stated: \"The *facilities provided by the law* are granted based on the certificate of the investor in the disfavored area\" (emphasis added by the Respondent). According to the Respondent, this demonstrates that the content of the facilities was established by law (i.e., EGO 24) and that PICs were an administrative tool attesting to eligibility to access facilities available under EGO 24.\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the language of the PICs themselves does not change this conclusion. All the PICs stated was that the titleholder was the beneficiary of the facilities granted under GD 194/1999, in accordance with the provisions of EGO 24 approved and amended by Law 20, and in accordance with the government decision approving the methodological norms. Accordingly, all the PICs did was certify that the titleholder was the beneficiary of the facilities granted by the law, whatever the law determined that those facilities were at any point in time.\n\n399.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the PICs did not list any individual facilities, let alone purport to stabilize them for any particular period. The PICs only stated that they were valid until a given date. That only meant that they certified eligibility to whatever facilities were available under the law until that date.\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' argument that the PICs were the source of the right to the facilities because they had to present them every time that they wanted to benefit from them. The PICs were needed so that administrators did not have to evaluate eligibility on each occasion that a business applied for an exemption. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that it was not necessary to obtain a new PIC each time EGO 24 was amended; the PIC continued to certify eligibility to the remaining facilities in EGO 24, as amended. This was confirmed by the Claimants' expert, Prof. Mihai (Tr., Day 5, 215).\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the administrative process to qualify for a PIC was equivalent to a contractual negotiation, or that the PICs were tantamount to contracts. In the legal order in which that process occurred, the issuance of a PIC did not create a contract. Nor did the obligation to submit an investment plan amount to a bilateral deal; the investment plan was merely a requirement for the government to establish that investors met the qualifying criteria.\n\n402.\n\nSimilarly, the requirements to employ a certain number of unemployed persons and to have made certain investments were part of the criteria for eligibility; they did not establish the existence of a promise that the facilities would be available for a certain duration. The Respondent adds that it is misleading to suggest that these requirements show that EGO 24 was intended to foster capital intensive industries, because there was no threshold of magnitude for a qualifying investment, the employment requirement was met by employing ten persons, five of which had to be unemployed, and the eligible sectors covered a wide range of activities.\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that EGO 24 created an obligation for investors to maintain their investments for twice as long as the investor is a recipient of the incentives. The Respondent alleges that it \"has repeatedly stated that the obligation does not exist and that (therefore) it has no intention of enforcing it\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 118). In any event, it argues that the alleged obligation is of only theoretical interest, because the Claimants have no desire to move the operations from Bihor county, and thus the state has never had the occasion to enforce the alleged obligation. However, it notes that Prof. Mihai did not address this matter in his expert opinion, and the Claimants have not cited any instances in which any investor has been subjected to the supposed obligation, or any Romanian court or agency has interpreted it in that fashion.\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that neither the monitoring process to which the Claimants were submitted, nor the alleged promotion of the EGO 24 regime by government officials, could have given rise to a promise that the facilities would remain unchanged for any period of time.\n\n405.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Romanian Constitutional Court disagrees with the Claimants' theory: when the profit tax exemption available under Law 35 of 1991 was repealed, the Constitutional Court found that the repeal of that exemption could not be construed as the termination of a contract, nor as an infringement of the right to property or of the investor's right to recover debt (Decision 130/2003). The Respondent notes that Prof. Mihai called this decision *ultra vires* at the hearing but did not discuss it in his expert report, while Prof. Baias confirmed the decision's relevance for this case. Thus, Romania submits that the Tribunal should afford this decision great weight and conclude that GD 194/1999, alone or together with the PICs, did not constitute a contractual or other obligation under Romanian law.\n\n**c. Even if the umbrella clause were applicable, Romania did not breach it**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nEven assuming that the regulatory acts relied upon by the Claimants could have created \"obligations entered into\" with the Claimants, the Respondent argues that it could not have failed to observe such obligations simply by modifying the facilities. If the underlying obligation (properly construed under its governing law) has not been breached, then there cannot be a breach of the umbrella clause.\n\n407.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent argues that nothing in EGO 24 could be construed as a guarantee to preserve EGO 24 unchanged for ten years. The only reference to duration is found in Article 5, which provides that \"[a] geographical area can be declared a disfavoured zone at least for three years but not for more than ten\". Romania did not breach or amend this provision: both \u015etei-Nucet and Dragane\u015fti retained their status of \"disfavoured regions\" until April 2009, as provided in GD 94/199935 and GD 1199/2000.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Respondent refers to GD 194/1999.\n\n408.\n\nAs to the availability of the facilities, the Respondent argues that there was nothing in EGO 24 that prevented the Respondent from eliminating some of them (the Respondent notes that the Profit Tax Incentive was maintained). Relying on *Parkerings v. Lithuania*,36 the Respondent contends that the mere existence of a law or regulation in no way implies that the government will not amend its terms. EGO 24/1998 contained no \"stabilization\" element that could ensure that the facilities listed therein would remain unchanged for ten years. Thus, Romania could not have assumed any obligation to freeze the content of the facilities regime simply by promulgating EGO 24/1998. To the contrary, the Respondent argues that by the time the facilities were first extended under EGO 24/1998, Romanian law on state aid (Exh. R-75) specifically provided that such measures were subject to possible repeal at any time. In particular, Article 13 of the State Aid Law provided:\n\n(1) The Competition Council and the Competition Office will supervise on a permanent basis all the existent aids. If it is determined that an existent aid distorts relevantly the normal competitive environment and affects the proper enforcement of the international agreements in which Romania is a party, the Competition Council will request the aid provider to adopt proper measures in order to remove its incompatibility with this law. Such measures may include a recommendation for cancellation or amendment of the existent aid. Such recommendations will be submitted also to the Competition Office achievement monitoring of the imposed measures.\n\n(2) If the measures are not adopted by the aid provider, within the time frame indicated in the request, the Competition Council may decide to stop the granting of the existent aid or may impose conditions and obligations which may insure the compatibility of the aid with this law's dispositions.\n\nThe decision will not have a retroactive effect and must allow the aid provider a reasonable time period in order to comply with such decision.\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania*, \u00b6 332.\n\n409.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent argues that as Romania was under no obligation to make all of the facilities available to the Claimants for 10 years, failure to do so cannot constitute a breach of the umbrella clause.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**a. Interpretation of the BIT's umbrella clause**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the BIT provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has entered into with an investor of the other Contracting Party with regard to his or her investment.\"\n\n411.\n\nThe Parties agree that, for the umbrella clause to apply, Romania must have entered into an obligation with the Claimants with regard to their investment. The Parties further agree that this obligation must be specific. The Parties dispute whether the EGO 24 framework and the PICs did in fact give rise to such an obligation. The Parties also dispute whether the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility constituted a breach of any such obligation, to the extent it arose.\n\n412.\n\nThe first step in the Tribunal's analysis is thus to determine whether the EGO 24 framework gave rise to an \"obligation\" in the meaning of Article 2(4) of the BIT. Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this rule.37 Accordingly, the Tribunal must first turn to the ordinary meaning of the term \"obligation\".\n\nIn doing so, the Tribunal adopts the line followed by the tribunals in *SGS v. Philippines,* \u00b6\u00b6 114- 128 (although it partially based its decision on considerations extrinsic from the text); *Eureko v. Poland,* \u00b6\u00b6 244-260; *Enron v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 273-277; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29), Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 February 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 167-168; *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5) *,* Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012 (hereinafter *\"Burlington v. Ecuador\"),* \u00b6 212.\n\n413.\n\nRelying on *Enron v. Argentina*, the Claimants argue that \"[u]nder its ordinary meaning the phrase \u2018any obligation' refers to obligations regardless of their nature\", noting that \"[t]ribunals interpreting this expression have found it to cover both contractual obligations such as payment as well as obligations assumed through law or regulation.\"38\n\n*Enron v. Argentina,* \u00b6 274.\n\n414.\n\nThe Respondent denies this. It argues that generally-applicable regulatory and legislative acts, standing alone, do not give rise to the kind of obligations covered by umbrella clauses (even under those more broadly formulated). In the Respondent's view, umbrella clauses only protect contractual or quasi-contractual obligations.\n\n415.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Eureko v. Poland* that the term \"\u2018[a]ny' obligations is capacious; it means not only obligations of a certain type, but \u2018any' -that is to say, all - obligations entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.\"39 In addition, the BIT specifies that these obligations must also be \"entered into with an investor [...] with regard to his or her investment\". This language suggests that the state must have committed with respect to a particular investor with regard to his or her investments.40 Indeed, both sides agree that the obligation must be specific. Thus, the umbrella clause in this BIT covers obligations of any nature, regardless of their source, provided that they are indeed \"obligations\" entered into with a particular investor with regard to his or her investment.\n\n*Eureko v. Poland*, \u00b6 246.\n\n*See, e.g.,* F.A. Mann, \"British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,\" 52 British Yearbook of International Law (1981), Exhibit RL-257, p 246 (explaining that an umbrella clause \"only covers an obligation arising from a particular commitment either of the Contracting Parties may have entered into. [...] What is assumed is that the State has entered into a particular commitment which imposes obligations. Such obligations may arise from contract with the State or from the terms of the licence granted by it. It may be express or implied, it may be in writing or oral. But it must be clearly ascertainable as an obligation of the State itself arising from its own commitments. No difficulty occurs where the contract is made with the State itself - and the term may fairly be said to comprise its instrumentalities, even if they are separate legal entities, as well as companies of which it is the sole shareholder. But where the contract is made with a private person, then the provision only applies if and in so far as an obligation of the State arising from its own particular commitment (as opposed to existing general legislation) may be discerned. Thus if the law of the land provides that the State is liable for the torts of its servants this is not an 'obligation arising from a particular commitment' the State may have entered into and may be changed, though in certain circumstances this may become subject to the provisions about expropriation.\").\n\n416.\n\nHaving said this, for the umbrella clause to be triggered, there must be an obligation in the first place. The BIT does not define \"obligation\", nor have the Parties attempted to do so. The Claimants simply state that the term obligation is equivalent to an \"undertaking\", because when someone undertakes to do something, they become obliged to do that thing. The Respondent, however, submits (and the Claimants do not seem to dispute) that the determination of whether an obligation exists must be done in accordance to domestic law. Specifically, the Respondent has argued that in order to be elevated to the protection of the umbrella clause, the obligation must have given the Claimants an actionable vested right under Romanian law.\n\n417.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, establishing whether an obligation exists is a question that cannot be answered by turning solely to the interpretation of the meaning of this term as stated in the BIT. The purpose of the umbrella clause is to cover or \"elevate\" to the protection of the BIT an obligation of the state that is separate from, and additional to, the treaty obligations that it has assumed under the BIT. As noted by the *Burlington v. Ecuador* tribunal, this separate and additional obligation does not exist in a vacuum; it is subject to its own proper law.41 In the words of the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines*, an umbrella clause\n\n... does not convert non-binding domestic blandishments into binding international obligations. It does not convert questions of contract law into questions of treaty law. In particular it does not change the proper law of the [relevant agreement] from the law of the Philippines to international law.42\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador,* \u00b6 214.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines,* \u00b6 126.\n\n418.\n\nThis Tribunal concurs with this view. Thus, whether an obligation has arisen depends on the law governing that obligation, and so the interpretation of the term \"obligation\" for purposes of the umbrella clause would rely primarily on that law rather than on international law. In other words, to be afforded the protection of the BIT, the obligation must qualify as such under its governing law. In this case, the governing law cannot be other than Romanian law and the Parties did not point to any other possibly applicable law. The obligation to which the Claimants wish to extend the protection of the BIT purportedly arose under EGO 24, its implementing legislation and/or the granting of the PICs. Thus, the existence and content of that purported obligation depends on Romanian law.\n\n419.\n\nAccordingly, whether Romania was bound by an \"obligation\" to provide the incentives to the Claimants until 31 March 2009 is a question to be determined by Romanian law. The Tribunal will now address whether such an obligation arose.\n\n**b. Did Romania enter into a specific obligation with the Claimants?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, through the EGO 24 framework, Romania entered into a specific obligation with the Claimants with regard to their investment, which consisted of Romania's undertaking with respect to the Claimants to maintain the EGO 24 incentives in the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored region for the full 10-year period provided by GD 194/1999. The Respondent concedes that EGO 24 created a generalized entitlement that could be claimed by qualifying investors, but denies that it promised that the incentives would remain in place or unchanged for any specific period. It also denies that this entitlement gives rise to an obligation on the part of Romania under Romanian law.\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the content of the entitlement created by EGO 24 (Section (i)). It will then address whether it gives rise to a specific obligation for Romania under Romanian law that may trigger the application of the umbrella clause (Section (ii)).\n\n**i. Content of the Claimants' entitlement**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence before it, the Tribunal's conclusion is that EGO 24 created a general scheme of incentives available to investors who fulfilled certain requirements, which were later \"granted\" to qualifying investors through a specific administrative act (the PIC). In other words, the legislation created a generalized entitlement that could be claimed by qualifying investors, but this general entitlement later crystallized with respect to qualifying investors through the granting of the PICs, becoming from that moment on a specific entitlement with respect to specific investors. Therefore, the Tribunal does not need to decide whether a general entitlement, in a law or regulation, could give rise to an obligation subject to the umbrella clause; here the general obligation was converted into a specific commitment.\n\n423.\n\nIn particular, EGO 24, as republished on 8 November 1999 (Exh. R-68) provided that the Government could declare the creation of certain \"disadvantaged areas\", at the proposal of the National Council for Regional Development (Article 3). This declaration would be made by means of a \"government decision\", which would also approve (a) the period for which a geographical area was declared a disadvantaged region, (b) the fields of investments, and (c) \"the required financing and advantages provided by law, and granted to the investors\" (Article 4). Article 5 provided that \"[a] geographical area may be declared a disadvantaged area for a period of at least 3 years, but for not more than 10 years, with possibility for extension, under the conditions of this Emergency Ordinance.\" Article 6(1) went on to say that investors meeting certain requirements \"will be granted the following advantages for their new investments in these regions\", and then listed those advantages (that is, the incentives or facilities) (*see* paragraph 148 above).\n\n424.\n\nIt is thus clear that EGO 24 did not stand alone: by its own terms it required an important part of its implementation to be carried out by way of a government decision (including the determination of the disfavored area and of the incentives or facilities that would be available for investors in that area). For the case of \u015etei-Nucet, this government decision was GD 194/1999 (Exh. C-31, C-280), later extended to Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti by GD 1190/2000. The boundaries of the disfavored region were extended to include Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti by means of GD 1190/2000 on 29 November 2000 (Exh. C-32).\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even if EGO 24 delegated certain aspects to a government decision, because of the hierarchy of norms under Romanian law it was legally impossible for GD 194/1999 or GD 1190/2000 to grant anything that EGO 24 did not authorize. This may be so, but based on the relevant laws and regulations and the testimony of the Respondent's expert, Prof. Baias, the Tribunal concludes that GD 194/1999 and GD 1190/2000 did exactly what was authorized by EGO 24:\n\na. GD 194/1999 determined that \u015etei-Nucet would be a disfavored region (Articles 1 and 2), established the time period for that (i.e., 10 years, Article 3), and provided that, \"during the existence of the disfavored region, established according to this decision, the facilities under annex no. 2\\*) will be granted\" (Article 4 of GD 194/1999). In turn, Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 listed all of the incentives provided under Article 6(1) of EGO 24 (*see* paragraph 153 above). Article 5 of GD 194/1999 also provided that \"[t]he domains of interest for the achievement of investments in the zone shall be those provided for in Annex No. 3.\" In turn, Annex 3 provided that these domains of interest were agriculture and \"zootechny\", production (except the manufacture of distilled alcoholic drinks and manufacture of ethyl alcohol by fermentation), services (except public alimentation not included in an investment in tourism), trade (except marketing of products not made in activities performed in the zone) and environmental protection and rehabilitation of natural sites. Article 6 of GD 194/1999 provided that Annexes 1-3 would \"be an integral part of the present decision.\"\n\nb. Similarly, GD 1190/2000 extended the boundaries of the disfavored region to include Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti (Article I), confirmed that \"the period for which the \u015etei-Nucet region is established as a disfavored region shall end on 31 March 2009\", and added that \"[f]or the commune of Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti, the facilities related to the disfavored region shall be granted commencing with the date this decision is published in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I.\" (Article II)\n\n426.\n\nProf. Baias confirmed that GD 194/1999 was *intra vires* at the time it was issued and until the time when EGO 24 was amended in 2004 by GO 94/2004 to revoke the facilities, because, in Prof. Baias's view, the subsidiary norm is automatically restricted to the scope of the amended primary norm.43 However, at the time of its issuance in 1999 and up until the facilities were revoked in November 2004 (or February 2005, if we take the effective date), GD 194/1999 validly provided that qualifying investors investing in the \u015etei-Nucet area (later expanded to include Dragane\u015fti) would be granted the incentives listed in Annex 2 until the date in which the region ceased to be disfavored (i.e., 1 April 2009). The same conclusion should apply to GD 1190/2000.\n\nSpecifically, Prof. Baias testified:  \n Q. So are we agreed, then, that when the government decision was issued, the way in which it should be interpreted is that in \u015etei-Nucet, the incentives granted, or indicated in Annex 2, would be granted for the full duration of the time when \u015etei- Nucet was declared a disfavoured zone; that was the position at that time?  \n A. At the very moment of the adoption of this government decision, I agree.  \n Q. That was in conformity with EGO 24 at that time?  \n A. At that moment.  \n Q. So your position is that because EGO 24 was subsequently changed, this government decision became in contradiction with -- not EGO 24 as it was, but the subsequent legislative position?  \n A. Yes. With the subsequent form of the EGO 24 as it was modified.  \n (Tr., Day 5, 265:11-266-2 (Reed/Baias)).\n\n427.\n\nThus, EGO 24, GD 194/1999 and GD 1190/2000 by themselves do nothing more than establish a general entitlement to qualifying investors in the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored region. Standing alone, they do not give rise to a specific entitlement to a specific investor. The rules for the actual granting of the incentives to investors were established by the Methodological Norms (GD 525/1999, the \"1999 Methodological Norms\", and later by GD 728/2001, the \"2001 Methodological Norms\"). Pursuant to these Methodological Norms, qualifying investors (only) became entitled to the incentives once they received their PIC (or TIC, on a temporary basis).\n\n428.\n\nSpecifically, Article 5 of the 1999 Methodological Norms provided:\n\n\"(1) The incentives provided by the law ***shall be granted*** [in Romanian, \" *se acorda* \"] pursuant to the certificate of investor in a disfavored area, which is issued, upon the business entity's request, by the Regional Development Agency under the jurisdiction of which the head office of such business entity is located.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(3) Business entities requesting the issuance of the certificate of investor in a disfavored area shall prove they meet the requirements set forth by the [EGO].\n\n(4) Emerging business entities, unable to produce evidence regarding the investment, the commissioning of the operations and the creation of new jobs, may request the issuance of a temporary certificate of investor in a disfavored area, for a maximum of 3 months. In case they do not bring, during this period, evidence of having met the requirements set forth by the [EGO], they shall be compelled to pay and return, respectively the equivalent value of all the incentives they have benefited of.\n\n(5) The temporary certificate shall be issued pursuant to the business entity's commitment regarding the investment and the creation of new jobs.\n\n[\u2026]\"\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n429.\n\nThe substance of these requirements was repeated in Articles 4 and 5 of the 2001 version, which added two specifications:\n\na. Investors applying for a certificate of investor had to prove that they had \"at least 10 employees with individual employment contracts for an indefinite term out of which at least 5 should be employed from the unoccupied work\" (Article 4(4)).\n\nb. \"The business entities which obtained the certificate of investor in the disfavoured area and which perform activities from fields of interest other than those provided under annex no. 1 shall continue to benefit from facilities under the law, until the expiry of the period for which the disfavoured area was declared\" (Article 5(3)).\n\n430.\n\nProf. Mihai testified in cross-examination that the correct translation of Article 5(1) of GD 525/1999 should be \"[t]he facilities provided by the law shall be granted on the basis of the certificate of investor\" (Tr., Day 5, 214:14-215:1). Although the Respondent argues that the key words here are \"provided by the law\", in the Tribunal's view the key words are rather that such facilities \"shall be granted.\" The applicable regulation (EGO 24) \"provided\" or created certain incentives or facilities; GD 194/1999 and GD 1190/2000 (by express delegation of the law) determined which of these incentives would be available to investors in a particular disfavored area and for what time period, and the Methodological Norms established the rules under which these incentives would be granted to specific investors. But the actual \"granting\", \"awarding\" or \"vesting\" of the entitlement to the incentives occurred at the moment of the issuance of the PICs. It is in this moment when the general entitlement becomes a specific entitlement with respect to a particular investor.\n\n431.\n\nIn other words, the specific entitlement of a particular investor to the incentives provided under the EGO 24 framework arises from an administrative act of specific scope (i.e., directed to specific investors with respect to specific investments). This administrative act is evidenced by the issuance of the PICs. In the Tribunal's view, it is irrelevant for purposes of determining the existence of a specific entitlement whether the PIC merely certified eligibility to the incentives under generally applicable legislation. The fact is that, without having been granted a PIC, an investor could not benefit from the incentives offered by EGO 24, GD 194/1999 and GD 1190/2000. In other words, the granting of the PIC was the moment in which a particular relationship between the Government and the investor was \"perfected\": an investor could benefit from the privileges offered by the legislative framework only after having applied for a PIC, proved it fulfilled the requirements and received a favorable decision from the government in the form of a PIC. Only thereafter did the investor have the actual entitlement to the incentives, and only after that moment did it have the obligations established under EGO 24.\n\n432.\n\nThe question that follows is: did the regulatory framework provide that this specific entitlement would last until 1 April 2009? The Tribunal finds that it did.\n\n433.\n\nEGO 24 itself did not say anything with respect to the timing of the entitlement, but by its own terms it delegated this determination to a government decision. For \u015etei-Nucet, this government decision was GD 194/1999. Article 4 of GD 194/1999 provided that the facilities listed in Annex 2 \"shall be granted\" (\" *se acorda* \" in Romanian) during the existence of the disfavored region. In turn, Article 3 provides that \u015etei-Nucet is designated a disfavored region for a period of 10 years, starting on 1 April 1999. This was confirmed by GD 1199/2000 when the boundaries of the region were extended to include Dragane\u015fti, which stated that the designation of the region as disfavored would end on 31 March 2009.\n\n434.\n\nThis was further confirmed by Article 5(3) of the 2001 version of the Methodological Norms (GD 728/2001, Exh. R-35), which provided that:\n\nThe business entities which obtained the certificate of investor in the disfavoured area and which perform activities from fields of interest other than those provided under annex no. 1 ***shall continue to benefit from*** ***facilities under the law, until the expiry of the period for which the disfavoured area was declared***. (Emphasis added)\n\n435.\n\nIn addition, Article 1(f) of the 2001 Methodological Norms defined the period during which it would be understood that an investor had benefitted from the incentives for purposes of Article 7 and 9 of EGO 24 as the period \"comprised between obtaining the certificate of investor in [the] disfavored area and disappearance of the disfavored area; in case of a temporary investor certificate, followed by obtaining an investor certificate in the disfavored area, the period shall be calculated as of obtaining a temporary investor certificate until the disfavored area ceases to exist.\"\n\n436.\n\nIt is true that these provisions were added in the 2001 Methodological Norms, and not in the 1999 version. However, they confirm an interpretation that was already reasonable in light of the interplay of the legal provisions.\n\n437.\n\nIn addition, all three of the Corporate Claimants' PICs provided that the certificate (which certified that they were the beneficiaries of the facilities granted under EGO 24 and GD 194/1999) would be valid until 1 April 2009. Indeed, Romania concedes that the PICs certified eligibility to the incentives until 1 April 2009, arguing however that the PICs only entitled the Claimants to whatever incentives were available under the general scheme from time to time.\n\n438.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that the PICs, in the context of the EGO 24 regulatory framework, provided (or, to use Respondent's words, entitled) that PIC holders would be entitled to the incentives offered under EGO 24 until 1 April 2009.\n\n439.\n\nThe third question that arises is: did the legislative framework provide that the Claimants would be entitled to the same incentives, or at least substantially the same incentives, that were originally provided under GD 194/1999? The PICs merely state that the investor is the \"beneficiary\" of the facilities provided under the general scheme, as republished and amended. This seemingly supports Romania's contention that they merely certified eligibility to whatever incentives were available under the general scheme from time to time.\n\n440.\n\nHowever, Article 4 of GD 194/1999 provides that the facilities listed in Annex 2 \"shall be granted\" during the existence of the disfavored region, and that annex was attached to GD 194/1999 and was deemed to form an \"integral part\" of that decision (*see* paragraph 425.a). It could thus be argued that the facilities listed in that annex are incorporated into the Government Decision and thus \"stabilized\" in some form by the reference to a specific time period. It would be a difficult question to determine whether the Government would thus unduly exceed its authority under Romanian law and what the legal consequences would be under such law, but it is unnecessary to make that determination.\n\n441.\n\nIn fact, the incentives underwent several amendments during the life of EGO 24, which included the revocation of some of the facilities. Specifically:\n\na. On 16 June 2000 (effective 1 July 2000), Romania passed Emergency Government Ordinance No. 75/2000 (\"EGO 75/2000\", Exh. C-45, R-81). Although the Competition Council had issued Decision 244/2000 a month before, EGO 75/2000 ignored the Competition Council's recommendation to eliminate the Raw Materials Incentive. Instead, it amended EGO 24 in the following ways:\n\ni. It amended the Raw Materials Incentive by providing for an exemption (rather than the refund) on customs duties, and excluded spare parts and components from the customs duty exemption. Article 6(1)(b) of EGO 24 was replaced with the following text:\n\nb) the exemption from the payment of customs duties for imported raw material necessary for the own production in the area.\n\nii. It amended the provisions regarding the award of funds under the Special Development Fund.\n\nb. On 7 November 2001, Romania passed Law No. 621/2001 (Exh. R-33, R-129), which amended EGO 75/2000 by, among others, reinstating the customs duties exemption on imported components. Article 6(1)(b) of EGO 24 was replaced with the following text:\n\nb) the exemption of customs duties for imported raw materials and components required to perform the area's own production.\n\nc. On 1 June 2002, Romania passed Law No. 345/2002 (Exh. R-90), which abolished the Machinery Incentive provided under Article 6(1)(a) of EGO 24 (both with respect to customs duties and VAT).\n\nd. On 1 July 2002, Romania passed Law No. 414/2002 (Exh. C-48, R-34), which repealed the Profit Tax Incentive but grandfathered it for investors who held a PIC prior to the date on which this law entered into force (Articles 36(1)(d), 35(3)).\n\ne. On 19 November 2002, Romania passed Law No. 678/2002 (Exh. C-49) which amended the Raw Materials Incentive by excluding from the customs duties exemption raw materials for the production, processing and preservation of meat.\n\nf. In June 2004, Law 239/2004 (Exh. C-50) subjected the remaining facilities to a requirement that they not exceed a threshold of maximum intensity of state aid.\n\ng. On 31 August 2004, Romania passed EGO 94/2004 (Exh. R-94), which abolished all the remaining incentives with the exception of the grandfathered Profit Tax Incentive. EGO 94/2004 also provided that \"[i]n calculating the intensity of state aid, eligible costs related to investments made before 15 September 2004 shall be taken into account.\"\n\n442.\n\nThus, from its enactment in 1998 and until its final revocation in 2004, EGO 24 was amended several times, either to the benefit or to the detriment of PIC holders. The Machinery Incentive was eliminated completely in 2002. The Profit Tax Incentive was repealed in 2002, but grandfathered for PIC holders. The Raw Materials Incentive survived, in some ways enhanced (it was transformed into an exemption instead of a refund in 2000), but its scope of application was modified (it was eliminated for components in 2000 and then reinstated in 2001, and later eliminated for meat products in 2002). Only the Profit Tax Incentive was grandfathered for PIC holders.\n\n443.\n\nThis seems to confirm the Respondent's argument that the legislative framework only provided that PIC holders would be entitled to whatever incentives were available under the regime from time to time. However, the Claimants argue that these amendments (at least until 2002) did not indicate in any way that the entire regime would be brought to a premature conclusion. They argue that EGO 75/2000 strengthened the regime, even against the Competition Council's recommendation, noting that the Raw Materials Incentive was made into an exemption rather than a refund, and that the components part of it was reinstated the following year. They also argue that the amendments to the Machinery Incentive and the Profit Tax Incentive were made in the context of other reforms (VAT laws, profit tax laws) and did not target EGO 24 in the context of state aid. Finally, they argue that the elimination of the Raw Materials Incentive with respect to raw materials for the production, processing and preservation of meat was made to address problems specific to the Romanian meat industry.\n\n444.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Romania's conduct cannot change the content of the entitlement. That Romania did as a matter of fact amend or eliminate certain incentives without grandfathering them does not mean that it was entitled to do so, at least not if that amendment or elimination, in itself or in conjunction with other amendments or eliminations, would amount to a repeal of the entitlement altogether, more precisely of the entitlement based on PICs (or TICs). This does not contradict the principle *lex posterior derogat legi priori:* it is undisputed that Romania may validly amend its laws, and presumably GD 194/1999 could be validly amended by subsequent legislation, but this is not the question.\n\n445.\n\nThe question is whether such an amendment could affect rights or entitlement created by previous laws with respect to private parties. In this case, the question is whether PIC holders continued to have the entitlement to the same incentives specified in Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 despite the later amendments to the EGO 24 regime. This question is addressed in the following section.\n\n**ii. Does Romania's undertaking qualify as an \"obligation\" under Romanian law? If yes, did Romania breach it?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the EGO 24 framework, once specified with respect to the Claimants through the granting of the PICs, created for the Claimants a specific entitlement to the EGO 24 incentives until 1 April 2009. Thus, under the EGO 24 framework Romania committed to provide the EGO 24 incentives until 1 April 2009.\n\n447.\n\nHowever, for purposes of the umbrella clause, the Tribunal will determine whether this commitment (or undertaking) amounts to an \"obligation\" under Romanian law. In addition, the Tribunal must answer the question raised in the preceding section: whether that undertaking, commitment or obligation consisted of providing the Claimants the *same* incentives that were listed in Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 until 1 April 2009. Both questions are relevant. If there is no obligation under Romanian law, the umbrella clause is not triggered. If an obligation under Romanian law exists but its scope is limited to providing the Claimants with whatever incentives are available under the regime from time to time, Romania discharges that obligation by providing whatever incentives were in force in a particular time. If, on the other hand, there is an obligation under Romanian law to maintain the same incentives through 1 April 2009 with respect to the Claimants, then Romania would be in violation of the BIT's umbrella clause.\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal considers two alternative approaches potentially relevant to that analysis. Under the first approach, the answer to the questions above depends on whether the EGO 24 framework provided the Claimants with a vested right to the incentives listed in Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 until 1 April 2009. In other words, under that approach, the Tribunal would need to decide whether the Claimants' entitlement qualifies as a \"vested right\" under Romanian law, and whether Romania's corresponding undertaking qualifies as an \"obligation\" under Romanian law. In many legal systems, the existence of a debtor's obligation is inseparable from the existence of the creditor's vested right to performance of the obligation and is a mirror view of that right from the debtor's perspective. Thus, presumably, under this approach, in order for Romania to be legally obligated to provide the Claimants with the incentives listed in Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 until 1 April 2009 (or legally obligated to compensate the Claimants if those incentives were eliminated or amended), the EGO 24 framework would have had to provide the Claimants with a vested right to receive those very same incentives.\n\n449.\n\nThese are matters of Romanian law that the Tribunal cannot answer in the abstract or with reference to comparative law. It is the Claimants' burden to prove that Romania's undertaking amounts to an obligation under Romanian law, and that the content of that obligation is such that Romania's actions have breached it. The Claimants have not addressed these issues convincingly. The Claimants' legal expert on Romanian law, Prof. Mihai, did not address whether the regulatory framework created an obligation under Romanian law. In particular, he did not address the nature of GD 194/1999 or of the PICs in his expert report, and only briefly in his oral examination. Nor was this matter addressed by Romania's expert, Prof. Baias. His report only referred to whether EGO 24, GD 194/1999 or the PICs created contractual relations between the Claimants and the state (his answer was no) (ER of F. Baias, \u00b6\u00b6 5.1-5.2).\n\n450.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants have not addressed to the Tribunal's satisfaction whether their alleged right to the incentives might be lawfully withdrawn without compensation under Romanian law. The Tribunal has paid particular attention to Decision 130/2003 of the Constitutional Court. The Respondent argues that this decision (which applied to the incentives provided by Law 35 on Foreign Investment) proves that the EGO 24 framework did not give PIC holders a vested right to the incentives, and their withdrawal did not give PIC holders a right to compensation. Decision 130/2003 specifically stated:\n\nThe Court finds that no contract was concluded between the Romanian State and the potential investors by the adoption of this law, as the entity raising the objection of unconstitutionality groundlessly claims, and no ownership right or right to recover debt was created in their favor, but a legal framework was created that could offer to the foreign investors an attractive business climate, taking into account the requirements of the transition from a State centralized economy to the market economy. Therefore, the fact that the contested provisions provide for the cessation of the applicability of such facilitations may not be construed as the termination of a contract and the least as infringement of the ownership right or of the investors; rights to recover debt, but the amendment of the legal framework in connection with the business background. The measure is not meant to harm foreign investors, as they must still carry out their activity under the usual conditions of a market economy, without the facilities that represented positive discriminations by comparison to the other participants to the business circuit. (Exh. RL-214, p.4).\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the findings of this decision cannot be extrapolated to EGO 24 because the regimes created by Law 35 and EGO 24 were significantly different (in particular, because Law 35 provided all foreign investors in Romania with benefits, while EGO 24 only benefited investors who met certain specific criteria who invested in disfavored regions and fulfilled other obligations), adding that the testimony of the Respondent's expert, Prof. Baias, was based on the mistaken premise that both regimes were substantially similar. During cross-examination it became evident that Prof. Baias did not know the details of either incentive regime (Tr., Day 6, 26-31), while the Claimants' expert, Prof. Mihai, testified that there were important differences between EGO 24 and Law 35 (Tr., Day 5, 252 (Mihai)). Prof. Mihai (a former president of the Constitutional Court) also characterized Decision 130/2003 as \"extremely infelicitous\" and \"ultra vires\", stating that the reasoning of the Constitutional Court was \"inappropriate\" and \"not in line with the reality\" because \"by the repeal of [EGO] 24, damages were brought to the foreign investors, because that repeal created [\u2026] a worse legal and economic situation than before the repeal.\" (Tr., Day 5, 231, 252 (Mihai)). In the circumstances, the Tribunal is far from certain that it should revisit as such the validity of the Constitutional Court's decision, as opposed to the extent of its possible application by way of extrapolation to EGO 24, but finds that Decision 130/2003 is in any circumstance not decisive when interpreting the nature of the EGO 24 incentives.\n\n452.\n\nHowever, the fact that Decision 130/2003 may not be applicable to the EGO 24 incentives does not prove that the EGO 24 incentives gave rise to vested rights or a right to compensation if they were withdrawn, and Prof. Mihai's testimony was insufficient to establish this. Prof. Mihai testified that the constitutional principle of the rule of law set out in Article 1(3) of the Romanian Constitution44 \"required the Romanian state to maintain unchanged all facilities granted under prior regulations in favour of holders of investment certificates, issued before [GO 94/2004] was enforced\", or required GO 94/2004 to contain grandfathering provisions (ER of L. Mihai, \u00b6\u00b6 12.6-12.7). He also stated that, by failing to do so, GO 94/2004 was issued in breach of the ECHR's jurisprudence on legitimate expectations and legal foreseeability, as well as the Romanian principles of vested/acquired rights (ER of L. Mihai, \u00b6\u00b6 13.1-13.3) and non-retroactivity (Tr., Day 5, 207-208, 247 (Mihai)). But Prof. Mihai refrained from going as far as stating that the EGO 24 framework gave rise to vested rights. He did say, with respect to the Machinery Facility repealed in 2000, that \"those who had already acquired this right on the basis of some laws which were in effect at the moment when these rights had been acquired [\u2026] could continue to claim these tax exemptions\" (Tr., Day 5, 210 (Mihai)). However, he accepted that most of the changes made to EGO 24 during its life did not contain grandfathering provisions (e.g., the revocation of the meat facility and the machinery facility), although he did characterize these regulations as unconstitutional (Tr., Day 5, 212, 234-238 (Mihai)). In the Tribunal's view, this is not sufficient to establish the existence of a vested right to the incentives for the Claimants (and a corresponding obligation for Romania), or a right to compensation if the incentives were withdrawn.\n\nArticle 1 paragraph (3) of the Romanian Constitution provides: \"Romania is a democratic and social state governed by the rule of law, in which human dignity, the citizens' rights and freedoms, the free development of human personality, justice and political pluralism represent supreme values, in the spirit of the Romanian people's democratic traditions and the ideals embodied by the December 1989 Revolution, and shall be guaranteed.\"\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the Claimants in that the entitlement created by the EGO 24 framework and the PICs creates an appearance, perhaps even a distinct appearance, of a vested right giving rise to the corresponding obligation. In particular, as discussed in paragraph 457 below, the relationship between the Claimants and the Romanian State included a certain *quid pro quo*. However, the Claimants have not proved that Romanian law would characterize such an appearance, even in the presence of such *quid pro quo*, as a vested right or obligation, or afford it the same protection.\n\n454.\n\nUnder this approach, therefore, the Tribunal lacks sufficient evidence on the content of Romanian law to be able to ascertain whether the EGO 24 framework, including after \"crystallizing\" through the issuance of a PIC, gave the Claimants a vested right under Romanian law to the incentives listed in Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 until 1 April 2009. For the same reason, it cannot ascertain that the EGO 24 framework created the corresponding obligation for Romania to provide those very incentives during that period.45\n\nArbitrators L\u00e9vy and Abi-Saab favor this approach.\n\n455.\n\nUnder the second approach, it is not necessary that the obligation be \"vested\" or \"actionable\" in order to be considered an obligation covered by the umbrella clause. Although the Respondent has argued that granting a \"vested\" or \"actionable\" right is a prerequisite for an obligation to arise and to have binding legal effect under Romanian law, its experts have not established that this is the case. Thus, to find an obligation it would be sufficient to find that (i) Romania undertook a firm commitment vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants, and (ii) that the scope of that commitment was to provide substantially the same incentives during a specific period of time.\n\n456.\n\nThe first question is whether Romania undertook a firm commitment vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants under Romanian law. Through its regulatory framework, which was intended to promote investments and job creation in certain disadvantaged regions, Romania made an offer to investors who would consider establishing their business in those regions. The offer included granting the incentives and maintaining them through 1 April 2009. The offer was however, conditional. Investors who accepted the offer would only qualify if they met certain requirements and remained in compliance with those requirements for a period twice as long as the period of the incentives. Therefore, Romania's offer and the Claimants' acceptance of that offer established a relationship of mutual rights and duties: Romania accepted to grant the incentives and maintain them through 1 April 2009 and the Claimants committed to comply with the requirements of the offer for the requisite period. To state it differently, Romania had the right to insist that the Claimants carry out their business activities in compliance with the requirements while the Claimants had the right to receive the incentives. The investors were taking a firm commitment and the regulatory framework required a firm commitment on the side of Romania. This relationship was certified by the PICs, the wording of which confirms that analysis of the regulatory framework. The offer and the acceptance thus included a *quid pro quo* and, therefore, can be considered a relationship of mutual rights and obligations. If such is the nature of the relationship, Romania must have undertaken an obligation to maintain the incentives through 1 April 2009 and the Claimants must have the corresponding right to the incentives during that period. Romania's obligation, and the Claimants' corresponding rights, are by definition obligations and rights under Romanian law because they were established through the regulatory framework that created the incentives.\n\n457.\n\nThe second inquiry relates to the scope of Romania's undertaking. Romania has argued that, even if an obligation existed (which it denies), the scope of the obligation was only to grant whatever incentives might be available under the EGO 24 framework from time to time. The question is thus whether Romania's commitment to provide the incentives contained an element of stabilization in the event of an amendment of the laws governing the EGO 24 framework. The commitment to maintain the incentives for a certain specific time period induced investors to take advantage of the offer. Therefore, Romania cannot in good faith ignore the fact that such a commitment would necessarily be understood as including a promise of stabilization; that is, that the incentives would be maintained for the specified period. Stated differently, because Romania promised certified investors that it would maintain the incentives through a certain date, that promise could not be understood otherwise than as including the undertaking that the incentives would not be withdrawn earlier. Thus, while Romania did not make a commitment not to amend its laws as a general matter, certified investors understood that they would benefit from the incentives through 1 April 2009. For example, if Romania promised to waive customs duties on the imports of certain raw materials for a certain period of time with respect to a certified investor, that promise would be understood as remaining valid regardless of whether Romania amends its general legal framework to impose higher or lower duties on the same raw materials during the specified period. Therefore, the certified investors were offered (and accepted as part of the *quid pro quo*) a guarantee of some stability of the legal regime within the scope of the incentives, as described in the PICs, for a specific time period.\n\n458.\n\nUnder both aspects of the second approach, therefore, the Tribunal would find that a legal obligation by Romania with respect to the Claimants exists. The mirror image of that legal obligation would be the Claimants' right to the incentives through 1 April 2009.46\n\nArbitrator Alexandrov favors this approach.\n\n459.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully both approaches and is conscious of the fact that their application would lead to different conclusions. The majority follows the first approach and concludes that the burden of proof lies with the Claimants and that the Claimants have not met that burden. The majority does not find that the Claimants have provided sufficient evidence and legal arguments on the content of Romanian law for the Tribunal to find the existence of an obligation protected by the umbrella clause. The majority accordingly dismisses the Claimants' umbrella clause claim, and the Tribunal will now address the Claimants' arguments in the context of their fair and equitable treatment claim, which spans the same injuries alleged by the Claimants under the umbrella clause.\n\n**B. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nArticle 2(3) of the BIT provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof, as well as the acquisition of goods and services or the sale of their production, through unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\n\n461.\n\nThis section addresses the Claimants' allegation that the Respondent has breached its obligations under this provision by failing to afford to their investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n462.\n\nTo facilitate the discussion of the Parties' arguments with respect to the Claimants' fair and equitable treatment claim, the Tribunal will first set out a summary of the Parties' general positions (Section 1 below). It will then address the nature, interpretation and content of the fair and equitable treatment standard (Section 2 below). Finally, it will address the Parties' specific arguments with respect to each alleged breach of the standard (Sections 3 to 6 below).\n\n**1. Summary of the Parties' positions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n463.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the fair and equitable treatment standard, which is contained in Article 2(3) of the BIT, is an autonomous standard that is additional to general international law, and is thus not restricted by the international minimum standard contained in customary international law (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 183-192, citing scholarly opinion, an UNCTAD study and the practice of international tribunals, in particular, *Tecmed v. Mexico47, Azurix v. Argentina48*). The Claimants also contend that the fair and equitable treatment standard has a specific meaning, which is not to be confused with a decision *ex aequo et bono* (citing *ADF Group Inc. v. United States49,* \u00b6 184).\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award, 29 May 2003 (hereinafter *\"Tecmed v. Mexico\" or \"Tecmed\"*).\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award, 14 July 2006 (hereinafter *\"Azurix v. Argentina\"*).\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1), Award, 8 January 2003 (hereinafter *\"ADF Group Inc. United States\"* or *\"ADF Group\").*\n\n464.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the interpretation of the treaty provision containing the fair and equitable treatment standard should start from the normal canons of treaty interpretation as contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, which include the ordinary meaning of the treaty's terms, their context, and the object and purpose of the treaty, the preamble being of particular importance (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 194-200, citing *Tecmed v. Mexico*, *MTD v. Chile50*, *Azurix v. Argentina*, *Siemens v. Argentina51*).\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. 01/7), Award, 25 May 2004 (hereinafter *\"MTD v. Chile\"*).\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award, 6 February 2007 (hereinafter *\"Siemens v. Argentina\"* or *\"Siemens\"*).\n\n465.\n\nStarting with the text of the provision, the Claimants note that the Oxford Dictionary defines \"fair\" as \"free from bias, fraud or injustice; equitably legitimate\"; the word \"equitable\" as \"characterized by equity or fairness\"; and the word \"equity\" as \"the quality of being equal or fair; impartiality; even-handed dealing [...] that which is fair and right\" (C-SoC, \u00b6 200, Exh. C-83).\n\n466.\n\nWith respect to the context of the provision, the Claimants argue that a comparison of the fair and equitable treatment standard with other standards of the BIT shows that, as opposed to standards that are relative (such as the national treatment or most-favored nation treatment standards), the fair and equitable treatment standard is an absolute standard that provides a fixed reference point. As a result, it is not a valid defense for Romania to argue that investors of Romanian nationality or investors from third countries were also adversely affected by the revocation of tax exemptions or other incentives (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 201-203).\n\n467.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that the fair and equitable treatment standard should be interpreted in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT as reflected in its Preamble.52 As a result, any interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard should be generally favorable to the intensification of economic cooperation between the two countries, help promote and protect investments, be conducive to expanding the economic relations between the two countries and stimulate investment initiatives. In this regard, the Claimants argue that attracting investors through tax exemptions and other incentives that are promised for a certain period of time, and withdrawing these incentives unilaterally, is not conducive to the intensification of economic cooperation nor the stimulation of investment initiatives (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206).\n\nThe Claimants note that the Preamble expresses the Parties' desire \"to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both States and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" and recognizes \"that the promotion and protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives...\" (BIT, Preamble).\n\n468.\n\nAs discussed in Section V(B) on Applicable Law, the Claimants deny that the interpretation of the BIT must take into consideration EU law (see 291 above *et seq*.).\n\n469.\n\nThe Claimants endorse the definitions of the fair and equitable treatment standard made by several international tribunals (including, among others, *Waste Management v. Mexico II53*, *MTD v. Chile*, and *Saluka v. Czech Republic54*). Relying in particular on *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, the Claimants submit that the fair and equitable treatment standard \"prohibits at least six different types of host state misconduct [...], including: (1) a government's violation of an investor's legitimate expectations; (2) inconsistent treatment of an investment by different organs or officials of the same government; (3) a lack of transparency that hampers the ability of an investor to operate its investment or understand what is required by the government in order for an investment to succeed; (4) failure by a government to provide adequate advance notice of measures that will negatively impact an investment; (5) governmental treatment of an investment that is in bad faith; and (6) discriminatory conduct\" (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 367; 374). In later submissions the Claimants group categories (2), (3) and (4) into one single category covering lack of transparency (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 51-62). The Claimants also seem to suggest that the fair and equitable treatment standard requires the state to ensure a stable and predictable legal and business environment beyond the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations (C-SoC, \u00b6 211, C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 424-430).\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3), Award, 30 April 2004 (hereinafter *\"Waste Management v. Mexico II\" or \"Waste Management II\"*).\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (the Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006 (hereinafter *\"Saluka v. Czech Republic\" or \"Saluka\"*).\n\n470.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Romania's treatment of the Claimants' investments fell below the standard of treatment required by the fair and equitable treatment obligation of the BIT. Specifically, the Claimants submit that Romania (i) failed to provide a stable and predictable legal framework and violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations, (ii) failed to act transparently with respect to the Claimants' investments, and (iii) acted in bad faith with respect to those investments.\n\n471.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that Romania breached the fair and equitable treatment standard by failing to provide a stable and predictable legal and business environment for the investment, and in particular by violating the Claimants' legitimate expectations with respect to that regulatory framework.\n\n472.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the core element of the fair and equitable obligation is to ensure a consistent and stable legal environment (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 211-225; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 424-430; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41). Numerous tribunals concur with this interpretation of the obligation (*Metalclad v. Mexico55, Tecmed v. Mexico, CMS v. Argentina, Eureko v. Poland, Bayindir v. Pakistan56, LG&E v. Argentina*, *Duke Energy v. Ecuador57*, *PSEG v. Turkey58*, *Enron v. Argentina*). The fair and equitable treatment standard extends to regulation in matters of taxation (*Occidental v. Ecuador59*). For this obligation to be breached, investors do not need to have a contract with the state containing a stabilization clause.\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August 2000 (hereinafter *\"Metalclad v. Mexico\"* or *\"Metalclad\"*).\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisidiction, 14 November 2005 (hereinafter *\"Bayindir v. Pakistan*).\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008 (hereinafter *\"Duke Energy v. Ecuador\"*).\n\n*PSEG Global Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektr\u00edk \u00daret\u00edm ve T\u00edcaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/5), Award, 19 January 2007 (hereinafter *\"PSEG v. Turkey\"*).\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, Final Award, 1 July 2004 (hereinafter *\"Occidental v. Ecuador\"*).\n\n473.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants argue that the fair and equitable treatment standard requires the state to protect the investor's legitimate expectations based on the legal framework at the time of the investment and on any undertakings and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host state. The legal framework on which the investor is entitled to rely consists of legislation and treaties, and assurances contained in decrees, licenses and similar executive assurances, as well as in contractual undertakings. Relying on a number of investment cases, the Claimants argue that a state will violate the fair and equitable treatment standard if it reverses assurances that have resulted in the investor's legitimate expectations (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 211-228, citing *Metalclad v. Mexico, Tecmed v. Mexico, CMS v. Argentina, Eureko v. Poland, Bayindir v. Pakistan, LG&E v. Argentina*, *PSEG v. Turkey,* and *Occidental v. Ecuador*).\n\n474.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Romania failed to provide a stable and predictable legal and business environment for their investment, and undermined their legitimate expectations with respect to the regulatory framework. Specifically, they argue that Romania created a special regulatory regime for disfavored regions that consisted of certain tax exemptions and other incentives promised for a 10 year period. This special regime instilled in the Claimants the legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 incentives would remain in place during the 10 year period that \u015etei-Nucet was designated a disfavored region. The Claimants assert that this legitimate expectation was an essential basis for their investment, and without it the Claimants would not have invested in the manner that they did. Having enticed the Claimants to make substantial investments in reliance on these incentives, in February 2005 Romania changed its legislation and withdrew most of the EGO 24 incentives, four years before they were scheduled to expire. The Claimants argue that, by prematurely revoking the EGO 24 incentives, Romania failed to provide a predictable and stable legal framework for the Claimants to plan their investments, and in particular violated their legitimate expectation that these incentives would be in place for the promised 10-year period.\n\n475.\n\nThe Claimants clarify that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment does not mean that a state must completely freeze its regulatory regime (and the Claimants acknowledge that a stabilization clause would be needed to obtain that result). However, it does mean that, by entering into the BIT, Romania accepted limitations on its power to fundamentally alter the regulatory framework of the investment, particularly in ways that would be unfair, unreasonable and inequitable, including by undermining an investor's legitimate expectations (C-PHB, \u00b6 40). As a result, Romania could not, consistent with the BIT, simply dispense with the legal framework it had put in place, but instead was required to meet its commitments with respect to investors. Specifically, the Claimants concede that Romania was entitled to revoke the incentives it had put in place if it grandfathered them for existing PIC holders (as it did with the Profit Tax Incentive).\n\n476.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that Romania breached its obligation to accord them fair and equitable treatment by acting in a manner that was not transparent.\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment requires that the state's conduct toward investors and its legal environment must be transparent (i.e., free from ambiguity and uncertainty). The Claimants rely on *Metalclad v. Mexico*, *Tecmed v. Mexico*, *Waste Management v. Mexico II*, *Saluka v.* *Czech Republic*, *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, *Occidental v. Ecuador, CMS v. Argentina*, *LG&E v. Argentina*, *PSEG v. Turkey*, and an UNCTAD study.60 In particular, the *Tecmed* tribunal held that a foreign investor \"expects the host state to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.\" *(**Tecmed,* \u00b6 154). Similarly, the late Prof. Thomas W\u00e4lde noted that transparency requires \"that government administration has to make clear what it wants from the investor and cannot hide behind ambiguity if it has created such ambiguity and contradiction itself.\"61\n\nUNCTAD Series on issues in international investment agreements, Fair and Equitable Treatment, p. 51 (1999) (Exh. C-74).\n\nT.W. W\u00e4lde, Energy Charter Treaty-based lnvestment Arbitration, 5 The Journal of World Investment 387 (2004), (Exh. C-94).\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Romania acted in a manner that was not transparent. Specifically, they argue that Romania actively pursued two conflicting policies: on the one hand, it promoted the EGO 24 incentives, and at the same time it negotiated their revocation behind closed doors. In addition, they argue that Romania's conduct with respect to the validity of the EGO 24 incentives was contradictory and the manner in which they were revoked created uncertainty.\n\n479.\n\nThird, the Claimants argue that Romania acted in bad faith with respect to the Claimants' investments. The Claimants contend that the fair and equitable treatment standard is breached if the host state acts in bad faith (C-SoC, \u00b6 243, C-Reply \u00b6\u00b6 443-449). Although bad faith is not required for a violation of the standard to occur (*Tecmed v. Mexico*, *Mondev v. United States62*, *Loewen v. United States63, CMS v. Argentina)*, the Claimants argue that host state measures taken in bad faith against an investor violate the fair and equitable treatment standard (*Waste Management v. Mexico II*, *Tecmed v. Mexico, Bayindir v. Pakistan, Saluka v. Czech Republic*).\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award, 11 October 2002 (hereinafter *\"Mondev v. United States\" or \"Mondev\"*).\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3), Award, 26 June 2003 (hereinafter *\"Loewen v. United States\"*).\n\n480.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that Romania's responsibility for violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard arises regardless of its motives, and irrespective of any showing of bad faith (although, as explained above the Claimants do argue that Romania acted in bad faith). Consequently, the Claimants do not need to show that Romania acted with an improper motive in order to establish violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Conversely, a showing of good faith or legitimate cause on Romania's part does not excuse a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 242-252, citing, *inter alia*, *Mondev v. United States* ; *Tecmed v. Mexico*, *Loewen v. United States*, *Occidental v. Ecuador*, and *PSEG v. Turkey*).\n\n481.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants submit that, no matter how laudable or justifiable Romania's motives might have been, they do not excuse the fact that Romania breached the fair and equitable treatment standard. Whether Romania withdrew the incentives for fiscal reasons, for reasons of international economic policy or for other reasons of public interest, is irrelevant (C-SoC, \u00b6 252). In particular, as discussed in Section V(B) above on Applicable Law, the Claimants contend that Romania's \"EU law\" defense does not immunize Romania from liability.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nWith respect to the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Respondent does not dispute that many of the decisions cited by the Claimants can provide useful guidance to the Tribunal, subject to the general interpretative principles applicable to this dispute as explained in Section V(B) above on Applicable Law. Indeed, the Respondent concedes that \"[m]ost of the general principles governing the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard form common ground between the Parties\" (R-CM, \u00b6 101). In particular, the Respondent does not dispute that Article 2(3) of the BIT must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, according to which the Tribunal must first look to the plain meaning or the language of the provision, and in the event of ambiguity construe the relevant provision in its context and in the light of the objective and purpose of the BIT (*Id*.). However, the Respondent disputes Claimants' actual interpretation of these terms.\n\n483.\n\nWith respect to the plain meaning of the provision, the Respondent accepts for present purposes the Claimants' definition of \"fair and equitable\" as \"free from bias, fraud or injustice\" and \"even-handed dealing.\" The Respondent also concurs with the Claimants' reliance on *Waste Management v. Mexico II*, where the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n... fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\n\n484.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the preamble of the BIT reflects the signatories' goal of intensifying economic cooperation between Romania and Sweden. However, the BIT's preamble does not in itself indicate what interpretation of \"fair and equitable treatment\" is appropriate to achieve this goal. The proper approach depends upon the state parties' intentions with respect to the intensification of economic relations. The Respondent submits that this intention was to intensify economic relations in the context of Romania's integration into the EU (R-CM, \u00b6 108).\n\n485.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent argues that the BIT was signed pursuant to Article 74 of the Europe Agreement (to which both Sweden and Romania were parties), which calls for Romania to enter into investment protection agreements with EU Member States. The goal of the Europe Agreement was to establish close and lasting economic political integration between Romania and the EU, with the ultimate goal of EU accession. For this, Romania undertook to harmonize Romanian law with EU law (Articles 69 and 70 of the Europe Agreement). Accordingly, the Respondent submits that \"the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in the [BIT] must therefore be interpreted consistently with any requirements for Romania's integration into the EU, including the elimination of impermissible State aid [...]\"(R-CM, \u00b6 109).\n\n486.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that, under the Europe Agreement, the Accession Agreement and the EC Treaty, Romania owed an obligation to Sweden to eliminate all state aid that did not conform to EU law and that distorted competition in the common market. As a result, Romania and Sweden could not have intended that Romania's obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment to Swedish investors would require the preservation of non-conforming State aid. In other words, \"the object and purpose of the [BIT], and the context in which it was concluded as an integral part of Romania's integration into the EU, indicate that the [BIT] cannot be construed to sanction as \u2018unfair and inequitable' the adjustment of the Facilities in accordance with the requirements of the Europe Agreement and the *acquis communautaire* \" (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 109-110).\n\n487.\n\nReferring to the Claimants' division of the fair and equitable treatment standard into different \"strands\", the Respondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT is not a laundry list, and there is no claim under the BIT for violating any particular \"strand.\" Citing *Mondev v. United States*, the Respondent submits that whether a host state has treated an investment fairly and equitably must be assessed in view of all of the facts and circumstances. However, for analytical organization, the Respondent accepts that the Claimants' allegations may be grouped into three categories, corresponding to types of conduct where other international tribunals have found breaches of the fair and equitable treatment standard (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16):\n\na. Cases in which the state's action is alleged to have been substantively improper (for example because it was unreasonable, arbitrary, or discriminatory);\n\nb. Cases in which the state's action is claimed to have violated a promise the state made to the investor, thus upsetting the investor's \"legitimate expectations\", and\n\nc. Cases in which a state's action may be attacked as having been procedurally unfair, as in cases of denial of justice or lack of due process, retroactive or secret regulation, or inconsistent and non-transparent administration (although there are very few awards finding a violation of fair and equitable treatment solely on the basis of this class of allegations).\n\n488.\n\nThe Respondent denies having engaged in any of these types of conduct. It contends that, given the factual circumstances surrounding the investment, the Claimants could have had no reasonable expectation that the incentives (facilities) would remain in force unchanged for ten years. The modification of the incentives was wholly predictable and equitable, and Romania conducted itself as consistently and transparently as possible given the historical context of economic transition and EU accession (R-CM, \u00b6 100).\n\n489.\n\nFirst, the Respondent denies having engaged in substantively improper conduct. The Respondent contends that, where an investor challenges general legislation that modifies existing general legislation, the question for an international tribunal is whether that legislation is grounded in reason (rather than being arbitrary) and enacted in pursuit of legitimate objectives (rather than for illicit purposes, such as discrimination). Relying on *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, the Respondent argues that for a state's conduct to be reasonable it must \"bear a reasonable relationship to some rational policy\" (*Saluka,* \u00b6\u00b6 309 and 460). This requirement was further developed in *AES v. Hungary,64* where the Tribunal found that \"two elements\" must be analyzed in judging whether a state acted reasonably: \"the existence of a rational policy; and the reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to the policy\" (*AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6 10.3.7). According to that Tribunal, a policy is rational when the state adopts it \"following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter\" (*Id*., \u00b6 10.3.8), and an action is reasonable when there is \"an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it\" (*Id*., \u00b6 10.3.9).\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erom\u00fc Kft. v. Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22), Award, 23 September, 2010 (hereinafter *\"AES v. Hungary\"* or *\"AES\"*).\n\n490.\n\nIn addition, for there to be a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the state's conduct must be manifestly unreasonable. A state does not breach the standard merely by failing to adopt the optimal course of action. Citing *Glamis Gold v. United States,65* the Respondent contends that it is Claimants' burden to prove a manifest lack of reasons for the legislation.66 (R-PHB, \u00b6 33, fn. 50).\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, 8 June 2009 (hereinafter *\"Glamis Gold v. United States\")..*\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 803.\n\n491.\n\nHowever, as explained further below, the Respondent argues that the Claimants do not allege that Romania engaged in any fraud, bias or discrimination, or that they were denied justice with respect to the Facilities. Nor do the facts show \"grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic\" treatment (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103). To the contrary, Romania argues that its conduct was fair and equitable under the circumstances.\n\n492.\n\nSecond, the Respondent denies having failed to provide regulatory stability or having violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations. The Respondent contends that the BIT does not require the Contracting States to tailor their laws and regulations to the preference of foreign investors, nor does it create liability for every regulatory change that has a negative impact on the foreign investors' businesses. To the contrary, investment protection treaties accord host States considerable deference in relation to regulatory policy (*El Paso v. Argentina;*67*S.D. Myers v. Canada;68 Saluka v. Czech Republic* ;69*Waste Management v. Mexico II;70 Parkerings v. Lithuania;71 Genin v. Estonia72* ; *Methanex v. United States73*). This is a reflection of the fundamental rule of international law that a state's regulatory sovereignty can only be subject to the specific limitations that flow from the international legal obligations that it has voluntarily assumed (relying on *The Case of the S.S. Lotus (France v. Turkey*)74) (RCM, \u00b6\u00b6 85-90).\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15), Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006 (hereinafter *\"El Paso v. Argentina\"*), \u00b6 70.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 November 2000 (hereinafter *\"S.D. Myers v.Canada\"*), \u00b6 263.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 305.\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II*, \u00b6 94.\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania*, \u00b6 332.\n\n*Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2), Award, 25 June 2001 (hereinafter *\"Genin v. Estonia\"*), \u00b6 370.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 August 2005 (hereinafter *\"Methanex v. United States\"*), Part IV, Ch D, p 4, \u00b6 7.\n\n*The Case of the S.S. \"Lotus\" (France v Turkey)*, PCIJ Series A No 10 (1927).\n\n493.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent argues that where a state has exercised its sovereign powers to regulate in a general, non-discriminatory way to advance public welfare (including by legislative changes), international law will not characterize such conduct as \"expropriation\", \"unfair and inequitable treatment\", or otherwise in breach of the provisions of an investment protection treaty. International law (and the BIT) does not call for a regulatory standstill, and there is no warrant that a legal regime will remain unaltered. Laws are inherently liable to change, even when the original legislative intent was to create a permanent regime or a regime for a given period (*Continental* *Casualty v. Argentina,* \u00b6 258). The Respondent concedes that international law will require observance of specific commitments about the stability of legislation, but contends that such commitments will not be lightly inferred, and are never to be found in general legislative texts. Rather, they may be found in stabilization terms specially bargained for with specific investors (R-CM, \u00b6 91).\n\n494.\n\nIn the present case, it is undisputed that the modification of the Facilities that had been granted pursuant to EGO 24/1998 was a generally applicable act. Moreover, Romania was compelled to curtail the Facilities as an essential precondition for accession to the EU. Accordingly, in considering Romania's compliance with the substantive provisions of the BIT, Romania is entitled to the deference under international law (R-CM, \u00b6 92). The modification of the Facilities was fair under the circumstances. In light of the plain meaning of Article 2(3), Romania argues that an examination of the Claimants' supposed expectations is unnecessary. In any event, Romania contends that the Claimants had no legitimate expectations that were undermined by the modification of the Facilities.\n\n495.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the doctrine of legitimate expectations is part of the general duty to afford fair and equitable treatment. However, under this doctrine a state would only violate this duty if it exercised its regulatory sovereignty in such a way as to create a legitimate expectation in an investor that the state will or will not act in a certain way in the future. In this way, the state itself derogates from its right and duty to change its regulations. Thus, the Respondent argues that an expectation of regulatory stability must be based on some sort of promise or at the very least, a proper representation made to the investor, on the part of the state. However, \"if the state has not committed itself to freeze a particular area of regulation, or to shield an investor from regulatory change, the most an investor can legitimately expect is regulatory rationality and absence of arbitrariness\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 169). The Respondent relies on *EDF v. Romania75 and Parkerings v. Lithuania*. The Respondent's detailed position with respect to the standard of legitimate expectations is addressed in Section 3(b) below.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13), Award, 8 October 2009 (hereinafter *\"EDF v. Romania\"*).\n\n496.\n\nThird, the Respondent asserts it acted transparently and consistently. The Respondent appears to agree that transparency and consistency are a part of the fair and equitable treatment standard. For the Respondent, this \"strand\" refers to whether Romania complied with due process and fair administration. The Respondent notes that the UNCTAD report cited by the Claimants states the following:\n\nIf laws, administrative decisions and other binding decisions are to be imposed upon a foreign investor by a host State, then fairness requires that the investor is informed about such decisions before they are imposed.76\n\n\"Fair and Equitable Treatment\", UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements (1999) 3 UNCTAD/ITE/IIT/11, Exh. C-527, quoted at \u00b6 433 of the Claimants' Reply.\n\n497.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this means that investors should be able to find out what the rules are and how to comply with them, and the rules should be administered in an even-handed and reasonably consistent fashion (R-PHB, \u00b6 160).\n\n498.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent argues, the Claimants do not contend that Romania was unclear about the rules and procedures they had to follow, or that the rules were applied inconsistently. Rather, the Claimants contend that they were not given enough information about ongoing diplomatic negotiations. The Respondent argues that there is no authority suggesting that international investment law requires a state to disclose its assessment of the likely outcome of such negotiations. As a result, the Respondent argues that \"the Claimants' contentions are not only irrelevant as a matter of law but illogical as a matter of fact: if, as the Claimants seemed to suggest at the hearing, Romania should have publicly announced at the earliest possible date that it did not expect to obtain the EU's agreement to continue the EGO Facilities in force, the only possible difference is that the Claimants would have lost the benefit of the Facilities sooner\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 161). Likewise, the Respondent argues that there is no need to warn investors of legislative changes, in particular in legal and political environments that are unpredictable and evolving (*Parkerings*, \u00b6\u00b6 341-342, 345).\n\n499.\n\nIn view of the above, the Respondent submits that there are four propositions that the Claimants must prove in order for their fair and equitable treatment claim to succeed, and they have failed to prove them. These propositions are (Tr., Day 13, 45:1-20 (King)):\n\n(i) First, the Claimants must prove that Romania's actions, and in particular the 31 August 2004 amendment of EGO 24, were manifestly unreasonable.\n\n(ii) Second, the Claimants must prove that Romania promised them ten years of stabilization of the EGO 24 facilities.\n\n(iii) Third, the Claimants must prove that they made investments in reasonable reliance on the legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 facilities would not change until 2009.\n\n(iv) Fourth, the Claimants must prove that Romania acted in such a non-transparent and inconsistent way as to violate the fair and equitable treatment clause.\n\n500.\n\nThe Respondent has clarified that these propositions are not cumulative except (ii) and (iii). In other words, the Respondent's position is that the Tribunal could find a breach if the Claimant can prove that either proposition (i), propositions (ii) and (iii) jointly, or proposition (iv) are true (Tr., Day 13, 58:5-60:7).\n\n501.\n\nIn addition, as noted in paragraph 279 above, the Respondent argues as a general matter that the Claimants' case on fair and equitable treatment hinges on the testimony of their witnesses, which the Respondent contends is neither credible nor reliable. It also argues that, despite the Claimants' shift in focus, this is not and has never been a case about whether Romania acted transparently; it has only become so because the hearing undermined the Claimants' previous legal theories (Tr., Day 13, 19-43 (King)).\n\n**2. Nature, interpretation and content of the fair and equitable treatment standard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the nature, interpretation and content of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n**a. Interpretation and general contours of the standard**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree on the basics of the fair and equitable treatment standard, with certain nuances. The Respondent does not contest the Claimants' portrayal of the standard as an autonomous one, different from the international minimum standard. Nor does it contest that the standard has specific meaning. Likewise, both Parties agree that the interpretation of Article 2(3) of the BIT should start from the normal canons of treaty interpretation as contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Romania is not a party to the VCLT, but it is common ground that the VCLT reflects customary international law77 and Romania relies on it as the appropriate method to interpret the BIT.78\n\n*See, e.g., Case Concerning the Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v Chad),* [1994] ICJ Reports 6, \u00b6 41 (\"The Court would recall that, in accordance with customary international law, reflected in Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Interpretation must be based above all upon the text of the treaty. As a supplementary measure recourse may be had to means of interpretation such as the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\")\n\n*See, e.g.,* R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n504.\n\nTo establish the content of the standard, the Tribunal must first turn to the plain meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable.\" The plain meaning of these terms, however, does not provide much assistance. As noted by the tribunal in *MTD v. Chile*, \"[i]n their ordinary meaning, the terms \u2018fair' and \u2018equitable' [...] mean \u2018just', \u2018even-handed', \u2018unbiased', \u2018legitimate'.\"79 Similarly, the tribunal in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* stated that unfair and inequitable treatment meant \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.\"80 This Tribunal agrees with the *Saluka* tribunal in that \"[t]his is probably as far as one can get by looking at the \u2018ordinary meaning' of the terms of Article 3.1 of the Treaty.\"81\n\n*MTD v. Chile*, \u00b6 113.\n\n*S.D. Myers v. Canada*, \u00b6 263.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 297.\n\n505.\n\nThe question is rather how those concepts should be applied to the facts. It is undisputed that an analysis of whether a state's conduct has been fair and equitable requires an assessment of all the facts, context and circumstances of a particular case. As stated in *Mondev v. United States:*\n\nWhen a tribunal is faced with the claim by a foreign investor that the investment has been unfairly or inequitably treated or not accorded full protection and security, it is bound to pass upon that claim on the facts and by application of any governing treaty provisions. A judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case.82\n\n*Mondev v. United States*, \u00b6 118. See also *M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Award, 31 July 2007, \u00b6 370.\n\n506.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Waste Management II* said that \"the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\"83 This has been echoed by several tribunals, including in *Lauder v. Czech Republic84, CMS v. Argentina, Noble Ventures v. Romania85, Saluka v. Czech Republic*.\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II*, \u00b6 99.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001 (hereinafter, *\"Lauder v. Czech Republic\"*).\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award, 12 October 2005.\n\n507.\n\nThat being said, as the Claimants point out and the Respondent does not contest, the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard does not depend on a tribunal's idiosyncratic interpretation of the standard but \"must be disciplined by being based upon state practice and judicial or arbitral case law or other sources of customary or general international law\" (C-SoC, \u00b6 193, citing *ADF Group,* \u00b6 184). The tribunal in *Saluka* held:\n\nThis does not imply, however, that such standards as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty would invite the Tribunal to decide the dispute in a way that resembles a decision *ex aequo et bono*. This Tribunal is bound by Article 6 of the Treaty to decide the dispute on the basis of the law, including the provisions of the Treaty. Even though Article 3 obviously leaves room for judgment and appreciation by the Tribunal, it does not set out totally subjective standards which would allow the Tribunal to substitute, with regard to the Czech Republic's conduct to be assessed in the present case, its judgment on the choice of solutions for the Czech Republic's. As the tribunal in *S.D. Myers* has said, the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard does not create an \"open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making\". The standards formulated in Article 3 of the Treaty, vague as they may be, are susceptible of specification through judicial practice and do in fact have sufficient legal content to allow the case to be decided on the basis of law. Over the last few years, a number of awards have dealt with such standards yielding a fair amount of practice that sheds light on their legal meaning.86\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 284.\n\n508.\n\nIn any event, it is established that the state's conduct does not need to be egregious to violate the standard *(Mondev, ADF Group, Waste Management II* - *see* paragraph 524 below).\n\n509.\n\nFurther, both Parties agree that the fair and equitable treatment standard should be interpreted in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT as reflected in its Preamble. This was also the approach taken by the *Saluka* tribunal, which noted that \"[t]he preamble thus links the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' standard directly to the stimulation of foreign investments and to the economic development of both Contracting Parties.\"87 The Respondent further argues that the standard should be interpreted in the broader context of EU accession.\n\n*Id*, \u00b6 298.\n\n510.\n\nThe Preamble of the BIT states that the Contracting Parties have agreed on the terms of the BIT:\n\n*desiring* to intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both States and to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,\n\n*recognizing* that the promotion and protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives, [...]\n\n511.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Preamble reflects the BIT signatories' goal of intensifying economic cooperation between Romania and Sweden, but disagree on what interpretation of \"fair and equitable treatment\" is appropriate to achieve this goal. The Claimants do not suggest a specific interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard in this context, other than to argue that attracting investors through tax exemptions and other incentives that are promised for a certain period of time, and then withdrawing those incentives unilaterally, is not conducive to the intensification of economic cooperation or to the stimulation of investment initiatives.\n\n512.\n\nThe Respondent for its part contends that the Contracting Parties' intention was to intensify economic relations in the context of Romania's accession to the EU. The Respondent argues that the BIT was signed pursuant to Article 74 of the Europe Agreement, which prompted Romania to sign investment protection treaties with EU member states. As the goal of the Europe Agreement was to integrate Romania and the EU at a political level, which carried with it the obligation to harmonize Romanian law to EU law, the goal of the BIT between Romania and Sweden must be interpreted in this context. Therefore, Romania's obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment to Swedish investors must be interpreted in such a way that it is consistent with EU law.\n\n513.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Europe Agreement predated the BIT and, indeed, promoted the conclusion of BITs such as the Sweden-Romania BIT. Despite the lack of express reference in the BIT to EU accession or the EU, the Tribunal has also found that the general context of EU accession must be taken into account when interpreting the BIT.\n\n514.\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal cannot conclude in the abstract (as Romania seems to suggest) that the revocation of the incentives is fair and equitable solely because it was undertaken pursuant to Romania's obligation under the Europe Agreement to harmonize its law with EU law. As previously stated, whether the state's conduct is unfair and inequitable must be assessed in view of all the facts and surrounding circumstances.\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal must bear in mind that the goal of the BIT is the \"intensif[ication of] economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both States\" and, in this context, \"to maintain fair and equitable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\", and that when the Contracting States set this goal they recognized \"that the promotion and protection of such investments favour the expansion of the economic relations between the two Contracting Parties and stimulate investment initiatives.\" In this respect, the Claimants argue that the objective of the BIT was to help Romania raise its level of economic development so it could join the EU (Tr., Day 1, 181-184 (Gaillard)).\n\n516.\n\nIn view of these considerations, the Tribunal favors a balanced view of the goals of the BIT similar to that adopted by the *Saluka* tribunal:\n\nThis is a more subtle and balanced statement of the Treaty's aims than is sometimes appreciated. The protection of foreign investments is not the sole aim of the Treaty, but rather a necessary element alongside the overall aim of encouraging foreign investment and extending and intensifying the parties' economic relations. That in turn calls for a balanced approach to the interpretation of the Treaty's substantive provisions for the protection of investments, since an interpretation which exaggerates the protection to be accorded to foreign investments may serve to dissuade host States from admitting foreign investments and so undermine the overall aim of extending and intensifying the parties\u2019 mutual economic relations.\n\nSeen in this light, the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard prescribed in the Treaty should therefore be understood to be treatment which, if not proactively stimulating the inflow of foreign investment capital, does at least not deter foreign capital by providing disincentives to foreign investors. An investor\u2019s decision to make an investment is based on an assessment of the state of the law and the totality of the business environment at the time of the investment as well as on the Investor\u2019s expectation that the conduct of the host State subsequent to the Investment will be fair and equitable.88\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6\u00b6 304-309.\n\n517.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the fair and equitable treatment standard is not a laundry list of potential acts of misconduct. Whether a state has treated an investor\u2019s investments unfairly and inequitably defies abstract analysis or definitions, and can only be assessed when looking at the totality of the state\u2019s conduct. As noted by the tribunal in *Total S.A. v. Argentina,89* \"[s]ince this standard is inherently flexible, it is difficult, if not impossible, \u2018to anticipate in the abstract the range of possible types of infringements upon the investor\u2019s legal position\u2019.\"90\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01), Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010 (hereinafter *\"Total S.A. v. Argentina\"* or *\"Total\").*\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentina,* \u00b6 107.\n\n518.\n\nNonetheless, as noted by Professors Dolzer and Schreuer, one way to \"gauge the meaning of an elusive concept such as FET\" is \"to identify typical factual situations to which this principle has been applied. An examination of the practice of tribunals demonstrates that several principles can be identified, which are embraced by the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\"91 As noted by the *Total* tribunal, \"[o]n the premise that a \u2018judgement of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the fact[s] of the particular case\u2019 and that \u2018the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case\u2019, tribunals have endeavoured to pinpoint some typical obligations that may be included in the standard, as well as types of conduct that would breach the standard, in order to be guided in their analysis of the issue before them.\"92\n\nR. Dolzer and C. Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law, 2008, p. 133.\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentina,* \u00b6 109.\n\n519.\n\nAccording to Dolzer and Schreuer, tribunal practice shows that the concepts of transparency, stability and the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations play a central role in defining the FET standard, and so does compliance with contractual obligations, procedural propriety and due process, action in good faith and freedom from coercion and harassment.93 Cases reflecting these conclusions include *Bayindir v. Pakistan*94 and *Total S.A. v. Argentina*.95\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Bayindir v. Pakistan*, Award, 27 August 2009, \u00b6 178 (\"The Tribunal agrees with Bayindir when it identifies the different factors which emerge from decisions of investment tribunals as forming part of the FET standard. These comprise the obligation to act transparently and grant due process [ *Metalclad v. Mexico* ], to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures [ *Waste Management v. Mexico II, Lauder v. Czech Republic* ], from exercising coercion [ *Saluka v. Czech Republic* ] or from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework affecting the investment [ *Duke Energy v. Ecuador* ].\")\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentina*, \u00b6\u00b6 109 (\"A breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has been found in respect of conduct characterized by 'arbitrariness' [ *ELSI* case] and of 'acts showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith' [ *Genin v. Estonia* ]. It has been also held that the standard requires 'treatment in an evenhanded and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment' [ *MTD v. Chile* ], thereby condemning conduct that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic or that 'involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in administrative process' [ *Waste Management v. Mexico II* ]. Awards have found a breach in cases of discrimination against foreigners and 'improper and discreditable' or 'unreasonable' conduct. [ *Saluka v. Czech Republic* ] This does not mean that bad faith is necessarily required in order to find a breach: 'A State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.' [ *Mondev v. U.S*.]\").\n\n520.\n\nIn this context, the Parties appear to agree that there are certain types of conduct that are usually deemed to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard, bearing in mind the facts of the particular case. For analytical purposes, the Tribunal will use the Respondent's distinction between (i) conduct that is substantively improper (because it is arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory or in bad faith), (ii) conduct that violates legitimate expectations relied upon by the investor (including here the Claimants' stability \"strand\"), and (iii) conduct that is procedurally improper. That being said, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimants' claim that Romania acted non-transparently and inconsistently is based on an assertion that the violation is \"procedural,\" so the Tribunal will not use the Respondent's terminology for that claim.\n\n521.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses the standard for substantively proper conduct in Section (b) below, the standard for determining when a legitimate expectation has arisen in Section (c) below, and the standard for transparency in Section (d) below.\n\n**b. Conduct that is substantively improper**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nThere is no dispute that conduct that is substantively improper, whether because it is arbitrary, manifestly unreasonable, discriminatory or in bad faith, will violate the fair and equitable treatment standard. As stated by the *Waste Management II* tribunal:\n\n\"[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"96\n\nl/l/aste *Management v. Mexico II,* \u00b6 98. The Tribunal notes that, strictly speaking, this case refers to the minimum standard of treatment contained in NAFTA Article 1105. However, both Parties have relied on this definition in their submissions in this case, so the Tribunal understands that they accept that it is relevant for the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT.\n\n523.\n\nOn this subject, the *Saluka* tribunal stated:\n\nA foreign investor protected by the Treaty may in any case properly expect that the Czech Republic implements its policies bona fide by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors\u2019 investment, reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination. In particular, any differential treatment of a foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investments over the foreign-owned investment.97\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6 307.\n\n524.\n\nThat being said, it is well established that the state\u2019s conduct need not be outrageous to breach the fair and equitable treatment standard. In *Mondev v. United States,* the tribunal held that \"[t]o the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a state may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.\"98 This finding was echoed by the tribunal in Waste *Management v. Mexico II:*\n\nBoth the *Mondev* and *ADF* tribunals rejected any suggestion that the standard of treatment of a foreign investment set by NAFTA is confined to the kind of outrageous treatment referred to in the *Neer* case, i.e. to treatment amounting to an \"outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an in insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"99\n\n*Mondev v.* U.S., \u00b6 116.\n\nl/l/aste *Management v. Mexico II,* \u00b6 93. This paragraph has been cited by many different tribunals, including *Chemtura Corporation v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award, 2 August 2010 (hereinafter, *\"Chemtura v. Canada\"),* \u00b6 215. *See* Dolzer & Schreuer p. 129.\n\n525.\n\nWith respect to the meaning of the term \"unreasonable\", both Parties appear to agree that \"unreasonable\" means lacking in justification or not grounded in reason (i.e., arbitrary), or not enacted in pursuit of legitimate objectives (C-Reply, \u00b6 454; R-PHB, \u00b6 33). The Respondent also proposes the formulation used by the *Saluka* tribunal: for a state\u2019s conduct to be reasonable, it must \"bear a reasonable relationship to rational policies [,..].\"100 Although the definition is rather circular, the Tribunal finds it appropriate, with the specification made by the *AES* tribunal, namely that the determination of whether the state\u2019s conduct is reasonable requires the analysis of two elements: \"the existence of a rational policy; and the reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to the policy\" *(AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6 10.3.7). As noted by the *AES* tribunal, a policy is rational when the state adopts it \"following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter\" (*Id*., \u00b6 10.3.8), and an action is reasonable when there is \"an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it\" (*Id*., \u00b6 10.3.9). In other words, for a state's conduct to be reasonable, it is not sufficient that it be related to a rational policy; it is also necessary that, in the implementation of that policy, the state's acts have been appropriately tailored to the pursuit of that rational policy with due regard for the consequences imposed on investors.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6\u00b6 309 and 460.\n\n526.\n\nThat is not to say that any conduct that is \"reasonable\" under this definition will be \"fair and equitable\". As stated above, the determination of what is fair and equitable cannot be made in the abstract: it requires the assessment of all the factual and legal circumstances surrounding both the state's conduct and an investor's investments. There are conceivably cases in which reasonable action by a state in pursuit of a rational policy may nonetheless be unfair with respect to certain investors.\n\n**c. Regulatory stability and legitimate expectations**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Romania's obligation to afford them fair and equitable treatment means that Romania must ensure a stable and predictable legal and business environment, and must protect the Claimants' legitimate expectations. In turn, the Respondent submits that \"[t]he default position in international law is that a state is free to adopt, change, and repeal regulations as it sees fit - so long as its actions are reasonably related to a legitimate public interest and are not discriminatory\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 9). However, the Respondent concedes that its regulatory sovereignty is limited by the legitimate expectations the state has validly created in investors, provided that these expectations arise from specific assurances entered into by the state, are reasonable, and were the predicate of the Claimants' investments (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 111-135; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 169-172, 191).\n\n528.\n\nThe tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* stated that \"the stability of the legal and business framework in the state party is an essential element in the standard of what is fair and equitable treatment\", and found that it \"was an emerging standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law.\"101 This Tribunal agrees as a general matter.\n\n*LG&E v. Argentina*, \u00b6 125.\n\n529.\n\nHowever, the fair and equitable treatment obligation is not an unqualified guarantee that regulations will never change. Investors must expect that the legislation will change from time to time, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurances giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stabilization. The BIT's protection of the stability of the legal and business environment cannot be interpreted as the equivalent of a stabilization clause. In the Tribunal's view, the correct position is that the state may always change its legislation, being aware and thus taking into consideration that: (i) an investor's legitimate expectations must be protected; (ii) the state's conduct must be substantively proper (*e.g.*, not arbitrary or discriminatory); and (iii) the state's conduct must be procedurally proper (*e.g.*, in compliance with due process and fair administration). If a change in legislation fails to meet these requirements, while the legislation may be validly amended as a matter of domestic law, the state may incur international liability.\n\n**d. Transparency / Consistency**\n---------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nProfessors Dolzer and Schreuer submit that \"[t]ransparency means that the legal framework for the investor's operations is readily apparent and that any decisions affecting the investor can be traced to that legal framework.\"102 They also state that by now the requirement of transparency is \"firmly rooted in arbitral practice.103\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, pp. 133-134 (citing the UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements, Fair and Equitable Treatment (1991) p. 51).\n\n*Id*.\n\n531.\n\nThis was also the view adopted by the tribunal in *Metalclad v. Mexico*, which stated as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal understands [transparency] to include the idea that all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under the Agreement should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors of another Party. There should be no room for doubt or uncertainty on such matters. Once the authorities of the central government of any Party (whose international responsibility in such matters has been identified in the preceding section) become aware of any scope for misunderstanding or confusion in this connection, it is their duty to ensure that the correct position is promptly determined and clearly stated so that investors can proceed with all appropriate expedition in the confident belief that they are acting in accordance with all relevant laws.104\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, \u00b6 76.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful that, when defining fair and equitable treatment, the *Tecmed* tribunal stated that:\n\nThe foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations.105\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico*, \u00b6 154.\n\n533.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the general thrust of these statements. However, as noted by the *Saluka* tribunal, such propositions must be considered in the proper context; \"taken too literally, they would impose upon host States obligations which would be inappropriate and unrealistic.\"106 Whether a state has been unfair and inequitable by failing to be transparent with respect to its laws and regulations, or being ambiguous and inconsistent in their application, must be assessed in light of all of the factual circumstances surrounding such conduct. For example, it would be unrealistic to require Romania to be totally transparent with the general public in the context of diplomatic negotiations. The question before the Tribunal is thus not whether Romania has failed to make full disclosure of or grant full access to sensitive information; it is whether, in the event that Romania failed to do so, Romania acted unfairly and inequitably with respect to the Claimants. The same applies to consistency: the question is not merely whether Romania has acted inconsistently; it is whether, in acting inconsistently, it has been unfair and inequitable with respect to the Claimants. This is a question that cannot be answered in a vacuum; it is highly dependent on the factual circumstances.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 304.\n\n534.\n\nWhether a state acted in an ambiguous or inconsistent manner is also assessed taking into consideration that state's past conduct which is part of the context. As stated by the *Tecmed* tribunal, \"[t]he foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities [,..].\"107 It also found that \"the Claimant was entitled to expect that the government's actions would be free from any ambiguity that might affect the early assessment made by the foreign investor of its real legal situation or the situation affecting its investment and the actions the investor should take to act accordingly.\"108 Consequently, the tribunal found that the investor's legitimate expectations were frustrated by the contradiction and uncertainty in Mexico's conduct, \"which [were] prejudicial to the investor in terms of its advance assessment of the legal situation surrounding its investment and the planning of its business activity and its adjustment to preserve its rights.\"109\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico*, \u00b6 154 (Emphasis added).\n\n*Id,* \u00b6 167.\n\n*Id,* \u00b6\u00b6 172-173.\n\n535.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the Tribunal will thus now assess the Claimants' claims that Romania acted unfairly and inequitably.\n\n**3. Did Romania fail to provide a predictable and stable legal framework for the Claimants' investments? In particular, did it violate the Claimants' legitimate expectations of regulatory stability?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, by prematurely revoking the EGO 24 incentives, Romania failed to provide a predictable and stable legal framework for the Claimants to plan their investments. In particular, they argue that Romania violated their legitimate expectation that these incentives would be in place for the promised 10-year period (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 211-228; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 359-430; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 36-50).\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimants address the stability and legitimate expectations \"strands\" of their fair and equitable treatment claim together in their Statement of Claim and Post-Hearing\n\nBrief, but treated the individual claims separately in their Reply. As discussed above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' arguments with respect to these two \"strands\" are closely interlinked, and will thus address them jointly. Indeed, as noted by the tribunal in *Duke v. Ecuador,* \"[t]he stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor's justified expectations.\"110\n\n*Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, \u00b6 340.\n\n**i. The standard for determining whether there has been a breach of legitimate expectations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the threshold legal question is how a Tribunal should determine whether it was reasonable for an investor to rely on a particular expectation in a particular context. The Claimants rely on *Parkerings v. Lithuania* (at \u00b6 331), where the Tribunal held that an investor's expectation is legitimate if:\n\na. The investor received an explicit promise or guarantee as to particular legal or regulatory provisions;\n\nb. The investor received implicit promises or guarantees to that effect that it then took into account in making its investment; or\n\nc. Absent such assurances or representations, the circumstances surrounding the investment were such as to give rise to a legitimate expectation.\n\n539.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's allegations, the Claimants contend that explicit assurances or specific representations from the host state are not required to generate legitimate expectations (C-PHB, \u00b6 38). The Claimants' argue this was the position adopted by the tribunals in *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, *Occidental v. Ecuador*, *MTD v. Chile*, and *PSEG v. Turkey*).\n\n540.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in determining whether an expectation was legitimate, the Tribunal must also consider whether the Claimants conducted due diligence and whether the expectations were reasonable in light of the circumstances (*Parkerings,* \u00b6 333). Furthermore, according to the Claimants, whether an expectation was legitimate must be examined at the time the investment was made (*EDF v. Romania,* \u00b6 41).\n\n541.\n\nThe Claimants submit that an investor's expectation must be legitimate at the time when the promise or assurance was made, and when the investors relied on that promise or assurance (Tr., Day 1, 176:3-8 (Gaillard)).\n\n542.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants argue that Romania made a promise or assurance to them that gave rise to a legitimate expectation (Section (ii) below); the Claimants relied on that assurance (Section (iii) below), and the Claimants' expectation was reasonable (Section (iv) below). They also argue that Romania breached that legitimate expectation when it revoked the EGO 24 incentives (Section (v) below).\n\n**ii. Romania made a promise or assurance to the Claimants that gave rise to a legitimate expectation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Romania made a promise or assurance to the Claimants (i.e., that the EGO 24 incentives would remain in place during the 10 year period that \u015etei-Nucet was a disfavored region) that gave rise to a legitimate expectation (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 411-423; C-PHB, \u00b6 42). As explained in Section A above with respect to the umbrella clause, the Claimants argue that EGO 24 and its implementing legislation (in particular GD 194/1999) gave investors benefiting from that regime through the issuance of a PIC, a right to receive all of the incentives created by EGO 24 until 1 April 2009. Furthermore, the Claimants argue, Romania had a corresponding obligation to grant all of those incentives, substantially unchanged, during that time period. In the event that the Tribunal finds that the legislation did not give rise to an obligation *stricto sensu*, the Claimants argue that the legislation at least constituted a representation or promise that gave rise to a legitimate expectation that those incentives would remain in place until 1 April 2009.\n\n544.\n\nThe Claimants assert that their legitimate expectation arose \"upon the granting to them of their PIC, or in the case of European Food possibly at the time of the granting of its temporary certificate\" (Tr., Day 12, 91 (Reed)). In other words, it arose for European Food at the earliest on 9 December 1999, and for Starmill and Multipack on 17 May 2002.\n\n545.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the promise or assurance that gives rise to their legitimate expectation satisfies the *Parkerings* criteria.\n\n546.\n\nFirst, as explained in Section A above, the Claimants contend that, through the enactment of EGO 24 and its implementing legislation, and through the issuance of investor-specific PICs, Romania explicitly committed to make the incentives available to the Claimants in the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored region until 1 April 2009 (C-SoC, \u00b6 300; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 467-468; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 6-24; Tr., Day 12, 70-91 (Reed), 163-164 (Gaillard)).111 This assurance was made to investors generally through EGO 24 and its implementing legislation, and to the Claimants in particular by means of the issuance of investor-specific PICs to each of the Corporate Claimants that explicitly granted these particular Claimants the benefits of the EGO 24 incentives regime for a period of 10 years. The Claimants argue that this assurance from the Respondent was evident from the language of the relevant regulations and the PICs, and was reinforced by Romania's conduct. The Claimants stress that these PICs constitute a specific assurance that gives rise to a legitimate expectation, regardless of whether the Tribunal finds that Romania did or did not enter into an obligation with the Corporate Claimants.\n\nThis argument is also the core of the Claimants' umbrella clause claim.\n\n547.\n\nSecond, even absent the express language in EGO 24 and the investor-specific commitments made in the PICs, the Claimants submit that Romania implicitly committed to maintain the incentives for ten years. By offering, reaffirming and maintaining for their designated durations various incentives to invest in disadvantaged regions during the 1990s, Romania demonstrated the reasonableness of relying on the stability of the EGO 24 incentives and the rights embodied in the PICs. In addition, the fact that Romania offered the Raw Materials Incentive in 1998 - three years after it subjected itself to EU state aid requirements - reflected Romania's own belief that the incentive was permissible under those requirements and its intent to maintain the incentives regime despite the ongoing EU accession negotiations. Moreover, when the Romanian Competition Council issued its findings in 2000 questioning the legality of the Raw Materials Incentive, the Government disagreed with and opposed those findings, which were ultimately dismissed by Romanian courts.\n\n548.\n\nThird, the Claimants submit that the circumstances surrounding their investments demonstrate Romania's commitment to maintain the incentives for ten years. The Claimants argue that \"this is not a case of an investor taking advantage of a legal regime that just happened to be in place at the time of investment, and then complaining when the host state legislated a new regime. Rather, the regime was specifically designed to attract investors like Claimants, so that they would spend money and create jobs in Romania's disadvantaged regions\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 421).\n\n549.\n\nAs a result, the Claimants submit that this interpretation is the only one that makes sense from a teleological standpoint. According to the Claimants, if the incentives could have been revoked at any time, they would have been ineffective in incentivizing investment, because investors would have lacked the certainty that they would have needed to commit funds.\n\n550.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Romania was successful in attracting investors, but revoked the incentives before the Claimants could achieve the benefits that had been used to attract them. In this context, Romania violated the Claimants' legitimate expectation of basic regulatory stability with respect to the incentives regime.\n\n**iii. The Claimants relied upon that promise or assurance**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n551.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they relied upon Romania's promise or assurance when deciding to invest on the scale and at the speed they did in the \u015etei-Nucet disfavored region. In particular, they allege that they had a ten-year plan for European Food to capitalize on the EGO 24 benefits. Although the Claimants acknowledge that Messrs. Micula's initial investments in Bihor County were made in reliance on previous incentive regimes (specifically, Law 35 and GD 27) (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 62-124), they claim that they would not have invested in the manner, scale and speed that they did if they had not reasonably relied on the expectation that the EGO 24 incentives regime would remain in place for the full 10-year period (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 161-170; C-PHB, \u00b6 43; Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 44-64; WS of M. Ban, \u00b6 38).\n\n552.\n\nThe Claimants allege that their investments in Bihor County only made economic sense if they could count on the benefits of the Raw Materials' Incentive for the 10-year period. Absent that incentive, the Claimants would not have invested in the way they did, and Romania would not have achieved the socioeconomic benefits in its disadvantaged regions that it sought (C-Reply, \u00b6 422).\n\n553.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Romania is incorrect and misleading when it states that EGO 24 was neither the predicate for the Miculas' initial investment decision, nor the cause of any apparent change in their investment strategy (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 62-68). The Miculas allege that they did not invest in Bihor County because of legislative \"fluctuations\" happening at the time (implying instability); rather, they relied on legislative changes that promoted investment. Prior to the implementation of EGO 24, the Miculas relied on two predecessor state aid regimes, Law 35 and GO 27, which illustrates the reasonableness of the Claimants' reliance on other incentive programs such as EGO 24. In any event, the Miculas did not create the fully integrated and complex facilities that include today's food production business until after 1998, in reliance on EGO 24.112\n\nThe Claimants note that Romania's timeline of the Claimants' investments in Romania (R-CM, Figure 1, page 7) shows the dates in which the relevant companies were incorporated, rather than the dates in which Messrs. Micula acquired the shares in the preexisting companies created by others. The Claimants include a \"correct timeline\" at C-Reply, page 25.\n\n554.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their reliance on the EGO 24 incentives is proven by the following facts (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 165-170, 197-204; C-PHB, \u00b6 43):\n\na. *The Claimants\u2019 decision to invest in \u015etei-Nucet instead of Bucharest.* In 1997, the Miculas had planned to relocate from Bihor county to Bucharest, which would have meant considerable cost savings (given its location within Romania's largest market and proximity to the port of Constan(a). They had already purchased two companies and land in Bucharest in 1997 and had entered into a contract for bottling lines to be installed in Bucharest in January 1998. However, after learning of the EGO 24 incentives, the Miculas changed their mind and remained in Bihor County. On the understanding that the incentives would last for the full 10 years, they determined that the incentives outweighed the costs of investing in such a remote region (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 31-36; Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29; Tr., Day 2:211, Day 3:133,141,145-150, Day 4:72-73 (I. Micula); WS of M. Ban, \u00b6 38; Exh. C-439; C-346; C-679; C-676-678).\n\nb. *The Corporate Claimants were created specifically to benefit from the incentives*. The Articles of Incorporation of European Food state that the company was created \"in accordance with the provisions of Law 20/15.01.1999 regarding the approval of EGO 24/1998...\" (Exh. HEC-1). The Miculas used European Food to import the majority of the raw materials used by the business to take advantage of customs duties exemptions. Starmill was incorporated to establish integrated in-house grain milling facilities, which would also take advantage of the Raw Materials Incentive and create cost efficiencies. Multipack was incorporated to establish the packaging and labeling for nearly all of the companies' products, and also relied heavily on the Raw Materials Incentive. (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 55, 59-67; WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19; Exh. C-385).\n\nc. *The scale of the investments, the integration of the Claimants' business model and the Claimants' expansion into new markets such as food and beer, only made economic sense if the incentives were to last for the full 10-year period.* The Claimants allege that their business strategy depended on taking advantage of the incentives to achieve long-term profitability through the vertical integration of their facilities and the construction of cost-saving and revenue-generating capital projects. This would allow them to achieve economies of scale and reduce costs, which would allow them to maintain successful businesses after the expiration of the incentives. However, for this strategy to be successful, they needed sufficient time (and the cash savings provided by the incentives) to integrate their existing operations and construct these additional capital projects, as well as time to penetrate domestic and foreign markets. As explained in Section III.C.2 above, this business strategy contemplated two phases, each of which depended on the availability of the Raw Materials Incentive. The first phase consisted in penetrating the Romanian market with fast-moving consumer products. This would generate quick cash flows, which together with the incentive savings, would allow the companies to integrate vertically and achieve economies of scale, allowing them to save on operational costs and minimize waste and energy consumption. The second phase was to build a brewery and the so-called \"Incremental Investments\" (malt plant, canning plant and cogeneration plant). The Claimants thus planned to use the EGO 24 incentives to expand their production facilities so that they would no longer be dependent on the incentives after their expiration on 2009 (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46; \u00b6\u00b6 59--64, 83-84; Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6 33, 51-52).\n\nd. *The fact that the obligations were to last for twice the period that the investors benefitted from the incentives*. As the obligations imposed by EGO 24 would last for twice the period that the Claimants benefitted from the incentives, the Claimants argue that they had to invest up-front so as to take advantage of the incentives to develop an integrated business that would be competitive and successful in the long term (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64; Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 51-52).\n\ne. *The availability of funding.* Due to the higher debt/equity ratio that would have existed but for the incentives, the Claimants argue that, without the promise that the incentives would last 10 years, it is unlikely that sufficient funding would have been available for the Claimants to invest the way they did (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6\u00b6 7.18-7.21).\n\n555.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the lack of written business plans reflecting their reliance on Romania's assurances is irrelevant. They contend that family businesses such as the Miculas' do not generally prepare all the types of written documents that the Respondent claims should exist. Instead, the Tribunal must consider the actual evidence before it, which shows that the Miculas carefully considered the impact of the incentives, how they could take advantage of those incentives, and how the incentives could be weighed against the disadvantages of investing in a disfavored region that lacked basic infrastructure and skilled workers, which ultimately led to their decision to invest (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45).\n\n556.\n\nThe Claimants contend that it is likewise irrelevant that the Claimants may have adapted their plans over time to respond to changes in the market; what matters is that the Miculas made specific investment decisions in reliance on the expectation that the incentives would remain in place for 10 years (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 46).\n\n**iv. The Claimants' reliance was reasonable**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nThe Claimants' argue that their reliance on the expectation that the EGO 24 incentives would last for the entire 10-year period was reasonable. According to the Claimants, the reasonableness of this expectation is proven by (a) the content of EGO 24 and of its enacting legislation; (b) the content of the PICs; (c) Romania's intimate involvement in the granting and monitoring of the EGO 24 incentives program; (d) Romania's promotion and support of the EGO 24 regime and previous incentive regimes, and (e) Romania's interaction with the Competition Council. In addition, the Claimants argue that, contrary to Romania's contentions, the Claimants' reliance was reasonable in light of Romania's impending accession to the EU.\n\n*(a) The purpose and content of EGO 24 and its enacting legislation*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the very purpose and content of EGO 24 - and of its enacting legislation - gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the facilities would remain in place until 31 March 2009 (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 211-221).\n\n559.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that the language of EGO 24 and its implementing legislation were clear, and it was legitimate for the Claimants to rely on that language. In particular, Article 3 of GD 194/1999 declared \u015etei-Nucet a disfavored region for a period of 10 years, while Article 4 stated that the incentives were available to investors during the existence of that disfavored region. GD 1199/2000, which amended GD 194/1999, increased the size of the disfavored region to include Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti, confirmed that the region would be declared disfavored for 10 years, and did not amend Article 4 of GD 194/1999. GD 728/2001, which established the Methodological Norms for EGO 24, also stated that investors who had obtained a PIC would continue to benefit from the incentives until the lapse of the period during which the region was declared disfavored (Art. 5(3) of GD 728). Law 20, which enacted EGO 24, allowed this period to be extended (Art. I(5) of Law 20). In the light of these provisions, it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the incentives would be granted for the full 10 year period.\n\n560.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that EGO 24 was designed to induce long-term investments. To this end, Article 9 of EGO 24 required investors to continue to operate in the disfavored regions for twice the period for which they received the incentives, or they would have to repay the amounts they had received and/or saved. This meant that the Claimants had to ensure that their investments lasted for twenty years. Thus, the reciprocal nature of the obligations demonstrated the existence of a *quid pro quo* between the investors and the state and instilled in the Claimants the reasonable expectation that both parties would comply with their obligations.\n\n561.\n\nIn addition, because the benefits applied only to new investments, any investor wishing to take advantage of them would either need to make a greenfield investment or reform an outdated facility. The Claimants also had to build their own utility support, which was nonexistent in the region. All of this necessitated significant commitments of capital which only made economic sense if the promised benefits were to last their full, 10-year term.\n\n562.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the amendments made to the EGO 24 regime in the following years were made for a variety of reasons and did not give rise to an expectation that the regime would come to an end in early 2005 (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 230238). For example, EGO 75/2000 solved certain practical problems in the application of the incentives and even made some of them more readily available to investors. Although EGO 75/2000 repealed the \"Components Facility\", Law 625/2001 reinstated it. GD 1199/2000 extended the disfavored region to include Dragane\u015fti. Law 345/2002 repealed the exemption from customs duties and VAT provided in Art. 6(1) of EGO 24, but did so in the context of a general taxation reform, not for the purpose of regulating state aid. Law 414/2002 repealed the profit tax exemption, but that exemption remained in place for investors (such as the Claimants) who had received PICs prior to 1 July 2002. Although another set of amendments passed in 2002 targeted the Raw Materials Incentive, it was clear from parliamentary debates and other contemporaneous sources that their purpose was to address problems in the meat industry, not the harmonization of Romania's law with EU law.\n\n*(b) The issuance and content of the PICs*\n------------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the issuance and content of the PICs further enhanced their legitimate expectations that the facilities would remain in place for the entire period (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 239-245). All of the Corporate Claimants' PICs expressly stated that they would be valid until 1 April 2009. The granting of the PICs and the fact that the Government allowed the Claimants to use them repeatedly to receive the benefits confirmed this belief. Further, the PICs confirmed all of the activities for which the Claimants could receive incentives (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 156, 159).113 Thus, the PICs explicitly and implicitly confirmed that the Claimants were entitled to benefit from the incentives until 1 April 2009.\n\nThe reference seems to be to Exh. C-638, which contains various versions of the PICs and a list of investment activities, but it is unclear to the Tribunal if this list was attached to the original PICs.\n\n564.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Romania's attempts to minimize the importance of investor-specific PICs based on the language granting the incentives \"in accordance with the provisions of EGO 24/1998\" are unconvincing. That language merely reflects that EGO 24 had been amended prior to the date the PIC was granted. In any event, Multipack's PIC does not contain that language. Further, the PICs do not contain any language contemplating potential revocation of the incentives.\n\n*(c) Romania's intimate involvement in the granting of the EGO 24 incentives*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the reasonableness of their expectations was reinforced by the state's intimate involvement in the EGO 24 regime and close monitoring of the Claimants' receipt of the EGO 24 benefits (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 171-196; 260-272).\n\n566.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants allege that they underwent lengthy and detailed approval processes with different government agencies, which kept the Government fully apprised of the Claimants' investment plans and actual investments. Specifically, to obtain their Temporary Investment Certificates they needed to file and secure approval of their investment plan with the NW-RDA (e.g., European Food's investment plan of December 1999 is found at Exh. C-385). Each time they planned a new investment, they had to file updated versions of the investment plans for approval and obtain new, modified PICs that reflected the newly-approved investments. Similarly, to obtain their PICs, the Claimants had to undergo another approval process, including an on-site visit from the NW-RDA to verify that the companies qualified for EGO 24 benefits. In addition, to actually benefit from the incentives, the Corporate Claimants had to obtain approval from different regulatory bodies to verify that they met their EGO 24 requirements. Indeed, each time European Food wanted to import equipment or raw materials it had to submit very specific information regarding the machinery or raw materials it wished to import, as well as the investment purpose.\n\n567.\n\nIn addition to monitoring and regulating Claimants' activities via the PICs, the NW-RDA and the Oradea Customs Department closely supervised and controlled the Claimants' activities on a day-to-day basis via the continuous approvals processes in relation to the importation of equipment and raw materials. The Claimants' investments were also reviewed outside the approvals process, *e.g.*, through audits, biannual reviews, information obligations, and other monitoring activities.\n\n568.\n\nThe Claimants thus argue that, through the key role the Romanian authorities played at all levels of the EGO 24 incentives regime, these authorities provided explicit as well as implicit assurances to Claimants that the EGO 24 incentives would be available for their full term. These approval processes allowed the Government to track the amount and type of incentives the Claimants received under the EGO 24 program and ensured that the Claimants received incentives only for those business purposes for which they had obtained approval under their Temporary or Permanent Investor Certificates. Each approval by the Government agencies solidified the Claimants' expectation that the Government had every intention of complying with its obligations under EGO 24, which in turn encouraged the Claimants to continue with their investments.\n\n*(d) Romania's promotion and support of the EGO 24 regime and previous incentive regimes*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the legitimacy of their expectations and the reasonableness of their reliance was further enhanced by Romania's contemporaneous statements and conduct with respect to the EGO 24 regime and previous incentive regimes.\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimants first allege that the Government actively promoted the EGO 24 incentives regime in order to induce investments in disfavored areas, and gave assurances as to its 10 year duration (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 222-229). The Claimants cite,\n\n*inter alia* :\n\na. Presentations by Mr. Neculai Liviu Marcu, then President of the NARD, in which he explained the EGO 24 regime and its benefits for investors. In his witness statement submitted in this arbitration, Mr. Marcu states that \"[o]n all of the occasions where I presented in disfavoured regions that had been declared as such for a 10 year period I explained that the benefits of the regime would last for the full 10 years\" (WS of N. Marcu, \u00b6 32);\n\nb. Meetings with potential investors run by the NW-RDA and local government representatives (WS of M. Ban, \u00b6\u00b6 32-37);\n\nc. The NW-RDA's annual reports (Exh. C-393, C-458);\n\nd. The preparation of a CD-ROM for international promotion (\"Romania - Your Business Partner 1999/2000\" (Exh. C-563)).\n\ne. Media reports of government initiatives (Exh. C-568 and C-630). In particular, the Claimants allege that the Government's June 2003 press release114 noted the success of the EGO 24 program and, according to the Claimants, assured that the EGO 24 incentives would continue to be in place at least until Romania joined the EU (Exh. C-489).\n\nf. Romania's National Program for Joining the EU, where the Claimants allege that the Government stated that the laws in force at the time would continue to be in place.115\n\nThe Claimants refer to June 2002, but the date on Exh. C-489 is 18 June 2003.\n\nThe Claimants mistakenly cite Exh. C-489. The correct reference appears to be Exh. HEC-7, which states at page 147 that \"[t]he provisions of the normative acts on facilities granted for \"D areas\" will be maintained till the moment of Romania's accession to the European Union.\"\n\n571.\n\nFurther, the Claimants contend that the success of the EGO 24 program - and Romania's public acknowledgement of this fact - reinforced the Claimants' legitimate expectation that the regime would remain in place for the stated term (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 273-278). The EGO 24 program was enacted as part of Romania's attempts to address significant economic problems related to regional development and to further Romania's accession aspirations. The Claimants allege that the program was extremely successful in attracting investors to areas in need of capital, and this success was recognized and hailed by the Government. Romania continued to reaffirm the need for investment and reduction of unemployment in the disfavored regions, and continued to issue PICs and promote the EGO 24 scheme. In this context, it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that Romania would remain committed to the EGO 24 program.\n\n572.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that it was reasonable for them to rely on the EGO 24 incentive program and its stated duration because Romania had previously offered and maintained other incentive regimes similar to the EGO 24 regime, including Law 35 and GO 27 (both of which had been implemented in the context of the Europe Agreement and were never challenged by the European Commission or the Government). The Government never revoked the incentives granted under these programs, and when Law 35 ended the incentives were \"grandfathered\" so that existing investors were able to benefit from them until their original expiration date. The Claimants thus argue that Romania's consistent pattern of conduct and the Miculas' successful experience with these previous incentive programs created a course of dealing between Romania and the Claimants that made it reasonable for the Claimants to expect that Romania would maintain the EGO 24 incentive program for its full stated term or at least grandfather its benefits.\n\n573.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants contend that, under Romanian law, the government was not allowed to revoke the incentives without grandfathering the provisions or compensating the investors. Relying on the testimony of Prof. Mihai, the Claimants argue that new legislation cannot affect acquired rights (Tr., Day 5:207-208, 210, 247 (Mihai)).\n\n574.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that Romania never suggested to investors that reliance on the EGO 24 regime was inappropriate (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 279-280). Romania argues that the Claimants should have somehow known that the EGO 24 regime would come to a premature end. However, until its revocation, the Claimants aver that the Government never suggested to, let alone informed, investors that the regime would not remain in place for the full ten-year period (Tr., Day 9, 21-23 (Juratowitch/Ban)). Instead, the Government continued to promote, apply and support the EGO 24 regime. When Romania finally started to indicate that the incentives could be terminated, Romania did not clearly state the timing and effects of that termination. In fact, Romania suggested that investors that relied on that regime would be protected or compensated.\n\n*(e) Romania's interaction with the Competition Council*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that their expectation that the EGO 24 incentives would remain in place for the entire 10 year period was solidified by Romania's reaction to Decision 244 of the Competition Council (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 246-259). In Decision 244 of 15 May 2000 (Exh. R-78), the Competition Council recommended alterations to EGO 24 (including the Raw Materials Incentive and the Machinery Incentive) after finding that the incentives distorted competition. However, the Government ignored Decision 244 and instead adopted EGO 75/2000, which did not implement the recommendations of Decision 244. The Claimants argue that this suggests that the Government disagreed with Decision 244. Indeed, the Claimants submit that Romania's comments to the Commission's Written Submission in this arbitration suggest that Romania still considered the EGO 24 incentives to be compatible with state aid at that time (C-Reply, \u00b6 60, citing Romania's letter of 16 November 2009).\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Government was right to disagree with Decision 244 for a number of reasons, in particular because it was flawed and was not based on EU competition law considerations. As explained by Prof. Dashwood, its findings were not supported by evidence and were not based on facts relating to the Claimants or their business. The Decision made no reference to the EU or the requirement for Romania to harmonize its laws with those of the EU, nor did it state that EGO 24 was incompatible with EU law. Decision 244 was also silent on whether EGO 24 fell under Article 87(3) of the EU Treaty, which exempts certain forms of state aid, especially aid designed to alleviate under-developed regions, from a general prohibition of aid that distorts competition (ER of A. Dashwood).\n\n577.\n\nThis disagreement generated a public debate between the Government and the Competition Council, which later led to a lawsuit brought by the Competition Council against the Government. The Government prevailed both in the first instance before the Bucharest Court of Appeal and on appeal before the High Court of Cassation and Justice (Exh. C-528 and C-643; ER of L. Mihai). In both instances the courts held that the Competition Council did not have the authority to challenge emergency government ordinances such as EGO 24, which are legislative acts.\n\n578.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Romanian courts' decisions highlighted the Competition Council's lack of authority regarding EGO 24. The Claimants argue that under Law 143/1999 (Exh. R-18) the Competition Council was not authorized to scrutinize all state aid or order government agencies to stop granting aid. With respect to existing state aid (such as the EGO 24 incentives), the Competition Council was only authorized to request the aid provider to remove the incompatibility of the measures with the law, including through a recommendation for cancellation or amendment. But as shown by the Court decisions, the Government was not required to comply, and the Competition Council had no ability to challenge the legislation in court. Indeed, the Government did not comply with the Council's recommendation. This strengthened the Claimants' reasonable belief that the Government was committed to the EGO 24 program. This belief was confirmed by the fact that European Food was granted its PIC on 1 June 2000, only a few weeks after Decision 244 was rendered, and Starmill and Multipack were granted their PICs soon after the Supreme Court Decision was granted.\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the Government's support of the EGO 24 regime in the face of the opposition of the Competition Council was a strong indicator that the Government considered the EGO 24 regime to be lawful, and made the Claimants' reliance on that regime all the more reasonable. They argue that investors are entitled to assume that the government is acting lawfully, and if the government was acting as if EGO 24 was lawful, the Claimants were entitled to rely on that.\n\n580.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants conducted sufficient due diligence prior to investing. According to the Claimants, investors cannot be required to conduct a higher standard of due diligence than the government itself: it would be unreasonable to require the investors to know whether Romania would accede to the EU and what effect that would have on EGO 24, if Romania itself did not know that.\n\n*(f) The Claimants' expectations were reasonable in light of Romania's impending accession to the EU*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nAs discussed in Section V.B on Applicable Law, in the Claimants' view EU law plays a different role with respect to the analysis of the Claimants' fair and equitable treatment claim than with respect to its expropriation and umbrella clause claims. With respect to these latter two claims, the Claimants argue that Romania's EU law defense can only be analyzed as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, and thus should be assessed after the Tribunal has decided whether there is liability under the BIT. In contrast, the Claimants submit that with respect to the fair and equitable treatment claim, Romania's EU law defense is relevant to the determination of the wrongfulness itself; in other words, it is relevant to determining whether Romania has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard. Thus, Romania's EU law defense must be assessed during the Tribunal's analysis of whether the fair and equitable treatment standard has been breached (Tr., Day 1, 159-164, 170-174 (Gaillard)).\n\n582.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants argue that EU law is part of the factual matrix against which the Tribunal must determine whether the Claimants' expectations were legitimate and, specifically, whether they were reasonable (Tr., Day 1, 176-177 (Gaillard)). The Claimants deny that, as argued by the Respondent, Romania's impending accession to the EU made their reliance unreasonable. To the contrary, the Claimants contend that their expectation that the Raw Materials Incentive would be afforded to them for 10 years was reasonable despite Romania's accession process. The Claimants stress that this analysis must consider the state of EU law and Romania's relationship with the EU at the time that the expectation arose and at the time the Claimants made their investments in reliance on this expectation (Tr., Day 1, 167 (Gaillard)).\n\n583.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that, from a substantive standpoint, the incentives were compatible with EU law. At the very least, it would have been reasonable (from the time in which EGO 24 was enacted and until the incentives were revoked) for an investor to believe that the incentives were compatible with EU law. With the support of their expert in EU law, Prof. Dashwood, the Claimants assert that the incentives could have fallen within the scope of a valid exception to the EC Treaty's prohibition on state aid as provided in Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty (formerly Article 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and incorporated into the Europe Agreement regime by Article 64 of the Europe Agreement), and could have validly constituted regional operating aid under the EU Guidelines on Regional Aid (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6\u00b6 43-55).\n\n584.\n\nThe \"Implementing Rules\" for the application of Article 64 of the Europe Agreement were adopted on 10 April 2001 through Decision 4/2000 of the EU-Romania Association Council (Exh. R-65; C-579).116 Article 2(1) of the Implementing Rules provided that \"[t]he assessment of compatibility of individual aid awards and programmes with the Europe Agreement, as provided for in Article 1 of these Rules, shall be made on the basis of the criteria arising from the application of the rules of Article 87 of the Treaty establishing the European Community [...].\"\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Implementing Rules also extended the time period in which Romania would be considered an underdeveloped area pursuant to Article 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement:  \n In accordance with and within the limits of Article 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement, Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community referred to in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. (Article 4(1) of Decision 4/2000).\n\n585.\n\nAccording to Prof. Dashwood, \"the criteria applicable in respect of regional aid granted by the Romanian authorities under the regime of the [Europe Agreement] were those of the 1998 Guidelines [on Regional Aid] relating to areas covered by the Article 83(3)(a) derogation\" (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 22). Prof. Dashwood explained that the Guidelines on Regional Aid distinguished between various types of state aid, and described the circumstances under which certain state aid could be granted. These circumstances included cases where the economic situation was extremely unfavorable in relation to the European Community as a whole, and the Guidelines specified the types of aid that could be granted as tax exemptions. In addition, although Prof. Dashwood acknowledges that while \"operating aid aimed at reducing a firm's current expenditure is normally prohibited, the Guidelines recognise that, exceptionally, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 87(3)(a), subject to certain conditions\" (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 11). Relying on Prof. Dashwood's expert opinion, the Claimants argue that EGO 24 incentives met all of the criteria for state aid permitted by Art. 87(3)(a). Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the EGO 24 incentives could have qualified under the Art. 87(3)(a) exemption.\n\n586.\n\nIndeed, the Claimants argue that Romania itself appears to have believed that, at the time EGO 24 was enacted, the incentives were compatible with EU state aid requirements, noting that Romania itself has acknowledged this point in its submissions in this arbitration (*see* R-CM, \u00b6 29; Respondent's Comments to the Commission's Written Submission, 16 Nov. 2009, \u00b6 1(b)). Thus, the Claimants argue that any reasonable investor would have relied on Romania's own position that EGO 24 was compatible with EU law, and would have had no reason to expect the incentives to be prematurely revoked.\n\n587.\n\nThe Claimants reject Romania's suggestion that the Implementing Rules effective 2001 (Exh. R-65; C-579) explain why it viewed the incentives compatible with EU law in 1998, but incompatible in 2004 (R-CM, \u00b6 20). According to the Claimants, there is nothing in the Implementing Rules to suggest this. Instead, the Implementing Rules clarified that \"the procedural rules to ensure effective application of the criteria governing the compatibility of aid granted in Romania with the proper functioning of the [Europe] Agreement were left to be determined exclusively as a matter of Romanian law.\" (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 25). Given that Romania had entered into the Europe Agreement in 1993, it was well aware by 1998 which kinds of state aid it could provide. It is thus inappropriate for Romania to rely on the issuance of the 2001 Implementing Rules to try to argue that in 1998 there was little specific guidance as to whether particular incentive regimes would be permissible under EC state aid rules.\n\n588.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, nothing after the issuance of EGO 24 affects this conclusion. The EC never requested that Romania repeal the EGO 24 incentives, and there was never a determination (by the EC) that the incentives did not qualify for an exemption of Art. 87(3)(a). The only body that examined whether the incentives in EGO 24 were compatible with EU law was the Romanian Competition Council through Decision 244 in 2001. In any event, the Competition Council's complaint against the Government for failure to apply Decision 244 was dismissed by Romanian courts.\n\n589.\n\nIndeed, the Claimants contend that, as late as 2003, the EU was giving signals that it would accept existing aid schemes and would only require that the rules be changed for new entrants. In its Common Position of May 2003, the EU invited Romania to:\n\n[...] provide information on individual benefits granted in the free zones and the disadvantaged areas and on any other individual tax benefits that have already been granted and which provide for tax benefits beyond Romania's target date for accession. The EU urges Romania to close incompatible aid schemes for new entrants with immediate effect. (EU Common Position, May 2003, Exh. EC-8, p. 5).\n\n590.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this document shows that, even at that late point in time, the EU was only requiring Romania to change the rules for new entrants, but it had no problem with grandfathering vested rights of existing investors (Tr., Day 1, 180:13-25 (Gaillard)).\n\nSo even at that late point in time, the EU is saying: hey, change the rules for the new entrants. Frankly, I take issue with what I call the Commission's brief in this matter, because they fail to quote that. They quote the rest of the document but they forget conveniently this reference to the new entrants. So it was pretty clear, even at that late point in time, that the EU had no problem with granting -- grandfathering vested rights to existing entrants, existing investors, and that they would maybe insist that the rules are changed going forwards for the new entrants, as they should, because, frankly, the rule of law should mean something, even in Europe. (Tr., Day 1, 180:13-25 (Gaillard))\n\n591.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that, from a procedural standpoint, only Romania (and not the European Commission) had the competence to determine which forms of state aid qualified as permissible state aid. This is because during the relevant time Romania was a pre-accession regime, where the only applicable law was Romanian law. As opposed to a post-accession regime, where there is a duality of functions between the State's legal order and the European Commission, in pre-accession Romania the European Commission and EU law played no role (Tr., Day 1, 178-179 (Gaillard); ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 25).\n\n592.\n\nSpecifically, Prof. Dashwood states that the Europe Agreement said nothing about the procedural aspects of disciplining state aid. The Implementing Rules merely established rules for cooperation, consultation and problem solving between the European Commission and the Romanian monitoring authority (which was the Romanian Competition Office and Competition Council). Thus, Prof. Dashwood concludes that \"[w]hat emerges clearly is that in the State aid regime of the [Europe Agreement] the procedural rules to ensure effective application of the criteria governing the compatibility of aid granted in Romania with the proper functioning of the Agreement were to be left to be determined exclusively as a matter of Romanian law\" (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 25).\n\n593.\n\nProf. Dashwood further asserts that the substantive rules regarding State aid (in particular, Article 87 of the EC Treaty) cannot apply independently of the procedural rules in Articles 88 and 89 of the EC Treaty: \"There has to be a concrete finding, by way of an individual Commission decision or legislation, that a particular aid, or aid of a certain type, is or is not compatible with the common market. It follows that the granting of the disputed aid could only be rendered unlawful under the [Europe Agreement] regime by a ruling compliant with the procedural requirements of that regime, finding that the aid satisfied all four of the criteria in Article 87 (1) [of the EC Treaty], while not qualifying as an exemption under Article 87(3)(a)\" (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33).]\n\n594.\n\nFourth, the Claimants contend that Romania contradicts itself when it asserts that the Miculas should have known that the incentives would disappear with Romania's accession to the EU. Indeed, Romania's acknowledged that it enacted the incentives legislation in order to advance its accession prospects. According to the Claimants, Romania admits (at R-CM, \u00b6 29117) that EGO 24 was not incompatible with the Europe Agreement's provisions and Romania's accession obligations, and was, in fact, necessary for accession (C-Reply, \u00b6 210).\n\n\"Especially given Romania's status as an \u2018underdeveloped area' within the meaning of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, the government could reasonably conclude at the time that the EGO 24/1998 regime was not incompatible with the Europe Agreement's provisions. Furthermore, given the economic dislocation that existed at the time, measures to ameliorate conditions in the disfavoured regions were necessary. Romania was not alone among EU candidate States in making the policy choice to implement new economic-assistance measures based upon such an assessment of the legal position. For example, Poland passed similar legislation authorizing State aid for underdeveloped regions in 1994, while it was a candidate for EU admission\" (R-CM, \u00b6 29).\n\n595.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there is a similar \"element of schizophrenia\" in the Commission's position. On the one hand, the EU urged Romania to take the measures necessary to improve Romania's economic and legal status, including negotiating BITs, so that it would be in a position to join the EU. Romania's economic situation at the conclusion of the Europe Agreement was so dire that the EU expressly stated that the whole of Romania should be considered an underdeveloped area for purposes of State aid (Art. 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement). Accordingly, to \"establish and improve a legal framework which favours and protects investment\" and with the higher aim of achieving EU accession, the EU promoted the conclusion of bilateral investment treaties between Romania and EU member states (Art. 74(2) of the Europe Agreement), including the BIT that is the basis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. However, under the EC's argument, once Romania had achieved the necessary economic development for accession, and once the Claimants had made their investments under the BIT, Romania then had to renege on its BIT obligations because revocation of the incentives was allegedly needed to obtain EU accession. As stated by the Claimants:\n\nNow, the last thing I will say about the European attitude is that if you were to believe them at face value and take at face value what they say regarding the alleged EU requirements which would oblige countries to renege on their commitments when they join the EU, even if you were to take that at face value, and I don't think you should because, frankly, it's an argument for the purposes of litigation, it's nothing which remotely resembles the true goals of the EU, and that's fortunate -- but even if you were to take that at face value, you would notice a certain element of schizophrenia in the EU position.\n\nBecause, and this is the last thing I would like you to look at in my table, back on page 1 and page 2, and you will see that an element of the Europe agreement of February, which came into force in February 1995; an element is what? Look at page 2 of my chart, Article 74(2). You see that in plain words the EU is promoting what? Promoting the conclusion of bilateral investment treaties.\n\nThey say, in plain words, the particular aims of the cooperation will be: \"... for Romania...\" That's entered into with Romania, it's specific to Romania: \"... for Romania to establish and improve a legal framework which favours and protects investment, the conclusion by the Member States and Romania of agreements for the promotion and protection of investment.\"\n\nSo the very BIT which is the basis of your jurisdiction has been blessed, promoted by Europe itself. They told Romania: you are a very disfavoured region; the whole of Romania would qualify in terms of state aids for an exemption, the whole thing, because you are so way behind because of the history you suffered, you are so behind that you qualify all together. Please enter into BITs because that will help you catch up.\n\nNow, that is exactly what Romania has done. They entered into the BIT, which does protect the investment. So I am saying that if you were to give any credence to the current litigation argument of the Commission, which is: well, they shouldn't be liable because they had to give up all this after the fact; that would be in direct contradiction with what the EU at the time was requesting Romania to do. ***So if you were to follow that type of argument, I would say -- frankly, it's an argument which is pretty shocking because it means: well, thank you for having invested, thank you for having helped Romania to catch up and to be able to join in the first place the EU, but now that it has joined, we don't need you any more, so we can dump you, and the state should renege and should renege without compensation on its promises. There is no problem whatsoever.***\n\n(Tr., Day 1, 181:1-183:6 (Gaillard)) (Emphasis added)\n\n596.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Commission's position is wrong on four counts:\n\nIt's wrong from a timing standpoint, because EU law has nothing to say before the accession; all these representations on the right side of the paper are compatible with our case.\n\nIt's wrong from an EC law standpoint, because EC law is not that bad.\n\nIt's wrong from a policy standpoint, because if that were true, no one could ever carry [sic] any policy, because if you were to listen to the EU litigation paper, you would have to say that investors, if they are in their right mind when representations are made to them, when they are given certificates, when they are given incentives, they shouldn't believe that that's valid; they should ignore that and invest elsewhere, in countries where they respect the rule of law I guess, and they should not invest in the places they are told to invest in, because EU law would somehow permit states to change their mind without carrying any consequence of that change.\n\nSo that's wrong under EU law, but I would say for you the only thing which matters is that it's wrong from an international law standpoint: look at Articles 25 and 27 of the ILC Articles; and I would add just for the sake of the record that I find it wrong morally as well.\n\n(Tr., Day 1, 183:8-184:6 (Gaillard)).\n\n597.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants argue that:\n\nAt the very least, it was reasonable for Claimants to expect, based on Romania's promulgation of the incentives regime in 1998 and its awarding the Corporate Claimants PICs in 2000 and 2002, that even assuming Romania entered the EU before April 1, 2009 (which was highly uncertain at the time), the Government would (1) wait for an official EC decision demanding the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive before revoking it; (2) attempt to negotiate with the EC a disadvantaged-regions exception for the Raw Materials Incentive under Article 87(3) of the Europe Treaty; or (3) compensate Claimants or otherwise help to mitigate their damages as a result of revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive, perhaps by promulgating a new regulatory regime designed to meet EU requirements. But Romania did none of these things. Instead, having achieved the desired economic benefits from Claimants' investments in the country's disadvantaged regions and of EU membership, it unilaterally shifted all of the risks associated with EU accession to investors like Claimants. (C- Reply \u00b6 419)\n\n**v. Romania violated this legitimate expectation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n598.\n\nThe Claimants argue that all the factors described above instilled in them the legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 incentives would remain in place for 10 years. The Claimants allege that, by prematurely revoking these incentives 5 years before they were due to expire, Romania violated that legitimate expectation, and consequently breached its obligation under the treaty to afford the Claimants fair and equitable treatment.\n\n599.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that not all incentives were revoked - indeed, the Profit Tax Incentive remained in place for the Claimants until the expiration of their PICs in April 2009. Nonetheless, they argue that the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive was sufficient to constitute a breach of the BIT (C-PHB, \u00b6 49). The Claimants also argue that leaving the Profit Tax Exemption in place until 2009 enabled Romania to keep the Claimants' obligations to maintain their investments in the disfavored region of eight years longer than if they had simply revoked all of the incentives (Tr., Day 12, 41-43 (Fleuriet)).\n\n600.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Romania's revocation of the incentives was unfair and inequitable, because:\n\na. Romania failed to provide alternatives or otherwise mitigate the effects of the revocation on investors through transitional periods or grandfathering the incentives for existing PIC holders. Nor did Romania provide any evidence that it attempted to negotiate any alternatives or transitional periods with the EU.\n\nb. Romania failed to show how the incentives conflicted with EU law.\n\nc. The Claimants' obligations under EGO 24 remain in place.\n\nd. Romania failed to grandfather the incentives, in breach of Romanian Law. According to the Claimants, under Romanian law, grandfathering provisions are mandatory in all cases where an enactment of a new law affects legal relations established under an earlier statute and these relations are still in operation at the time the new law is enacted. (ER of L. Mihai, \u00b6 6.1).\n\n601.\n\nThe Claimants summarize their legitimate expectations claim as follows:\n\nAt its core, Claimants' story is a simple one: Romania attracted substantial investments from them on the basis of a Raw Materials Incentive granted to them through domestic legislation (EGO 24 and GD 194) and individual PICs until 2009; did so after subjecting itself to EU requirements, thereby representing to investors that the incentive was consistent with those requirements; successfully opposed its own Competition Council's determination to the contrary; achieved the desired benefits accruing from both Claimants' investments and EU accession; and then revoked the Raw Materials Incentive without waiting for an official demand from the EC, without attempting to negotiate an exception or transition period, and after it was too late for Claimants to modify their incentive-based business strategy pursuant to which they had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the disadvantaged regions of northwestern Romania. As a result, Claimants have suffered significant damages that Romania has made no attempt to mitigate. When compared to leading BIT cases like *MTD* (in which the Tribunal found that the investor had failed to conduct proper due diligence) and *Saluka* (in which the Czech Government specifically refused to assure the investor of State aid), this case presents a classic instance of the violation of investors' legitimate expectations of minimal regulatory stability. (C-Reply, \u00b6 423).\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n602.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it has breached any legitimate expectation of the Claimants. It contends that the Claimants have not met any of the requirements necessary for the doctrine of legitimate expectations to apply. First, the Claimants received no assurance that could have created a legitimate expectation that the Facilities would remain in place for 10 years. Second, the Claimants did not invest in reliance on that expectation. Finally, even if that had been the case, any such reliance would not have been objectively reasonable.\n\n**i. The standard for determining if a measure has undermined legitimate expectations**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Claimants that the appropriate standard to evaluate whether a measure has undermined legitimate expectations is that set out in *Parkerings v. Lithuania* (R-PHB, \u00b6 101). On the basis of this and other awards, the Respondent contends that for a legitimate expectation of regulatory stability to be protected, the following requirements must be met (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 111-135; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 170-173; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 99-159):\n\ni. There must be a contract, or at least a promise or specific representation that the law will remain unchanged, that created a subjective expectation.\n\nii. The expectation (or the reliance on that expectation) must have been objectively reasonable.118 In particular, the investor must anticipate that the law may change, especially if the general legislative climate is in a state of flux (*Glamis Gold v. United States*, \u00b6 767).\n\niii. The investor must have relied on that subjective expectation when it made its investment.\n\nIn some briefs, the Respondent focuses on the reasonableness of the expectation, whilst in others on the reasonableness of the reliance. The Tribunal considers this to be the same argument, which goes to the legitimacy of the expectation.\n\n604.\n\nWith respect to the first requirement, the Respondent submits that any claim based on the frustration of legitimate expectations requires the claimant to prove that the state created or reinforced the expectations through its own affirmative acts.119 The practice of international tribunals shows that legitimate expectations may only be frustrated where the state has made \"specific commitments\" that particular laws or regulations would remain in place.120 These specific commitments or assurances cannot be generated by inaction or generally applicable regulation. In addition, these specific commitments must be valid under domestic law.\n\n*Gami Investments, Inc. v. The Government of the United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 15 November 2004 (hereinafter, *\"GAMI v. Mexico\"*) *,* \u00b6\u00b6 90-110; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, 26 January 2006 (hereinafter, *\"International Thunderbird v. Mexico\"*), \u00b6 196; *CMS v. Argentina*), \u00b6\u00b6 78-82; *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 September 2001 (hereinafter \" *CME v. Czech Republic\"*), \u00b6\u00b6 610-611; *MTD v. Chile,* \u00b6 167; *Tecmed v. Mexico,* \u00b6 154.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina* (Award), \u00b6\u00b6 127-166; *Tecmed v. Mexico,* \u00b6 154; *Metalclad v. Mexico,* \u00b6 87; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1) *,* Award, 16 December 2012 (hereinafter *\"Feldman v. Mexico\"*), \u00b6 111.\n\n605.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that it is well established that a regulatory regime does not carry with it any promise that the law will remain unchanged indefinitely. Citing *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, the Respondent argues that \"[a] State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion\", and \"save for the existence of an agreement in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment\" (*Parkerings v. Lithuania,* \u00b6 332).121\n\nThe Respondent cites, inter alia, *PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6 241 (\"Legitimate expectations by definition require a promise of the administration.\"); *Metalpar S.A. and Buen Aire S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/5), Award, 6 June 2008 (hereinafter *\"Metalpar v. Argentina\"*), \u00b6 186 (\"There was no bid, license, permit or contract of any kind between Argentina and Claimants\"); *Plama Consortium Ltd v Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/24), Award, 27 August 2008 (hereinafter, *\"Plama v. Bulgaria\"*), \u00b6 219 (\"It does not appear that Bulgaria made any promises or other representations to freeze its legislation on environmental law to the Claimant or at all\").\n\n606.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent notes that in *AES v. Hungary* the tribunal found that, absent a specific representation to the investor, such as a stabilization clause, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation of legislative stasis, and any general entitlement to regulatory stability does not preclude legislative changes that are significant and even surprising (*AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.17-9.3.34). In the *AES* case, the investor did have a contract with the state. Although in that case the tribunal found that the state did not have a rational policy in modifying or eliminating its own contractual obligations, \"this does not mean that the state cannot exercise it[s] governmental powers, including its legislative function, with the consequence that private interests - such as the investor's contractual rights - are affected. But that effect would have to be a consequence of a measure based on public policy that was not aimed only at those contractual rights\" (*AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6 10.3.13). Romania concludes that, *a fortiori*, where the investor has no contract with the state, it can have no legitimate expectation that generally applicable legislation will not affect it.\n\n607.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that, for an expectation to be legitimate and therefore protected under international law, it must be reasonable and justified in the circumstances.122 According to the Respondent, it is well established that foreign investors must accept the conditions of the host state as they find them (*The Oscar Chinn Case123*). An investor cannot complain if its business suffers economically from laws or practices that were in place at the time of the investment (*MTD v. Chile,* \u00b6 204). The investor must conduct its business in a reasonable manner, which includes undertaking due diligence with respect to the regulatory environment in which it operates and the likelihood that it may change and evolve (*Parkerings v. Lithuania,* \u00b6 333). Indeed, investors are required to seek relevant professional advice in assessing the risks inherent in a particular host state (*Feldman v. Mexico,* \u00b6\u00b6 114, 132). An investor who fails to conduct such due diligence cannot invoke any legitimate expectations (ECJ jurisprudence). Citing *Maffezini v. Spain124*, the Respondent submits that BITs \"are not insurance policies against bad business judgments (*Maffezini v. Spain,* \u00b6 64).\n\n*Parkerings,* \u00b6 333; *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6\u00b6 304 and 309; *Mondev v. U.S.,* \u00b6 118; *Waste Management v. Mexico II,* \u00b6\u00b6 98-99; *Lauder v. Czech Republic,* \u00b6 292.\n\n*The Oscar Chinn Case*, PCIJ Series A/B No 63 (1934), p. 25.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Award, 13 November 2000 (hereinafter, *\"Maffezini v. Spain\"*).\n\n608.\n\nThe Respondent adds that regulatory change must be anticipated all the more in regulatory environments where there is public and continuous scrutiny of the actions of the state (e.g., *Methanex v. United States*, Part IV D, \u00b6 10, *Glamis Gold v. United States, Chemtura v. Canada*), and in transition or otherwise unstable economies (*Olgu\u00edn v. Paraguay,* \u00b6 65(b),125*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,* \u00b6 20.37,126*Parkerings v. Lithuania,* \u00b6\u00b6 335-338).\n\n*Eudoro Armando Olgu\u00edn v. Republic of Paraguay*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5), Award, 26 July 2001 (hereinafter *\"Olgu\u00edn v. Paraguay\"*).\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9), Award, 16 September 2003 (hereinafter *\"Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine\"*).\n\n609.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, even if an expectation is reasonable, it will not be protected absent specific assurances to the investor. As stated by the tribunal in *Glamis Gold v. United States*, the inquiry is not whether the expectations were reasonable, but whether the State has made specific assurances to the investor in order to induce the investor's investment (*Glamis Gold v. United States,* \u00b6\u00b6 810-811).\n\n610.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that for a breach of legitimate expectations to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard, the investor must have relied on that expectation when it made the investment. The Respondent submits that \"a legitimate expectation is protected only if, and to the extent that, it was the predicate upon which an investment was made. If an expectation, however legitimate, was not the predicate of an investment, there is nothing inequitable in the state's acting against it\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 191). Specifically, \"[w]here an investor claims that it was induced by a particular regulatory measure, it must demonstrate that the existing regulatory framework was the crucial factor in determining whether or not to invest in the host state and that, absent that measure, the investor would not have made the investment\" (*Id*., relying on *CMS v. Argentina,* \u00b6 275).\n\n611.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent contends that it did not make a promise or assurance that could have created a subjective expectation that the Facilities would not change for 10 years (Section (ii) below); any expectation of regulatory stability would have been unreasonable (Section (iii) below), and the Claimants have not proven that they relied on a subjective expectation (Section (iv) below).\n\n**ii. Romania did not make a promise or assurance that could have created a subjective expectation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proven that Romania made a promise or assurance that could have created a subjective expectation that the EGO 24 Facilities would remain unchanged for ten years. Romania never represented to the Claimants, or to anyone else, that the Facilities would be available to them for the entire 10 year period indicated in the PICs (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 113-117; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 169189; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 104-120).\n\n613.\n\nAs discussed in Section A above (umbrella clause), the Respondent denies that the EGO 24 framework gave rise to an actionable vested right to the Facilities for any particular period.127 The Respondent also denies that it made a promise or assurance that could constitute the basis for a legitimate expectation, through the EGO 24 framework or elsewhere.\n\nThe Respondent focused on this argument in the context of the Claimants' umbrella clause claim, but it is also relevant to its defense to the Claimants' legitimate expectations case.\n\n614.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have not proven that the State made a promise specifically to them. There is no evidence that any state organ made such a promise or representation to the Claimants. Nor do the Claimants or their witnesses claim to have received such an assurance from a State official. Mr. Ban's testimony (Tr., Day 9, 22-23 (Juratowitch/Ban)) only serves to highlight this: rather than admit that no one ever told him that the Facilities would be stabilized for 10 years, he stated that no one had explicitly warned him that the Facilities might not last that long. However, relying on *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, the Respondent argues that a state has no duty to warn investors that the law might change.128 Even when a legislative change is sudden and radical, an investor has no claim for a lack of transparency or predictability unless there has been an \"active inducement of a quasicontractual expectation\" (*Glamis Gold v. United States*, \u00b6 799).\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania*, \u00b6 345 (\"The acts and omissions of the Municipality of Vilnius, in particular any failure to advise or warn the claimant of likely or possible changes to Lithuanian law, may be breaches of the Agreement but that does not mean they are inconsistent with the Treaty\").\n\n615.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent notes that Mr. Marcu never said he or anyone else ever spoke to any of the Claimants about EGO 24. In fact, his testimony about the NARD's general efforts to promote investment in disfavored areas showed that those efforts began after the Claimants' supposed decision to invest in the \u015etei-Nucet region, rather than in Bucharest (Tr., Day 7, 49 (Marcu)). The two promotional activities he mentioned in 2000 were not attended by the Claimants, so anything Mr. Marcu may have said there is irrelevant. In any event, Mr. Marcu admitted that EGO 24 had been amended a number of times and that by the time of his presentations the Competition Council had already issued Decision 244. On this basis, the Respondent argues that it is difficult to see how Mr. Marcu could have said in his presentations that every EGO 24 Facility was locked in for 10 years.\n\n616.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proven that, through the EGO 24 framework or the issuance of the PICs, the State made a promise to investors in general. As discussed above, the Respondent argues that general regulation cannot generate a specific commitment of the kind needed to create a legitimate expectation. The Respondent argues:\n\nThe Claimants contend that their legitimate expectation arose from unilateral acts taken by Romania which were general in scope, rather than specific assurances to the Claimants. Also, the Claimants' case relies extremely heavily on the PICs that the Corporate Claimants received in 2000 and 2002 - but they acknowledge that these were not individually negotiated documents. They were standard administrative certifications of eligibility that were received by thousands of beneficiaries of the EGO 24/1998 state aid scheme. The Claimants depend on the same government actions that any of those beneficiaries could cite, such as the terms of executive instruments implementing EGO 24/1998, which as we have seen (Chapter II) were necessarily subject to amendments to EGO 24/1998 itself. Overwhelmingly consistent authority suggests that it must be an extremely rare case when such general legislative acts, and implementing regulations, can generate legitimate expectations that those acts will not be amended in future. (Rejoinder, \u00b6 170).\n\n617.\n\nIn any event, as explained in Section A with respect to the umbrella clause, the Respondent argues that the relevant regulations did not promise that the Facilities would remain unchanged for a period of 10 years.\n\n618.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, if Romania had decided to bind itself to regulatory stasis for 10 years, it would have done so in one clear instrument, through an appropriate organ, and that instrument would contain clear terms with respect to the promise of stability and its duration. However, the Claimants have not identified which regulation would embody this promise. It cannot be EGO 24, because that regulation lays out a general scheme and makes no reference to a 10 year time period. The Respondent concedes that \"there is no doubt that EGO 24 set forth a generalized entitlement that could be claimed by qualifying investors\" (Tr., Day 13, 85:7-10 (Petrochilos)). Article 4(c) of EGO 24 stated that a government decision would determine the facilities \"provided by law\" that would be granted to investors (which confirms that the source of the entitlement is EGO 24). But it contained no promise as to the length of time the facilities would remain available, nor any stabilization language (unlike its predecessor, Law 35, which did contain express stabilization language). The Respondent further argues that, under Romanian law, general laws such as EGO 24 do not confer individual vested rights (as was confirmed by the Romanian Constitutional Court in Decision 130/2003).\n\n619.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants appear to rely on GD 194/1999 and the PICs, which are lower ranking documents issued to implement and administer EGO 24 and Law 20/1999.129 However, relying on the expert opinion of Prof. Baias, it argues that these were subsidiary normative or administrative instruments issued to implement and administer EGO 24 and Law 20/1999, which could not modify or contradict the authority of a government ordinance or a law, and as such could not have granted an entitlement beyond what EGO 24 authorized. In particular, they could not have imposed significant, long-term obligations on the state that the authorizing statute did not impose. As a result of the hierarchy of Romanian laws, the Government, implementing the law through the government decision, could not have bound the legislature not to change the law. And once EGO 24 was modified, GD 194/1999 could not have had a broader field of application than the modified EGO 24. Thus, no prudent investor in Romania could have understood that Annex 2 of GD 194/1999 as freezing the facilities there listed. For the same reason, because EGO 24 created no vested right but only a general entitlement, neither could GD 194/1999 or the PICs create such a vested right.\n\nThe Respondent finds it notable that, considering that the nature of GD 194/1999 and the PICs has become the cornerstone of their expropriation, umbrella clause and fair and equitable treatment cases, Prof. Mihai (the Claimants' own expert in Romanian law) made no mention of either instrument in his expert report. Thus, the Respondent argues that the Claimants are left with no evidence to support an allegation that, under Romanian law, they had a right to the Raw Materials Facility until 2009.\n\n620.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the PICs could have been the source of an investor's right to the EGO 24 incentives. The Respondent argues that the PICs were merely administrative tools that certified the holders' eligibility to obtain the Facilities; the source of the right was EGO 24. Specifically, the Respondent argues that Article 5 of the GD 525/1999 published on 8 July 1999 (Exh. R-6),130 which approved the 1999 Methodological Norms for the application of EGO 24, provided that the \"incentives *provided by the law* shall be granted pursuant to the certificate of the investor in a disadvantaged region\" (emphasis added). Such a certificate was to be issued by the relevant Regional Development Agency, upon an investor's request. According to the Respondent, the language of Article 5 makes it explicit that the PICs merely certified eligibility to \"incentives provided by the law.\" That law was EGO 24, as approved by Law 20, neither of which contained any provision concerning their duration nor any restriction on the government's ability to amend or repeal them.\n\nThe Respondent notes that GD 525/1999 replaced an earlier version of the Methodological Norms, contained in GD 907 of 1998, published on 22 December 1998.\n\n621.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this conclusion was reaffirmed by a subsequent version of the Methodological Norms, adopted by GD 728/2001 (Exh. R-9). Article 4(1) of these Methodological Norms stated: \"The *facilities provided by the law* are granted based on the certificate of the investor in the disfavoured area\" (emphasis added). According to the Respondent, this demonstrates that the content of the facilities was established by law (i.e., EGO 24) and that PICs were an administrative tool attesting to eligibility to access facilities available under EGO 24.\n\n622.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the language of the PICs themselves does not change this conclusion. All the PICs stated was that the titleholder was the beneficiary of the facilities granted under GD 194/1999, in accordance with the provisions of EGO 24 approved and amended by Law 20, and in accordance with the government decision approving the methodological norms. Accordingly, all the PICs did was certify that the titleholder was the beneficiary of the facilities granted by the law, whatever the law determined that those facilities were at any point in time.\n\n623.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the PICs did not list any individual facilities, let alone purport to stabilize them for any particular period. The PICs only stated that they were valid until a given date. That only meant that they certified eligibility to whatever facilities were available under the law until that date.\n\n624.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' argument that the PICs were the source of the right to the facilities because they had to present them every time that they wanted to benefit from them. The PICs were needed so that administrators did not have to evaluate eligibility on each occasion that a business applied for an exemption. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that it was not necessary to obtain a new PIC each time EGO 24 was amended; the PIC continued to certify eligibility to the remaining facilities in EGO 24, as amended. This was confirmed by the Claimants' expert, Prof. Mihai (Tr., Day 5, 215).\n\n625.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the administrative process to qualify for a PIC was equivalent to a contractual negotiation, or that the PICs were tantamount to contracts. In the legal order in which that process occurred, the issuance of a PIC did not create a contract. Nor did the obligation to submit an investment plan amount to a bilateral deal; the investment plan was merely a requirement for the government to establish that investors met the qualifying criteria.\n\n626.\n\nSimilarly, the requirement to employ a certain number of unemployed persons and to have made certain investments were part of the criteria for eligibility; they do not establish the existence of a promise that the facilities would be available for a certain duration. The Respondent adds that it is misleading to suggest that these requirements show that EGO 24 was intended to foster capital intensive industries, because there was no threshold of magnitude for a qualifying investment, the employment requirement was met by employing ten persons, five of which had to be unemployed, and the eligible sectors covered a wide range of activities.\n\n627.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that EGO 24 created an obligation for investors to maintain their investments for twice as long as the investor is a recipient of the incentives. The Respondent alleges that it \"has repeatedly stated that the obligation does not exist and that (therefore) it has no intention of enforcing it\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 118). In any event, it argues that the alleged obligation is of only theoretical interest, because the Claimants have no desire to move the operations from Bihor county, and thus the State has never had the occasion to enforce the alleged obligation. However, it notes that Prof. Mihai did not address this matter in his expert opinion, and the Claimants have not cited any instances in which any investor has been subjected to the supposed obligation, or any Romanian court or agency has interpreted it in that fashion.\n\n628.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that neither the monitoring process to which the Claimants were submitted, nor the alleged promotion of the EGO 24 regime by government officials, could have given rise to a promise that the facilities would remain unchanged for any period of time.\n\n629.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Romanian Constitutional Court disagrees with the Claimants' theory: when the profit tax exemption available under Law 35 of 1991 was repealed, the Constitutional Court found that the repeal of that exemption could not be construed as the termination of a contract, nor as an infringement of the right to property or of the investor's right to recover debt (Decision 130/2003). The Respondent notes that Prof. Mihai called this decision *ultra vires* at the hearing but did not discuss it in his expert report, while Prof. Baias confirmed the decision's relevance for this case. Thus, Romania submits that the Tribunal should afford this decision great weight and conclude that GD 194/1999, alone or together with the PICs, did not constitute a contractual or other obligation under Romanian law.\n\n630.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that not only did Romania not make any specific commitments or representations that the Facilities would remain unchanged during the 10 year period indicated in the PICs, but:\n\n[T]he only indications that Romania offered were to the contrary. Six months before EGO 24/1998 was adopted, Romania publicly committed to harmonize its national law with the acquis, including competition law. This was consistent with the binding provisions of the Europe Agreement, to which Romania had been a party since 1995. Before any PICs were ever issued to the Corporate Claimants, Romania adopted Law 143/1999 on State aid, which expressly indicated that incentives like the Facilities (defined as \"Existing Aid\") could be subject to nullification or modification at any time. Within months after Law 143/1999 came into force, the responsible regulatory authority, the Competition Council, challenged the Facilities' validity in a public decision and, later, in the Romanian courts. Again, this public challenge was underway and reported in the Romanian media before European Drinks received a PIC in June 2000. The Claimants concede that by July 2000, the government had already begun restricting the Facilities, which in itself put all beneficiaries on notice that further modifications could be forthcoming. When Starmill and Multipack were established and obtained PICs in 2002, the European Commission was actively pursuing calls for the abolition of Romania's State aid programs, including specifically the EGO 24/1998 regime, and the dismantling of the Facilities was continuing apace. The PICs clearly reflected the evolution that was underway, and the lack of any undertaking by Romania to stop it: the benefits to be granted under the Facilities expressly depended in part upon the terms of EGO 24/1998 as amended. (R-CM, \u00b6 116).\n\n631.\n\nIn any event, Romania's actions did not create a legitimate expectation that EGO 24 would not be amended, even substantially amended, before 2009 (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 173188). According to the Respondent:\n\n173. The doctrine of legitimate expectations is objective: the question is whether, in all the circumstances, the investor's claimed expectation is reasonable. To answer this, however, one first must know what the supposed subjective expectation was. In their Reply, the Claimants say they expected that \"the Raw Materials Incentive would remain in place until 2009\". However, in their Statement of Claim, the Claimants had asserted that it was the entire suite of EGO 24/1998 state aid that they legitimately expected would remain in force until 2009.\n\n174. Indeed, that is what they must show: there is no logical or evidentiary basis for a supposed expectation that while all other Facilities were subject to change or repeal, the one Facility that the Claimants say they actually cared about had a special reason to remain unchanged. If the Claimants expected one EGO 24/1998 facility to last until 2009, there is no reason why they, and every other beneficiary, could not have expected all of the existing EGO 24/1998 facilities to have remained unchanged. There is no distinction between the Raw Materials Facility and the other Facilities, in terms of the state's conduct or statements with respect to each Facility, that would create a different regime of legitimate expectations.\n\n175. In sum, the position is this. The Claimants are challenging a general legislative programme; if they are right, the repeal of any EGO 24/1998 facility was unfair and inequitable to every actual or prospective beneficiary. The Claimants must show, therefore, that there was a commitment or representation by Romania, binding on future Parliaments, that EGO 24/1998 would not be amended at all.\n\n(R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 173-175)\n\n**iii. Any expectation of regulatory stability would have been unreasonable**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, even if the Claimants had actually believed that the Facilities would remain unchanged for ten years (which the Respondent argues has not been proved), such an expectation would have been unreasonable, and thus irrelevant to the assessment of the fairness of Romania's conduct (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 118126; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 176-189; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 136-159).\n\n633.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent contends that there is no reliable evidence of Messrs. Micula's reasoning. There are no documents, contemporaneous or otherwise, explaining the Claimants' reasoning at the time. The only evidence is the testimony of Messrs. Micula, which is unreliable. In any event, this testimony does not evidence reasonable reliance, but rather unreasonable expectations with no legitimate basis and reckless business conduct.\n\n634.\n\nThe Respondent's main argument is that any expectation that the Facilities would remain unchanged for ten years would have been unreasonable taking into consideration the regulatory framework in which the Facilities were granted, both from a Romanian law and an EU law perspective.\n\n635.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, as a general matter, the Miculas' alleged trust in the stability of Romanian law was misplaced. Ordinarily, an investor must take into account that the legislation will change. There were no representations or assurances that made this case an exception. Nor do the circumstances and context invoked by the Claimants change this basic principle.\n\n636.\n\nIn the context of EU accession, the Respondent argues that this alleged trust in the stability of Romanian law was even more misplaced. By 2000, it was public knowledge that the target date for EU accession was 1 January 2007 (as evidenced in Romania's first Position Paper on competition policy of August 2000, Exh. EC-1). As noted above, the Respondent submits that regulatory change must be anticipated all the more in regulatory environments where there is public and continuous scrutiny of the actions of the state, and in transition or otherwise unstable economies. In this case, the Claimants chose to invest in a transitional economy, and were fully aware of the risks associated with such a choice. Indeed, Mr. Ioan Micula testified that he and his brother were drawn to invest in Romania precisely because they sought to benefit from the rapid changes taking place in the local economy and regulatory system (Second WS of I. Micula, \u00b6 7; Tr. Jur., Day 2, 53-54; 183). Messrs. Micula began to invest in Romania in 1991, and were fully aware of the risks of doing business in Romania during the transition period.\n\n637.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' portrayal of themselves as *ing\u00e9nues* who were oblivious to what was happening around them. Businessmen with substantial activity in Romania like the Miculas can have no excuse for their purported ignorance. It was public knowledge that Romania was undergoing significant regulatory changes to align itself with the *acquis.* Three reports shown during the hearing (Exh. HEC-6, HEC-7 and HER-1) show that over 100 draft laws were initiated (R-PHB, \u00b6 144 and Annex A). The Respondent contends that \"[t]he fact that EU-accession changes would likely include Romania's state aid schemes was a fact readily knowable by anyone who cared to conduct even the most cursory research\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 178).\n\n638.\n\nWith respect to the Facilities in particular, the Respondent contends that it would have been impossible for a rational investor not to perceive the risk that they could change or be withdrawn. Not only had they been changing since they were first enacted, but their continuing viability was seriously in doubt. Even the most optimistic business person would have known that the Facilities' continued existence was the subject of fierce political battle. Indeed, the Respondent submits that \"[g]iven the political and economic environment in 2000 and 2002, when the Claimants obtained their PICs, it would have been impossible for a reasonable investor to expect any particular form of state aid to remain in place and unchanged. The only way one could entertain such an expectation is if the Competition Council or the European Commission had specifically approved EGO 24/1998. Both institutions, however, expressed views that were squarely contrary to any expectation of preservation of the Raw Materials Facility\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 179).\n\n639.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that Decision 244/2000 of the RCC was a clear warning signal that the Facilities were incompatible with Romania's current obligations under the Europe Agreement and future obligations under the EC Treaty. Although the Claimants try to characterize this decision as referring only to the pig farming industry, the Respondent asserts that it refers to the same Raw Materials Incentive and declared the entire aid scheme illegal.\n\n640.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, if the Claimants had conducted any legal due diligence, any com petent lawyer would have advised them that EU accession would likely affect the Facilities. However, it notes that although the Claimants have alleged that they had a legal department of over 30 persons that was allegedly monitoring legislative changes (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6 37), they have been unable to produce any evidence of contemporaneous due diligence on the subject.\n\n641.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, instead, the Miculas recklessly ignored obvious signs that the Facilities could change or be withdrawn. They paid no heed to the 2000 PWC Business Plan section on \"Political Risk\", which highlighted the possibility of legislative or regulatory change, or to all the PWC plans' note that Romania was \"clamping down on incentives\" even as early as 2000. Their attention and belief in the press was selective: when the reports were unfavorable, they simply did not believe them.\n\n642.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimants' suggestions that a particular statement in a government report, standing alone, could have led them to believe that the Facilities would be maintained until or after accession. First, as the Claimants profess ignorance of anything written or published about the future of the Facilities, any such statement is irrelevant, because they did not rely on it. But even if the Claimants had reviewed it, the Respondent contends that a diligent and prudent investor would not have been misled by that statement, because a diligent investor would have known that each country had an independent monitoring authority (R-PHB, \u00b6 156; Tr., Day 6, 127-8 (Petersen/Smith)). Even in the absence of EU requirements, under Romanian law it would have been unreasonable to expect that the Facilities would remain unchanged for any particular period of time. Contrary to the Claimants' allegations, the content and nature of EGO 24 did not make the Claimants' expectation of regulatory stability reasonable. Nor does the content of the PICs or the manner in which they were issued support that alleged expectation. As noted above, the Respondent argues that the PICs were administrative tools certifying eligibility to access facilities available under EGO 24. The source of the facilities was thus EGO 24, not the PICs. The PICs could not reasonably be read as anything more than confirmation that their holder was eligible for the EGO 24 Facilities, whatever those Facilities might happen to be at any particular time. EGO 24 had no stabilization clause or other clause of similar effect (unlike Law 35 which, as amended by Law 57/1993, promised that the changes would only affect investors if they were more favorable). The Claimants argue that there was no possibility of bargaining for a stabilization clause, suggesting that they were not at fault for failing to obtain one, but this cannot mean that the State is therefore impeded from amending its regulations.\n\n643.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that the Claimants repeatedly contradict themselves as to the nature and significance of the PICs. At some points the Claimants assert that the PICs are the allegedly expropriated investment; at other times they state that the PICs \"enhance\" an expectation that has already arisen, while at others they are the instrument creating the expectation. The Claimants also state at that the PICs are administrative documents not subject to a bargain and whose terms were unilaterally imposed, while at other times describing them as akin to contracts. The Respondent submits that \"[i]t is a claimant's burden to set out a coherent claim and then to prove it\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 183).\n\n644.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' remaining arguments with respect to the reasonableness of their expectation.\n\n645.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' trust in the stability of the regulatory framework, based on the alleged stability of previous incentive schemes, was misplaced. Previous incentive regimes had been anything but stable. Indeed, the Claimants' trust seems to stem from the fact that they were not bothered by amendments to previous legislation. However, the Respondent argues that international law does not enshrine an investor's supposed faith that new legislation will always benefit him because he has had good fortune in the past.\n\n646.\n\nSecond, it was unreasonable for the Claimants to believe that if the Facilities were repealed they would get special treatment from the government in the form of grandfathering of benefits.\n\n647.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that the contemporaneous statements and actions by the Government or its officials are not sufficient to make their alleged expectation reasonable. In particular, the Respondent avers that:\n\na. The Government's Development Plan for 1998-2000 (Exh. C-567) does not mention tax customs or customs duty exemptions; it merely places Romania's regional development strategy within the country's general economic reform (the major objective of which was EU accession).\n\nb. Although Mr. Marcu, then President of the body charged with administering EGO 24/1998, would have presumably been knowledgeable about EGO 24/1998, he had no authority to commit Parliament not to amend the law, and thus his statements would not have made the Claimants' alleged expectation reasonable. In addition, his remarks were so informal that there is no contemporaneous evidence of them. In the context of the public debates over the future of the Facilities, no reasonable investor could have taken Mr. Marcu's alleged oral statements as authority committing the state to leave the Facilities in place.\n\nc. Although Mr. Ban alleges that he attended meetings hosted by government officials, he did not testify that those officials said specifically that all of the EGO 24/1998 facilities would remain unchanged, nor did he testify that he held any bilateral discussions with government officials in this regard or received particular assurances. In addition, there is no contemporaneous record of what any official purportedly did say in Mr. Ban's presence, whether at a meeting or otherwise.\n\nd. The generic investment promotion materials cited by the Claimants (e.g. CDROM prepared by ANEIR, a non-governmental trade organization, Exh. C-563) do not highlight EGO 24/1998, nor do they make any representations as to its legislative future.\n\ne. The two media reports (Exh. C-568 and C-630) cited by the Claimants are not attributable to the government, and it is not clear whether the reporters' words are direct quotations or narrative reporting.\n\nf. The June 2002 government press release (Exh. C-489) was issued well after the Claimants' legitimate expectations are said to have arisen, their PICs obtained, and their supposed 10-year plan put into motion. In any event, the press release says the opposite of what the Claimants say it does:\n\nWith view to joining the European Union, we are concerned with making the legislation of the disfavoured areas compatible as concerns the state aid.... The project for a norm to modify the Emergency Ordinance of the Government No. 24/1998 regarding the system of the disfavoured areas [\u2026].\n\ng. The positive assessments of the incentive regime and their businesses by Government officials were not assurances that the Facilities would stay in place. The fact that the withdrawal of the Facilities could have negative social consequences for the region is not a reason to believe they would not be withdrawn. If there were policy reasons for adopting and maintaining the Facilities, a reasonable investor would also have considered that there may be other equally legitimate policies militating against them (e.g., pro-competition policies).\n\n648.\n\nIn any event, relying on *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, the Respondent contends that undocumented and informal remarks by government officials cannot generate legitimate expectations. Nor can road shows or general pronouncements create legitimate expectations on their own: citing *CMS v. Argentina*, the Respondent argues that, at best, such statements are confirmatory evidence of a legitimate expectation created by other, authoritative state actions.\n\n649.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the reasonableness of the Claimants' strategy (making decisions based on how to best run ahead of competitors with respect to customs duties) as the basis of a 20-year business plan is questionable.\n\n650.\n\nIn sum, considering all the circumstances, the Respondent argues that it would have been unreasonable for the Claimants to believe that they were guaranteed anticompetitive advantages until 2009. \"In a legal system where everything was changing, sometimes dramatically, they adopted a fragile business model that depended on the stability of a customs policy and on state aid whose legality was publicly challenged and reported to be the subject of a fierce political battle. That things did not turn out as the Claimants would have wished does not give them a claim under the [BIT]\" (R-PHB, fl159).\n\n**iv. The Claimants have not proven that they relied on a subjective expectation that the facilities would not change for 10 years**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nCiting *CMS v. Argentina*, the Respondent argues that \"[w]here a foreign investor claims that it was induced by a particular regulatory measure, it must normally demonstrate that the existing regulatory framework was the crucial factor in determining whether or not to invest in the host state and that, absent that measure, the investor would not have made the investment.\" It adds that \"a legitimate expectation is protected only if, and to the extent that, it was the predicate upon which an investment was made. If an expectation, however legitimate, was not the predicate of an investment, there is nothing inequitable in the state's acting against it\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 191).\n\n652.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimants are not arguing that, had they known that EGO 24 would change over time, they would not have invested in Romania. Rather, they argue that they would have invested elsewhere in Romania, or in different sectors (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 192).\n\n653.\n\nNonetheless, the premise of the Claimants' case is that when they made the relevant investments, they expected the facilities to remain unchanged at least until 2009. Thus, the Respondent argues that they must prove that they had this subjective expectation at the time of the investments. It is insufficient to establish that they \"relied on\" the facilities that existed at the moment of any particular investment, in the sense that they took advantage of the tax and duty exemptions that were then available.\n\n654.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there is no evidence of that reliance. To the contrary, the evidence available suggests that the Claimants' business decisions had nothing to do with the facilities or their duration. Indeed, the Respondent alleges that there is no contemporaneous record of the Claimants' supposed subjective belief that the EGO 24 facilities would remain in place and unchanged (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 128-135; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 177, 190-217; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 121-135).\n\n655.\n\nFirst, had the Claimants acted in reliance on any legitimate expectation, there would have been abundant contemporaneous evidence of such reliance in the form of business plans, possible press statements, legal advice about duration of the facilities, and decisions of the Corporate Claimants' Boards of Directors. Messrs. Micula's unsubstantiated and self-serving witness statements are not sufficient to prove reliance.\n\n656.\n\nIn particular, there is not a single contemporaneous record of the alleged \"10-year business plan\" to capitalize on the EGO 24 incentives. This is telling given that the Claimants' claim to have had many discussions with their management team and the shareholders and several analyses of market demand and the customs implications of different raw materials. The lack of contemporaneous evidence is also striking given the level of detail of the Claimants' alleged 10-year plan (supposedly consisting of two phases, beginning with food production and moving to \"core capital expenditures\", including a brewery, a malt plant, a canning plant and a co-generation plant).\n\n657.\n\nThe only \"business plans\" submitted by the Claimants do not prove reliance. None of the \"feasibility studies\" for the financing of the proposed investments mentions EGO 24. The 3 PWC business plans for 2000, 2002 and 2003 do not say that the incentives were stabilized for 10 years. To the contrary, they all noted that the government was \"clamping down... on tax incentives\") (Exh. R-215; R-204; R-214). The Miculas' explanation for these plans (that they were valuations prepared for a potential sale of all or part of EFDG) does not make sense: on one hand, it undermines the claim of a 10-year business plan, and on the other, if they truly were prepared for potential sale, the valuations would have included the existence of a 10-year guarantee of the facilities.\n\n658.\n\nIndeed, according to the Respondent, the record suggests that the Miculas made decisions on an *ad hoc* basis, identifying good opportunities for short-term profit (Tr., Day 3, 37; Day 4, 161-163, 174; Day 5, 10 (I. Micula); Day 4, 214 (V. Micula)). Taking immediate advantage of whatever incentives happen to be available does not constitute reliance on a guarantee that those incentives will remain in place and unchanged for 10 years.\n\n659.\n\nSignificantly, the Respondent notes that Viorel Micula confirmed at the hearing that it was not true that the EFDG made sense only if they could count on the benefits of the Raw Materials Incentive for 10 years (Tr., Day 6, 279 (Petrochilos/V. Micula)).\n\n660.\n\nSecond, the Claimants' decision to base their businesses in Romania was motivated by their familiarity with their home country and their desire to profit from the rapid evolution of Romania's economic and regulatory system, not by the facilities (Tr. Jur., Day 2, 23, 32-33, 53-55). Indeed, Messrs. Micula began to develop their food and drinks business in Bihor County in 1991, long before EGO 24 was introduced, long before any of the Corporate Claimants were established, and long before any of the Corporate Claimants had obtained a PIC. When the Claimants invested in the 1990s, they did not even rely on the then-available incentives. Even considering that under Law 35/1991 they could have invested anywhere in Romania, from 1991 to 1998 they chose Bihor County for other reasons.\n\n661.\n\nIn fact, had the Claimants really wanted to establish businesses in Bucharest, as they claim they did, they could have taken advantage of the EGO 24 facilities there as well: there were a half-dozen disfavored areas far closer to Bucharest and the port of Constanza.131 Whatever led the Miculas to install new lines in the same place where they had always located their businesses, it was not EGO 24. If the cost savings of moving closer to their consumers were so significant, the Miculas could have gone to any of three disfavored areas within 90 km of Bucharest and enjoyed both those cost savings and the facilities.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Miculas could have invested in the following regions that were closer to Bucharest and Constanta than Bihor and had been granted disfavored region status for ten years: Com\u00e2ne\u00e7ti, Bac\u00e2u County (Exh. C-412); Baraolt, Covasna County (see Exh. C-414); Filipesti, Prahova County (Exh. C-410); Ceptura, Prahova County (Exh. C-411); Alt\u00e2n Tepe, Tulcea County (Exh. C-415); and Motru-Rovinari, Gorj County (Exh. C-399); Zimnicea, Teleorman County (Exh. C-416) (R-Rejoinder, fn. 345).\n\n662.\n\nThird, the timing of the investments confirms that these investments were not made in reliance of the facilities. The Claimants' investments made prior to the enactment of EGO 24 and the issuance of the PICs could not have been made in reliance on any expectation allegedly generated by the PICs. Starmill and Multipack were only incorporated in 2002, after Romania had begun to limit the facilities (a fact that the Claimants acknowledge, *see* SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 104-109). In addition, all three Corporate Claimants increased their investment activity after 2003, by which time Romania had already restricted or eliminated the Components Facility, the Machinery Facility, the Meat-Related Facility, and the Subsidies. More significantly, the Claimants continued to make substantial investments in Bihor County even after the revocation of the Raw Materials Facility; indeed, the Claimants invested a total of \u20ac182 million after the Raw Materials Facility was repealed (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 128; Tr. Day 8, 69 (Lessard)). Each of the Corporate Claimants allegedly invested millions of Euro in 2005, and continued to invest more in 2007, allegedly pursuing the regional expansion of the EFDG. According to the Respondent, the Claimants continue to expand their economic activity today, boasting of increased turnover in 2006, 2007 and 2008.\n\n663.\n\nFinally, there is no evidence that the Claimants relied on the specific document that they now claim incorporates a 10-year stabilization clause: GD 194. Indeed, the Miculas themselves always refer to EGO 24, which does not specify a period (R-PHB, \u00b6 134).\n\n664.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"[a]ll of this belies any suggestion that Messrs Micula made investment decisions relying upon a belief that the facilities would remain unchanged until 2009. Indeed, the investment expansions in 2005 and thereafter cannot possibly assist the Claimants' legitimate expectations arguments: they espoused, rather than avoided, Romania's regulatory framework\" (R-CM, \u00b6 131).\n\n**c. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**i. The standard to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been breached**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n665.\n\nAs the Respondent puts it, the key issue before the Tribunal is \"who bore the risk of regulatory change: the state or the investors who benefitted from the existing regulatory regime\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 9).\n\n666.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to regulatory stability *per se*. The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect that the legislation will change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation of stability. Thus, the Claimants' \"regulatory stability\" argument must be analyzed in the context of the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations.\n\n667.\n\nCases supporting the doctrine of legitimate expectations are numerous. As noted by Dolzer and Schreuer, the protection of legitimate expectations is by now \"firmly rooted in arbitral practice.\"132 Although the question of whether these legitimate expectations were breached is a factual one, an overwhelming majority of cases supports the contention that, where the investor has acquired rights, or where the state has acted in such a way so as to generate a legitimate expectation in the investor and that investor has relied on that expectation to make its investment, action by the state that reverses or destroys those legitimate expectations will be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and thus give rise to compensation.133\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, p. 134.\n\nSee, e.g., *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6\u00b6 302 (The standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\" is therefore closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of that standard. By virtue of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard included in Article 3.1 the Czech Republic must therefore be regarded as having assumed an obligation to treat foreign investors so as to avoid the frustration of investors' legitimate and reasonable expectations\"); *Tecmed v. Mexico,* \u00b6 154 (where the tribunal found that the obligation to provide \"fair and equitable treatment\" meant \"to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment\"); *CME v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 611 (where the tribunal concluded that the Czech authority \"breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment by evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon with the foreign investor was induced to invest\"); *Waste Management v. Mexico II*, \u00b6 98 (\"In applying [the \u2018fair and equitable treatment'] standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"); *International Thunderbird v. Mexico*, \u00b6 147 (\"[t]he concept of \u2018legitimate expectations' relates, within the context of the NAFTA framework, to a situation where a Contracting Party's conduct creates reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA Party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer damages\")\n\n668.\n\nThe Parties agree that, in order to establish a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation based on an allegation that Romania undermined the Claimants' legitimate expectations, the Claimants must establish that (a) Romania made a promise or assurance, (b) the Claimants relied on that promise or assurance as a matter of fact, and (c) such reliance (and expectation) was reasonable.134 This test is consistent with the elements considered by other international tribunals.135\n\nIn their final briefs, both Parties refer to the reasonableness of the reliance, although Romania at first had focused on the reasonableness of the expectation. In the Tribunal's view, both must be reasonable, but in particular the expectation itself.\n\nFor example, the late Prof. Thomas W\u00e4lde explained that a claim of legitimate expectations required \"an expectation of the investor to be caused by and attributed to the government, backed-up by investment relying on such expectation, requiring the legitimacy of the expectation in terms of the competency of the officials responsible for it and the procedure for issuing it and the reasonableness of the investor in relying on the expectation\" (*International Thunderbird v. Mexico,* Separate Opinion of Thomas W\u00e4lde, 1 December 2005, \u00b6 1). It must be noted that Prof. W\u00e4lde did not dissent on the standard, but rather on the application of that to the facts of the case).\n\n669.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, elements (a) and (c) are related. There must be a promise, assurance or representation attributable to a competent organ or representative of the state, which may be explicit or implicit. The crucial point is whether the state, through statements or conduct, has contributed to the creation of a reasonable expectation, in this case, a representation of regulatory stability. It is irrelevant whether the state in fact wished to commit itself; it is sufficient that it acted in a manner that would reasonably be understood to create such an appearance. The element of reasonableness cannot be separated from the promise, assurance or representation, in particular if the promise is not contained in a contract or is otherwise stated explicitly. Whether a state has created a legitimate expectation in an investor is thus a factual assessment which must be undertaken in consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.\n\n670.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal subscribes to the view of the tribunal in *Duke Energy v.* *Ecuador* (quoted in *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* \u00b6 179):\n\nThe stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor's justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their limitations. To be protected, the investor's expectations must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment [ *Tecmed,* \u00b6 154; *Occidental,* \u00b6 185; *LG&E,* \u00b6 127]. The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest [ *SPP v. Egypt136,* \u00b6 82; *LG&E,* \u00b6\u00b6 127-130; *Tecmed,* \u00b6 154].137\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award, 20 May 1992 (hereinafter *\"SPP v. Egypt\"*).\n\n*Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, \u00b6 340. *See also Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, \u00b6 20.37 (\"it is relevant to consider the vicissitudes of the economy of the state that is host to the investment in determining the investor's legitimate expectations\").\n\n671.\n\nThis promise, assurance or representation may have been issued generally or specifically, but it must have created a specific and reasonable expectation in the investor. That is not to say that a subjective expectation will suffice; that subjective expectation must also have been objectively reasonable. As stated by the *Saluka* tribunal, \"the scope of the Treaty's protection of foreign investment against unfair and inequitable treatment cannot exclusively be determined by foreign investors' subjective motivations and considerations. Their expectations, in order for them to be protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in light of the circumstances.\"138\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 304.\n\n672.\n\nThe Claimants must also have relied on that expectation when they made their investments. However, it is not necessary for the entire investment to have been predicated solely on such expectation. Businessmen do not invest on the basis of one single consideration, no matter how important. In the Tribunal's view, that expectation must be a determining factor in an investor's decision to invest, or in the manner or magnitude of its investments.\n\n673.\n\nWhen the alleged legitimate expectation is one of regulatory stability, the reasonableness of the expectation must take into account the underlying presumption that, absent an assurance to the contrary, a state cannot be expected to freeze its laws and regulations. As noted by the *Saluka* tribunal, \"[n]o investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor's expectations was justified and reasonable, the host state's legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.\"139 Accordingly, for a state to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard by changing the regulatory framework, the investor must have received a legitimate assurance that the relevant laws and regulations would not be changed in his or her respect. By legitimate assurance, the Tribunal refers to the considerations identified in paragraph 669 above.\n\n*Id*, \u00b6 305.\n\n**ii. Did Romania make a promise or assurance that gave rise to a legitimate expectation?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n674.\n\nIn Section A on the umbrella clause, the Tribunal found that the EGO 24 framework, in conjunction with the PICs, created a specific entitlement for the Claimants, according to which they were entitled to receive the incentives until 1 April 2009. To recall, the Tribunal found that EGO 24 created a general scheme of incentives available to investors who fulfilled certain requirements, which were later \"granted\" to qualifying investors through a specific administrative act (the PIC). In other words, the legislation created a generalized entitlement that could be claimed by qualifying investors, but this general entitlement was later crystallized with respect to qualifying investors through the granting of the PICs, becoming from that moment on a specified entitlement with respect to specified investors.\n\n675.\n\nAlthough the majority of the Tribunal found that it had insufficient evidence as to whether that entitlement gave rise to a legal obligation for purposes of the umbrella clause, it stated that the same set of facts could give rise to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, if it found that the EGO 24 framework, in conjunction with the PICs, provided the Claimants with the legitimate expectation that they would be entitled to receive the incentives until 1 April 2009.\n\n676.\n\nAnother question remained open in the majority's analysis of the umbrella clause: whether there was an element of stabilization in the EGO 24 framework (in other words, whether PIC holders (including the Claimants) were entitled to receive the incentives in the same form (or substantially the same form) as when they were first given their PICs during the entire period, regardless of changes in the Romanian legislation). Although the majority of the Tribunal was not able to answer that question as a matter of Romanian law, it will do so now as a matter of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n677.\n\nAfter a review of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Claimants' investment and Romania's enactment of EGO 24 and related legislation, the Tribunal (again by majority140) answers both questions in the affirmative. For the reasons set out below, it finds that, even from an objective standpoint the legislative framework in Romania between the years 1998-2002 (taking into consideration EU law, as it applied to Romania at the time), together with the PICs, instilled in the Claimants a legitimate expectation that they would be entitled to the EGO 24 incentives, in substantially the same form as when they received their PICs, until 1 April 2009. Specifically, the Tribunal finds that, through an interplay of the purpose behind the EGO 24 regime, the legal norms, the PICs, and Romania's conduct, Romania made a representation that created a legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 incentives would be available substantially in the same form as they were initially offered.\n\nArbitrator Abi-Saab does not concur with this view, as expressed in his separate opinion.\n\n678.\n\nFirst, the purpose behind the EGO 24 regime was to attract investment in the disadvantaged areas, preferably long-term investment that created employment. In the context in which this legislation was passed, it is evident that Romania was eager to attract investment in order to boost its economy and work towards EU accession. If Romania had spelled out that it retained the right to elim inate the incentives at its discretion, despite the stated duration term for the incentives, Romania likely would not have achieved its objective of attracting investment. Investors require legal certainty, and Romania knew this full well, otherwise it would not have specified in several different documents that the incentives would be available during the period in which \u015etei-Nucet was declared a disadvantaged area. Indeed, it is evident from Romania's conduct that it intended for the regime to remain in place until 1 April 2009 and, absent the EU's intervention, this is what would have happened, as discussed further below.\n\n679.\n\nSecond, the regime required a certain *quid pro quo* from the investors. As specified in EGO 24 itself and in the Methodological Norms, investors had to fulfill certain requirements to obtain their PIC, and undertook certain obligations:\n\na. Investors were required to create employment. The 2001 Methodological Norms required 10 employees, 5 of which must have been previously unemployed (Article 4(4) of the 2001 Methodological Norms).\n\nb. Investors were required to create new investments. In this regard, Article 6(1) of EGO 24 provided that the facilities would be granted to qualifying investors \"for their new investments in [the disfavoured] regions.\" Only three of the Claimants' companies benefitted from the EGO 24 incentives, but the Claimants have argued (and Romania has not disputed) that for each new investment they had to submit an investment plan and amend their PIC.\n\nc. PIC holders had to undergo substantial monitoring to continue receiving the incentives under their PICs (Articles 14 and 16 of the 1999 Methodological Norms, Articles 6, 8, 14 and 15 of the 2001 Methodological Norms). Indeed, the Claimants' witnesses have described audits and monitoring procedures that seem to go beyond what is provided in the Methodological Norms, but it is not surprising that actual administrative procedures were more detailed than the relevant norms set out. The Respondent has not challenged these descriptions.\n\nd. Investors were required to maintain their investments in the disadvantaged area for at least twice the time they benefitted from the incentives (Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24).\n\n680.\n\nThis last obligation was set out in Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24, as follows:\n\nArt. 7. - If an investment which is benefiting from the provisions of the present Emergency Ordinance is ***voluntarily liquidated in a period of*** ***time shorter than twice the period of time in which they enjoyed the advantages*** granted through the Government Decision to create the underprivileged area, ***the liquidator(s) is/are obligated first to pay the funds related to the advantages*** granted in accordance with the provisions of the present Emergency Ordinance, to the State Budget, the State Social Insurance Budget and the Special Funds Budgets from the funds resulting from the liquidation procedure.\n\nArt. 9. - Businesses established in a disadvantaged area ***may voluntarily cease to operate in the respective area***, and those opening subsidiaries as legal entities in such an area may ***close them or move the location of*** ***their headquarters out of the disadvantaged area in a period shorter than the one provided in Art. 7 only if they pay the funds they owe*** to the State Budget, the State Social Insurance Budget and the Special Funds Budgets ***related to the advantages granted*** in accordance with the provisions of the present Emergency Ordinance. (Emphasis added)\n\n681.\n\nThus, Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24 put investors on notice that, if they planned to benefit from the incentives for the full period they were offered, they had to be prepared to make long-term commitments and investments in the region, and make sure that their investments would continue to be profitable without the incentives when the incentives were no longer available.\n\n682.\n\nThird, the Respondent did not merely \"trim down\" the incentives, as the Respondent contends. It is true that the incentives were amended several times, and that by 2002 the Machinery Incentive had been eliminated and the Raw Materials Incentive could not apply to raw materials for the production, processing and preservation of meat. (The Profit Tax Incentive had also been eliminated but grandfathered for existing PIC holders). However, three of the original six incentives remained (four counting the grandfathered Profit Tax Incentive). These three remaining incentives (other than the Profit Tax Incentive) were eliminated by EGO 94/2004. Therefore, the incentives were virtually eliminated rather than simply modified or amended.\n\n683.\n\nSpecifically, Chapter II, Section 3, Article VI(2) of EGO 94/2004 provided (Exh. R-94):\n\nArt. VI. - Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998 on Less-Favoured Areas, republished in the Official Gazette of Romania, Part I, Issue 545 of 8 November 1999, as subsequently amended and supplemented, shall be amended and supplemented as follows:\n\n1. After paragraph (1) of Article 141 insert a new paragraph, paragraph (11) with the following content:\n\n\"(11) In calculating the intensity of State aid, eligible costs related to investments made before 15 September 2004 shall be taken into account.\"\n\n2. Article 6(1)b)d) and e) shall be repealed within 90 days from the date of entry into force of this Ordinance.\"\n\n684.\n\nAs can be seen from the text of EGO 94/2004, the amendment eliminated the incentives and added rules for the calculation of the intensity of state aid. In turn, it left in place all remaining provisions of the regime, including its obligations, which is however disputed. In turn, this stripped EGO 24 of most of its practical content and reduced almost to nothing its advantages given that the purpose of the regime for disadvantaged areas was to attract investment in exchange for certain tax benefits. After EGO 94/2004, the only tax benefit that remained was the Profit Tax Incentive, and only for existing PIC holders. This is not a \"trimming down\" of the incentives. It was an outright termination.\n\n685.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that Romania's representation that the EGO 24 incentives would be available to PIC holders until 1 April 2009 meant that the Claimants would continue to benefit from substantially the same incentives that were available when the Claimants obtained their PIC.\n\n686.\n\nAs stated above, the Tribunal considers that, in determining whether the Claimants had a legitimate expectation, it must take account of the accepted principle that Romania is free to amend its laws and regulations absent an assurance to the contrary. However, in this case the Tribunal finds that Romania's conduct had included an element of inducement that required Romania to stand by its statements and its conduct. Romania launched a program directed to attract investors to the disfavored regions. To obtain that investment, it offered certain tax benefits for a certain amount of time. In other words, Romania created the appearance of a ten-year tax holiday for investors who decided to invest in the disadvantaged area (and this appearance conformed to what Romania did in fact wish to enact). The Tribunal has noted in particular that the former president of the NARD, Mr. Neculai Liviu Marcu, testified that the incentives were to be understood to be granted for the full duration of the disadvantaged area (WS of Mr. N. Marcu, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32; Tr., Day 7, 15:2-9 (Marcu)). In the Tribunal's view, Romania thereby made a representation that gave rise to the PIC holders' legitimate expectation that during this tax holiday they would receive substantially the same benefits they were offered when they committed their investments.\n\n687.\n\nWhat is at stake is not Romania's regulatory sovereignty, which is not to be questioned. However, it cannot be fair and equitable for a state to offer advantages to investors with the purpose of attracting investment in an otherwise unattractive region, require these investors to maintain their investments in that region for twice the period they receive the investments, and then maintain the formal shell of the regime but eviscerate it of all (or substantially all) content.\n\n688.\n\nThe record shows that Romania itself shared that belief. It did all it could to preserve the incentives regime through its accession negotiations (*see* Section 4 below). Whether or not it felt committed to existing PIC holders, it certainly wished to maintain the regime for as long as possible and publicly stated so. Romania thereby created the legitimate expectation that the regime would not be repealed or fundamentally altered during the duration of each PIC.\n\n689.\n\nRomanian officials also stated that investors would be compensated if the regime were repealed or fundamentally altered. In particular, in his interview in May 2004 (Exh. C-652), Prime Minister Nastase indicated that during its negotiations with the European Union, Romania would see if it was \"able to obtain some transition periods\" for PIC holders, as well as \"some compensation packages, established during direct negotiations.\" The Prime Minister also stated that the government would talk to the investors, and \"based on the conclusions of the negotiations of the Competition Chapter, we will negotiate with those who initially obtained these fiscal incentives\" (Exh. C-652, pp. 7-9 of translation). These statements confirm that Romania itself understood that the EGO 24 regime was to last for 10 years, and that in repealing it prematurely Romania was undermining PIC holders' legitimate expectations and causing them to suffer damages.\n\n**iii. Was this expectation reasonable?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n690.\n\nIn broad terms, the Tribunal will analyze the reasonableness of the Claimants' expectation from two perspectives: (i) the legitimacy of the expectation in the context of Romania's accession to the EU, and (ii) the legitimacy of the expectation under Romanian law.\n\n*(a) Reasonableness in the context of Romania's Accession to the EU*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n691.\n\nAfter a careful review of the record, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that between 1998 and late 2003 it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the EGO 24 incentives were compatible with EU law. The Tribunal agrees with Prof. Dashwood's conclusion that \"a strong case can be made that the Romanian authorities were justified in treating the disputed aid as a valid regional operating aid, up until the moment when they abolished it\" (ER of A. Dashwood \u00b6 55).\n\n692.\n\nThere seems to be no dispute that, throughout the period during which the Claimants received the EGO 24 incentives (that is, from receipt of European Food's TIC in 1999 until the incentives were abolished in February 2005), the EGO 24 scheme was subject to the state aid regime of the Europe Agreement (which was the operative pre-accession treaty; ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 31). As explained by Prof. Dashwood (with no convincing rebuttal by Romania's experts), under the Europe Agreement regime, the substantive rules to assess the compatibility of the EGO 24 incentives with the common market were the substantive rules of the EU state aid regime contained in Article 87 of the EC Treaty (through the operation of Article 64(2) of the Europe Agreement), as amplified by case law and Commission practice, and as subsequently clarified by the Implementing Rules that were annexed to Decision 4/2000 of the Romania-EU Association Committee (Exh. R-65; C-579).\n\n693.\n\nArticle 64 of the Europe Agreement provides in relevant part:\n\n1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Romania: [...] (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.\n\n2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86, and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.\n\n3. The Association Council shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphes 1 and 2.\n\n4. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public aid granted by Romania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic situation of Romania, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of five years. [...]\n\n694.\n\nArticle 64 of the Europe Agreement incorporated Article 87 of the EC Treaty, which is the primary source of the EU's substantive rules on state aid. Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty contains the general principle that \"any aid granted by a Member State or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.\" However, Article 87(3)(a) (which replaced Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community) expressly permitted \"aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment.\"\n\n695.\n\nIn turn, Art. 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement expressly stated that all of Romania would be considered an underdeveloped area for purposes of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty for the first five years after the entry into force of the Europe Agreement:\n\nFor the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public aid granted by Romania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic situation of Romania, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of five years. [...] (Art. 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement).\n\n696.\n\nArticle 64(3) of the Europe Agreement provided that \"[t]he Association Council shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphes 1 and 2.\" With some delay, on 10 April 2001, the EU-Romania Association Council adopted Decision 4/2000 which contained these \"Implementing Rules\", Exh. R-65; C-579), which prescribed the manner in which Article 64 of the Europe Agreement would be implemented by Romania.141\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Implementing Rules also extended the time period in which Romania would be considered an underdeveloped area pursuant to Article 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement:  \n In accordance with and within the limits of Article 64(4)(a) of the Europe Agreement, Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community referred to in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. (Article 4(1) of Decision 4/2000).\n\n697.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the Implementing Rules provided that \"[t]he assessment of compatibility of individual aid awards and programmes with the Europe Agreement, as provided for in Article 1 of these Rules, shall be made on the basis of the criteria arising from the application of the rules of Article 87 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, including the present and future secondary legislation, frameworks, guidelines and other relevant administrative acts in force in the Community, as well as the case law of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice of the European Communities and any decision taken by the Association Council pursuant to Article 4(3).\"\n\n698.\n\nThe criteria applied by the European Commission when examining the Article 87(3)(a) exception were set down in the 1998 Guidelines on Regional Aid (first published in 1998 (Exh. RJ-9) and since replaced by a revised version for the years 2007-2013) (Exh. C-298).\n\n699.\n\nThe Guidelines on Regional Aid distinguished between various types of state aid, and described the circumstances under which certain state aid could be granted, including where the economic situation was extremely unfavorable in relation to the Community as a whole. In such cases, the aid could be granted as tax exemptions. In addition, although operating aid aimed at reducing a firm's current expenses is normally prohibited, the Guidelines recognize that, exceptionally, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 87(3)(a), subject to certain conditions. Specifically, the 1998 EU Guidelines on Regional Aid (RJ-9) provided:\n\nOperating aid\n\n4.15. Regional aid aimed at reducing a firm's current expenses (operating aid) is normally prohibited. Exceptionally, however, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 92(3)(a) provided that (i) it is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development and its nature and (ii) its level is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate (36). It is for the Member State to demonstrate the existence of any handicaps and gauge their importance.\n\n4.16. In the outermost regions qualifying for exemption under Article 92(3)(a) and (c), and in the regions of low population density qualifying either for exemption under Article 92(3)(a) or under 92(3)(c) on the basis of the population density test referred to at point 3.10.4, aid intended partly to offset additional transport costs (37) may be authorised under special conditions (38). It is up to the Member State to prove that such additional costs exist and to determine their amount.\n\n4.17. With the exception of the cases mentioned in point 4.16, operating aid must be both limited in time and progressively reduced. In addition, operating aid intended to promote exports (39) between Member States is ruled out.\n\n700.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Prof. Dashwood that the EGO 24 incentives appeared to meet most of the criteria for regional operating aid set forth in the 1998 Guidelines (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). Specifically:\n\na. EGO 24/1998 was created to contribute to regional development, and there is evidence that it did in fact contribute to such development.\n\nb. The level of disputed aid appears to have been proportional to the handicaps of the disadvantaged areas that the aid was designed to alleviate, and the Romanian government could have been able to demonstrate this.\n\n701.\n\nThe only unsatisfied criterion would be its \"non-degressive character\" (i.e., the fact that the EGO 24 incentives were not meant to be progressive, as mandated by Article 4.17 of the 1998 Guidelines). However, given the level of unemployment in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti area Prof. Dashwood did not consider it a determinative factor (ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 54).\n\n702.\n\nNeither the Respondent nor its experts contested Prof. Dashwood's conclusions persuasively, and the Tribunal finds Prof. Dashwood's assessment reasonable.\n\n703.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concludes that the EGO 24 incentives could have reasonably been thought (both by the Romanian government and the Claimants) to be valid regional operating aid under EU law. Indeed, Romania itself appears to have believed that, at the time EGO 24 was enacted, the incentives were compatible with EU state aid requirements. In its Counter-Memorial, Romania stated:\n\nEspecially given Romania's status as an \u2018underdeveloped area' within the meaning of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, the government could reasonably conclude at the time that the EGO 24/1998 regime was not incompatible with the Europe Agreement's provisions. Furthermore, given the economic dislocation that existed at the time, measures to ameliorate conditions in the disfavoured regions were necessary. Romania was not alone among EU candidate States in making the policy choice to implement new economic-assistance measures based upon such an assessment of the legal position. For example, Poland passed similar legislation authorizing State aid for underdeveloped regions in 1994, while it was a candidate for EU admission (R-CM, \u00b6 29).\n\n704.\n\nSimilarly, in its comments to the Commission's Written Submission, Romania acknowledged that:\n\nThe facilities in EGO 24/1998 appeared to be regional aid for economically disadvantaged areas. Thus, EGO 24/1998 was reasonably considered as falling within the exceptions in Article 87(3)(a) and 87(3)(c) EC Treaty. (Respondent's Comments to the Commission's Written Submission, 16 Nov. 2009, \u00b6 2).\n\n705.\n\nRomania's expert, Prof. Rudolf Streinz confirms the reasonableness of that position:\n\nIn my opinion, in 1998 and particularly in the absence of effective State aid control and support from the European Commission, Romania could, in the exercise of its discretion, reasonably have considered that the EGO 24/1998 regime fell under one of the State aid exceptions of the EC Treaty [...]. For example, Romania, having been designated in its entirety in Article 64(4) of the Europe Agreement as underdeveloped within the meaning of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, could have considered itself permitted to enact EGO 24/1998. EGO 24/1998 provided for State aid to foster economic development of areas - i.e. the whole of Romania - where the standard of living was abnormally low or where there was serious underemployment. Alternatively, Romania might have considered that the State aid granted pursuant to EGO 24/1998 was exempt under Article 87(3)(c), because the regime amounted to assistance of regions which are disadvantaged compared to the national average, based on national criteria (First ER of R. Streinz, \u00b6 19).\n\n706.\n\nAs expressly acknowledged by Romania, many government officials maintained this \"sincere belief\" until after the Competition Council issued Decision 244 in 2000, and the Respondent's expert Mr. Petersen acknowledged that \"Romanian politicians and officials who thought that EGO 24 was legal were incorrect, but they were not unreasonable, and they acted in good faith\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 174, Tr., Day 6, 111, 178). The Tribunal does not believe that investors should be held to a higher standard than the government. Investors are entitled to believe that the government is acting legally.\n\n707.\n\nThe question is when should the Claimants have realized that the incentives were (or became) vulnerable because they contravened EU law and, as a consequence, at what time they might be phased out. As late as June 2002, Romania's \"National Programme for Accession of Romania to the European Union\" (Exh. HEC-7) stated that \"[t]he provisions of the normative acts on facilities granted for \u2018D areas' will be maintained till the moment of Romania's accession to the European Union\" (p. 148). Mr. Orban testified that this was Romania's intention, and that it \"battled a lot with the Commission to get this\" (Tr., Day 8, 219-220 (Orban)). Indeed, when asked when it should have been clear to the public that the facilities would not survive, Mr. Orban testified that it could have been as late as April/May 2004 (Tr., Day 8, 12-14 (Orban)).\n\n*(b) Reasonableness under Romanian law*\n---------------------------------------\n\n708.\n\nDetermining whether the Claimants' expectations were reasonable under Romanian law is less straightforward. On the one hand, the Claimants argue that the purpose of EGO 24 and its enacting legislation, as well as the issuance and content of the PICs, made their expectations reasonable. Romania argues that, to the contrary, nothing in the regulation and the PICs themselves assured the Claimants that the incentives would remain in place for 10 years. However, the Tribunal has already found that the content of the legislation and the PICs themselves gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the incentives would last until 1 April 2009.\n\n709.\n\nOn the other hand, Romania argues that the regulatory framework as it existed at the time of the Claimants' alleged investment in reliance on Romania's assurances (from 2000 to 2004, if the issuance of European Food's PIC is taken as starting point) contemplated the possibility that the incentives could be subject to repeal. Romania argues that the incentives could have been revoked as a matter of general administrative law, or because in 1999, prior to the issuance of the PICs, Romania passed the Competition Law, which allowed the Competition Council to determine whether any existing aid was compatible with the Europe Agreement and, if it was not compatible, to recommend cancellation of such aid and request its repayment (Articles 12-13 of the Competition Law). In Romania's submission, the fact that Romanian legislation allowed the Competition Council to recommend the revocation of the incentives undermines the reasonableness of any expectation that these incentives would remain unchanged for 10 years. Indeed, Romania argues that this is exactly what the Competition Council did with Decision 244/2000.\n\n710.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, two distinct but related issues must be analyzed: (i) the possibility that the incentives would be found incompatible with Romanian law, and (ii) Romania's interaction with the Competition Council with respect to Decision 244/2000.\n\n711.\n\nWith respect to the first point, the Respondent argues that, under the existing regulatory framework, the incentives were inherently subject to the Competition Council's review and possible cancellation. Thus, the fact that the fate of all existing legal aid could depend on a decision by the Competition Council weakens any reasonable belief that any incentives would remain unchanged for any particular period of time. In other words, the Claimants should have known, when they obtained the PICs, that the incentives could be at any time declared by the Competition Council to be incompatible with Romanian law.\n\n712.\n\nThis proposition cannot be sustained. Any piece of legislation must comply with higher ranking norms. That does not change the fact that enacted rules are supposed to be valid and enforceable for so long as they have not been repealed or annulled. Law-abiding actors may not violate enacted laws or regulations because they question their validity or legality: they may know that such validity or legality is debatable, and seek appropriate relief in court or otherwise, but, in the meantime, they must obey the law. Romania has not argued that the incentives were illegal or that there were any doubts as to their legality. In other words, the possibility of cancellation of the incentives by order of the Competition Council is in itself not a valid argument.\n\n713.\n\nWith respect to the second point, on 15 May 2000, the Competition Council issued Decision 244/2000, which recommended that the Raw Materials Incentive be abolished. However, the Romanian Government (with the approval of the judiciary) overruled this decision, and thus confirmed the incentives' legality under Romanian law.\n\n714.\n\nThe Claimants' expectation that the incentives were com patible with Romanian law was particularly reasonable given the sequence of events with respect to the process surrounding Decision 244 and the granting of the Claimants' PICs. Decision 244 was rendered on 15 May 2000, European Food's PIC was issued on 1 June 2000, and EGO 75/2000 (which amended EGO 24 but maintained the Raw Materials Incentive) was enacted on 16 June 2000. The Competition Council brought a law suit against the Government, which the High Court of Cassation dismissed on admissibility grounds on 19 February 2002. Multipack and Starmill's PICs were issued on 17 May 2002.\n\n715.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, given that the Government, in this case through Parliament, did not follow the Competition Council's recommendation to abolish the incentives, and decided instead to confirm them via new legislation (EGO 75/2000), and immediately afterwards issued the Claimants PICs confirming their eligibility for the questioned incentives, it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the Government considered that such incentives were legitimate and intended to maintain them for the stated period. The fact that the Competition Council sought to enforce Decision 244 in Romanian courts and that its action was dismissed by the original and appellate courts, further enhances the notion that the Government (at its legislative and judicial level) endorsed the legitimacy of the incentives. In other words, the Government implicitly confirmed the incentives' legality under Romanian law.\n\n716.\n\nThe fact that the court action was dismissed on admissibility grounds does not change this conclusion. Indeed, by determining that the Competition Council did not have the power to challenge legislative acts, the courts merely confirmed that, as a matter of Romanian law, the existence and legitimacy of the incentives depended on Parliament, not on the Competition Council. And as a matter of Romanian law, the Claimants were entitled to rely on the assumption that the incentives were legal. The fact that Starmill and Multipack received their PICs after the challenge was dismissed further confirms that it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the incentives were legitimate.\n\n717.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the incentives were legal under Romanian law and would be maintained for the full 10 year period.\n\n**iv. Did the Claimants in fact rely on that expectation?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Claimants invested in Bihor County, and that they made use of the incentives. However, it is also evident from the record that their initial investments were not made in reliance on the EGO 24 incentives, because they began to invest in the early 90s, before these incentives were created. Indeed, the Claimants concede that their initial investments were made in reliance on previous incentive regimes (R-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 62-124). The Claimants have also stated that their expectation that the Raw Materials Incentive would be available for 10 years arose when the PICs (or TIC, in the case of European Food) were granted (Tr., Day 12, 91 (Reed)). In the Tribunal's view, a legitimate expectation could only have been crystallized at the time when the Corporate Claimants were granted their permanent investor certificates, not temporary certificates. A temporary certificate is, by its own nature, granted only for a limited time and does not necessarily guarantee that a permanent certificate will be issued. A TIC can give rise to an expectation that its beneficiary is temporarily entitled to some benefits but not that the permanent certificate will actually be issued as the beneficiary will have to prove that, in the meantime, it has satisfied some conditions. Thus, the only investments that could have been made in reliance on that expectation are those made after European Food obtained its PIC in June 2000, and after Starmill and Multipack obtained theirs in May 2002. Whether the Claimants relied on previous incentive programs neither proves their reliance on the EGO 24 incentives nor strengthens their reliance argument.\n\n719.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence that, further to the EGO 24 incentives, there were other reasons why the Miculas invested in Bihor County. The Tribunal recalls that, according to Mr. Viorel Micula's cross-examination, there were other reasons for the Claimants' investment in Bihor apart from the availability of the Raw Materials Facility for the planned 10 year period until 2009. Mr. Viorel Micula testified as follows:\n\nQ. Mr Micula, let's not beat around the bush. I will read out a proposition to you and you tell me if you agree. Your investment in Bihor in the European Food and Drinks Group only made economic sense if you could count on the benefits of the raw materials facility for the planned ten-year period until 2009, is that correct? Is it true to say that your investment makes economic sense only if you have the raw materials facility?\n\nA. It is wrong, Mr Petrochilos. I think no one, either myself or my brother who knew about this leverage had made such a mistake. That would have been a big mistake. Maybe you made that mistake.\n\n(Tr., Day 6, 279 (Petrochilos/V. Micula)).\n\n720.\n\nIn addition, the Micula brothers were born in Bihor County and Ioan Micula conceded that that there was \"a very emotional drive\" behind their business initiative (Tr. Jur., Day 2, 23). However, he also stated that \"it was not just a question of us being born there, it was also a question of long-standing facilities and exemptions that have been there for a very long time and many of them are still there\" (Tr. Jur., Day 2, 54).\n\n721.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, it is clear that (i) not all of the Claimants' investments were predicated on the EGO 24 incentives; and (ii) even when the Claimants' took the EGO 24 incentives into account in making investment decisions, other factors also influenced the Claimants' decisions. However, the Tribunal is satisfied that a significant part of the Claimants' investments (from 2000 to 2004) were made in reliance on the incentives. In particular, the Tribunal is satisfied that the existence of the incentives was one of the reasons for the scale and manner of those investments. It is evident from the record that the Claimants built a large and complex platform for the production of food and drink products, and that its profits depended largely on the reduction of their operating costs resulting from the Raw Materials Incentive (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6\u00b6 44-67, 83-84; Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6 33, 51-52; WS of M. Ban \u00b6 38; WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 12-61; First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 32-42; ER of R. Boulton, Sections 4 and 5; ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6\u00b6 1.11-1.15; Section 4; Exh. C-385, C-987). Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants in fact relied on the incentives to build and develop their investment in the manner in which it stood at the date of the revocation of those incentives.\n\n722.\n\nIt goes without saying that the BIT only protects investments made in reliance on legitimate expectations (*see* paragraphs 667 to 673 above). It does not protect investments made after such an expectation has been destroyed. The Tribunal has found that the Claimants' expectations arose in June 2000, with the granting of European Food's PIC. This expectation was shattered once it became clear that Romania would revoke the incentives without compensation, which, as discussed further below, occurred on 31 August 2004, with the issuance of GO 94/2004. Although Prime Minister Nastase publicly announced the termination of the regime for the first time in January 2004, it was still uncertain at that time whether PIC holders would be compensated (*see* Section 4 below). Accordingly, the BIT can only protect the Claimants' investments made between 1 June 2000 and 31 August 2004.\n\n723.\n\nThe Tribunal does not ignore the fact that the Respondent has challenged the credibility and reliability of the Claimants' witnesses, in particular with respect to the question of whether, in making their investment decisions, the Claimants' relied on an expectation that the incentives would remain in place for 10 years, and with respect to their damages case.\n\n724.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the Respondent's arguments with respect to damages in due course. With respect to Claimants' legitimate expectations, however, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the testimony of the Claimants and their witnesses is unreliable. The key issue before the Tribunal is whether and to what extent the Claimants relied on the EGO 24 incentives to make and develop their investments, and if that reliance was reasonable. It is evident from the documentary record that the Claimants did in fact rely on the EGO 24 regime to expand their business (*see* paragraph 721 above). The Tribunal has also found that the Claimants' expectation that the EGO 24 regime would be in place for 10 years was objectively reasonable. It was also reasonable to rely, at least until 31 August 2004, on the survival of that regime.\n\n725.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Romania violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations with respect to the availability of the EGO 24 incentives.\n\n726.\n\nAlthough the majority of the Tribunal has found a breach of legitimate expectations, in order to provide a complete ruling on Romania's compliance with its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal will address the Parties' remaining arguments with respect to this standard. The Tribunal will next address Romania's defense that it acted reasonably (Section 4 below). It will then address whether Romania acted in bad faith (Section 5 below). Finally, it will address the Claimants' argument that Romania failed to act transparently and consistently (Section 6 below).\n\n**4. Did Romania act unreasonably?**\n------------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nThe Respondent's main defense with respect to the Claimants' fair and equitable treatment and unreasonableness claims is that it acted reasonably when it terminated the EGO 24 incentives regime. It thus argues that it did not engage in what it has called \"substantively improper conduct\", and it should not be made to compensate for reasonable general regulation. Although the Respondent has acknowledged that the Tribunal may find a breach of the BIT if it finds that Romania promised that the incentives would remain unchanged for ten years and the Claimants reasonably relied on that expectation (see paragraph 500 above, Tr., Day 13, 19-43 (King)), the Respondent devoted considerable time and effort to establishing that it acted reasonably.\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimants have not addressed this defense directly in the context of their fair and equitable treatment claim, other than to argue that Romania's subjective motivation is irrelevant to determine if it has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard. However, in the context of their claim for \"impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures\" under the second section of Article 2(3) of the BIT (the \"impairment clause\"), the Claimants also argue that Romania acted unreasonably when it repealed the EGO 24 incentives. When discussing unreasonableness in the context of fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal will thus refer to the arguments made by the Claimants on that issue in the context of the impairment clause.\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n729.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Romania acted unreasonably by:\n\na. Actively promoting and extending the EGO 24 regime and encouraging investors to participate in that scheme (at least until 2003), despite the fact that behind closed doors it was negotiating for the scheme's early termination.\n\nb. Revoking the incentives regime prematurely without being required to do so by any competent legal authority, without attempting to negotiate with the EU or the Claimants to mitigate the damages caused by the revocation, and in contradiction of its repeated statements over the years that the regime was legal and satisfied EU requirements.\n\nc. Revoking the benefits of the incentives regime while maintaining the investors' obligations under that regime (in particular the obligation to maintain the investments for 20 years). In the Claimants' view, \"a government's decision unilaterally to continue to reap the full benefits of a deal with investors while denying those investors the originally-promised benefits is a textbook example of unreasonableness\" (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 459-460; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66).\n\n730.\n\nIn terms of the relevant case authority, the Claimants argue that Romania deprived the Claimants of their legitimate rights under circumstances that are contrary to the rule of law (relying on the ICJ's decision in *ELSI142*). They further contend that there was no factual justification for the withdrawal of the tax exemptions and incentives (*Lauder v. Czech Republic*). In addition, they argue that the reversal of Romania's position upon which the Claimants had relied was not merely surprising but outrageous (*Pope & Talbot*143). Finally, they argue that the measures affecting the Claimants' position were not based on rational decision-making or any consideration of the effects on foreign investments, and did not balance the interests of the state with the burden imposed on Claimants' investments (*LG&E*).\n\n*Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) (United States of America v Italy)*, 20 July 1989 (hereinafter *\"ELSI\"*), [1989] ICJ Reports 15.\n\n*Pope & Tablot Inc v. The Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award in Respect of Darnaqes, 31 May 2002, 41 ILM 1347 (2002), \u00b6 64.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n731.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the central question in this case is whether Romania acted reasonably in amending EGO 24 in August 2004. The Respondent argues that where an investor challenges general legislation that modifies existing general legislation, the question for an international tribunal is whether that legislation is grounded in reason (rather than being arbitrary) and enacted in pursuit of legitimate objectives (rather than for illicit purposes, such as discrimination). The Claimants have not argued that Romania acted in a discriminatory fashion; the question is thus whether Romania acted unreasonably. The Respondent contends that, to show that Romania acted unreasonably, the test is to determine whether, in light of all of the surrounding circumstances, what Romania did was reasonably connected to a rational policy (R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 167-174; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 108-117; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 33-98; Tr., Day 13, 45-50 (King)).\n\n732.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it is the Claimants' burden to prove that Romania's action in withdrawing the facilities was manifestly unreasonable (as stated in *AES v. Hungary*). The Respondent submits that the Claimants have not met that burden. Rather, the Claimants speculate about possible transitional measures or possibly delaying the withdrawal of the facilities, and other things Romania might have done. In the Respondent's view, such speculation is not sufficient to prove that Romania's actions were manifestly unreasonable. The Respondent submits that the Claimants' burden is to prove, not merely that Romania could have made better decisions, but rather that the decisions that it did make were so poor and so arbitrary, that they lacked any reasonable relationship to a rational policy goal.\n\n733.\n\nIn any event, according to the Respondent the record shows that Romania, over a 4 year period of negotiations with the EU, did endeavor to salvage what it could of the EGO 24 facilities. However, the Member States were adamant about the need to eliminate nonconforming state aid, not just by the date of accession but before the negotiations on Chapter 6 (the competition policy chapter of the EU accession negotiations) could be closed and the accession treaty signed. This was especially true of operating aid, and aid that would have been inconsistent with the rules of the customs union, which is what the raw materials exemption would have been.\n\n734.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent argues that (i) its motivation in amending EGO 24 was to comply with EU accession; (ii) it acted reasonably in pursuit of conflicting policies, and (ii) none of the Claimants' contentions about what Romania could or should have done differently proves that Romania acted unreasonably.\n\n**i. The Respondent's motivation in amending EGO 24 was to comply with EU accession**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n735.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its subjective motivation in amending EGO 24 was to address the EC's concerns over state aid. Romania alleges that it gradually repealed the facilities, not irrationally or unreasonably, but in response to increasing pressure from the Commission and the Member States, and in pursuit of the universally accepted national policy priority of joining the EU. According to the Respondent, the facts \"indicate that the measures were based upon a rational decision-making process, related directly to the dual (and competing) policy goals of support for disadvantaged regions and admission to the EU\" (R-CM, \u00b6 173).\n\n736.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent alleges that in 2000, Romania announced that the target for EU accession was 2007, and that was public knowledge. During the next three years, Romania, the Commission and the Member States talked with each other about state aid. The Respondent argues that there was a particular focus on EGO 24, especially once the EU was informed that in May 2000 Romania's Competition Council had found certain facilities to be incompatible with the *acquis* on state aid.\n\n737.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, as a result, Romania began to \"chip away\" at the customs duty exemptions. In 2002, it eliminated the Machinery Facility, and then the meat-related Raw Materials Facility. Also in 2002, it repealed the Profit Tax Exemption but grandfathered it for existing PIC holders. Ultimately Romania managed to persuade the EU to accept the grandfathering of the Profit Tax Exemption.\n\n738.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, by 2004, time was running out if it was to meet its longstanding 1 January 2007 target date for accession. For that to happen, negotiations had to be closed in 2004 and the Accession Treaty had to be signed in 2005. So in June 2004 Romania placed maximum intensity caps on the EGO 24 facilities, but that was not enough for the EU. Finally, in August 2004 the Romanian Parliament passed GO 94/2004, withdrawing the remaining facilities. Romania communicated this fact to the EU in November 2004, and the very next month Chapter 6 was provisionally closed. The revocation of the EGO 24 facilities took effect on 22 February 2005, and two months later Romania and Bulgaria signed the Accession Treaty with the existing member states. Even then, the Accession Treaty imposed on Romania a probationary period regarding state aid, which it did not impose on Bulgaria.\n\n739.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the EU's position was clear: the EGO 24 incentives had to be terminated and, as confirmed by the Commission representatives during the hearing, the Commission and the Member States were inflexible on this point. According to the Respondent, the documentary record demonstrates that the EU insisted on the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive and other types of illegal state aid. It argues that the Claimants' attempt to read the EU documents as leaving room for Romania to maintain the EGO 24 facilities ignores the structure of the accession negotiations. The Respondent points out that in its first Position Paper on competition policy of August 2000, Romania confirmed that it accepted the competition *acquis* in full. In light of Decision 244/2000 of the Competition Council in May 2000, this could not have been reasonably interpreted to mean that Romania believed that EGO 24 complied with the *acquis*. Nor does the fact that the EU did not expressly object to EGO 24 at that time mean that the EU accepted the regime; it merely meant that the EU did not yet know all the details of EGO 24.\n\n740.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that in its Common Position of 2003 (Exh. EC-8) the EU invited Romania to \"bring all incompatible aid measures in line with the *acquis* without delay and to continue to provide information on the progress made towards this goal.\" The Respondent argues that, despite the \"diplomatic language\" used by the EU, the message was strong: Romania must repeal the facilities as promptly as possible. Likewise, the EU's request that Romania \"close incompatible aid schemes for new entrants with immediate effect\" cannot negate other statements that made clear that such schemes must be removed for all beneficiaries. The Commission representatives confirmed at the hearing that EGO 24 had to be terminated immediately both for existing and new entrants.\n\n741.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent argues that EU law is particularly hostile to operating aid in the form of customs duty exemptions. This is because operating aid reduces the recipient's operating costs, creating an artificial (even if temporary) ability to undersell competitors as long as the aid continues to flow. Romania asserts that this was confirmed by the Commission at the hearing (Tr., Day 5, 157-157 (Commission)).\n\n742.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that the Raw Materials Facility is, by its very nature, contrary to the Customs Union, as it would create a hole in the metaphorical wall around the EU created by the Common Customs Tariff. This is illustrated by the Claimants' business model: taking advantage of the Raw Materials Facility enabled the Claimants to purchase their raw materials for a price substantially lower than their competitors outside the disfavored regions. This did not simply lower the cost of operations in the disadvantaged region; it gave the Claimants a chance to become sugar dealers (at least if the Claimants' quantum case is to be believed) by importing far more duty-free sugar than needed for their own operations, minimally processing it, and then selling it outside the disfavored region. According to the Respondent, this is exactly the type of situation that the EU's policies against operating aid are trying to prevent.\n\n**ii. Romania reasonably balanced conflicting policies**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n743.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it reasonably balanced conflicting policies when negotiating the state aid aspects of Chapter 6. Romania states that \"[t]he government, including a majority of Parliament, favoured the policy underlying subsidies for disadvantaged areas. But EU accession was also a crucial policy supported across the government (and among the Romanian people). As the conflict between those two policies became increasingly apparent, Romania had to balance conflicting policy objectives, as must any democratic state in which diverse constituencies pursue divergent interests\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 40). This balancing was made difficult by the differing and sometimes opposing views of various state organs and officials, as exemplified by the differing positions of Mr. Marcu (who was president of the NARD) and Mr. Orban (who was negotiating EU accession).\n\n744.\n\nEven once the legal and political difficulties surrounding EGO 24 had become evident, Romania contends that it actively sought to maintain the facilities. Indeed, it argues that many of its actions during the accession negotiations can be explained by its intention to prolong the facilities as long as possible. According to Mr. Orban, this is why Romania was sometimes slow in providing information to the EU about the EGO 24 regime (Tr., Day 8, 205 (Orban)). This is also why Parliament refused to comply with the Competition Council's decision and why it gradually repealed the facilities in response to new demands by the EU.\n\n745.\n\nThe Respondent argues that whether Romania accurately assessed the EU's position is irrelevant. As Mr. Orban confirmed, Romania acted on the basis of its good-faith understanding of the EU's demands.\n\n746.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that it could not bargain with the EU from a position of strength. It contends that in EU accession negotiations, candidate countries had very little bargaining power, and that this was particularly true of competition policy.\n\n747.\n\nNonetheless, Romania notes that it obtained substantial concessions from the EU to the benefit of investors in the disfavored areas. Specifically, Romania was able to obtain (i) the grandfathering of the Profit Tax Exemption (for a maximum period of three years after accession); (ii) a delay of the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility until February 2005; and (iii) a favorable formula to calculate the maximum state aid intensity that investors could receive, which excluded from the cap aid received prior to 1 January 2001. The Respondent asserts that all of these concessions were very real and useful solutions for many companies.\n\n**iii. None of the Claimants' contentions about what Romania could or should have done differently prove that Romania acted unreasonably**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nThe Respondent denies that Romania could have obtained concessions from the Commission and EU Member States that would have allowed the incentives to remain in place. According to the Respondent, the Claimants must prove that Romania's actions were not reasonably related to its rational policy objectives; it is irrelevant whether Romania got the best possible deal. In the Respondent's view, none of the Claimants' contentions about what Romania could or should have done differently prove that Romania acted unreasonably.\n\n749.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proven that Romania could have maintained the Raw Materials Facility after EU accession. Indeed, the Claimants have not proven that the Raw Materials Facility was legal under Article 87(3) of the EC Treaty. Nor is there any plausible basis to believe that the EU would have granted derogation, and the Claimants have not cited a single comparable instance in which this has happened.\n\n750.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that none of the alternatives to maintaining the Raw Materials Facility suggested by the Claimants (i.e., a delay in the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility, the grandfathering of the Raw Materials Facility, or the payment of compensation to PIC holders) were feasible. The Respondent contends that Romania kept the Raw Materials Facility in place for as long as possible without delaying accession. Mr. Orban testified that the Commission was very displeased when Parliament delayed the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility to February 2005.\n\n751.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent argues that Romania could not have persuaded the EU to agree to grandfather the Raw Materials Facility or agree to other transitional arrangements. Because the Raw Materials Facility constituted incompatible state aid, Romania could not have included it in the list of aid it wished to continue after accession. The Respondent concedes that in its 2001 Common Position the EU invited Romania to submit \"a list of those existing aid measures which the Competition Council considers as compatible with the *acquis* \", stating that \"Romania may continue to operate any aid which is included in the list and against which the Commission has not objected for the period for which the aid was approved by the Competition Council.\" However, Romania argues that by definition it could only include measures that the Competition Council considered compatible, which was not the case for the Raw Materials Facility.\n\n752.\n\nThe Commission confirmed at the hearing that to operate incompatible state aid beyond accession, Romania would have needed a special provision in the Accession Treaty (Tr., Day 5, 90-91 (Gaillard/Commission)). Because the Raw Materials Facility involved an exemption from certain customs duties, grandfathering would have created a hole in the \"wall\" around the Customs Union. Relying on the Commission's testimony, the Respondent contends that, because of the characteristics of the EGO 24 scheme, grandfathering any facility other than the Profit Tax Exemption \"would not have been agreed in the context of accession negotiations\" (Tr., Day 5, 174 (Commission)). An exception was made for the Profit Tax Exemption because it constituted investment aid rather than operating aid.\n\n753.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proven that Romania could (let alone, should) have paid compensation to all PIC holders. As Mr. Orban and the Commission testified, any compensation paid to the beneficiaries of the incentives would have been seen as incompatible state aid, and the Commission would have requested reimbursement (Tr., Day 5, 45-46 (Commission); Day 8, 216217 (Orban)). Thus, the Commission and Member States would not have agreed to the payment of compensation to PIC holders.\n\n754.\n\nEven if the Claimants could prove that Romania could have implemented these alternatives, the Respondent contends that that would not establish a breach of the BIT. For a breach to be established, the Respondent argues that the Claimants must show that the judgments made by Romania were not reasonably related to a legitim ate policy, i.e., that Romania's judgment of how to balance the policies and interests at stake in the accession process was not merely incorrect, but unreasonable. The Respondent denies that the Claimants have proven this.\n\n**c. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n755.\n\nBefore addressing the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal will first summarize the relevant facts to establish whether Romania did indeed act in pursuit of a rational policy, as it asserts (Section (i) below). It will then turn to the question of whether Romania acted reasonably in pursuit of that policy and will review the Claimants' specific allegations of unreasonable conduct (Section (ii) below).\n\n**i. Did Romania act in pursuit of a rational policy?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n756.\n\nAs discussed in paragraphs 691 to 707 above, the Tribunal has found that, given Romania's status as an \"underdeveloped area\" within the meaning of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, it was reasonable for Romania to believe that the EGO 24 incentives could qualify under the operating aid exception contemplated in the 1998 Community Guidelines on Regional Aid.\n\n757.\n\nRomania's conduct suggests that, during the first years of the accession negotiations, this was indeed the belief of a significant part of the Romanian Government. The evolution of the government views on the compatibility of EGO 24 with EU law is described by Romania as follows:\n\nIn August 2000, when Romania submitted its first position paper on competition issues to the EU, most officials (outside the Competition Council) apparently still believed that EGO 24 was legal. When Romania received the Member States' response in October 2000, more Romanian officials began to realise that EGO 24 might be incompatible with EU state aid rules. Even then, there was considerable support for the EGO 24 Facilities outside the Competition Council and the negotiating team. For example, after the Court of Appeal rejected the Competition Council's litigation against EGO 75/2000, Parliament reinstated the one Facility that EGO 75/2000 had eliminated. (R-PHB, \u00b6 175).\n\n758.\n\nThe exchange of position papers between Romania and the EU suggests that there may have been an initial miscommunication as to the nature of the EGO 24 regime.\n\n759.\n\nIn its first Position Paper 6 (Competition Policy) dated August 2000 (Exh. EC-1). Romania stated that it \"accepts the entire *acquis communautaire* in force on 31 December 1999, does not request transition periods or derogations and declares that it will be able to entirely implement it upon accession.\" However, it also stated that:\n\nRegarding the state aid rules and agreeing to the principles provided for in Art. 87 and 88 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, ***it is*** ***necessary to grant state aids to the sensitive sectors of economy and the deprived areas*** due to the difficulties confronting the Romanian economy during the transition to a market economy.\n\nIt is also obvious that, after accession, Romania's development level will not exceed the EU average, and, consequently, ***the whole territory of*** ***Romania will comply with the conditions laid down in Art. 87(3) of the Treaty*** establishing the European Community.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n760.\n\nIn that same Position Paper, Romania provided a description of EGO 24, as amended by EGO 75/2000. However, it did not mention Decision 244/2000 of the Competition Council, which had recommended the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive.\n\n761.\n\nThis suggests that in 2000 Romania believed that the EGO 24 regime was compatible with the *acquis,* or at least that Romania hoped to be able to negotiate to maintain the EGO 24 aid after accession. It may very well be that the \"full acceptance\" of the *acquis* was a classic formula, as Mr. Orban testified (Tr., Day 8, 188-189 (Orban)), but Romania still appears to have been stating that it nonetheless required state aid for deprived areas to continue its economic development, and that it understood that Romania was considered underdeveloped for this purpose. In other words, Romania appeared to have been saying that it believed it fell into the Article 87(3)(a) exception. This conclusion was confirmed by Mr. Orban, who testified that, at the time Romania submitted its first position paper, the Government believed that the EGO 24 facilities were permissible state aid consistent with Romania's obligations under the *acquis*, and thus believed no derogations from the *acquis* would be needed (Tr., Day 8, 188189; 196-197 (Orban)).\n\n762.\n\nRomania argues that, because of the Competition Council's decision in 2000, Romania's acceptance of the *acquis* cannot be reasonably interpreted to mean that Romania believed that the EGO 24 regime complied with the *acquis*. The Tribunal disagrees. First, Romania expressly acknowledges that many government officials maintained the \"sincere belief\" that the EGO 24 regime complied with *acquis* even after the Competition Council issued Decision 244 in 2000 (R-PHB, \u00b6 174). Second, Mr. Orban testified that the Government believed that the EGO 24 regime complied with the *acquis*. Thus, if that belief was unreasonable, then Romania was being unreasonable. Third, the fact that the legislature refused to follow the Competition Council's recommendation and instead confirmed the EGO 24 incentives via new legislation (EGO 75/2000) suggests that the Government (at least as a body even if some of its members possibly disagreed) verily believed that these incentives were compatible with the *acquis*.\n\n763.\n\nMoreover, Romania omitted any mention of the Competition Council's decision in its first Position Paper. This suggests, as one alternative, that Romania did not see the link between the Competition Council decision and EU state aid law (indeed, the decision made no mention of EU state aid rules). Another possible reason was that Romania did not believe it needed to inform the EU of this decision, perhaps because it considered that under domestic law Parliament had overruled that decision. The omission of any mention of the Competition Council's decision could also suggest that Romania preferred not to raise thorny issues with the EU, because it wanted to maintain the incentives. Any of these interpretations suggests that Romania believed that the EGO 24 incentives were compatible with the *acquis*, or at least that it might be able to negotiate to maintain them.\n\n764.\n\nThe EU did not immediately ask Romania to revoke the EGO 24 regime. In its first Common Position (\"EU Common Position 2000\", Exh. EC-2), it underlined that \"the \u2018acquis' under chapter 6, in accordance with the Europe Agreement, has to be applied by Romania already now.\" However, it also invited Romania to \"provide details regarding existing aid measures\", and \"provide a more detailed analysis of the aid facilities in the so-called D-areas\", in particular \"what action, in light of the Community Guidelines on Regional Aid, the Competition Council has taken with regard to the Government Ordinances providing for these aid facilities.\"\n\n765.\n\nIn February 2001, Romania issued a Complementary Position Paper on Chapter 6 (Competition Policy) (Exh. EC-3). In this position paper, Romania provided further information with respect to EGO 24, but, as confirmed by Mr. Orban, not the detailed analysis that the EU had requested (according to Mr. Orban, this detailed analysis was not made until 2004 (Tr., Day 8, 203-204)). Romania also provided a brief summary with respect to the Competition Council's decision of 244/2000 of 8 May 2000, noting that it had been \"overlooked\" by EGO 75/2000, but did not explain whether the Competition Council had assessed EGO 24 in light of the Community Guidelines on Regional Aid. It appears that no such study was ever undertaken (there is none in the record).\n\n766.\n\nIn its next common position (the \"2001 EU Common Position\", Exh. EC-5), the EU's language became stronger:\n\nThe EU further notes that there are a number of existing as well as new incompatible aid schemes which have not been brought into line with the *acquis*. The EU notes that such schemes include in particular [...] facilities provided under Emergency Ordinances no. 24/1998 and 75/2000 in the so-called \"D-areas\". The EU urges Romania to align the existing incompatible aid schemes without delay. (2001 EU Common Position, p. 4)\n\n767.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this request to \"align\" EGO 24 did not imply that EGO 24 necessarily had to be terminated. They further note that the 2001 EU Common Position also invited Romania to draw up a list of existing aid measures that it wished to operate beyond accession. Specifically, the EU stated that:\n\nWith regard to aid which Romania wishes to operate beyond the date of accession, the EU invites Romania to draw up a list of those existing aid measures which the Competition Council considers as compatible with the *acquis*. The EU invites Romania to transmit this list to the Commission; Romania may continue to operate any aid which is included in the list and against which the Commission has not objected for the period for which the aid was approved by the Competition Council. A reference to the existing aid list and to the procedure for its establishment will be included in the Accession Treaty. (2001 EU Common Position, p. 4)\n\n768.\n\nIn view of these statements, it is not evident to the Tribunal that the EU was requesting the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives, and the record shows that it was not evident to Romania either. Mr. Orban testified that it was not necessary for the EU to expressly say that EGO 24 had to be eliminated, because in his opinion \"the first position paper of the Union was very clear: every scheme incompatible with the *acquis* has to be eliminated immediately\", but \"it was the duty of the national authority in the competition policy to exactly define\" what schemes were compatible with the *acquis* and which were not (Tr., Day 8, 212 (Orban)). However, he also confirmed that the Romanian Government continued to enact legislation and regulations that maintained the EGO 24 regime, because the Government still believed it to be a compatible scheme (Tr., Day 8, 213 (Orban)). Mr. Orban also testified that \"it was a gradual process of learning\" for the Romanian Government, that \"a significant number of members of the government were not aware about the requirements of the [accession] process\", that there was a \"lack of expertise\" within the Government, but also \"a certain confidence that Romania would be able to get [...] a lot from the accession process, which finally proved to be wishful thinking\" (Tr., Day 8, 208-209 (Orban)).\n\n769.\n\nBy June 2002, however, Romania apparently understood that the EGO 24 regime constituted incompatible aid, but believed that it could \"align\" it with the *acquis* by converting it into compatible aid. The Romanian Government's \"Report on the progress in preparing for the accession to the European Union September 2001-May 2002\", dated June 2002 (Exh. HEC-6) stated that:\n\nAll existing State aid measures will be assessed, establishing their compatibility with the acquis in order to suggest measures eliminating or transforming the incompatible ones in compatibles aids, taking into account the legal and economic implication of the modification of any incompatible schemes on the already granted specific allocations.\n\nThis approach will be made according to the European Commission recommendation and will take into consideration following three steps: (i) closing the incompatibles schemes in order to stop potential future allocations; (ii) the modification of these scheme[s] to reach the compatibility with the acquis; (iii) the identification of the solutions for the economic agents that received the State aid under the present schemes (e.g. Free areas, deprived areas etc). [...] (p. 132)\n\n770.\n\nMore specifically with respect to EGO 24, it stated that:\n\nRegarding the \"D areas\", the State aid granted in the present ***must to [sic] be converted into a compatible State aid.*** The Ministry of Development and Prognosis started the technical debates with the beneficiary associations in order to identify solutions and to make, in 2 months, proposals for alteration of the present system of facilities. (p. 133. Emphasis added).\n\n771.\n\nAt the same time, Romania's \"National Programme for Accession of Romania to the European Union\" dated June 2002 (Exh. HEC-7) stated that \"[t]he provisions of the normative acts on facilities granted for \u2018D areas' will be maintained till the moment of Romania's accession to the European Union\" (p. 148). Mr. Orban testified that this was Romania's intention, and that it \"battled a lot with the Commission to get this\" (Tr., Day 8, 219-220 (Orban)).\n\n772.\n\nIn November 2002, Romania provided the Commission with Additional Information on Chapter 6 - Competition Policy (Exh. EC-6). With respect to EGO 24, Romania merely informed the Commission that state aid for the D-areas was regulated by Law 621/2001, which approved EGO 75/2000, and explained the amendment to the VAT and the repeal of the profit tax incentive (noting that it had been grandfathered for PIC holders) (*see* paragraph 232 above).\n\n773.\n\nOn 7 April 2003, the Mission of Romania to the EU sent a communication to the Romanian Minister for European Integration and other state officials, including Mr. Orban and Mr. Berinde (Communication No. 1480, Exh. R-93). It stated:\n\nCommunity officials stated clearly that the ***negotiations on this chapter may be closed if, and only if, the following conditions*** (relating primarily to State aid, which was found to have the highest potential to distort the Internal Market) ***are met:*** new aid must comply strictly with the acquis, ***existing aid must be aligned or in the process of being aligned*** (including in terms of duration; the granting of transition periods may be considered depending on the outcomes of discussions between the competent institutions in' Romania and the relevant operators), and ALL cases of non-notified State aid must be analysed and resolved.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe Commission stated that it had asked all of the candidate countries to bring their tax breaks into line with the acquis communautaire, including those granted in Free Zones or ***Less Favoured Areas***, which entails either their withdrawal or their conversion into compatible aid. In the latter case, ***negotiations with a view to converting them into compatible schemes must be pursued directly by the Competition Council with the economic operators concerned.*** Only once this has occurred can the companies for which transition periods may be negotiated with the EU be identified.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n774.\n\nIn its Common Position dated 28 May 2003 (EC-8), the EU's language also became stronger:\n\nThe EU recalls that all fiscal aid provisions, (for example those included in the VAT Law; the ***Law on customs duties exemptions*** - including benefits for transactions undertaken by firms located in industrial parks, free zones and ***disadvantaged areas*** [...]) ***should be subject to the approval by the Competition Council. In cases where the Competition Council assesses the respective measures to be incompatible with the State aid rules, the EU invites Romania to either***  ***end***  ***the measures or to***  ***align***  ***them with the acquis.***\n\nThe EU invites Romania to bring all incompatible aid measures in line with the acquis without delay and to continue to provide information on the progress made towards this goal. [\u2026]\n\nThe EU moreover invites Romania to provide information on individual benefits granted in the free zones and the disadvantaged areas and on any other individual tax benefits that have already been granted and which provide for tax benefits beyond Romania's target date for accession. ***The EU urges Romania to***  ***close***  ***incompatible aid schemes for new entrants with immediate effect.***\n\nIn this context Romania is further invited to present a ***plan outlining how it intends to***  ***convert***  ***the benefits that are incompatible with the acquis***  and to hold further technical consultations with the Commission to explore the possibilities for this conversion.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nWith regard to aid which Romania wishes to operate beyond the date of accession, the EU recalls it's invitation to Romania to draw up a list of those existing aid measures which the Competition Council considers as compatible with the acquis and to transmit this list to the Commission. The EU recalls that Romania may continue to operate any aid which is included in the list and against which the Commission has not objected for the period for which the aid was approved by the Competition Council. A reference to the existing aid list and to the procedure for its establishment will be included in the Accession Treaty.\n\nThe EU recalls that the ***existing aid measures*** are subject in accordance with Article 88(1) of the EC Treaty to the ***appropriate measures procedure***, under which the Commission can, in cooperation with the (future) Member State, propose changes to an aid measure for the future. To the extent that Romania wishes to benefit from this mechanism, the EU invites Romania to present the following to the Commission, every six months as from 1 January 2002, and up until the date of accession:\n\n(a) a list of all existing aid measures (both schemes and ad hoc aid) (i) which have been assessed by the Competition Council and (ii) which it found to be compatible with the *acquis* ; (b) any other information which is essential for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid measures referred to under (a).\n\nDetails on the precise format for this reporting have been provided by the Commission.\n\nThe EU underlines that all aid measures in Romania which are considered State aid according to the acquis and which are not included in this list shall be considered as new aid upon Romania's accession. After that date, application of such an aid measure will be conditional upon Romania's notification of it pursuant to Article 88 of the EC Treaty, and a decision of the Commission that the aid measure in question is compatible with the Common Market. As regards individual aid, no measures which continue to have effects after accession and which are incompatible will be acceptable.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n775.\n\nThe Claimants argue that at this point the EU was still inviting Romania to \"align\" incompatible aid schemes, and the request for immediate termination was only for new entrants. They also argue that Romania could have included the EGO 24 scheme in the list of aid it wished to operate beyond accession.\n\n776.\n\nThe Respondent rejects these interpretations, arguing that, despite the \"diplomatic language\" used by the EU, the message was strong: Romania had to repeal the facilities as promptly as possible. Likewise, the EU's request that Romania \"close incompatible aid schemes for new entrants with immediate effect\" cannot negate other statements that made clear that such schemes had to be removed for all beneficiaries.\n\n777.\n\nAlthough the EU had not expressly ordered, in so many words, that the EGO 24 scheme had to be terminated, at that point the message was clear for Romania. It appears that Romania interpreted that message to be diplomatic in language and adamant in substance. Mr. Orban testified that, from the technical consultations in 2003 \"it was absolutely obvious [...] that for Custom duties exemptions there will be no, not at all, any chance to get, not only a transition period, but we were obliged to stop as soon as possible\", and that \"it was absolutely clear that for such kind of facilities, there is no room for manoeuvre\" (Tr., Day 8, 229-230 (Orban)).\n\n778.\n\nNor could the revocation have been delayed until accession. Asked whether it would have been possible to keep the Raw Materials Facility until the entry into force of the Accession Treaty, Mr. Orban replied \"[m]y clear answer is no. It was a very clear condition formulated by the Commission to stop, to repeal these facilities, the Customs duties exemptions, before the conclusion of the accession negotiation process\" (Tr., Day 8, 232:6-9 (Orban)).\n\n779.\n\nThe Commission representatives confirmed during the hearing that the Commission's message was that the EGO 24 incentives had to be terminated:\n\nDuring the accession negotiations with Romania, the EU [\u2026] made clear through a number of common positions and other documents which we have submitted to this Tribunal that ***Ordinance No. 24/1998 involved illegal state aid and therefore would have to be revoked prior to accession***. In its reaction to this unambiguous position of the EU, Romania proceeded with the successive abolition of the incentives foreseen in the ordinance. (Tr., Day 5, 45 (Commission); Emphasis added)\n\n780.\n\nIndeed, despite the difference in language in the EU's 2003 Common Position, the Commission representatives confirmed at the hearing that EGO 24 had to be terminated immediately both for existing and new entrants:\n\nSo the EU does two things. It says, first of all: end your incompatible aid schemes, and that of course mean[s] also for existing entrants; but then the EU also says: stop them with immediate effect for new entrants, because of course allowing new entrants then creates further problems, deepens further the distortions of competition which arise from the scheme.\n\nSo there are, in fact, several exhortations here. Now, this may all not seem very structured or logical; it's a diplomatic document which set out a number of desiderata that the Union had to formulate at the time towards Romania in the context of the accession negotiation. But I think the overall thrust is quite clear: the EU wanted that the aid scheme for disadvantaged areas be terminated. (Tr., Day 5, 156-157 (Commission))\n\n781.\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Orban's testimony, the record suggests that in early 2004 Romania was still attempting to prolong the incentives until the date of accession or negotiate transitional periods. In particular, in an interview on national television on 12 January 2004 (Exh. C-651), Prime Minister Nastase announced that the EGO 24 regime would be terminated due to EU requirements. However, he also stated that the Government was examining whether some of the incentives would remain in place until 2007, noting that the Government had negotiated some transition periods with the EU and that they were trying to find \"elegant solutions.\" When asked to confirm if certain investors could benefit from the program until 2007, Minister Nastase stated that they would try to negotiate an agreement on that point. When asked what would happen to investors who had invested significant sums, the Minister stated that the Government was negotiating with each investor.\n\n782.\n\nNotably, in its Complementary Position Paper III on Chapter 6 - Competition Policy dated 24 March 2004 (Exh. EC-9), Romania did not state that the EGO 24 regime would be terminated. Instead, it stated that PIC holders would be subject to maximum permitted intensity thresholds. Romania also highlighted that the EGO 24 incentives had been \"significantly diminished\" by the elimination of the Raw Materials Facility for the production, processing and preservation of meat. It also stated that investors who had obtained a PIC prior to 1 July 2003 would benefit from the Profit Tax Incentive, which would be grandfathered for the entire duration of the deprived area.144 This suggests a final attempt by Romania to convince the EU that the EGO 24 incentives could be aligned with the *acquis* without outright termination, or at least that the incentives could be prolonged until the date of accession.\n\nSpecifically, Romania's Complementary Position Paper III on Chapter 6 - Competition Policy dated 24 March 2004 (Exh. EC-9) stated: \"The Ministry of Administration and Interior elaborated a draft law for completing the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the regime of deprived areas. The draft provides that the facilities the undertakings that have an investor certificate and operate in deprived areas benefit from, will be granted below the maximum admitted intensity foreseen in the Regulation on regional aid. At present, the draft normative act is under inter-ministerial endorsement procedure.  \n By entering into force of the Fiscal Code, the fiscal facilities have been significantly diminished. In fact, the undertakings with investor certificate in the deprived areas will benefit from the exemption from the payment of the taxes perceived for changing the destination or removing from the agrarian circuit of certain fields designated to achieving the investment as well as the exemption from the custom duties payment for raw materials and imported components, excepting the import of the raw material for meat production, processing and preserving. Also the undertakings that obtained before 1 July 2003 the permanent certificate of investor in the deprived area, will benefit from exemption from the profit tax payment related to the new investment, during the whole existing duration of the deprived area\" (Emphasis added).\n\n783.\n\nPrime Minister Nastase confirmed this view in public statements. In an interview in Oradea, Bihor County in May 2004 (Exh. C-652), Prime Minister Nastase indicated that ***\"[s]ubsequent to 2007***, when we want to be accepted in the European Union, these disfavored areas will no longer exist in Romania\" (emphasis added). When asked about compensation to investors in those areas, the Prime Minister answered that Romania would discuss these matters during its negotiations with the European Union and they would see if Romania was \"able to obtain some transition periods for them.\" The Prime Minister specified that \"there will be no fiscal incentives, there will be some compensation packages, established during direct negotiations.\" The Prime Minister also stated that the Government would talk to the investors, and \"based on the conclusions of the negotiations of the Competition Chapter, we will negotiate with those who initially obtained these fiscal incentives\" (Exh. C-652, pp. 7-9 of translation).\n\n784.\n\nHowever, by August 2004 Romania must have understood that no transitional periods or compensation packages were possible. On 31 August 2004, through GO 94/2004 (Exh. R-94), Romania repealed Article 6(1)(b)(d) and (e) of EGO 24/1998, thus revoking the incentives provided under EGO 24/1998, including the Raw Materials Incentive, with the exception of the Profit Tax Exemption. The repeal was originally to become effective 90 days from the date of entry into force of GO 94/2004 (that is, on 3 December 2004). However, the date of repeal was subsequently extended to 22 February 2005 by means of Law No. 507/2004 of 22 November 2004 (Exh. C-52), which approved and amended GO 94/2004.\n\n785.\n\nDespite this strict position, Romania obtained certain concessions from the EU to the benefit of investors in the D-areas. Specifically, as previously mentioned, Romania was able to obtain (i) the grandfathering of the Profit Tax Exemption (for a maximum period of three years after accession), (ii) a delay of the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility until February 2005, and (iii) a favourable formula to calculate the maximum state aid intensity that investors could receive, which excluded from the cap aid received prior to 1 January 2001.\n\n786.\n\nFrom the documentary and oral evidence described above, the Tribunal draws two broad conclusions. First, at the beginning of the accession negotiations Romania believed that the EGO 24 incentives were compatible state aid. This belief must have ended at least by 2002, when the Romanian government acknowledged in its report on the progress for accession that the EGO 24 regime constituted incompatible state aid and had to be converted into compatible state aid. However, only in mid-2003 did it become clear to Romania that the incentives must be revoked (see paragraph 777 above). That being said, it appears that by as late as May 2004 Romania still believed that it could negotiate transitional periods or compensation packages.\n\n787.\n\nAs acknowledged by Romania's expert in EU competition law, Mr. Petersen, Romania's belief that the EGO 24 regime constituted compatible state aid was incorrect, but it was not unreasonable:\n\nQ. [D]o you have any opinion on whether Romania thought as of 1999 that EGO 24 was fully compliant with its obligations under the Europe agreement?\n\nA. I have no knowledge about it. But I could understand that they have a certain good faith, I'm not doubting the good faith, because they were pursuing an objective which was definitely in line with the European Community's cohesion objective.\n\nQ. Do you think that view of the Romanian Government as of that time would have been reasonable?\n\nA. As to that policy, yes [...].\n\n(Tr., Day 6, 111 (Smith/Petersen)).\n\n788.\n\nSecond, it is plain that Romania revoked the incentives in order to comply with EU competition regulations and, in particular, to obtain EU accession. Romania would not have been able to sign the Accession Treaty in 2005 if it had not brought the incentives into compliance with EU competition law. Although it is true that there does not appear to have been an official determination from the European Commission that the incentives constituted incompatible state aid, by mid-2003 it should have been quite clear to the Romanian government that the EGO 24 incentives were impermissible state aid under EU standards.\n\n789.\n\nThe EU did not explicitly order the revocation of the incentives in the Common Positions; rather, it requested the *alignment* of incompatible state aid regimes (such as EGO 24). However, Mr. Orban testified that in 2003 it became absolutely clear that this was the EU's position, and this was confirmed by the Commission. Indeed, the Commission confirmed during the hearing that, in its view, EGO 24 constituted incompatible state aid:\n\nEmergency Ordinance 24/1998 involved state aid which was not compatible with EU rules on regional aid. In particular, the various measures did not respect the basic EU rules on eligible costs, which exclude in particular that mere operating costs may not be compensated. Moreover, the limits on maximum aid intensities were not respected either. (Tr., Day 5, 45:10-16 (Commission)).\n\n790.\n\nThe Commission representatives also explained at the hearing that, because the Raw Materials Incentive constituted operating rather than investment aid, it could not have been transformed into compatible aid without substantially changing their nature. In response to questions from the Tribunal, the Commission testified as follows:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: [\u2026] Is there any way to read EGO 24/1998 specifically with respect to the raw material duty, Customs duty exemption which would make it compatible with EU law now?\n\nA. (By PROFESSOR MARTENCZUK) I find that somewhat difficult to see. There are, of course, various grounds in EU law which allow state aid to be declared compatible. These grounds are contained in Articles -- today they are Article 107, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the Treaty on the Function of the European Union; at the material time, they were paragraphs 2 and 3 of 87 of the EC treaty.\n\nEssentially you need to have a legitimate objective. Such a legitimate objective could, of course, be, for instance, to further regional development. The EU has rules under which member states can grant aid to help the regional development of certain defined particularly disadvantaged regions. And presumably many of the regions in Romania that are at issue here qualify as such areas; that's not contested.\n\nHowever, in general the EU, as a matter of competition policy, has formulated limits to that. One of these limits is, for instance, that regional aid should always be granted in the form of investment aid. The reason for that is that it is felt that aid towards investment creates a more durable effect in the development of the underdeveloped region than aid which purely goes towards operating cost. It alleviates an undertaking which otherwise may already be there, and operating maybe inefficiently, of its normal running costs.\n\nIt would seem to me that one of the problems precisely with the exemptions that were at issue here is that they essentially are operating aid: they alleviate the undertaking from operating costs. And therefore I think it would have been very difficult to find a ground on which to find these aids compatible, and that is -- and that also doesn't seem to have been, in the end, pursued in the accession negotiations.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I just want to make clear. You said it would have been very difficult, and I will come back to that question, but much later.\n\nMy question right now is: right now, would it be possible, if the Romanian State just for any reason was to enact right now EGO 24/1998, which would be called EGO something/2010, would there be any way to read it which would make it compatible with the EU law now?\n\nA. (By PROFESSOR MARTENCZUK) Unfortunately I am not here in the company of our competition law experts from DG Competition who might be able to provide more direct expertise on that. But my tentative response would be: probably not.\n\n(Tr., Day 5, 158-160 (Tribunal/Commission)).\n\n791.\n\nIn response to further questions, the Commission added:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: [\u2026] Taking Professor Alexandrov's question [on the possibility of redress for investors], what would have been your answer if -if it had been possible to consider that the goal of the investment was compatible? That is the contrary, I think he said incompatible, and really what I was also interested in is knowing: what if it had been compatible?\n\nA. (By PROFESSOR MARTENCZUK) Well, if the aid scheme by its nature had been such that it was compatible with - or capable of being compatible with EU law, then the correct approach for Romania would have been to include it in the list of compatible existing aid schemes which were adopted at the time of the accession treaty, and which in fact constitutes, if you like, the list of grandfathered existing aid schemes which the Commission sometimes under a number of conditions allows, and which may continue to be applied by Romania without requiring any further -- a new approval by the Commission which would otherwise be necessary.\n\nNow, however, because of the characteristics of the aid scheme, and with the exception of the profit tax exemption, Romania made no -- as far as I am aware, at least, made no such request, and that's why - and probably if it had made such a request, given the characteristics of the scheme, it would not have been agreed in the context of the accession negotiations.\n\nAnd that's why, if you like, these aid schemes did not find themselves on the positive list unless [ *recte:* unlike] other schemes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Such kind of incentive as the Customs duties exemption on the import of raw material, is it totally incompatible with European law, even if it's for disfavoured areas and for a limited duration?\n\nA. (By PROFESSOR MARTENCZUK) I would believe that it would be, I'm at least not aware of any examples of such types of aid. There may be -there may be specific rules, but I would -- that is something I would have to verify for -- there are some more specific regimes for what is called the ultra-peripheral regions of the European Union. This is for instance the DOM-TOM fran\u00e7ais, and so forth. For ultra-peripheral regions --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Angola?\n\nA. (By PROFESSOR MARTENCZUK) For those regions, there are in fact possibilities to grant under more lenient conditions operating aid. I have a suspicion that you might find things there. But that's really just for those specific regions, and the regions that we are talking about here in Romania don't fall under any specific category.\n\n(Tr., Day 5, 173-175 (Tribunal/Commission)).\n\n792.\n\nOther than these last comments, neither in its submission nor at the hearing did the Commission explain why the EGO 24 incentives could not have been covered by an exception to operating aid requirements under the 1998 Community Guidelines on Regional Aid (Exh. RJ-9). As noted above, both sides' experts agree that, as an underdeveloped region in meaning of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, Romania could have been exceptionally allowed to grant operating aid.\n\n793.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot speculate as to why the Commission refused to consider the EGO 24 regime as permissible operating aid under the 1998 Community Guidelines on Regional Aid. The fact is that the EU (in particular, the Commission) wanted the EGO 24 regime terminated, and this termination was made a pre-condition for accession.\n\n794.\n\nIt also seems clear that Romania could not have included the EGO 24 incentives in the list of aid it wished to operate beyond accession. In its 2001 Common Position the EU invited Romania to submit \"a list of those existing aid measures which the Competition Council considers as compatible with the *acquis* \", stating that \"Romania may continue to operate any aid which is included in the list and against which the Commission has not objected for the period for which the aid was approved by the Competition Council.\" It then reiterated this invitation in its 2003 Common Position. However, as is evident from the language of that invitation, for any state aid to be included in this list, it had to be approved by the Competition Council, and such approval was not given for the Raw Materials Incentive. The Commission confirmed that this was probably the reason why Romania had not made this request (Tr., Day 5, 174 (Commission)).\n\n795.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the Substantiation Note accompanying the repeal of the EGO 24 incentives stated that\n\nIn order to meet the criteria in the Community rules on state aid, and also to complete the negotiations under Chapter No. 6 - Policy it is necessary to eliminate all forms of State aid in national legislation incompatible with the *acquis communautaire* in this area and, in this respect, it is proposed to repeal [...] the provisions of Article 6 paragraph (1), letter (b), letter (d) and letter (e) of the Emergency Government Ordinance no. 24/1998 on the disadvantaged areas [\u2026]\n\n(Substantiation Report accompanying EGO 94/2004, 26 August 2004, Exh. R-95, pp. 12-13).\n\n796.\n\nUnder those circumstances, it is clear that Romania was under considerable pressure from the EU to terminate the EGO 24 regime. Thus, there is no doubt in the Tribunal's mind that Romania's repeal of the EGO 24 incentives was motivated by the EU's demands.\n\n**ii. The Claimants' specific allegations of unreasonable conduct**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n797.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the question of whether, in pursuit of its objective to join the EU, Romania acted reasonably and, in that context, will address the Claimants' specific allegations of unreasonable conduct.\n\n*(a) The Claimants' allegation that Romania actively promoted and extended the EGO 24 regime, while at the same time negotiating for the scheme's early termination*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n798.\n\nThe Claimants first argue that Romania acted unreasonably by actively promoting and extending the EGO 24 regime, and (at least until 2003) encouraging investors to participate in that scheme, while at the same time it was negotiating for the scheme's early termination.\n\n799.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects this argument. As discussed above the record shows that, until mid-2003, Romania believed that the incentives were compatible with EU law and believed they could be maintained after accession. The record suggests that, after realizing that the incentives were incompatible aid, Romania tried to maintain the incentives for as long as possible, but there is no evidence to suggest that during that period after mid-2003 it actively promoted the regime. Romania has not been able to establish clearly when or how it began to inform stakeholders that the incentives would be terminated, but Mr. Orban confirmed that the public should have known at least by May 2004. This is consistent with the fact that Prime Minister Nastase announced the termination of the scheme in January and May 2004.\n\n800.\n\nAccordingly, the record shows that Romania did not at the same time promote the EGO 24 regime and seek its early termination. During the time it promoted the regime, it sought to maintain the incentives. After it became clear that this would not be acceptable to the EU, it announced that the incentives would be revoked. Thus, the factual basis for the Claimants' allegation is incorrect.\n\n*(b) The Claimants' allegation that Romania revoked the incentives regime prematurely, without being required to do so by any competent legal authority and without attempting to mitigate damages*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that it was unreasonable for Romania to revoke the incentives regime prematurely without being required to do so by any competent legal authority, without attempting to negotiate with the EU or the Claimants to mitigate the damages caused by the revocation, and in contradiction of its repeated statements over the years that the regime was legal and satisfied EU requirements.\n\n802.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects this argument. Applying the standard enunciated in paragraph 525 above, the Tribunal does not find that Romania acted unreasonably. Romania did not act arbitrarily; to the contrary: it is evident that Romania's repeal of the EGO 24 incentives was done in response to conditions imposed by the EU for accession. It is true that the EU did not explicitly order the revocation of the incentives; rather, it requested the alignment of incompatible state aid regimes (such as EGO 24) with the *acquis*. However, as discussed above, the EU's demand must be interpreted as a request for termination of the incentives as a pre-condition for accession, and Romania understood that sometime in 2003. Thus, the repeal of the EGO 24 incentives was reasonably related to a rational public policy objective (i.e., EU accession), and there was an appropriate correlation between that objective and the measure adopted to achieve it (i.e., the repeal of the EGO 24 incentives). However, as will be seen, it does not follow of necessity that such repeal was fair and equitable to the Claimants.\n\n803.\n\nAs to the Claimants' argument that this termination was not ordered by a \"competent legal authority\", the demands were issued by the Commission on the behalf of the EU itself during accession negotiations. Given Romania's goal of accession, it was not unreasonable for Romania to comply with the EU's demands, even if such demands were not formally issued by a \"competent legal authority\" if that should have been the case. Even if the Claimants were correct as a matter of law that the termination was not ordered by a com petent legal authority, it is not for this Tribunal to decide whether Romania properly understood the point at the time or whether it would have been opportune for Romania to raise the point in its negotiations with the EU.\n\n804.\n\nIndeed, the \"competent legal authority\" appears to have been the Romanian Competition Council, which did in fact recommend the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive in Decision 244/2000. The Claimants (relying on Prof. Dashwood) have argued that, from a procedural standpoint, during the pre-accession regime only Romania (and not the European Commission) had the competence to determine which forms of state aid qualified as permissible state aid (Tr., Day 1, 178-179 (Gaillard); ER of A. Dashwood, \u00b6 25). This appears also to have been the position of the EU, which in its Common Positions repeatedly stated that the determination of whether aid was compatible with the *acquis* depended on the local Competition Council. It is unclear whether Decision 244/2000 was premised on EGO 24's incompatibility with EU law (indeed, the decision makes no mention of EU law at all). However, to the extent that the Claimants argue that Romania eliminated the Raw Materials Incentive without a finding by a \"competent legal authority\", they may be technically incorrect.\n\n805.\n\nWhat matters, however, is that, both at the EU and Romanian levels, there was some exhortation to end the EGO 24 scheme because of its capacity to distort competition. This, in addition to the fact that revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive was a precondition for accession, shows that Romania's decision to repeal the EGO 24 incentives was not irrational, arbitrary, or based on preference. It was a decision logically related to, narrowly tailored, and necessary for, the pursuit of a legitimate and rational policy.\n\n806.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that it was unreasonable for Romania to revoke the incentives without attempting to negotiate with the EU or the Claimants to mitigate the damages caused by the revocation. It is true that there is no convincing evidence that Romania tried to negotiate alternative solutions with the EU, such as a delay in the revocation date, a transition period, or payment of compensation. However, as became abundantly clear at the hearing, it would have been extremely difficult (perhaps even impossible) to obtain agreement from the EU on any of these alternative solutions.\n\n807.\n\nFirst, the EU would not have allowed the revocation to be delayed until the date of accession. The Commission representatives testified that the Commission's unambiguous message was that \"Ordinance No. 24/1998 involved illegal state aid and therefore would have to be revoked ***prior*** to accession\" (Tr., Day 5, 45 (Commission), emphasis added). As mentioned above, when he was asked whether it would have been possible to keep the Raw Materials Facility in place until the entry into force of the Accession Treaty, Mr. Orban replied \"[m]y clear answer is no. It was a very clear condition formulated by the Commission to stop, to repeal these facilities, the Customs duties exemptions, before the conclusion of the accession negotiation process\" (Tr., Day 8, 232 (Orban)). He also testified that the Commission was very displeased when Parliament delayed the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility to February 2005 (*Id.*).\n\n808.\n\nSecond, the EU would not have accepted a transitional period or grandfathering for the Raw Materials Incentive. The Commission confirmed at the hearing that to operate incompatible state aid beyond accession, Romania would have required a special provision in the Accession Treaty itself (Tr., Day 5, 90-91 (Gaillard/Commission)). The Commission also confirmed that, because of the characteristics of the EGO 24 scheme, grandfathering any facility other than the Profit Tax Exemption \"would not have been agreed in the context of accession negotiations\" (Tr., Day 5, 174 (Commission)). As noted above, Mr. Orban testified that, from the technical consultations in 2003 \"it was absolutely obvious [...] that for Custom duties exemptions there will be no, not at all, any chance to get, not only a transition period, but we were obliged to stop as soon as possible\", and that \"it was absolutely clear that for such kind of facilities, there is no room for manoeuvre\" (Tr., Day 8, 229-230 (Orban)).\n\n809.\n\nThere is some logic to the Commission's inflexibility, at least with respect to transition periods beyond accession. The Respondent is right in that, because of the very nature of the Raw Materials Facility, grandfathering it would have created a \"hole in the wall\" around the Customs Union. This would only have been the case after accession, not before. However, the Tribunal is not assessing whether the Commission was being reasonable when it imposed these conditions; the Tribunal's mandate is to determine whether Romania acted reasonably in the factual context in which it found itself.\n\n810.\n\nThird, Mr. Orban and the Commission confirmed very clearly that any compensation paid to PIC holders would have been seen as incompatible state aid, and the Commission would have requested its reimbursement (Tr., Day 5, 45-46 (Commission); Day 8, 216-217 (Orban)). Thus, the Commission and Member States would not have agreed to the payment of compensation to PIC holders.\n\n811.\n\nGiven Romania's uncertain chances to obtain any of these alternative arrangements, its lack or, at least, weakness of bargaining power before the Commission, and the Commission's inflexible stance, the Tribunal does not find that it was unreasonable for Romania to revoke the incentives without making more efforts to maintain them. In addition, a negotiation involves many considerations and trade-offs. It is not for a Tribunal subsequently to second-guess decisions which are within the realm of diplomatic bargaining if there are no objective circumstances allowing and requiring such an evaluation.\n\n812.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds that any contradiction in Romania's statements as to the legitimacy of the EGO 24 regime or its compatibility with EU state aid regulations in the earlier years of the accession process was based on a good faith lack of knowledge and an overly optimistic initial assessment of its bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis the EU.\n\n*(c) The Claimants' allegation that Romania revoked the benefits of the incentives regime for investors, while maintaining the investors' obligations under that regime*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n813.\n\nThe Claimants argue that it was unreasonable for Romania to revoke the benefits of the incentives regime for investors like the Claimants, while preserving the investors' obligations under that regime, in particular the obligation to maintain the investments for twenty years.\n\n814.\n\nThere is some dispute among the parties as to the content and length of this obligation. The Claimants argue that under Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24 (republished version of November 1999, Exh. R-68) investors were required to maintain their investments for twice the period during which they benefitted from the incentives provided under EGO 24. However, relying on Article 1(f) of the 2001 Methodological Norms (GD 728/2001, Exh. R-69), the Claimants argue that the period in which an investor is deemed to have benefitted from the incentives, for purposes of Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24, is calculated as \"the period between the moment when the certificate of investor in the disfavoured area was obtained and the moment when the disfavoured area ceases to exist.\"\n\n815.\n\nBecause Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24 have not been repealed, and because the revocation did not affect the Profit Tax Exemption, the Claimants argue that European Food must maintain its investments until 2018. They argue that this was confirmed by both Prof. Baias and Prof. Mihai. In this respect, the Claimants argue that \"Romania has acted like it did [the Claimants] a big favour by leaving the profit tax exemption in place until 2009, but in reality that was what enabled Romania to keep the obligations on [the Claimants] in place for eight years longer than they would have been otherwise if Romania had simply revoked all the incentives in early 2005.\" As a result, the Claimants \"are effectively hostage in the [\u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti] region and they will be until 2018 or until they go bankrupt\" (Tr., Day 12, 41-43 (Fleuriet)).\n\n816.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Romania is still monitoring their compliance with EGO 24 to this day, and \"still carrying out audits and inspections to make sure that Romania gets its benefit from its side of the bargain in terms of employment\" (Tr., Day 12, 43 (Fleuriet)). In any event, the Claimants argue that, due to the nature of their investments, they cannot simply move them to another area of Romania (Tr., Day 12, 40-44).\n\n817.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Romania argued that it \"has repeatedly stated that the obligation does not exist and that (therefore) it has no intention of enforcing it.\" As the alleged 20-year obligation is non-existent, Romania argues that there is no merit to the Claimants' assertion of unfairness (R-PHB, \u00b6 120).\n\n818.\n\nHowever, Romania took a different position in its closing argument. First, it argued that the Claimants are not hostages in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti region; they can leave whenever they wish. It explained that \"the obligation is to repay the value of exemptions that have been received if a decision is made by an investor voluntarily to leave the deprived area\", and that \"[t]he state is not empowered to force a business to stay in the deprived area, nor does it wish to do so.\" Thus, \"[t]his a business decision to be made by an individual investor\"; \"[i]t is just a money decision\" (Tr., Day 13, 128129 (Petrochilos)).\n\n819.\n\nSecond, relying on Prof. Baias, Romania argued the period for which the investments must be maintained is twice the period in which the investor actually enjoyed the facility, not twice the period between the issuance of the investment certificate and the termination of the designation of the region as disfavored. In this respect, the Respondent noted that the Claimants have conceded that they stopped receiving the Profit Tax Exemption in 2006 (ref. to Tr., Day 12, 42 (Fleuriet)). In any event, the Respondent argued that Claimants' arguments are irrelevant, because the Claimants have never sought to leave Bihor county (as confirmed by Mr. Ban, Tr., Day 9, 13), and thus they have never been threatened by an obligation to repay the benefits they have received (Tr., Day 13, 131-2 (Petrochilos)).\n\n820.\n\nThe Parties agree that the obligations set forth in Articles 7 and 9 of EGO 24 have not been repealed. Despite Romania's initial allegation that the obligation does not exist, Prof. Baias confirmed at the hearing that some form of obligation to maintain investments did indeed exist. His position was that the period for which investors were obliged to stay in the disfavored area was twice the period during which they had actually benefitted from the program (Tr., Day 5, 267-273).\n\n821.\n\nArticles 7 and 9 of EGO 24 provide:\n\nART. 7\n\nIn the situation in which ***an investment*** that benefits [sic] from the provisions under the present expeditious ordinance ***is voluntarily liquidated in a period smaller than double the period in which it had enjoyed the facilities*** granted by the Government decision for the setting up of the deprived zone, ***the liquidator/liquidators shall compulsorily pay***, with priority, to the state budget, to the state social insurance budget and to the special funds budgets ***the amounts of money relating to the facilities*** granted in accordance with the provisions under the present expeditious ordinance, from the amounts of money resulting from the liquidation.\n\nART. 9\n\nThe trading companies set up in a deprived zone ***may voluntarily cease their activity in the respective zone***, and those that open branches with legal personality in such a zone may liquidate them or change their head-office from the deprived zone, ***in a shorter period than the one provided under Art. 7, only under the sanction of paying the debts*** to the state budget, state social insurance budget and special funds budgets, ***relating to the facilities*** granted in accordance with the provisions of the present expeditious ordinance.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n822.\n\nIn turn, Article 1(f) of the 2001 Methodological Norms (GD 728/2001, Exh. R-69) defines:\n\nf) the period in which it benefited from the facilitations granted by the Government Decision designating the area as disfavored, as specified under Art. 7 and 9 of the ordinance - the period between the moment when the certificate of investor in the disfavored area was obtained and the moment when the disfavored area ceases to exist; in the case of the provisional certificate of investor, followed by the procurement of the certificate of investor in disfavored area, the period is calculated from the moment the provisional certificate of investor is obtained until the disfavored area ceases to exist;\n\n823.\n\nProf. Baias insisted that Article 1(f) of the 2001 Methodological Norms contradicted the higher norm, which was Article 7 of EGO 24, and thus in his opinion the 2001 Methodological Norms should be ignored on this point.\n\n824.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that the duration of the Claimants' obligation makes in itself a difference for purposes of assessing the reasonableness of Romania's conduct. The point is that Romania repealed the Raw Materials Incentive while at the same time maintaining all of the Claimants' obligations under the scheme, including the obligation to maintain their investments for twice the period they received the incentives, or twice the period between the issuance of the certificate and the end of period in which the region is designated as disfavored, depending on the interpretation. The Tribunal finds that either scenario is unreasonable. The obligation to maintain investments had no rational justification after the incentives were terminated. The survival of the Profit Tax Exemption is not sufficient justification for the maintenance of investments made in reliance on the legitimate expectation that customs duties exemptions such as the Raw Materials Incentive would be available, just as the Profit Tax Exemption would not have been sufficiently attractive on its own to encourage investment in the disfavored region. Indeed, the maintenance of the Profit Tax Exemption ensured that, despite the absence of the Raw Materials Incentive, the Claimants would continue to be tied to the EGO 24 regime for as long as they made a profit. And, as the Claimants argue, the Profit Tax Exemption would have been useless for companies not making a profit, which could easily have been the case for businesses premised on the existence of operating aid such as the Raw Materials Incentive.\n\n**iii. Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n825.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal finds that, with one exception, Romania did not act unreasonably. Romania's decision to revoke the incentives was reasonably tailored to the pursuit of a rational policy (specifically, EU accession), and there was an appropriate correlation between that objective and the measure adopted to achieve it (i.e., the repeal of the EGO 24 incentives). The question is whether Romania could have negotiated a transition period for the incentives or their conversion into compatible aid. However, even if it could have done more, but failed to do so, objectively speaking the Tribunal does not find that it acted unreasonably. Even if Romania could have done more to maintain the incentives, its failure to negotiate transitional periods or compensation was not arbitrary, but appears justified under the specific circumstances of the accession negotiations.\n\n826.\n\nThe exception to this conclusion was Romania's decision to maintain the investors' obligations despite the repeal of the incentives. It is not for this Tribunal to say what would have been the right decision (i.e., possibly shortening the period or diminishing in other ways the obligations imposed upon the investors), but it was not reasonable for Romania to maintain as a whole the investors' obligations while at the same time eliminating virtually all of their benefits.\n\n827.\n\nIn other words, with the exception noted in the preceding paragraph, Romania's repeal of the incentives was a reasonable action in pursuit of a rational policy. That being said, this conclusion does not detract from the Tribunal's holding in Section 3(c) above that Romania undermined the Claimants' legitimate expectations with respect to the continued availability of the incentives until 1 April 2009. As a result, Romania's actions, although for the most part appropriately and narrowly tailored in pursuit of a rational policy, were unfair or inequitable vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants. In addition, the Tribunal finds that Romania could have been more transparent with PIC holders, as discussed in Section 6 below.\n\n**5. Did Romania act in bad faith?**\n------------------------------------\n\n828.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Claimants' arguments on bad faith.\n\n**a. The Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n829.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Romania breached its fair and equitable treatment obligation by acting in bad faith when it repealed the EGO 24 incentives. Specifically, the Claimants argue that \"Romania acted in bad faith by (1) reneging on its oftrepeated defense of the legality of the incentives regime within the EU accession framework by ultimately revoking the incentives prematurely without a decision from any competent legal authority requiring it to do so; (2) neglecting to negotiate with the EU in order to secure an exception to any potentially-violated State aid rules; (3) failing to negotiate with Claimants in order to protect them from premature revocation of the incentives regime via measures that would be acceptable to the EU; and (4) reaping the benefits from Claimants' investments in the Stei-Nucet-Dragane\u015fti disadvantaged region, and in particular accepting fulfillment of Claimants' various obligations under the incentives program as described above, before revoking the incentives four years before the promised date, refusing to compensate Claimants, and thereby failing to fulfill its own obligations under the program\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 449).\n\n830.\n\nThe Respondent does not directly address the Claimants' arguments on bad faith. However, the Tribunal presumes that the Respondent's arguments as to the reasonableness of its actions (as discussed in Section 4 above) are applicable.\n\n**b. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n831.\n\nGood faith is a standard that is flexible. A requirement of good faith is prevalent in all fields of the law and will arise in various matters, such as the interpretation of treaties (Article 31 of the VLCT), the prohibition to abuse rights, and the protection of legitimate expectations. As such, it eludes any strict definition. However, as a minimum, good faith would require that any party would not consciously conduct itself in such a way that should contradict the implications of that party's earlier behavior, a concept akin to the prohibition of estoppel.\n\n832.\n\nThe concept of bad faith is likewise difficult to define with precision. Black's Law Dictionary defines bad faith as \"dishonesty of belief or purpose.\"145 The commentary to Section 205 of the American Law Institute's *Restatement (Second) of Contracts* (1981) states with respect to good faith in the performance of an obligation:\n\n*d. Good faith performance*. Subterfuges and evasions violate the obligation of good faith in performance even though the actor believes his conduct to be justified. But the obligation goes further: bad faith may be overt or may consist of inaction, and fair dealing may require more than honesty. A complete catalogue of types of bad faith is impossible, but the following types are among those which have been recognized in judicial decisions: evasion of the spirit of the bargain, lack of diligence and slacking off, willful rendering of imperfect performance, abuse of a power to specify terms, and interference with or failure to cooperate in the other party's performance.146\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition (2009), p. 159.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 205 cmt. d (1981).\n\n833.\n\nIn the treaty context, Bin Cheng notes that \"[t]he principle that treaty obligations should be fulfilled in good faith and not merely in accordance with the letter of the treaty has long been recognised by international tribunals and is reaffirmed by the United Nations as an \u2018act of faith.'\"147 Similarly, citing a string of investment arbitration cases, the *Europe Cement* tribunal noted that \"it is well accepted in investment arbitrations that the principle of good faith is a principle of international law applicable to the interpretation and application of obligations under international investment agreements.\"148\n\nBin Cheng, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts Tribunals (1953, 2006), p. 114.\n\n*Europe Cement Investment & Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2), Award, 13 August 2009 (hereinafter *\"Europe Cement v. Turkey\" or \"Europe Cement\"),* \u00b6 171, citing *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Award, 20 November 1984; *Plama v. Bulgaria* ; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26), Award, 2 August 2006; *Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award, 15 April 2009.\n\n834.\n\nAccording to Bin Cheng, \"[p]erformance of a treaty obligation in good faith means carrying out the substance of this mutual understanding honestly and loyally.\"149 International investment tribunals confirm this interpretation. For instance, in *Canfor and Terminal Forest v. USA*, the tribunal stated that \"a fundamental principle of international law that States Party to a treaty must perform treaty obligations in good faith and, therefore, would not intentionally take steps that would undermine performance of those obligations.\"150 Similarly, the *Waste Management II* tribunal held that \"[a] basic obligation of the State under Article 1105(1) [which sets out NAFTA's minimum standard of treatment] is to act in good faith and form, and not deliberately to set out to destroy or frustrate the investment by improper means.\"151\n\nBin Cheng, p. 115.\n\n*Canfor Corporation v. United States of America, Tembec Inc. et. al. v. United States of America* and *Terminal Forest Products Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Decision of on Preliminary Question, 6 June 2006.\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II*, \u00b6 138.\n\n835.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' allegations of bad faith are virtually identical to their arguments with respect to Romania's allegedly unreasonable conduct. The Tribunal understands that the difference between both sets of allegations is that the Claimants are arguing here that not only was Romania's conduct unreasonable (i.e., not justified by the reasonably tailored pursuit of a rational objective), but that it was intentional or at least conscious in its unreasonableness.\n\n836.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that Romania's conduct was, with one exception, a reasonable action in pursuit of a rational policy. But even with respect to that one exception (maintaining investors' obligations after term inating the incentives), the record does not include any indication that Romania acted in bad faith. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects this argument.\n\n**6. Did Romania fail to act transparently or consistently?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n837.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Claimants' allegation that Romania failed to act transparently or consistently.\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n838.\n\nIn addition to failing to provide stability of the legal framework and violating their legitimate expectations, the Claimants argue that Romania breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment by acting in a manner that was not transparent or consistent (C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 229-241; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 440-442; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 51-62). The Claimants argue that this was acknowledged by Romania's own witness, Mr. Orban (Tr., Day 8, 208-209, 221 (Orban)).\n\n839.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants contend that Romania acted in a manner that was not transparent by actively pursuing two conflicting policies: on one hand, it promoted the EGO 24 incentives, and at the same time it negotiated their revocation behind closed doors. The Claimants allege that, at least until 2003, Romania actively promoted and supported the EGO 24 regime (as evidenced by the Government and Parliament's disagreement with the Competition Council on Decision 244 and the adoption of the Methodological Norms). However, at the same time Romania was secretly negotiating the revocation of these incentives. The Claimants also assert that there is no evidence that the government met with the Claimants to inform them that the incentives were likely to be prematurely revoked.\n\n840.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that Romania acted inconsistently when it repeatedly proclaimed that the incentives were compatible with the requirements of the *acquis*, but ultimately decided to revoke them prematurely based on their alleged incompatibility with those same requirements. The Claimants also allege that officials within the Romanian government took inconsistent positions with respect to the compatibility of EGO 24 with EU law. According to the Claimants, as explained above the evidence suggests that until 2004 Romania thought that EGO 24 was permissible state aid under EU law.\n\n841.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that the manner in which Romania revoked the incentives created uncertainty. The Claimants state that the incentives were subject to a string of contradictory measures that repealed some of the incentives, partially reintroduced some of them, and then repealed them again. In particular, the Claimants note that Romania repealed the incentives from EGO 24, but it did not amend GD 194/1999, which states that investors in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti region will benefit from the incentives for ten years. The Claimants argue that this led to insecurity and confusion, and as a result the investors could not plan their business in a rational way.\n\n842.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants contend that Romania did not align its measures with the various goals and policies behind EGO 24 and similar incentives programs granted to investors over the years (which pursued the goals of attracting capital, reducing unemployment, etc). In that context, the Claimants invoke *Tecmed*, as quoted in paragraph 534 above.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n843.\n\nThe Respondent denies that Romania treated the Claimants' investments in an inconsistent and non-transparent manner (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 160-184).\n\n844.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent understands that the transparency and consistency \"strand\" of the fair and equitable treatment standard requires Romania to comply with due process and fair administration. In particular, it means that Romania should conduct itself in such a way that investors are able to find out what the rules are and how to comply with them, and the rules should be administered in an even handed and reasonably consistent fashion.\n\n845.\n\nHowever, the Respondent argues that the situation here is different. The Claimants do not contend that Romania was unclear about the rules and procedures they had to follow, or that the rules were applied inconsistently. Rather, the Claimants contend that they were not given enough information about ongoing diplomatic negotiations. According to the Respondent, international investment law does not require a state to disclose its assessment of the likely outcome of such negotiations. As a result, the Respondent argues that \"the Claimants' contentions are not only irrelevant as a matter of law but illogical as a matter of fact: if, as the Claimants seemed to suggest at the hearing, Romania should have publicly announced at the earliest possible date that it did not expect to obtain the EU's agreement to continue the EGO Facilities in force, the only possible difference is that the Claimants would have lost the benefit of the Facilities sooner\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 161). Likewise, the Respondent argues that there is no need to warn investors of legislative changes (*Parkerings*, \u00b6 345).\n\n846.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants' consistency and transparency allegations fail on the evidence. It asserts that Romania's conduct \"was entirely fair and reasonable, particularly in a context in which its negotiating partners insisted on a degree of confidentiality and there were\u2014legitimately and unsurprisingly\u2014differing views among different government officials and constituencies as to the best approaches and the most likely outcomes\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 162). In any case, the Respondent argues that the Claimants knew or should have known (given their duty to conduct due diligence, and given their alleged strong political connections) that the future of the facilities was uncertain. The Respondent also denies that the Claimants were in fact misled by any of the supposedly inconsistent or non-transparent Government statements or omissions.\n\n847.\n\nMore specifically, Romania argues that (i) its balancing of confidentiality and openness was reasonable, (ii) it complied with any standard of consistency or transparency that could reasonably be imposed in the context of complex or politically sensitive legislation and negotiation, and (iii) it was common knowledge that the facilities were vulnerable.\n\n**i. Romania's balancing of confidentiality and openness was reasonable**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n848.\n\nRomania asserts that some measure of confidentiality and discretion was necessary during the accession negotiations. Romania alleges that this discretion was important \"if Romania was to have any hope of obtaining transitional provisions or delayed repeal of the Facilities\", but also to comply with confidentiality conditions imposed by the EU. In this regard, Mr. Orban testified that\n\nWe tried to inform as much as possible, but in a discreet way, because we were bound by the clear conditions of conducting accession negotiation process not to express publicly some of the conclusions which were already derived at that time from the negotiations with the Union (Tr., Day 8, 233 (Orban)).\n\n849.\n\nDespite the confidentiality constraints imposed by the EU and the need to protect its bargaining position, Romania argues that it pursued a policy of openness. It asserts that the government disseminated information about its progress through governmental websites, the Official Gazette and national media, including detailed reports on the country's progress towards accession. Although the Claimants may criticize the way Romania made information available, Romania contends that the legislative process need not be perfect nor perfectly transparent (*AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6 9.3.73).\n\n850.\n\nRelying on Mr. Orban's testimony, the Respondent argues that \"from the technical consultations in 2003, it was absolutely clear that for such kind of facilities [customs duty exemptions] there is no room for manoeuvre\" (Tr., Day 8, 229-230 (Orban)). This conclusion was announced gradually rather than immediately to different stakeholders (mainly through non-public discussions) because Romania was \"not in a position to make a public statement\" (Tr., Day 8, 230 (Orban)). Romania argues that, as the EU's opposition to the facilities became increasingly apparent, Romania \"sought to convey this information to stakeholders in a way that would not undermine its negotiating position with the Commission and Member States\" (Tr., Day 8, 223-224 (Orban)).\n\n851.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent asserts that the Competition Council organized extensive discussions with stakeholders and provided them with copies of state aid documents, such as the EU guidelines on regional aid. With respect to the Claimants' suggestion that the Miculas had not been included in these discussions, Romania argues that it is implausible that businessmen with the Miculas' level of political access and experience could have been deprived of information made available to smaller stakeholders, or that they would not have insisted on being privy to that information. The Respondent notes that the Miculas have boasted about their political connections, and argues that the Romanian government has been responsive to the Miculas' concerns in the past (citing as an example the Parmalat affair, where it alleges that the Miculas were able to use their political influence to overturn a court judgment that was against their interests). Indeed, given the Claimants own testimony about frequent contacts with government officials, Romania argues that the Claimants cannot prove that they were excluded from the consultative process. In any event, Romania argues that this information was public.\n\n**ii. Romania complied with any standard of consistency or transparency that could reasonably be imposed in the context of complex or politically sensitive legislation and negotiation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n852.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it complied with any standard of consistency or transparency that could reasonably be imposed in the context of complex or politically sensitive legislation and negotiation.\n\n853.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \"various agencies and individuals connected to the Government held differing views about the Facilities' future\", which it argues \"is normal for any state, and it certainly is to be expected of a state undergoing massive changes in its legal and political culture\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 173). The Respondent first highlights Romanian officials' lack of expertise in the enactment of EGO 24, noting that Mr. Orban described the EGO 24 program as a \"non-professional\" attempt by Romania to achieve its objective of regional development, passed \"with an incredible lack of expertise in terms of how the regional policy is developed at the European Union level\" (Tr., Day 8, 178-180 (Orban)).\n\n854.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent acknowledges that, at the time of EGO 24's enactment and even after the Competition Council issued Decision 244, a significant part of the government believed that the EGO 24 facilities were legal. Citing Mr. Marcu's testimony at the hearing, the Respondent alleges that \"it was this sincere belief that motivated Romania to enact EGO 75/2000, which only partially implemented the Competition Council's decision\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 175, citing Tr., Day 7; 20-21(Marcu)). Relying on Mr. Petersen's testimony, the Respondent argues that \"Romanian politicians and officials who thought that EGO 24 was legal were incorrect, but they were not unreasonable, and they acted in good faith\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 174, Tr., Day 6, 111, 178).\n\n855.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was in this environment that Romania promulgated the 2001 Methodological Norms (GD 728/2001). This was the document on which Mr. Orban was being cross-examined when he admitted that Romania was not being particularly transparent to investors and was also acting inconsistently in terms of the availability of EGO 24 (Tr., Day 8, 208-209 (Smith/Orban)). However, the Respondent contends that when this document was promulgated, \"the Government was publicly at odds with the Competition Council regarding the legality of several of the EGO 24 Facilities\", and \"[a]s Mr. Orban explained, any inconsistency in the position taken by different agencies resulted from different levels of knowledge and sophistication and different assessments (or even \u2018wishful thinking') of what might be obtained\", which \"is natural and unavoidable in any state\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 177).\n\n856.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that the 2001 Methodological Norms did not say that any particular Facility would stay in place for any period of time. Rather, Article 5 of GD 728/2001 provided that PIC holders \"shall continue to benefit from facilities under the law, until the expiry of the period for which the disfavored area was declared.\" The Respondent points out that the Claimants and other PIC holders did indeed continue to benefit from the facilities under EGO 24 [as amended] until 2009.\n\n857.\n\nSimilarly, any ambiguity in reports to the public regarding Romania's progress towards accession (Exh. HEC-6 and HEC-7) \"can be explained by the quandary in which Romania found itself.\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 178). Relying on Mr. Orban's testimony, Romania argues that single statements in the reports (such as statements saying that the provisions on the facilities granted in the D-areas would be maintained until the moment of Romania's accession) should not be taken at face value, but rather interpreted in context with other sections stating that the issue of state aid was a sensible subject in the negotiating process. For instance, the Respondent cites to the following testimony by Mr. Orban:\n\nQ. And in this public document in June 2002, anyone who took the time to read this would have been told by the government that the provisions on the facilities granted in the D-areas would be maintained until the moment of Romania's accession; correct?\n\nA. Yes, this was the intention, and this is why we battled a lot with the Commission to get this.\n\nQ. So any investor reading this report in June 2002 would be led to believe that these facilities under EGO 24 would be in place for -- the shortest period of time would be 2007; correct?\n\nA. No. Because -- once again, I don't want to repeat my previous answer, but at that time it was clear that this is a subject, a delicate subject in the accession negotiation process with not a very clear ending.\n\nQ. What's unclear about \"will be maintained until the moment of accession\"?\n\nA. No, you have to read all the documents, not only this sentence. Because it was clear, you mentioned the previous document, the report, where it is mentioned clearly at page -- so it's 9, okay, it's the negotiation on state aid control on Romania focused, pages 132, on the following sensible topics concerning the assessment of the fiscal aid.\n\nSo it was clearly mentioned that this is a sensible subject in the accession negotiation process.\n\n(Tr., Day 8, 219:21-220:21 (Smith/Orban)).\n\n858.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the June 2002 programme (Exh. HEC-7) was equivocal about the facilities' future, as confirmed by Mr. Orban:\n\nQ. [...] You were looking at page 148. You were directed to go to the second highlighted passage at the beginning. It says:\n\n\"The provisions of the normative acts on facilities granted for 'D areas' will be maintained till the moment of Romania's accession to the European Union.\"\n\nYou were asked about this, you were asked about the import of this statement and what one would make of it. I think in fairness I want you to read the next two sentences, where it is said:\n\n\"In conformity with the commitment assumed within the Complementary Position Paper of Chapter 6 'Competition Policy', the Ministry of Development and Prognosis worked out a study analysing the activities carried out in D-areas since July 1999 till June 2001. This study showed that the facilities within deprived areas might be maintained.\"\n\nI wanted to read out this passage and direct your attention to it, so that I can elicit your comment.\n\nA. So, as I told you, I haven't seen this study. So it clearly shows that the study was made by the Ministry of Development and Prognosis. But here the formulation is not -- how to say? -- has presented some doubts about the possibility of preserving these facilities until the end of the -- until before the accession to the European Union.\n\n(Tr., Day 8, 240:13-241:13 (Petrochilos/Orban)).]\n\n859.\n\nThe Respondent also denies the Claimants' accusation of deliberate adoption of contradictory positions, arguing that it is unsupported by the evidence. The Respondent contends that \"[t]he state may be a unitary entity for purposes of international law, but in judging allegations of bad faith and intentional action, reality must prevail.\" The Respondent argues that \"[d]ifferent officials\u2014in any state\u2014have different roles, different expertise, different levels of legal sophistication, and different opinions\", and that \"[i]n a period of transition, the diversity of knowledge and views is inevitably greater\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 179). Citing authors Newcombe and Paradell, the Respondent submits that \"[i]n the case of a large investment that involves the jurisdiction of several government ministries and agencies and multiple levels of government, a host state cannot be held to a standard of strict or absolute liability whereby any degree of inconsistency, ambiguity or lack of transparency breaches fair and equitable treatment.\"152\n\nA. Newcombe, L. Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment (2009), Exh. RL-365, p 294.\n\n860.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the only conclusion that can be reached from the record is that the Romanian Government was unsure what would happen with the facilities. It submits that, \"[o]n the totality of the record, no reasonable investor could have concluded that the Government was certain that the facilities would remain intact until accession, let alone until 2009. There was doubt, and there is nothing illegal about that, particularly in the context of a state making the transition to EU membership. Investors may choose to invest in conditions of greater uncertainty, in search of greater returns\u2014but also taking on, knowingly, the greater risk that comes with it\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 180).\n\n**iii. It was common knowledge that the facilities were vulnerable**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nAs explained in detail in Section 3 above, the Respondent argues that it was common knowledge that the facilities would be scaled back or withdrawn, and the Miculas knew or should have known of that risk. The Respondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment standard does not require more than that. Relying on *Parkerings* *v. Lithuania*,153 the Respondent argues that it was not required to advise the Claimants of future modifications of the law. Referring to the four points addressed by the *Parkerings* tribunal, the Respondent contends that (R-PHB, \u00b6 182):\n\na. The record does not show that Romania \"deliberately neglected to advise the Claimant[s] of the possible amendment of the law\". There was a diversity of views among Romanian officials at different times about what was likely to happen and what was desirable. Particularly at the time when the Claimants say that they committed themselves to a 10- or 20-year investment program (circa 1988-2000) it would be highly unrealistic to say that the Romanian state \"knew\" that the facilities would be withdrawn before 2009. There is no evidence that this information was intentionally withheld from the Claimants; to the contrary, the evidence is that the Claimants were in frequent contact with many different officials, including the chief negotiator in the accession negotiations.\n\nb. Moreover, \"the political environment was changing at the time. and the Claimant[s] should have known that the legal framework was unpredictable and could evolve.\"\n\nc. The fact that Romanian officials knew that the facilities might have to be changed or withdrawn does not mean that they knew exactly what was going to happen or when, particularly at the times relevant to the Claimants' case.\n\nd. The Claimants and their legal advisors were entirely capable of perceiving that the facilities were \"in play\" and there was a significant chance of amendment or repeal before 2009.\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania*, \u00b6\u00b6 341-342: \"[T]he City of Vilnius was in possession of information, prior to the conclusion of the Agreement, concerning possible modifications of the Law on Self-Government and omitted to advise the Claimant \u2026  \n However, first, the record does not show that the Respondent deliberately neglected to advise the Claimant of the possible amendment of the law. Second, as described above, the political environment was changing at the time of the negotiation of the Agreement and the Claimant should have known that the legal framework was unpredictable and could evolve. Third, the fact that the City of Vilnius knew the intention of the legislator to modify certain laws, does not mean that the City of Vilnius knew the substance of the modification. Indeed, the record does not show that the City of Vilnius was in possession of any specific information which indicated that the Agreement would be affected by a modification of the law. Fourth, the Claimant failed to demonstrate that any investor or at least a qualified law firm was unable to get the information about the amendment process. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no reason why, in the circumstances, the alleged contractual obligation of the Municipality to inform BP of the future modification of the law is constitutive of a legitimate expectation for the Claimant.\"\n\n862.\n\nIn addition, the *Parkerings* tribunal held that, while the municipality of Vilnius might well have breached a contractual obligation of disclosure, that would not amount to a breach of the relevant BIT. The Respondent notes that here there is no question of a contractual or other municipal law obligation requiring the Government to disclose to the Claimants the details of the accession negotiations or warn them that the law might change.\n\n863.\n\nIn view of the above, the Respondent argues that \"[t]he Claimants' allegations about transparency and consistency are red herrings. The plain fact is that, no matter what calumnies the Claimants wish to direct at Romania's conduct, the Claimants could not reasonably have believed that the facilities were guaranteed to remain in place and unchanged until 2009. There is no evidence that they were in fact duped or misled by anything the Government said (or failed to say)\u2014because they were not\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 184).\n\n**c. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n864.\n\nIt is evident from the record that, as the Respondent itself puts it, Romania was in a quandary whilst trying to balance two conflicting policies, *i.e.*, first, the continuation of the facilities regime and the protection of the interests of PIC holders in the disfavored regions, and, second, EU accession. The Tribunal has already found that Romania's actions, including its choice to terminate the EGO 24 regime in order to obtain EU accession, were not undertaken in bad faith. However, it finds that the manner in which Romania carried out that termination was not sufficiently transparent to meet the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n865.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot fail to note that the Respondent's own witness, Mr. Orban, who was Romania's Deputy Chief Negotiator for EU accession from 2001 to 2004, conceded that Romania acted inconsistently, non-transparently and ambiguously in terms of the availability of the EGO 24 program and the information given to PIC holders as late as 2002 (Tr., Day 8, 208-209, 221 (Orban)). For example, Romania's official reports regarding its progress towards EU accession were ambiguous (and perhaps even misleading, even if unintentionally) with respect to the duration of the EGO 24 regime. Specifically, Romania's \"National Programme for Accession of Romania to the European Union\" (Exh. HEC-7) stated that \"[t]he provisions of the normative acts on facilities granted for \u2018D areas' will be maintained till the moment of Romania's accession to the European Union\" (Exh. HEC-7, p. 148). Mr. Orban's protests that this document should not be interpreted literally (Tr., Day 8, 219:21220:21 (Smith/Orban), cited above at paragraph 857) are unpersuasive: an ordinary reader would not have understood that, because the assessment of fiscal aid was a \"delicate subject\" in the accession negotiations, these statements should not be taken literally.\n\n866.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that, until sometime in 2003, any inconsistencies in Romania's statements as to the compatibility of the EGO 24 regime with EU state aid regulations were based on a good faith lack of knowledge and an overly optimistic initial assessment of its bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis the EU (*see* Section 4 above). In addition, although for purposes of attribution the state is one single entity, when it comes to assessing transparency one cannot ignore the reality that the state is made of different departments which may hold conflicting views as to how to implement a particular policy. However, once it became clear to Romania that the incentives would have to be abolished (sometime in 2003, according to Mr. Orban), Romania should have made PIC holders aware of this fact. This was the position taken by the tribunal in *Metalclad* :\n\nThe Tribunal understands [transparency] to include the idea that all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under the Agreement should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors of another Party. There should be no room for doubt or uncertainty on such matters. ***Once the authorities of the central government of any Party*** (whose international responsibility in such matters has been identified in the preceding section) ***become aware of any scope for misunderstanding or confusion in this connection, it is their duty to ensure that the correct position is promptly determined and clearly stated so that investors can proceed with all appropriate*** ***expedition in the confident belief that they are acting in accordance with all relevant laws***.154 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, \u00b6 76 (Emphasis added).\n\n867.\n\nRomania argues that it was bound by confidentiality obligations imposed by the EU. However, there is no evidence of such requirements, other than Mr. Orban's testimony. While the Tribunal does not discount this testimony (and finds Mr. Orban generally to be a credible witness), it seems unlikely that the EU would object to Romania informing affected parties of steps taken by Romania in order to align incompatible aid with the *acquis*, when such alignment was exactly what the EU was requesting Romania to do since the conclusion of the Europe Agreement. Even if confidentiality was required, or Romania preferred to keep the negotiations with the EU confidential for other reasons, Romania then had to make a choice and accept the consequences of maintaining such confidentiality.\n\n868.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal finds Romania's argument that it had to keep the negotiations confidential to maintain its \"bargaining position\" with the EU unconvincing. If, according to Mr. Orban, \"from the technical consultations in 2003, it was absolutely clear that for such kind of facilities [customs duty exem ptions] there is no room for manoeuvre\" (Tr., Day 8, 229-230 (Orban)), then Romania had no bargaining position to speak of. Romania could be referring to negotiations to obtain transitional periods on the EGO 24 incentives, but there is no evidence whatsoever that Romania even attempted to negotiate transitional periods for the customs duty exemptions.\n\n869.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that Romania should have alerted PIC holders reasonably soon after it became clear that the EGO 24 incentives would be abolished. The statements made by Prime Minister Nastase on national television in January and May of 2004 were of a general nature (as befitting their context), and thus insufficient. Given the importance of the EGO 24 program and how intensely it was discussed in the context of Romania's EU accession, it was reasonable to expect that the Government would have given to the participants a formal advance notice of the program's anticipated termination. Prime Minister Nastase had also stated that the incentives would be in place until the date of accession,155 and that the government would try to negotiate transitional periods or that there would be compensation packages for PIC holders (*see* paragraph 689 above), so the actual situation was unclear to PIC holders. Nor has the Respondent pointed to any evidence of discussions with stakeholders organized by the Competition Council or other government agencies.\n\nIn an interview in Oradea, Bihor County in May 2004 (Exh. C-652), Prime Minister Nastase indicated that ***\"[s]ubsequent to 2007***, when we want to be accepted in the European Union, these disfavored areas will no longer exist in Romania\" (Emphasis added).\n\n870.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation by failing to inform PIC holders in a timely manner that the EGO 24 regime would be ended prior to its stated date of expiry (1 April 2009).\n\n871.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Claimants' remaining claims on lack of transparency or inconsistency unsubstantiated. Although perhaps the manner in which Romania offered, amended and then finally revoked the incentives could give rise to some confusion, it did not rise to the level of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation. The fact that the Government repealed the incentives from EGO 24 but made no amendment to GD 194/1999 (which states that investors in the \u015etei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti region will benefit from the incentives for ten years) likewise could not have created the level of uncertainty that could rise to the level of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n872.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, by repealing the EGO 24 incentives prior to 1 April 2009, Romania did not act unreasonably or in bad faith (except that the Respondent acted unreasonably by maintaining investors' obligations after terminating the incentives). The Tribunal, however, concludes by majority that Romania violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations that those incentives would be available, in substantially the same form, until 1 April 2009. Romania also failed to act transparently by failing to inform the Claimants in a timely manner that the regime would be terminated prior to its stated date of expiration. As a result, the Tribunal finds that Romania failed to \"ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments\" of the Claimants in the meaning of Article 2(3) of the BIT.\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANTS' REMAINING CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n873.\n\nIn addition to their claims under the umbrella clause and their fair and equitable treatment claims, the Claimants assert that the Respondent has breached the second part of Article 2(3) of the BIT by impairing the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of their investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures; and Article 4(1) of the BIT by expropriating their right to receive the incentives (as well as their entire investment) without compensation.\n\n874.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusion that, by prematurely revoking the EGO 24 incentives in the manner that it did, the Respondent breached its obligation to treat the Claimants' investments fairly and equitably, the Tribunal does not need to address the Claimants' remaining claims. Indeed, each of those claims arises from the same facts as the fair and equitable treatment claim, and the Claimants claim the same compensation in each instance (see Section VII below). Thus, even if the Tribunal were to find in favor of the Claimants with respect to these claims, this would not impact the Tribunal's calculation of damages. As a result, any legal findings on these matters are unnecessary.\n\n**VII. DAMAGES**\n----------------\n\n875.\n\nHaving found a breach of the BIT, the Tribunal now turns to the Claimants' requests for reparation.\n\n876.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, the Respondent argued that the Claimants had amended their case on damages. As a result, the Tribunal directed the Claimants to clarify their final request for relief, which they did on 20 December 2013 with their Revised Request for Relief and later confirmed in their Post-Hearing Brief and closing arguments. The Respondent had several opportunities to comment on this Revised Request for Relief, and submitted its own prayers for relief in response. The Tribunal has focused exclusively on the Parties' formal prayers for relief, namely the Claimants' prayers for relief as set out in their Revised Request for Relief,156 and the Respondent's response in its Post-Hearing Brief.157 The Tribunal has also considered that the Parties' additional requests for relief made in the context of their submissions on provisional measures fall under the category of formal prayers for relief. All arguments have been considered, but the Tribunal sees no need to decide on some of the arguments the Parties have made during the course of the proceedings where they are not necessary to the Tribunal's decisions on the actual requests themselves.\n\nAt the end of their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants \"request an award granting them the relief set out in the Revised Request\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 279).\n\nAt the end of its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal \"(a) DISMISS the Claimants' claim in their entirety; and (b) ORDER the Claimants to pay in their entirety the costs of this arbitration [...] (R-PHB, \u00b6 354). Although the Respondent submitted a Supplementary Post-Hearing Brief commenting on the Claimants' Revised Request for Relief, it did not articulate a formal prayer for relief in that submission.\n\n877.\n\nThe Tribunal will first provide an overview of the Claimants' damages case and the Respondent's position in this respect (Section A below). It will then address certain preliminary matters (Section B below), before analyzing the Claimants' specific claims for damages (Section C below). The Tribunal will turn next to the Respondent's defense that EU accession benefitted the Claimants (Section D below), followed by the Claimants' request that damages be awarded net of taxes (Section E below). Finally, the Tribunal will address the question of who should be the beneficiaries of the Award (Section F below).\n\n**A. OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n**1. Overview of the Claimants' damages case**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n878.\n\nThe Claimants' damages case has evolved over time, as described below.\n\n**a. The Claimants' original damages case**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n879.\n\nIn their Statement of Claim, relying on ILC Articles 34 to 36, the Claimants articulated their damages case as follows:\n\n\"378. [\u2026] Claimants are entitled to restitution of the legal framework that would have prevailed had Romania not withdrawn the tax exemptions and other incentives. In addition, Claimants are entitled to consequential damages arising as a consequence of Romania's illegal acts.\n\n379. In the alternative, if the Tribunal finds that restitution is impossible or constitutes a disproportionate burden, the Claimants are entitled to full damages for the loss suffered as a consequence of Romania's illegal acts. This includes damages for the direct loss suffered as a consequence of the impermissible withdrawal of the tax exemptions and other incentives. It also includes consequential damages for the loss suffered as a consequence of the loss of the cash flow and loss of opportunity.\"\n\n(C-SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379)\n\n880.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimants requested the following:\n\na. \"[R]estitution of the legal framework as in force at the time of the approval of the EGO 24/1998, alternatively adequate compensation for the losses suffered up to the amount of EUR 450,000,000; plus lost profits and any further losses suffered by Claimants as a consequence of Respondent's actions described above. The exact amount will be specified at an appropriate point during the proceedings\" (C-SoC, \u00b6 381).\n\nb. \"[R]eimbursement of their costs and expenses including the costs of the present proceedings\" (C-SoC, \u00b6 382), and\n\nc. \"[I]nterest compounded quarterly on all monetary claims with the precise rate of interest to be specified at an appropriate time during the proceedings\" (C-SoC, \u00b6 383).\n\n**b. The Claimants' damages case in their Reply**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n881.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants abandoned their request for restitution (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 583, 666, fn. 960). From this point forward, their case focused on compensation.\n\n882.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, to determine the compensation owed by Romania for its breaches of the BIT, the Tribunal should apply, in the first instance, any *lex specialis* in the BIT. In the absence of any *lex specialis*, the Tribunal must apply the rules of customary international law. The Claimants note that the only *lex specialis* found in the BIT with respect to compensation is in Article 4, which sets out the standard of compensation for a \"lawful\" expropriation (i.e., an expropriation that meets the requirements of Article 4). However, the BIT is silent with respect to the standard of compensation for \"unlawful\" expropriations and other breaches of the BIT's substantive protections, such as those alleged by the Claimants in this arbitration. In these cases, the Claimants contend that the appropriate standard for compensation under customary international law is the principle of \"full compensation\", as articulated by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case.158 According to the Claimants, this principle is supported by the ILC Articles and by an overwhelming majority of cases and authorities. The Claimants add that the generally accepted view is that they are entitled to be fully compensated irrespective of the breach or breaches of the BIT that the Tribunal may find (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 575-588).\n\n*Case Concerning Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland),* Judgment 13, Permanent Court of International Justice, 13 Sept. 1928 (hereinafter *\"Factory at Chorz\u00f3w\" or \"Ch\u00f3rzow Factory\"*) (1928 PCIJ, Series A. No. 17).\n\n883.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they can only be fully compensated by being placed in the position in which they would have been had Romania not breached the BIT. This includes in particular the lost profits that the Claimants would have made had the Raw Materials Incentive not been repealed. The Claimants further submit that the Tribunal has wide discretion in calculating damages (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 589-609).\n\n884.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants requested an award of compensation for the damages described in Professor Lessard's First Expert Report, in the amount of \u20ac613.7 million for the following categories of damages (R-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 611-655):\n\na. Increased costs for imported raw materials;\n\nb. Lost sales of products containing sugar free of customs tax;\n\nc. Financial penalties incurred to the state for delays in tax payments and that could have been avoided with cash available from the incentives and the lost product sales;\n\nd. Lost opportunities to complete or initiate incremental investments (malt, can and cogeneration plants) that would have created cost savings and incentive payments for green energy; and\n\ne. Lost incremental sales of private-label beer that would have been profitable with completion of the cost-saving investments.\n\n885.\n\nThe damages sought were broken down as follows (C-Reply, \u00b6 653):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Summary of Damages Including Incremental Sales** ***(Present Value at September 30, 2009 in Millions of RON unless Otherwise Noted)*** |\n|  | **Damage (Million RON)** | **Grossed-Up For Tax on Award** |\n| **(Million RON)** | **(Million EUR)** |\n| Increased Costs on Raw Materials | 139.8 | 166.4 | 39.6 |\n| Lost Sales of SCPs to Industrial Users | 524.4 | 624.3 | 148.7 |\n| Incremental Margin from Lost Sales of Finished Goods | 98.5 | 117.3 | 27.9 |\n| Penalties Avoided | 46.9 | 55.8 | 13.3 |\n| Malt Plant | 28.0 | 33.3 | 7.9 |\n| Cogeneration Plant | 591.8 | 704.5 | 167.8 |\n| Can Plant | 734.9 | 874.8 | 208.4 |\n| Total | 2,164.3 | 2,576.5 | 613.7 |\n\n886.\n\nThe Claimants added that, in any event, their injury could not be found to be inferior to the amount that they invested in reliance upon Romania's undertaking to provide the incentives for a period of 10 years. The Claimants provided an \"evaluation of that amount\" in the expert reports of Chris Osborne of (FTI) (C-Reply, 655). Specifically, Mr. Osborne calculated this amount to be RON 811 million.159\n\nIn his second expert Report, Mr. Osborne places the value of the Claimants' pre-EGO 24 business in \"a valuation range of approximately Euro 340 million to Euro 450 million\" (\u00b6 7.60), settling for a final estimation of Euro 400 million (\u00b6 1.38); see also C-PHB, \u00b6 228. However, Mr. Osborne then deducts \u20ac100 million to take into account factors other than revocation that may have affected the Claimants' financial situation, arriving to a final estimation of \u20ac300 million (at the time, RON 811 million) (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 1.43).\n\n887.\n\nIn addition to the damages sought, the Claimants requested post-award compound interest (C-Reply, 657-665), and costs and expenses associated with this arbitration proceeding, including attorneys' fees (C-Reply, 656).\n\n**c. The Claimants' revised request for relief**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nOn 20 December 2010, the Claimants submitted a revised request for relief (\"Claimants' Revised Request for Relief\"). In their Post-Hearing Brief submitted on 13 May 2011, the Claimants explained this Revised Request in detail, and set out three alternative methods (Methods A through C) according to which the Tribunal could calculate the damages sought. They stressed however that \"it is not their contention that the three methods listed below, or the itemized injuries that comprise the elements of the three methods, must be strictly adhered to in the ultimate calculation of an award\" (C-PHB, 96).\n\n889.\n\nThe Claimants explain that Methods A and B are \"alternative expectation scenarios that are offered to demonstrate the value of the integrated and flexible factory platform that the Claimants could have expected to derive had the Incentives not been revoked\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 97).\n\n890.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, **Method A** \"represents the expected returns from continuation of the ten year plan that Claimants undertook in reliance on the Incentives, a plan intended to both capitalize on the Incentives themselves during their duration, and to complete a platform that would have performed profitably after the Incentives statutorily expired\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 97).\n\n891.\n\nSpecifically, in Method A the Claimants request an award of **RON 2,655.35 million** (before interest) (at the date of this Award, approximately **\u20ac597 million**) representing the total of each of the following itemized injuries:160\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ***No.*** | ***Claim*** | ***Amount claimed before*** ***interest (RON)*** | ***Approximate*** ***equivalent in Euro*** | ***Interest applies from*** |\n| 1. | Increased cost of sugar | RON 85.1 million | \u20ac 19.1 million | 1 March 2007 |\n| 2. | Increased cost of PET | RON 6.3 million | \u20ac 1.4 million | 1 March 2007 |\n| 3. | Increased cost of raw materials other than sugar and PET | RON 17.5 million | \u20ac 3.9 million | 1 March 2007 |\n| 4. | Lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in 2009 | RON 62.5 million | \u20ac 14 million | 1 July 2010 |\n|  | **Subtotal** | **RON 171.4 M** | **\u20ac 38.5 M** |  |\n| 5. | Financial penalties incurred but not yet paid | RON 63.65 million (unless waived by Respondent) | \u20ac 14.3 million | N/A |\n| 6. | Financial penalties paid between 1 April 2005 and 30 September 2010 | RON 40 million | \u20ac 9 million | 1 July 2007 |\n| 7. | Lost profits on sales of finished goods | No less than ROM 427 million | \u20ac 96 million161 | 1 May 2008 |\n| 8. | Lost profits on sales of SCPs | RON 492.3 million | \u20ac 110.7 million | 1 July 2007162 |\n| 9. | Lost profits from inability to complete a malt plant | RON 28 million | \u20ac 6.3 million | 30 Sept. 2009 |\n| 10. | Lost profits from inability to complete a canning plant | RON 720.4 million | \u20ac 161.9 million | 30 Sept. 2009 |\n| 11. | Lost profits from inability to complete a co-generation plant | RON 712.6 million | \u20ac 160.2 million | 30 Sept. 2009 |\n|  | **TOTAL** | **RON 2,655.35 M** | **\u20ac 597 M** |  |\n\nClaimants' Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6\u00b6 2.1 to 2.5. The tables set out in this section are based on the tables included in pages 42-43 of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief. As the Parties have done in some of their respective submissions, the Tribunal has added, for indicative purposes only, the Euro equivalent of the amounts claimed rounded up to the nearest hundred thousand at the exchange rate of 9 December 2013 of 4.4482 RON/EUR, source: European Central Bank.\n\nMr. Boulton's valuation was originally made in Euro, for an amount of \"in excess of \u20ac100 million\" (ER of R. Boulton, V 5.99).\n\nIn his expert reports, Mr. Osborne had proposed that interest be computed as of 1 March 2007. However, during the hearing on closing arguments, the Claimants circulated a letter from Mr. Osborne dated 7 June 2011 in which he made an adjustment to the calculation of this claim in order to take into account working capital needs (Tr., Day 13, 6-7, 293 (Schwartz)). This adjustment involved a delay of 120 days for computing interest, which meant that interest should be computed from 1 July 2007 (Letter from Mr. Osborne dated 7 June 2011).\n\n892.\n\nAs an alternative to Method A, the Claimants propose **Method B**, which they argue \"represents the expected returns from the platform that the Claimants actually constructed, had the Claimants been able to maintain their respective market shares in their existing and proven product lines.\" The Claimants argue that they \"have a proven track record of constructing flexible, cost-efficient, and integrated factories, and of successfully and profitably penetrating markets and building market share.\" They further contend that \"[g]iven this track record, and the Claimants' known reliance on state investment incentives in building this track record, it was reasonably foreseeable to the Respondent that revocation of the Incentives at issue here would result in the losses reflected by either Methods A or B\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 97).\n\n893.\n\nSpecifically, in Method B the Claimants request an award of **RON 2,698.25 million** (before interest) (at the date of this Award, approximately **\u20ac606.5 million**) representing the total of each of the following itemized injuries:163\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ***No.*** | ***Claim*** | ***Amount claimed before*** ***interest*** ***(RON)*** | ***Approximate*** ***equivalent in*** ***Euro164*** | ***Interest applies from*** |\n| 1. | The subtotal of items 1 through 6 of Method A | RON 275.05 million | \u20ac 61.8 million | N/A |\n| 2. | Lost profits on sales of finished goods as calculated by BCG | RON 2,423.20 million165 | \u20ac 544.7 million | 15 Aug. 2007 |\n|  | **TOTAL** | **RON 2,698.25 M** | **\u20ac 606.5 M** |  |\n\nClaimants\u2019 Revised Request for Relief, 2.6.\n\nAt the exchange rate of 9 December 2013 of 4.4482 RON/EUR, source: European Central Bank.\n\nAlthough the Claimants\u2019 final prayer for relief is made in RON, the Parties have also expressed this claim in different Euro amounts. These differences appear to stem from the fact that BCG\u2019s calculations were done in Euros, while the Claimants have expressed their claims in RON, and the fluctuations in the exchange rate since the submission of the BCG report have affected the Euro amount at which the Parties have referred to this claim. Specifically, BCG\u2019s second report calculates the lost profits at \u20ac722 million (Second ER of BCG, p. 17), while in its Supplementary Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent values this claim at \u20ac590 million (R-SPHB, p. 15).\n\n894.\n\nIn the alternative to the expectation losses set out in Methods A and B, the Claimants have proposed **Method C**, a reliance damages calculation. According to the Claimants, Method C \"is a means by which the Tribunal can measure the consequences of the Respondent's unlawful act by calculating the value of the investment actually made by the Claimants in reliance on the promised, ten-year duration of the Incentives, and which has been lost\" (C-PHB, 98).\n\n895.\n\nSpecifically, in Method C the Claimants request an award of **RON 874.65 million** (before interest) (at the date of this Award, approximately **\u20ac196.6 million**), representing each of the following itemized injuries:166\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ***No.*** | ***Claim*** | ***Amount claimed (before interest)*** | ***Equivalent in*** ***Euro***167 | ***Interest applies from*** |\n| 1. | Financial penalties incurred but not yet paid | RON 63.65 million (unless waived by Respondent) | \u20ac 14.3 million | N/A |\n| 2. | Loss of value incurred in investing in reliance on the Incentives | RON 811 million168 | \u20ac 182.3 million | 1 Jan. 2002 |\n|  | **TOTAL** | **RON 874.65 M** | **\u20ac 196.6 M** |  |\n\nClaimants\u2019 Revised Request for Relief, fl 2.7.\n\nAt the exchange rate of 9 December 2013 of 4.4482 RON/EUR, source: European Central Bank.\n\nMr. Osborne's final valuation for the reliance claim was \u20ac300 million (at the time, RON 811 million) (Second ER of C. Osborne, U 1.43). In line with this final valuation, in their Revised Request for Relief and in their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants requested RON 811 million for this claim (Revised Request for Relief, U 2.7; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 228-231). Although in their Closing Statements the Claimants stated that they disagree with this discount and therefore the claim remained within the range between \u20ac350-400 million (Tr., Day 12, 123-125 (Reed)), the Tribunal will disregard this latest argument. It is far from certain that the Claimants could purport to amend their sought relief at this late juncture and actually did.\n\n896.\n\nThe Claimants further request interest and costs (Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6\u00b6 3 and 5), as described in Sections VIII and X below. The Claimants also request that \"[t]he total amount of damages payable by the Respondent comprising the amounts set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 [that is, all damages, interest and costs requested] to be received net of any tax obligations imposed by Romania on the proceeds\" (Claimants' Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6 4).\n\n897.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants have requested that \"[a]ny damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to the individual Claimants, Ioan Micula and Viorel Micula, to be divided between them on a 50:50 basis. In the alternative, any damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to all five Claimants\" (Revised Request for Relief, p. 1). This request was later confirmed in the Claimants' prayer for relief included at the end of their Post-Hearing Brief: \"the Claimants request an award granting them the relief set out in the Revised Request\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 279).\n\n898.\n\nFinally, in the context of their applications for provisional measures, the Claimants have also requested post-award injunctive relief, as described in Section IX.B below, as well as a declaration that the Respondent is not allowed to set off any damages awarded to the Claimants against the EFDG's tax debts (as described in Section IX.A below).\n\n**2. Overview of the Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' damages case is speculative and unsupported (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 259-288, R-PHB \u00b6\u00b6 207-210; R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 1-6; Tr., Day 1, 191; Day 2, 137-138).\n\n900.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' quantum case has changed substantially over the course of the proceedings. It notes that this claim began as an unparticularized claim for \u20ac450 million \"plus lost profits and any further losses\", but was transformed substantially when the Claimants submitted their Reply. From that point forward, the Claimants' case has centered on direct losses for approximately \u20ac33 million, which they have \"snowballed\" into indirect losses for approximately \u20ac600 million. Specifically, the Claimants allege that the loss of the Raw Materials Incentive caused them to lose cash flows totaling approximately \u20ac33 million (mostly related to the higher cost of purchasing sugar), which have allegedly prevented the Claimants from pursuing a purported \"10-year plan\", causing the Claimants to forgo hundreds of million Euro in hypothetical lost profits (most of them relating to investments they never made or businesses they never developed). The Respondent also notes that the Claimants blame this \"cash crunch\" and their subsequent inability to expand for having prevented them from paying Romanian taxes in a timely manner, resulting in interest and penalties which they now claim as losses.\n\n901.\n\nThe Respondent also complains that the Claimants have instructed an army of experts, made conflicting damages calculations and constantly changed positions. For example, until the hearing their damages claims were mostly supported by Prof. Lessard's expert reports; however, in their Post-Hearing Brief the Claimants rely on Mr. Osborne's calculations. The Claimants have also advanced an alternative reliance losses claim on the basis of Mr. Osborne's expert reports. The Respondent also complains that the Claimants submitted expert reports from Mr. Juh\u00e1sz of BCG and Mr. Boulton of LECG, and that the status and relevance of these reports remained unclear to Respondent even after the hearing. However, the Claimants rely on both of these reports in their Revised Request for Relief.\n\n902.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants' damages case is fundamentally flawed, and should be dismissed, for the following reasons.\n\n903.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that all of the claimed categories of damages are barred by legal standards. The Respondent does not dispute the general applicability of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard of compensation under international law, upon which the Claimants rely. However, it argues that \"the \u2018full com pensation' principle does not create an entitlement to collect a windfall based on damages not suffered, not proven, and not causally connected with a violation of a treaty obligation\", which in the Respondent's view is what the Claimants seek here (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 277).\n\n904.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimants (i) have not met their burden of proof, in particular with respect to claims of lost profits, and (ii) have failed to prove causation.\n\n905.\n\nWith respect to ***burden of proof***, the Respondent argues that the Claimants bear the burden of proving every element of their claim, and have failed to do so. Even with respect to heads of damages where there is some evidence, the Respondent submits that it is incomplete and insufficient. The Respondent thus argues that the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimants' claims on this basis (R-PHB, \u00b6 216).169 In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants must also meet the specific legal standard with respect to lost profits (discussed in Section VII.C.3 below), which it argues they have not done (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 217-221, R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 297-300).\n\nThe Respondent's specific comments as to the lack of evidence of each head of claim are provided in Section C below.\n\n906.\n\nWith respect to ***causation***, the Respondent submits that a state's actions must be the direct and proximate cause of the damages suffered (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 316-321). The Claimants must prove that breaches of the BIT by Romania were the \"underlying\" or \"dominant\" cause of each head of damage claimed. The causal connection must not be too remote, and there can be no intervening causes breaking the chain of causation.\n\n907.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, this rule disposes of the Claimants' entire damages claim, leaving only the claim for alleged direct losses for payments of customs duties. The Respondent argues that all but the direct losses claim are premised on the theory that the Claimants had insufficient funds (or cash flows) to undertake other activities because of the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility. If the Tribunal were to consider that this \"cash crunch\" had other causes, or that the Claimants might have obtained alternative funds from other sources, then the chain of causation has been broken. As explained further below, Romania argues that the hearing exposed the Claimants' rapidly deteriorating financial position before repeal of the Raw Materials Facility and their own business decisions as the real causes of the Claimants' alleged losses, severing the causal link between repeal of the Raw Materials Facility and the claimed damages. The Respondent adds that, if the Claimants really had been able to convert \u20ac30 million of cash flow into more than \u20ac600 million, there would have been no shortage of lenders and equity investors ready to provide the funding.\n\n908.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants must also establish the causal link between each alleged breach of the BIT and the specific damages caused by such breach. The Respondent notes that the Claimants have consistently refused to do so, including in the Revised Request for Relief. As a result, the Respondent contends that no assumptions can or should be made about which damages flow from each alleged treaty breach. It would be wrong to expect the Tribunal to simply assume that all of the heads of damages claimed flow directly from all of the alleged treaty breaches. In particular, the Respondent argues that it would be wrong to assume that the same damages would flow from an expropriation than from a breach of other treaty standards. In this respect, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have not even purported to identify the fair market value of the assets expropriated (their alleged vested right to enjoy the Raw Materials Facility).\n\n909.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that every category of the Claimants' quantum case (with the exception of the direct losses claim) is based on two assumptions for which there is no evidentiary support:170\n\na. That the Claimants had a \"10-year plan\" that they would have implemented but for the withdrawal of the Raw Materials Facility, and\n\nb. That, but for that withdrawal, the Claimants would have started selling SCPs to industrial customers (at about the time of revocation) and would have cornered the Romanian sugar market, thereby generating the cash flows necessary to undertake the Incremental Investments.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments on the assumptions identified above (including arguments on evidence) are addressed in the analysis of each of the Claimants' claims in Section C below.\n\n910.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that no award of damages can be made in respect to losses incurred by non-Claimant companies, nor for the diminution in value of the Individual Claimants' direct or indirect shareholdings in such companies, because they fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In this regard, it argues that the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over the Claimants' shareholdings only over the Corporate Claimants (R-PHB, \u00b6 314).\n\n911.\n\nFurther, the Respondent opposes the Claimants' request that all damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants.\n\n912.\n\nIn view of the above, at the end of its Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent requests the Tribunal to award the following relief:171\n\n\"(a) DISMISS the Claimants' claim in their entirety; and\n\n(b) ORDER the Claimants to pay in their entirety the costs of this arbitration [\u2026] (R-PHB, \u00b6 354).\n\nAlthough the Respondent submitted a Supplementary Post-Hearing Brief commenting on the Claimants' Revised Request for Relief, it did not articulate a prayer for relief in that submission.\n\n913.\n\nFinally, in the context of its application for the revocation of provisional measures, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to \"explicitly provide in the Award that any amount awarded to any of the Claimants, whether as damages, arbitration costs, or otherwise, is subject to set-off by Romania against the tax debts of all eleven EFDG companies, including lawful interest and penalties\" (Respondent's Revocation Application, \u00b6 87(c)).\n\n**B. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n914.\n\nBefore turning to the Claimants' specific claims for damages, the Tribunal will address certain preliminary matters, in particular legal standards (Section 1 below), and the Respondent's claim that certain of the Claimants' claims fall outside of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal (Section 2 below).\n\n**1. Legal Standards**\n----------------------\n\n915.\n\nA substantial part of the Respondent's arguments on quantum relates to the legal standards applicable to an award of damages. Accordingly, before addressing the quantification of the Claimants' claims, the Tribunal will address these standards.\n\n916.\n\nThe basis for the Claimants' expectations damages claims is the principle of full reparation enshrined in Article 31 of the ILC Articles,172 which provides:\n\nArticle 31. Reparation\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Part Two of the ILC Articles, which sets out the legal consequences of internationally wrongful acts, may not apply, at least directly, to cases involving persons or entities other than States, such as in investment disputes as is the case here. In particular, it is aware that Comment (3) to Article 28 states that \"[...] while Part One applies to all the cases in which an internationally wrongful act may be committed by a State, Part Two has a more limited scope. It does not apply to obligations of reparation to the extent that these arise towards or are invoked by a person or entity other than a State. In other words, the provisions of Part Two are without prejudice to any right, arising from the international responsibility of a State, which may accrue directly to any person or entity other than a State, and article 33 makes this clear.\" That being said, the ILC Articles reflect customary international law in the matter of state responsibility, and to the extent that a matter is not ruled by the treaties applicable to this case and that there are no circumstances commanding otherwise, the Tribunal will turn to the ILC Articles for guidance. The Tribunal further notes that the Claimants have cited to the ILC Articles and the Respondent has not objected.\n\n917.\n\nAs articulated by the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorzow* case, \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"173 This principle has been generally understood to mean that the claimant must be placed back in the position it would have been \"in all probability\" but for the international wrong. In most cases, this involves the payment of compensation (ILC Articles 34 and 36).174\n\n*Factory at Chorzow,* p. 47.\n\nArticle 34 of the ILC Articles (forms of reparation) provides that \"[f]ull reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\"  \nArticle 36 of the ILC Articles (compensation) provides: \"1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution. 2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"\n\n918.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute the principle of full reparation. Rather, it contends that the Claimants have not met their burden of proof with respect to the damage suffered, and have failed to prove that the damages alleged were caused by Romania's breaches of the BIT.\n\n919.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants must prove both the existence of the damage for which they request compensation, as well as the existence of a causal link between the breaches of the BIT found by the Tribunal and the damage alleged.\n\n920.\n\nArticle 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits ***insofar as it is established***.\" The Parties do not dispute the general principles on burden and standard of proof, except when they relate to lost profits. The Tribunal addresses the standard for an award of lost profits together with the analysis of the Claimants' specific claims for lost profits in Section C.3 below.\n\n921.\n\nWith respect to causation, the Respondent argues that the Claimants must not only prove causality in fact (which has been defined by the *Biwater v. Tanzania* tribunal as \"the sufficient link between the wrongful act and the damages in question\"175), but must establish that causation is proximate (i.e., not too remote or inconsequential). According to the Respondent, to prove proximate causation, it would not be enough for the Claimants to demonstrate that the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility had a detrimental impact on their business activities; they must also prove that the breaches of the Treaty were the \"underlying\" or \"dominant\" cause of each element of compensation that they seek. The Respondent relies (among others) on the *ELSI* case, where the International Court of Justice found that, despite the fact that there were several causes that led to the ELSI disaster, \"the underlying cause was ELSI's headlong course towards insolvency,\"176 and on *GAMI v. Mexico*, where the tribunal found that the damages suffered by the claimant had been largely the result of market forces177 (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 317-320). In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants must show a direct causal link between each violation of the BIT and the specific damages caused (see paragraph 908 above). Finally, relying on *Lauder v. Czech Republic*,178 the Respondent argues that there must be no intervening cause for the damage (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 319).\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/22), Award, 24 July 2008 (hereinafter *\"Biwater v. Tanzania\"*), \u00b6 785.\n\n*ELSI*, \u00b6\u00b6 100 and 101.\n\n*GAMI v. Mexico*, \u00b6 85.\n\n*Lauder v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6\u00b6 234-235.\n\n922.\n\nThe Claimants do not dispute the principles on causation described by the Respondent. Citing *Biwater v. Tanzania*,179 the Claimants simply assert that \"for each item of damage claimed, there is a \u2018sufficient link between the wrongful act and the damage in question'\", and that \"the Respondent's actions were the \u2018underlying' or \u2018dominant' cause of the Claimants' losses\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 100). The Claimants provide further details on these alleged causal links in the description of each claim.\n\n*Biwater v. Tanzania*, \u00b6 785.\n\n923.\n\nThe ILC Articles emphasize the need for a causal link between the internationally wrongful act and the injury for which compensation is due. Article 31(1) provides that \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury ***caused*** by the internationally wrongful act.\" Article 31(2) goes on to say that \"[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, ***caused*** by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\" Commentary (9) to Article 31 explains that\n\n\"It is only \u2018[i]njury. caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State' for which full reparation must be made. This phrase is used to make clear that the subject matter of reparation is, globally, the injury resulting from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences flowing from an internationally wrongful act.\"\n\n924.\n\nCommentary (10) adds that \"[t]he allocation of injury or loss to a wrongful act is, in principle, a legal and not only a historical or causal process\", and that \"causality in fact is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation. There is a further element, associated with the exclusion of injury that is too \u2018remote' or \u2018consequential' to be the subject of reparation.\" The commentary explains that \"in international as in national law, the question of remoteness of damage \u2018is not a part of the law which can be satisfactorily solved by search for a single verbal formula'\", but notes that international tribunals have used the criteria of directness, foreseeability or proximity to establish this, and that other factors may also be relevant.\n\n925.\n\nWith respect to the concept of directness, the Tribunal notes that under the ILC Articles not every event subsequent to the wrongful act and antecedent to the occurrence of the injury will necessarily break the chain of causation and qualify as an intervening cause. Indeed, the commentary to the ILC Articles explains that, in cases where \"the injury in question was effectively caused by a combination of factors, only one of which is to be ascribed to the responsible State, international practice and the decisions of international tribunals do not support the reduction or attenuation of reparation for concurrent causes, except in cases of contributory fault\" (Comment 12 to Article 31 of the ILC Articles). The only other exception seems to be cases \"where an identifiable element of injury can properly be allocated to one of several concurrently operating causes alone\", \"[b]ut unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, ***not being too remote***, of its wrongful conduct\" (Commentary 13 to Article 31 of the ILC Articles. Emphasis added).\n\n926.\n\nThus, an intervening event will only release the State from liability when that intervening event is (i) the cause of a specific, severable part of the damage, or (ii) makes the original wrongful conduct of the State become too remote. Unless they fall under either of these categories, cases of contributory fault by the injured party appear to warrant solely a reduction in the amount of compensation.180\n\nArticle 39 of the ILC Articles provides that \"in the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission\" of the injured party. Commentary 5 to Article 39 explains that the phrase \"account shall be taken\" \"indicates that the article deals with factors that are capable of affecting the form or reducing the amount of reparation in the appropriate case\".\n\n927.\n\nTherefore, the question seems to be whether the intervening event is so compelling that it interrupts the causal link, thus making the initial event too remote. Accordingly, when assessing the impact of an intervening cause, the Tribunal will first focus on whether the damage can be properly attributed to the cause cited by the Claimants, or rather to the intervening cause.\n\n928.\n\nFinally, the Respondent has argued that the Claimants must show a direct causal link between each violation of the BIT and the specific damages caused. In this particular case, however, all of the violations of the BIT alleged by the Claimants arise from the same fact: the premature revocation of the incentives or in direct connection with that premature revocation. Even if the Respondent's argument were correct, the damages claimed by the Claimants arise from one and the same set of facts, irrespective of the specific treaty breach alleged.\n\n**2. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over claims for damages relating to the nonclaimant companies of the EFDG?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n929.\n\nDuring the course of this arbitration, it has become evident that all of the damages calculations provided by the Claimants (be it under Methods A, B or C) refer to the damages suffered by the entire EFDG.181 In the Claimants' view, the Individual Claimants are entitled to all of the damages suffered by all of the companies in the EFDG because they assert that \"all of the main companies [in the EFDG] are 100% owned, or virtually 100% owned, by the Micula brothers\" (Tr., Day 11, 105 (Reed)).\n\n*See, e.g.,* First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73; Tr., Day 8, 118-121 (Lessard); First ER of C. Osborne, fn. 1 and Appendix 2 (definition of \"Companies\"); ER of R. Boulton, p. i (definition of \"Companies\"); Second ER of BCG, p. 2; Tr., Day 10, 88-89 (Osborne).\n\n930.\n\nThe Respondent argues that no award of damages can be made with respect to losses incurred by non-Claimant companies, nor for the diminution in value of the Individual Claimants' direct or indirect shareholdings in such companies, because they fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In this regard, they argue that the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over the Claimants' shareholdings only over the Corporate Claimants (R-PHB, \u00b6 314).\n\n931.\n\nThe Tribunal makes two observations in that regard. First, in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction \"over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration\" (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 170), after having found that it had jurisdiction *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae*, and *ratione temporis* over the Claimants' claims.182 The Tribunal did not state that it accepted jurisdiction only with respect to the Individual Claimants' shareholdings over the three Corporate Claimants. The Tribunal noted that, at that juncture, \"it need only determine whether there is an investment for the purpose of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT\" (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 123). The Tribunal was satisfied that the investments made by the Corporate Claimants, as well as the shareholding of Messrs. Micula in the Corporate Claimants, qualified as investments (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 125.) However, the Tribunal did not exhaustively determine what the Claimants' investments were nor hold that those were the only investments out of which the dispute arose. For example, the Tribunal concluded that it did \"not need to establish at this stage whether the incentives as such are considered investments capable of expropriation\" (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 128).\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal found that the Corporate Claimants' physical assets and the Individual Claimants' shares in the Corporate Claimants qualified as investments for purposes of the ICSID Convention and for purposes of the BIT (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 124-128).\n\n932.\n\nFurther, in their Statement of Claim, the Claimants stated that this dispute arose \"out of investments made by Claimants in the Romanian areas Stei-Nucet and Dragane\u015fti village\", adding that \"[t]hese investments comprise various facilities for the production of food and related services\" (SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33). The Claimants did not specify that all of those facilities were owned directly by the Individual Claimants or the Corporate Claimants, although they did suggest in a fashion (*see* SoC, \u00b6\u00b6 45-168). During the course of the arbitration, the Claimants have explained that their food production facilities are owned and operated through a group of Romanian companies, the EFDG, which they allege is ultimately owned by the Individual Claimants. The fact that part of the Claimants' business is channeled through Romanian companies that may be owned by the Individual Claimants, which was not brought to the Tribunal's (or the Respondent's) attention during the jurisdictional phase, does not negate the Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration, nor the Tribunal's competence and the Centre's jurisdiction over the dispute. Finally, it is not disputed that the claims related to the investments in non-claimant companies of the EFDG, which are within the competence of the Tribunal, were made in a timely fashion as they were raised at the latest in the Claimants' Reply.\n\n933.\n\nSecond, in the Tribunal's view, the question whether an award of damages can be made in respect to losses incurred by non-Claimant companies owned by the Individual Claimants is not a question of jurisdiction, that is, whether the Parties have consented to this Tribunal and to ICSID as the appropriate forum to adjudicate the dispute. The question is rather whether it is permissible for the Individual Claimants to seek remedy for losses suffered by companies owned by them but that are not claimants in this arbitration. Thus, the issue is whether the Individual Claimants are entitled to a remedy if neither of them personally suffered the prejudice directly suffered by corporations in which they are shareholders but which are not claimants in this arbitration.\n\n934.\n\nIn their Statement of Claim, the Claimants requested \"adequate compensation for the losses suffered up to the amount of EUR 450,000,000; plus lost profits and any further losses suffered by Claimants as a consequence of Respondent's actions\", the exact amount to be specified at an appropriate point during the proceedings (SoC, \u00b6 381). The Claimants did not at that stage specify that the Individual Claimants' losses stemmed exclusively from their investment in the Corporate Claimants. The Respondent does not dispute that the Individual Claimants have standing to bring claims related to their investments in shares of corporations.183\n\nIndeed, the Respondent does not dispute that the Individual Claimants could have chosen to bring a case by themselves, without joining the Corporate Claimants. That being said, the Respondent contends that, had the Individual Claimants done so, \"they would have been entitled (assuming liability) only to damages they had suffered\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 338). This is a different issue which the Tribunal addresses in Section VII.F below.\n\n935.\n\nThus, to the extent that the Individual Claimants can prove their ownership of the other (Romanian) companies in the EFDG and can prove that they have been affected in this regard by the Respondent's breaches of the BIT, the Tribunal finds that claims for losses suffered by the Individual Claimants through those other companies are within the scope of permissible damages claims.\n\n936.\n\nAlthough the Claimants provided surprisingly little documentary evidence of the Individual Claimants' ownership of the non-claimant companies of the EFDG, the evidence in the record (most of it provided by the Respondent) confirms that the Individual Claimants are jointly the owners of at least 99.96% of the companies in the EFDG that have allegedly suffered the losses claimed in this arbitration.\n\n937.\n\nMr. Osborne identified the following companies as part of the EFDG (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 10.3, Figure 64): the Corporate Claimants (European Food, Multipack and Starmill), European Drinks S.A. (\"European Drinks\"), EDRI Trading S.R.L. (\"EDRI Trading\"), Original Prod S.R.L. (\"Original Prod\"), Rieni Drinks S.A. (\"Rieni Drinks\"), Scandic Distilleries S.A. (\"Scandic Distilleries\"), Transilvania General Import-Export S.R.L. (\"TGIE\"), Tonical Trading S.R.L. (\"Tonical Trading\"), West Leasing S.R.L (\"West Leasing\"). Mr. Osborne also provided a diagram of the ownership structure of these companies with an indication at Figure 3 of his First Expert Report (p. 57). However, he did not cite the source of the information shown. Figure 3 is reproduced below, together with Mr. Osborne's explanations:\n\nThe Miculas are majority shareholders in most of the Companies, and the remainder are controlled by companies that are in turn owned by the Miculas. The diagram below shows the ownership structure of the 11 companies plus Limerock holdings, a Cypriot entity that owns Original Prod, and General Transilvania Exim. Some minor shareholdings have been omitted from the diagram for the sake of clarity, but shareholders not included are primarily other family members including Mrs Eeva Micula and Mrs Doina Micula.\n\n**Figure 3: The Companies\u2019 Major Shareholdings**\n\n938.\n\nAs recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, during the jurisdictional phase the Claimants provided evidence of their shareholdings in the Corporate Claimants in 2008, as follows:\n\na. \"Claimant 3 [European Food] is a Romanian joint stock company established on 30 November 1989. Respondent does not dispute that Claimant 3 was held on 1 February 2007 (Exh. C-25) at more than 93% by Messrs. Micula. The rest of the shares were held by Rieni Drinks SA, a Romanian company (6.5%). The excerpt from the Register of the Ministry of Justice dated 27 May 2005 (Exh. C-7) shows that the Miculas each held 46.7289% and Rieni Drinks 6.5415%\" (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 112).\n\nb. \"Claimants 4 [Starmill] and 5 [Multipack] were established as Romanian limited liability companies on 21 February 2002. Claimants 1 and 2 each hold 50% of the shares (Exh. C-7, dated 27 May 2005)\" (*Id*., \u00b6 113).\n\nc. \"On 31 July 2008 Counsel for Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants submitted, for each of the three Corporate Claimants, excerpts from the Romanian commercial registry showing the status of each of these three companies as of 25 June 2008, as well as their corporate biographies from 1 July 2005 on. These documents confirm the above conclusions\" (*Id*., \u00b6 113).\n\n939.\n\nThe Claimants did not provide updated information of the Individual Claimants' shareholdings in the Corporate Claimants during the merits phase. However, the Respondent has not disputed these shareholdings or suggested that there has been any change in them. In addition, an excerpt from the Bihor Trade Registry dated 9 December 2008 provided by the Respondent (Exh. R-60) shows that Ioan Micula holds 50.65% of Rieni Drinks, while Viorel Micula holds 49.34%, which would put their joint shareholding at 99.99%. Mr. Osborne confirmed this in Figure 3 of his First Expert Report, which showed Rieni Drinks as 99% owned by the Individual Claimants (although he did not cite the source for this affirmation). Accordingly, the Tribunal deems that all three Corporate Claimants are virtually 100% owned by the Individual Claimants, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n940.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants have provided no documentary evidence of their shareholding in the remaining companies of the EFDG. They simply assert that most of the companies in the EFDG are \"directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Micula brothers\", with the exception of Original Prod, Tonical Trading, and EDRI Trading. However, with respect to those three companies, they also state that \"[n]one of these companies has any real claim to any of the damages claimed in this case\" (Tr., Day 1, 146 (Reed)). Accordingly, the Tribunal will disregard the three companies named above for purposes of its damages analysis. However, this statement also suggests that, in addition to the Corporate Claimants, there are five other companies within the EFDG (namely, European Drinks, Rieni Drinks, Scandic Distilleries, TGIE and West Leasing) that have suffered part of the damages claimed in this case. As a result, the Tribunal must determine whether they are indeed owned by the Individual Claimants.\n\n941.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Respondent's frustration at the lack of evidence submitted by the Claimants. As noted by Mr. Ellison, it is difficult to understand why the Individual Claimants did not, of their own initiative, provide evidence of their shareholdings in the EFDG. It is the Individual Claimants' burden to prove that they are the owners of the companies they assert they own and that have suffered the damages they now claim. It is not fair to impose upon the Respondent (or, for that matter, the Tribunal) the burden of searching through the Romanian Registry of Commerce in order to assess whether the Claimants' assertions are true. Like Mr. Ellison, the Tribunal cannot help but to find the Claimants' approach to this matter \"bizarre\" (Tr., Day 11, 100-105 (Reed/Ellison)).\n\n942.\n\nThat being said, the evidence submitted by the Respondent (in particular, an excerpt from the Bihor Trade Registry dated 9 December 2008 (Exh. R-60) and from the Orbis Commercial Database (Exh. R-61, date unclear), indicates that, at the date the information was collected, the shareholding of the remaining EFDG companies was as follows:184\n\na. **Rieni Drinks** : Ioan Micula with 50.65%, Viorel Micula with 49.34%, European Drinks with 0,001%, and Intermark S.R.L. with 0.00002%. In other words, Rieni Drinks is 99.99% owned directly by the Individual Claimants.\n\nb. **TGIE** : Ioan Micula with 47.50%, Viorel Micula with 47.50%, and Rieni Drinks 5%. Considering that Rieni Drinks is 99.99% owned directly by the Micula brothers, the Tribunal deems this company owned 99.99% by the Individual Claimants.\n\nc. **European Drinks** : Ioan Micula with 39.94%, Viorel Micula with 39.94%, and TGIE with 20.05%, Rieni Drinks with 0.05% and Edri Trading with 0.02%. Considering that, with the exception of Edri Trading, all the companies that have shareholdings are 99.99% owned directly by the Micula brothers, the Tribunal deems that European Drinks is 99.98% owned by the Individual Claimants.\n\nd. **Scandic Distilleries** : Ioan Micula with 48.12%, Viorel Micula with 48.12%, Rieni Drinks with 0.05%, Intermark S.R.L. with 0.05%, European Drinks with 0.05%, and World Brands Production S.A. with 3.61%. Considering that, with the exception of Intermark and World Brand Productions S.A., all the companies that have shareholdings are at least 99.98% owned by the Micula brothers, the Tribunal deems that European Drinks is 99.96% owned by the Individual Claimants.\n\ne. **West Leasing** : Ioan Micula with 21.25%, Viorel Micula with 21.25%, and TGIE with 57.50%. Considering that TGIE is 99.99% owned by the Micula brothers, the Tribunal deems this company owned 99.99% by the Individual Claimants.\n\nNumbers have been rounded up to the nearest hundredth.\n\n943.\n\nThese shareholdings are roughly consistent with the shareholdings shown by Mr. Osborne in Figure 3 of his First Report. Accordingly, although the evidence reviewed by the Tribunal is from December 2008, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Osborne's assertions and deems that the companies in the EFDG identified above are at least 99.96% owned by the Individual Claimants. Accordingly, the Individual Claimants can claim for damages that they have suffered by virtue of the harm to those companies as well as the harm to the Corporate Claimants.\n\n**C. ANALYSIS OF THE CLAIMANTS' DAMAGES CLAIMS**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. General comments**\n-----------------------\n\n944.\n\nAs discussed above, the Claimants have advanced two expectation damages computations (Methods A and B) and one reliance damages computation (Method C). Method A quantifies the increased costs and lost profits that the Claimants would have made had they been allowed to develop their business the way they allege they had planned to do, in particular by implementing the Incremental Investments and the sale of SCPs to third parties. Method B quantifies the increased costs and lost profits that the Claimants would have made had they continued operating their existing platform. Method C presents a reliance damages scenario, which quantifies the value of the losses incurred by the Claimants in investing in reliance on their expectation that the incentives would remain in place for ten years. The Claimants have emphasized that the Tribunal need not adhere strictly to either of these three methods or the injuries itemized therein in order to make an award (C-PHB, \u00b6 96).185\n\nThe Claimants stated expressly: \"Claimants' Revised Request for Relief submitted on 20 December 2010 is summarized below. Claimants wish to stress, however, that it is not their contention that the three methods listed below, or the itemized injuries that comprise the elements of the three methods, must be strictly adhered to in the ultimate calculation of an award\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 96).\n\n945.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal will focus its attention on Method A.\n\n946.\n\nFirst, Method A is the Claimants' primary expectation damages scenario. The Claimants have devoted most of their efforts to Method A and have identified Methods B and C as \"alternative\" damages scenarios. In their Reply, the Claimants focused almost exclusively on the damages listed in Method A, as calculated by Prof. Lessard (and partly on the reports of Dr. Fry and Prof. Steenkamp). In their Revised Request for Relief, the Claimants continue to rely heavily on Method A, although some of the claims are now calculated by Mr. Osborne and Mr. Boulton.\n\n947.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal rejects Method B, for the following principal reasons:\n\na. Compared to Method A, the BCG Report (which quantifies the main head of claim under Method B) was subject to much less rigorous scrutiny in the proceedings. The Respondent repeatedly requested clarification as to the role of that report in the Claimants' quantum case, but this was only made clear with the Claimants' Revised Request for Relief. Although the Respondent had an opportunity to comment on that Revised Request (the Tribunal allowed it to submit a Supplementary Post-Hearing Brief), the Tribunal finds that it has a less complete and less well tested record as to Method B than Method A.\n\nb. The Tribunal has serious concerns regarding the methodology used by BCG. The flaws in BCG's First Report seem to have caused concern to the Claimants themselves, who requested Mr. Boulton to assist BCG and supervise the preparation of BCG's Second Report. However, as the Respondent pointed out, despite the changes in methodology and assumptions, the quantification of the Claimants' losses proposed by BCG's Second Report (\u20ac722 million present value of EBITDA, Second ER of BCG, p. 17) does not differ greatly from that proposed in its First Report (between \u20ac757-796 million present value of EBITDA, First ER of BCG, p. 14).\n\nc. The BCG Report purports to quantify lost profits for sales of finished goods that the Claimants would have allegedly earned but for the revocation on the basis of the Claimants' existing production platform at the time of the revocation. But despite the fact that Claimants' platform at that time did not have the benefit of the Incremental Investments, BCG's calculations yield a higher result for only the sales of finished goods (quantified by the Claimants as RON 2,423 million) than all of the lost profits claims included in Method A combined (i.e., lost profits deriving from sales of finished goods calculated by Mr. Boulton, lost profits deriving from the sale of SCPs and lost profits deriving from the Incremental Investments, which combined amount to RON 2,380 million). In stark contrast to BCG's calculations, Mr. Boulton (on whose report the Claimants rely under Method A) quantified lost sales of finished goods at \u20ac100 million. Although part of the difference in their results can be attributed to the fact that Mr. Boulton excluded export markets in his calculations, the Tribunal finds that this further calls into question the credibility of the assumptions and methodology used by BCG. Accordingly, as explained in Section 3(b) below, the Tribunal relies on Mr. Boulton's analysis of lost profits on sales of finished goods rather than the analysis of BCG.\n\nd. Although the Claimants specify that certain amounts calculated by Mr. Osborne in relation with Claims 1-4 of Method A (specifically, section 4 of Mr. Osborne's First Report and in section 3 of Mr. Osborne's Second Report) must be subtracted from the amount calculated by BCG (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 204), the Claimants do not provide a final calculation that takes into account this subtraction. Indeed, the RON number claimed by the Claimants does not appear to consider any deductions at all, since BCG's valuation of the losses at \u20ac 722 million has simply been claimed in RON (*see* C-PHB, \u00b6 206, note 305, where the Claimants simply state that \"RON 2,423.2 million is the [sic] RON \u20ac722 million\").\n\ne. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants devote a mere three paragraphs to the BCG Report in their Post-Hearing Brief (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 204-206). The least that can be said is thus that the Claimants did not build the core of their arguments and claims on the BCG Report.\n\n948.\n\nThird, the Tribunal rejects Method C. Method C provides an alternative reliance approach to the calculation of the Claimants' losses, in which Mr. Osborne attempts to \"value the business absent the investments made in reliance on the Incentives\" (CPHB, \u00b6 332; Tr., Day 10, 36-37 (Osborne)). The Tribunal does not see any reason to deviate from the Claimants' primary expectation damages approach which, in the Claimants' own submission, should place them in the position that they would have been but for Romania's breach of the BIT, and is thus consistent with the full compensation principle articulated in the *Ch\u00f3rzow Factory* case.\n\n949.\n\nThe Claimants' claims under Method A are summarized in paragraph 891 above. For purposes of the analysis, the Tribunal will divide them into three main groups: the Claimants' claims for actual / realized losses (*damnum emergens*) as a result of the increased cost of raw materials (addressed in Section 2 below), the Claimants' claims for lost profits (addressed in Section 3 below), and the Claimants' claims for tax penalties (addressed in Section 4 below).\n\n**2. Increased cost of raw materials**\n--------------------------------------\n\n950.\n\nThe Claimants had previously presented this claim as a single claim, but in their PostHearing Brief they divided it up into claims for increased costs of sugar, PET, other raw materials and sugar stockpile. Each sub-claim is addressed below.\n\n**a. Increased cost of sugar**\n------------------------------\n\n951.\n\nThe Claimants claim losses for the increased cost of sugar in the amount of RON 81.5 million, based on:\n\na. The calculations contained in section 4 of Mr. Osborne's first report, and paragraphs 4.9 to 4.16 and 4.23 to 4.24 in particular;\n\nb. The calculations contained in section 3 of Mr. Osborne's second report, and paragraphs 3.1 to 3.28 in particular; and\n\nc. The evidence referred to in those sections, including exhibits CO-1.18, CO-1.19, CO-2.1 and CO-9.1 (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 101-110).\n\n952.\n\nAlthough in their Post-Hearing Brief the Claimants rely on Mr. Osborne's figures, they submit that the differences with the calculations made by Prof. Lessard (on whose report they relied on for this same claim prior to the hearing) are minimal. In particular, they argue that working capital does not impact the calculation of these damages. Mr. Osborne explains that the reason for the nominal differences between both calculations is the different approaches to estimating the volume weighted actual transport premium (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 3.21).\n\n953.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal accepts this claim. Both the existence of the damage and the causal link between the revocation of the incentives and the damage suffered have been adequately proved. There is no dispute that, as a result of the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive, the Claimants were required to pay an increased amount for the sugar they purchased after February 2005. The Respondent's expert, Mr. Ellison, accepts that this is the case, subject to certain criticisms and exclusions (First ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6 6.2.24), as discussed further below.\n\n954.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied with the quantification of this claim, which is based on reliable documentary evidence. In his second report, Mr. Osborne reconciled the sugar purchase data used by him and Prof. Lessard, and reconciled his work with the raw material audit work carried out by BDO. Mr. Ellison recognized and accepted these reconciliations, noting that \"the reconciliation now appears valid\" (Second ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6 2.2.16). Mr. Ellison also confirmed that BDO checked all 2,586 sugar invoices in the process of conducting their audit (Tr., Day 11, 96-97 (Ellison/Reed)).\n\n955.\n\nMr. Ellison contends that these damages should exclude sugar purchases by nonClaimant EFDG companies after revocation of the incentives (RON 64.7 million, approximately \u20ac14.9 million, about 75% of the losses claimed) (First ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6\u00b6 6.2.9-6.2.12; Second ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6\u00b6 5.1.4, 5.3.1-5.3.5). Mr. Ellison notes that, before revocation, European Food was making substantially all the sugar imports for the entire group and selling it to its affiliates; however, after revocation, each EFDG company started importing its own needs for sugar. The Claimants and their experts argue that this exclusion is perverse: after the revocation, there was no incentive for the sugar purchases to be channeled through the Claimant companies, because they no longer had a right to the customs duty exemption and thus there was no cost advantage for them or their affiliates that are not parties in this arbitration. Had the incentives remained in place, the Claimants would have continued to purchase sugar through European Food (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6\u00b6 1.3, 3.13-3.17; Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 138). The Respondent argues that this is irrelevant, because there is no legal basis upon which the Corporate Claimants could be compensated for an outlay from someone else's pocket (R-PHB, \u00b6 313).\n\n956.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty with the Respondent's argument. European Food lost the opportunity to buy cheaper sugar, and as a result the Claimants were forced to buy more expensive sugar, incurring an additional cost. That this more expensive sugar was bought by a different company of the group does not eliminate the loss to the Individual Claimants, who the Tribunal has confirmed are the ultimate shareholders of the entire group.\n\n957.\n\nAs previously noted, the Respondent also argues that no award of damages can be made with respect to losses incurred by non-Claimant companies, nor for the diminution in value of the Individual Claimants' direct or indirect shareholdings in such companies, because they fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. As discussed in Section B.2 above, the Tribunal rejects this argument: this argument does not turn on jurisdiction, but rather whether it is permissible for the Individual Claimants to seek remedy for losses suffered by companies 99.96% owned by them that are not claimants in this arbitration. As set out in paragraph 943 above, the Tribunal has found that claims for losses suffered by the Individual Claimants through those other companies are within the scope of permissible damages claims.\n\n958.\n\nMr. Ellison also excludes the loss of the benefit to European Food of the arm's-length transactions by which it sold intermediate sugar products to European Drinks and Rieni Drinks. The documentary evidence appears to confirm (and Mr. Ellison conceded at the hearing) that the transactions were indeed at arm's length (Tr., Day 11, 59-63 (Ellison/Schwartz). The Tribunal understands the Claimants to be saying that, prior to the revocation, European Food bought the sugar duty-free and then sold the intermediate products to other EFDG companies at the same price it would have sold them to third party companies. The Claimants' argument seems to be that European Food lost that \"business\" as a result of the revocation. The Tribunal sees no reason to exclude this loss from the calculation.\n\n959.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that, because the Claimants cannot establish that they would have been entitled to import sugar duty free after 1 January 2007, no damages should be awarded for that period. Mr. Caspari, the Respondent's sugar expert, testified that the Claimants could not possibly have imported duty free sugar into the EU after accession (even absent the repeal), as such activity would have fundamentally undermined the EU sugar regime and threatened the stability of the EU sugar market (ER of C. Caspari, \u00b6 26; Tr., Day 11, 261 (Caspari)). According to the Respondent, this warrants a reduction of RON 18.1 million (or 19.4 million, if adjusted to account for Mr. Osborne's approach) (R-PHB, \u00b6 320, fn. 703).\n\n960.\n\nThe Claimants' sugar expert, Dr. Fry, seemed to recognize this problem but assumed that Romania would have negotiated with the European Commission a specific derogation allowing the Claimants to import duty free sugar into the EU. However, he conceded that he had no evidentiary basis for this assumption, and that such a derogation would have been unprecedented in EU history (Tr., Day 11, 234-236 (Fry)).\n\n961.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that it is uncertain whether the Claimants could have imported sugar duty free after Romania's accession to the EU, even if the facilities had remained in place. However, the Respondent has not established that the Claimants could not have done so. The Claimants argue that the EU could have granted exemptions if Romania had negotiated such exemptions, and there is no evidence that Romania even tried to negotiate such exemptions. The Tribunal has found that Romania breached the Claimants' legitimate expectation to benefit from the Raw Materials Incentive until 31 March 2009. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants are entitled to all losses regarding increased cost of sugar until that date.\n\n962.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants' claim for increased cost of sugar, for a total amount of RON 85.1 million.\n\n**b. Increased cost of PET**\n----------------------------\n\n963.\n\nThe Claimants claim losses caused by the increased cost of PET in the amount of RON 6.3 million, based on:\n\na. The calculations contained in section 4 of Mr. Osborne's first report, and paragraphs 4.17 to 4.24 in particular;\n\nb. The calculations contained in section 3 of Mr. Osborne's second report, and paragraphs 3.29 to 3.35 in particular; and\n\nc. The evidence referred to in those sections, including the witness statement of Mr. Halbac dated 22 December 2009 and exhibits CO-1.18, CO-1.19, CO-2.1 and CO-9.1 (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 111-115).\n\n964.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects this claim. It is undisputed that the Claimants never benefitted from the Raw Materials Facility in respect of PET imports because their PET equipment was not located in the Stei-Nucet region (R-PHB, \u00b6 318; C-PHB, \u00b6 112; First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 42; First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 83, Exh. C-681, C-686). Although Mr. Halbac testified that the Claimants did have PET equipment in Dragane\u015fti as far back as 2002, it is unclear whether they benefitted from the incentives. The Claimants do not expressly say so, and Mr. Ellison testified that he found invoices for PET in 2002 that had duty on them (See C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 112-115; Second WS of M. Halbac, fn. 53; C-680; Tr., Day 10, 195 (Ellison)).\n\n965.\n\nIn fact, the Claimants' claim for PET is based on their alleged intention to relocate their PET equipment in late 2004 or early 2005 to the disfavored region precisely for the purpose of taking advantage of the incentives. As the Respondent states, \"[i]n effect, this claim is for a hypothetical future lost opportunity to save money on the purchase of raw materials, rather than any claim for actual losses\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 318). The claim is thus not for actual losses, but for future losses. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent: the Claimants have not met their burden to prove the existence of a lost opportunity; therefore, they cannot claim a loss for increased cost of PET if the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility did not in fact cause them to incur greater costs in purchasing PET.\n\n966.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants have not proven that they would have indeed relocated their PET equipment to the disfavored region. This claim appears to rely entirely on Mr. Halbac's oral testimony, which the Tribunal did not find convincing in this respect. Although he cites some contemporaneous documents (Exh. C-681, C-686), Mr. Osborne appears not to have considered them in his report (Tr., Day 11, 147-148). In any event, these documents are not sufficient to prove that alleged intention:\n\na. Exh. C-681 is an invoice dated 1 September 2004 cited as evidence for moving Husky PET Equipment from Rieni to Dragane\u015fti. However, the document merely appears to list \"Works of wiring within Dragane\u015fti Complex, Hall 11, Plugs Machine - HUSKY, as per the work status due to May 2004\" with respect to an \"AGREEMENT 748/15th of July 2002\". This does not clearly evidence a purported move of that equipment. In addition, the agreement that appears to serve as basis for those works was signed in July 2002, but it is undisputed that the equipment had not been moved by the time the incentives were repealed in February 2005. This raises questions with respect to the intent to move that equipment and the timing of that alleged move, as discussed further below.\n\nb. Exh. C-686 is a drawing of a layout of the Multipack facilities showing where PET equipment would allegedly be installed. However, the Tribunal has no way of knowing when this drawing was made, how concrete of a project it embodied and what its intended use would have been.\n\n967.\n\nIn addition, the modest scale of the cost and effort allegedly required to move the equipment undermines the credibility of the claim. Mr. Halbac stated that the move would have cost only 250,000 RON (approx. \u20ac50,000) and taken approximately only 2 months to complete (see First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 42). In these circumstances, and considering that Exh. C-681 cites an agreement dated July 2002, it is unclear why the Claimants had not moved that equipment before the date of the revocation of the incentives.\n\n968.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' claim for increased cost of PET.\n\n**c. Increased cost of other raw materials**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n969.\n\nThe Claimants claim losses caused by the increased cost of raw materials other than sugar or PET in the amount of RON 17.5 million, based on:\n\na. The calculations contained in section 4 of Mr. Osborne's first report, and paragraphs 4.17 to 4.24 in particular; and\n\nb. The evidence referred to in that section, including exhibits CO-1.18, CO-1.19 and CO-2.1 (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 116-120).\n\n970.\n\nThe Claimants base their claim on Mr. Osborne's calculations, but note that the differences with Prof. Lessard's results are nominal (Prof. Lessard calculates RON 17.37 million). They thus state that the Tribunal may choose either calculation.\n\n971.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts this claim, as calculated by Mr. Osborne. As in the case of sugar, it is undisputed that following the revocation of the incentives, the Claimants were required to pay more for the other raw materials they purchased, including tomato paste, juice concentrates, wheat and corn flower, vegetable fats, and potato flakes and granules. The Respondent's expert, Mr. Ellison concedes that losses from these higher costs were incurred by the Claimants, and does not dispute the prices used by their experts (which the Claimants argue are conservative and understated, because they switched to cheaper products, and because the experts were unable to find benchmark prices to estimate but for prices).\n\n972.\n\nThat being said, Mr. Ellison argues that the total loss should be discounted to RON 14.5 million (or RON 11.2 million if one counts only damages suffered until the date of accession) for two reasons: first, that only 20% of the amount claimed is supported by documentary evidence, and second, that much of these increased costs were paid by non-Claimant companies within the EFDG (First ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6\u00b6 6.3.1-6.3.5; Appendix JMHE-4C).\n\n973.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses Mr. Ellison's second argument for the reasons set out in paragraphs 956 to 958 above. With respect to Mr. Ellison's first argument, the Tribunal understands that the documentary evidence cited by the Claimants (Exh. C-166, C-167, C-218, C-220 and C-222, which contain between them 43 customs declaration forms with customs duties amounting to RON 3.6 million) is a sample. Given the nature of the Claimants' business, the Tribunal does not expect the Claimants to provide an invoice for every item they ever imported, and thus accepts that a sample of customs declaration forms is an appropriate evidentiary means. In addition, the Respondent has given no compelling reasons why that sample is not representative of the total. As a result, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Ellison's first argument.\n\n974.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal accepts this claim for a total of RON 17.5 million.\n\n**d. Lost opportunity to stockpile sugar**\n------------------------------------------\n\n975.\n\nThe Claimants claim losses for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in the amount of RON 62.5 million, based on:\n\na. The calculations contained in section 4 of Mr. Osborne's first report, and paragraphs 4.13 to 4.16 in particular;\n\nb. The calculations contained in section 4 of Mr. Osborne's second report;\n\nc. The calculations contained in the expert reports of Dr. Fry of December 2009 and July 2010; and\n\nd. The evidence referred to in the abovementioned sections, including the witness statements of Mr. Balog dated 22 December 2009 and 30 July 2010 (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 121-130).\n\n976.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, because the incentives were going to end in 2009, they planned to buy large quantities of sugar ahead of that and thus avoid paying higher sugar prices for some months. The stockpile would thus help them to maintain the effects of the incentives for a longer period of time. The Claimants assert that, in late 2004/early 2005, after they heard that the incentives would be revoked, they stockpiled what they could, but not as much as they would have liked to do.\n\n977.\n\nMr. Osborne includes this claim in his calculation of increased cost of raw materials, as follows:\n\n\"4.1 The early termination of the EGO 24/1998 incentives has had a clearly detrimental effect on the Claimants. That effect comes in part from an impact on their costs - and therefore on their ability to earn a satisfactory return on the investments that they have made. [...]\n\n4.2 The first impact on the Claimants arises because of the increase in the effective cost of raw materials purchased for their own use - including sugar, fruit and tomato concentrates, and potato products. This applies both in respect of purchases that the Companies have made and ***purchases that the Companies would have made in creating*** ***a stockpile of sugar in 2009 to extend the period in which it could benefit from reduced sugar costs.***\n\n4.3 In the latter case, the reason for including the effect of stockpiling in 2009 is that the Companies would, had the EGO 24/1998 incentives continued, have undoubtedly sought to create a stockpile of sugar in 2009 - in essentially the same way as was actually done in 2004/2005. On that basis it seems reasonable also to assume that equivalent amounts would or should have been negotiated by way of compensation in the alternative scenario in which the EGO 24/1998 incentives continued only to the point of EU accession. To ensure symmetry, the calculations treat the beneficial effects of the stockpile actually created in 2005 as reducing the losses suffered by the Claimants.\" (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6\u00b6 4.1-4.3, emphasis added).\n\n978.\n\nIn preparing his calculations, Mr. Osborne assumed that, if the Claimants had time to properly organize and prepare for the termination of the incentives, they would have built an optimal stockpile, based on, among other things, sugar price forecasts, storage costs, the cost of capital and the EFDG companies' sugar consumption (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.10). According to Mr. Osborne, this optimal stockpile would have been around 75,000 tonnes. The Claimants argue that they were prevented from amassing this optimal stockpile because (i) they did not have enough time to properly plan for the optimal stockpile, and (ii) in 2004/2005 they had not put funds aside for this purpose. Instead, they amassed around 30,000 tonnes. Mr. Osborne calculates damages based on the optimal stockpile, not the actual stockpile amassed by the Claimants.\n\n979.\n\nThe Respondent argues that including any stockpiling in the direct damages claim is impermissibly speculative, transforming this part of the case into yet another \"lost opportunity\" claim. The Respondent contends that there is no way of knowing what the Claimants would have done in 2009 had the Raw Materials Facility remained in place. In particular, would they have had the funds to purchase and store vast quantities of sugar? Would it have been permissible to stockpile at that time? The Respondent also notes that Prof. Lessard did not incorporate a stockpile in his original calculations (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 315-316).\n\n980.\n\nThat being said, Mr. Ellison appears to accept this claim from an economic perspective, subject to proof that (i) the large quantities purchased in late 2004 and early 2005 were indeed a stockpile, and not, e.g., a period of intensified production or a seasonal issue, and (ii) that this stockpiling activity was a direct response in anticipation of revocation (and in this respect differed from the increased purchasing in 2003) and not, e.g., EFDG taking advantage of a particularly good price (beyond the discount provided by the incentives) and/or the replenishment of previously rundown stock levels and/or seasonal issues (Second ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6\u00b6 6.2.22-6.2.21).\n\n981.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it is established that the Claimants did in fact stockpile 30,000 tonnes in 2004/2005. Mr. Balog testified and Mr. Gamecho confirmed that the Claimants had purchased enough duty-free sugar to delay the economic effect of the repeal until the second half of 2006 (First WS of C. Balog, \u00b6 7; Tr., Day 4, 28 (Gamecho)). Mr. Ellison accepts that large quantities of sugar were purchased in late 2004 and early 2005, although as described above he questions whether these purchases were meant to create a stockpile.\n\n982.\n\nIn contrast, evidence of the Claimants' intention to stockpile in the future is limited:\n\na. The Claimants contend that \"Mr Balog has given clear and unchallenged evidence that upon hearing about the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive in 2004, the Claimants set about building as large a sugar stockpile as possible [WS of C. Balog dated 30 July 2010, \u00b6 12]. It is safe then to assume that had the incentives lasted for the promised 10 year period, at the end of that period the Claimants would have built a sugar stockpile, and in fact, Mr. Ellison has accepted that a sugar stockpile would have been made at that time [Tr., Day 10, 196]. The real issue in dispute is therefore over the size of the stockpile that would have been built\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 123). However, the Respondent points out that Mr. Balog's testimony purports to describe what the Claimants did in response to the announcement of the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility, and that it does not directly support the suggestion that the Claimants ever intended to (or could have) stockpiled vast amounts of sugar in 2009 (R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13).\n\nb. Mr. Osborne also relies on Mr. Viorel Micula's assertion that \"we had planned to purchase and stock-pile a large amount of sugar on a customs duty free basis prior to the incentives coming to an end\" (Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6 68; First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.10, third bullet point).\n\n983.\n\nDespite the absence of hard evidence on the Claimants' future intentions, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants' established past practice of stockpiling provides sufficient certainty that, but for the revocation, the Claimants would have stockpiled sugar in early 2008 in anticipation of the expiry of the incentives. In 2004, the stockpiling was organized as a reaction to the allegedly unforeseen occurrence of the early termination of the incentives. Indeed, the stockpiling was to be planned and organized closer to the scheduled expiry of the incentives and in preparation for such expiry, so there was no need for such stockpiling before the latter became looming. Other than Mr. Viorel Micula's testimony, the record does not show that the Claimants had planned for either event. However, this is understandable as the need for the actual stockpiling appears to have caught the Claimants off guard, and the scheduled expiry of the incentives was to occur almost 4 years after the revocation. In view of these considerations, the Tribunal finds that it is sufficiently certain that the Claimants would have acted in 2008/2009 as they actually did in 2004/2005. Indeed, Mr. Ellison conceded that, \"on the basis that in early 2008, the claimants would probably have started preparing a stockpile, knowing that [\u2026] expiry was coming along\" (Tr., Day 10, 196).\n\n984.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that there is a sufficient causal link between the damage asserted and the revocation of the incentives. The Respondent has not provided a plausible alternative explanation as to why the Claimants would have stockpiled sugar in late 2004/2005 if it was not in anticipation of the revocation of the incentives. Having accepted the causal link in 2004/2005, the Tribunal is satisfied that the same causal link would apply in 2008/2009 with respect to the scheduled expiry of the incentives.\n\n985.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Ellison that this loss should be circumscribed to the volumes actually stockpiled in 2004/2005. The \"optimal stockpile\" calculated by Mr. Osborne must be rejected because the size of such an optimal stockpile is too speculative. As Mr. Ellison points out, \"the way [Mr. Osborne's] formula works is that he has used 2009 prices and forecasts to work out what would have been the best stockpile to create in 2008. And the way commodities work, of course, you don't normally have that advantage of being able to look a year ahead and see actual prices\" (Tr., Day 10, 197 (Ellison)).\n\n986.\n\nInstead, it is more reasonable to use as counterfactual data the 30,000 tonnes that were actually stockpiled in 2004/2005 (Tr., Day 10, 196 (Ellison)). Using these volumes, Mr. Ellison recalculates the loss at RON 18,133,229 (approximately \u20ac4.3 million at the exchange rate of 30 September 2009 used by Mr. Ellison),186 as follows:\n\n\"6.2.20 I have recalculated the potential loss resulting from a higher price for white sugar. I have assumed a stockpile of 30,000 tonnes would have been assembled over the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009, in line with the stockpiled volume possibly amassed in 2004 and 2005 (see paragraph 6.2.17 above). (Although whether there was any stockpiling in 2004/2005 is not entirely clear). In the absence of any contemporaneous documentation establishing the decision process undertaken by EFDG in 2004 and 2005 (or, indeed, any contemporaneous evidence that the volumes purchased were in fact a stockpile), this is a more reasonable approach than to pick an optimal stockpile with the benefit of hindsight.\n\n6.2.21 I therefore calculate the impact of allowing for a delay in the (assumed) stockpiling patterns until 2008/2009, but at the volumes asserted to have been stockpiled in 2004/2005. My calculation of the loss for the Sub-Head of Claim relating to sugar therefore increases by approximately \u20ac4.3 million.\"\n\n(Second ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6\u00b6 6.2.20-6.2.21)\n\nAppendix JMHE-4C.\n\n987.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mr. Ellison's methodology and calculations. As a result, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants' claim with Mr. Ellison's reductions (i.e., for RON 18,133,229).\n\n988.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Ellison's alternative calculation on the basis of the assumption that the incentives would only have been available until the date of accession, for the reasons set out in paragraph 961 above.\n\n**3. The Claimants' claims for lost profits**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n989.\n\nThe Claimants advance five claims for lost profits under Method A. The Tribunal has grouped them into three categories: the Claimants' claim for lost profits on the sale of finished goods (Section (b) below); the Claimants' claim for lost profits on the sale of sugar-containing products (SCPs) (Section (c) below), and the Claimants' claim for lost profits due to the inability to complete the Incremental Investments (Section (d) below). Before addressing each of these claims, the Tribunal will address the standard for an award of lost profits (Section (a) below).\n\n**a. Standard for an award of lost profits**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n990.\n\nAs noted above, Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\" The Respondent argues that the standard of proof for an award of lost profits is more restrictive than for an award of other losses, and the Claimant has responded to these arguments. As a result, the Tribunal will first address the Respondent's position, and will then turn to the Claimants' comments.\n\n**i. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n991.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, for their claims for lost profits to succeed, the Claimants must meet a specific legal standard with respect to lost profits (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 217-221, R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 297-300).187\n\nThis is in addition to a causal link between the international wrong and the profits allegedly lost. The Respondent's position on causation is addressed in the context of each specific claim.\n\n992.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent argues that international law requires a claimant to demonstrate lost profits with \"reasonable\" or \"sufficient\" certainty. The Respondent contends that a claimant must adduce probative evidence that lost profits are \"probable\" and not \"merely possible\".188 If there is no proof that the alleged profitmaking activity would have been undertaken at all, the standard has not been met. According to the Respondent, this disposes of the Claimants' claim in respect of the Incremental Investments and the alleged SCP opportunity, which together amount to more than \u20ac450 million.\n\nM.M. Whiteman, Damages in International Law, Vol. 3 (1937), Exh. RL-313, p. 1837.\n\n993.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent argues that most of the Claimants' alleged lost profits claims (in particular the claims related to the Incremental Investments and sale of SCPs) constitute claims of lost opportunities, rather than lost profits. As none of these activities were ever undertaken in fact, the Claimants seek compensation for the loss of a hypothetical chance to profit, not for the loss of profit itself. According to the Respondent, in these circumstances international law does not recognize an entitlement to compensation for mere opportunities. The only circumstances in which international tribunals have accepted claims for lost opportunities are situations in which the lost opportunities had intrinsic value, which the Respondent argues is not the case here (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 278-288, citing *S.D. Myers v. Canada, Merrill & Ring* *v. Canada189, Sapphire v. NIOC190*).\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. The Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award, 31 March 2010.\n\n*Sapphire International Petroleum Ltd v National Iranian Oil Company*, Award, 15 March 1963 (hereinafter *\"Sapphire v. NIOC\"*).\n\n994.\n\nBut even where there is no doubt that an investment would have been undertaken, the Respondent submits that the reasonable certainty standard cannot be satisfied in the absence of a going concern and a proven record of profitability. Citing a string of cases including *Aucoven v. Venezuela191, PSEG v. Turkey, Metalclad v. Mexico and* *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, the Respondent contends that arbitral tribunals have consistently rejected lost profits claims where such a record of profitability could not be proven, noting that any compensation awarded in such circumstances has generally been limited to proven investment expenditures.\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, CA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No ARB/00/5), Award, 23 September 2003 (hereinafter *\"Aucoven v. Venezuela\"*).\n\n995.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent argues that international law precludes any award of prospective damages for projects that have not commenced. The Respondent submits that \"no tribunal adjudicating an investment treaty dispute has ever awarded lost profits where, as here, the claiming party had not made the investment that allegedly would have generated the profits\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 290). The Respondent cites *Aucoven v Venezuela*, where the Tribunal refused to award lost profits for the operation of a bridge that was never built or put into operation, despite the fact that it was undisputed that the bridge would have been built and would have been a profitable venture.192 This tribunal also noted that \"ICSID tribunals are reluctant to award lost profits for a beginning industry and unperformed work\", adding that this reluctance is confirmed by the practice of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal.193 Romania also cites *Himpurnia California Energy Ltd. v. PLN*, where the tribunal held that \"it would be intolerable... to uphold claims for lost profits from investment not yet incurred\".194\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 357, cited with approval in *PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6 310.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 360.\n\n*Himpurnia California Energy Ltd v PLN,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 4 May 1999, \u00b6 330.\n\n996.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent argues that mere projections of future profits made by investors or draft contracts that were never finalized are insufficient to prove lost profits. In particular, the tribunal in *PSEG v. Turkey* held that \"[r]elying on cash flow tables that were a part of proposals that did not materialize does not offer a solid basis for calculating future profits.\"195\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6 313.\n\n997.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that \"even claims for the lost future profits of existing investments have been disallowed where the investment had no track record of profit generation. An award to the contrary would be inherently speculative, and therefore contrary to the dictates of international law\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 290). The Respondent cites a string of cases where tribunals have rejected such claims, notably:\n\na. *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, where the tribunal found, in connection with a newly formed company that had no record of profits and was undercapitalized, that neither the \"goodwill\" of the company nor its '''future profitability' [...] could be reasonably established with a sufficient degree of certainty\".196\n\nb. *Metalclad v. Mexico,* where the tribunal held that \"where the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value.\"197\n\nc. *PSEG v. Turkey*, where the tribunal found that compensation for lost profits \"is normally reserved for the compensation of investments that have been substantially made and have a record of profits, and refused when such profits offer no certainty.\"198\n\nd. Several decisions of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (see R-Rejoinder, fn. 446).\n\n*AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, \u00b6 106.\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, \u00b6 120.\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6 310\n\n998.\n\nThe Respondent argues that in such circumstances, international tribunals have \"repeatedly held that damages should be limited to proven, net out-of-pocket expenditures (or \"sunk costs\") that the claimant has incurred in advancing the project\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 291). For example, in *Biloune v. Ghana,* the tribunal concluded that \"[g]iven the nature of the project, and its early interruption by the respondents (\u2026), the most appropriate method for valuing the damages to be paid [for expropriation] will be to return to Mr. Biloune the amounts he invested\".199\n\n*Biloune & Marine Drive Complex Ltd v Government of Ghana,* UNCITRAL, Award, 30 June 1990 (hereinafter *\"Biloune v. Ghana\"*), pp. 228 and 229.\n\n999.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, in the Claimants' case, there was no going concern with respect to the Incremental Investments or the sale of SCPs to third parties, and thus no proven record of profitability. As a result, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal need not even consider the evidence submitted with respect to the alleged lost opportunities. Even if the Tribunal were convinced of the Claimants' intention to \"complete\" the Incremental Investments and to engage in the sale of SCPs to third party industrial customers, it is undisputed that none of these ventures was ever launched, let alone earned profit (See, e.g, Tr., Day 8,33-38 and 45-46 (Lessard); Tr., Day 8, 10:66-67 (Osborne)). Thus, the Respondent argues that no award of damages for the Incremental Investments or the sale of SCPs to third parties can be contemplated in the present case as a matter of law. The Respondent's specific comments on the evidence submitted with respect to the sale of SCPs and the Incremental Investments is set out in Sections (c) and (d) below.\n\n**ii. The Claimants' position**\n-------------------------------\n\n1000.\n\nThe Claimants do not contest the standard offered by the Respondent for an award of lost profits (that is, that the claim must have \"sufficient certainty\") (C-PHB, \u00b6 145).200 However, they offer a different interpretation of how this \"sufficient certainty\" must be established (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 145-150; C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 604-609).\n\nIndeed, the Claimants concede that tribunals have traditionally been less willing to award compensation for lost profits than for other losses due to the inherently speculative nature of a lost profits claim. However, relying on the ILC Articles and an article by Prof. John Gotanda, they contend that such damages should be awarded where the claim for them has sufficient certainty. (See ILC Articles, Art. 36, and John Y Gotanda, Recovering Lost Profits in International Disputes, 36 Georgetown Journal of International Law 61, 111 (2004), Exh. C-603).\n\n1001.\n\nCiting *Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico*, the Claimants contend that the concept of certainty is both \"relative and reasonable in its application\". The Claimants argue that, in that case, the tribunal rejected the argument that the claimants had failed to prove their lost profits claims because their quantification was uncertain or difficult. The tribunal also emphasized that the assessment of a claim of lost profits was not an exercise in certainty but in \"sufficient certainty\", noting that \"[i]t is not always possible for a claimant to prove that a future event could or could not happen with certainty; and a tribunal can only evaluate the chances of such a future event happening.\"201 The *Gemplus and Talsud* tribunal was also more lenient with respect to the claimants' burden of proof, having concluded first that \"the Claimant's evidential difficulties in proving their claim for loss of future profits [were] directly caused by the breaches of the BITs by the Respondent responsible for such loss.\"202 The Claimants also rely on *Sapphire v. NIOC,*203*SPP v. Egypt,*204 and *Lemire v. Ukraine*205 for the proposition that the uncertainty in the amount of damages should not be an obstacle to an award of lost profits.\n\n*Gemplus S.A., SLP S.A. and Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States* and *Talsud,* *S.A. v. United Mexican States* (Conjoined ICSID Cases Nos. ARB (AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4), Award, 16 June 2010 (hereinafter *\"Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico\" or \"Gemplus and Talsud\"), \u00b6* 1391.\n\n*Id., \u00b6* 13-92.\n\n*Sapphire v. NIOC,* pp. 187-188, (\"It is not necessary to prove the exact damage suffered in order to award damages. On the contrary, when such proof is impossible, particularly as a result of the behaviour of the author of the damage, it is enough for the judge to be able to admit with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage.\").\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, \u00b6 215 (where the tribunal held that the inability to assess damages with certainty is not alone a reason not to award them when a loss has been suffered).\n\n*Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18), Award, 28 March 2011 (hereinafter *\"Lemire v. Ukraine\"*), \u00b6 246 (\"The Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the *in bonis* party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.\").\n\n1002.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, in the present case, the fact of injury from revocation of the incentives is not disputed; only the amount of the injury is in dispute. The Claimants also contend that the legal wrong giving rise to those injuries has been established beyond question. Relying on the cases cited above, the Claimants argue that the Respondent is therefore not entitled to invoke an unattainable burden of proof as to the amount of compensation for the Claimants' losses that would compound the Respondent's wrongs and unfairly defeat the Claimants' claim for compensation.\n\n1003.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's arguments regarding the need for a proven record of profitability, citing *Sapphire v. NIOC*, *SPP v. Egypt* and *Lemire v. Ukraine,* the Claimants argue that tribunals have awarded damages to un-established businesses or businesses still in their infancy (C-PHB, \u00b6 149). The Claimants note that in these cases the tribunals awarded damages despite the fact that the claimant was unable to prove the exact amount of damage suffered. However, these cases do not specifically address the situation where the claimant has not made the investment that would have allegedly generated the profits.\n\n1004.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants contend that the successes enjoyed by the Miculas' businesses from the early 1990s until the time of revocation of the incentives should satisfy the Tribunal to the requisite degree of certainty that, had the incentives remained in place, those successes would have continued. The Claimants emphasize that their business was not in its infancy; to the contrary, it was a very successful drinks and food business with large market shares at the time the incentives were revoked (C-PHB, \u00b6 149).\n\n1005.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal should have no hesitation in accepting the Claimants' claims for lost profits, and awarding them full compensation so as to put them in the position they would have been in had Romania not breached the BIT by prematurely terminating the incentives.\n\n**iii. The Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n1006.\n\nArticle 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits ***insofar as it is established***.\" As discussed above, the Respondent submits that lost profits must be proved with \"sufficient certainty\". The Respondent argues that this means that they must at least be \"probable\", and \"not merely possible.\"\n\n1007.\n\nThe Claimants do not dispute that lost profits must be established with sufficient certainty, but rather argue that the Tribunal must be more lenient in determining whether that standard has been met. In particular, the Claimants submit that once the fact of damage has been established, a claimant should not be required to prove its exact quantification. They argue that this is especially true where the conduct of the author of the damage has made that proof difficult or impossible.\n\n1008.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that any future damage is difficult to prove and is willing to take that into account. There remains nevertheless a requirement to show sufficient certainty as speculation is not the same as prediction. Indeed, the cases cited by the Claimants call for leniency in the assessment of the *amount* of damage, not of its existence. The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Lemire v. Ukraine* when it states that \"[o]nce causation has been established, and it has been proven that the *in bonis* party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.\"206\n\n*Lemire v. Ukraine*, \u00b6 246.\n\n1009.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the commentary to the ILC Articles limits compensation to \"damage actually suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes damage which is indirect or too remote\" (Comment 5 to Article 34 of the ILC Articles). In the case of lost profits, this can only mean that the claimant must have been deprived of profits that would have actually been earned but for the internationally wrongful act. Accordingly, before they are entitled to request a more lenient application of the standard of proof, the Claimants must first prove that they would have actually suffered lost profits, i.e., that they have been deprived of profits that would have actually been earned. In the Tribunal's view, this requires proving (i) that the Claimants were engaged in a profit-making activity (or, at the very least, that there is sufficient certainty that they had engaged or would have engaged in a profitmaking activity but for the revocation of the incentives), and (ii) that that activity would have indeed been profitable (at the very least, that such profitability was probable).\n\n1010.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the sufficient certainty standard is usually quite difficult to meet in the absence of a going concern and a proven record of profitability. But it places the emphasis on the word \"usually.\" Depending on the circumstances of the case, there may be instances where a claimant can prove with sufficient certainty that it would have made future profits but for the international wrong. This might be the case, for example, where the claimant benefitted from a long-term contract or concession that guaranteed a certain level of profits or where, as here, there is a track record of similar sales. This must be assessed on a case by case basis, in light of all the factual circumstances of the case. That is what the Tribunal will now do with respect to the Claimants' specific claims for lost profits.\n\n**b. Lost profits on sales of finished goods**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1011.\n\nThe Claimants claim no less than RON 427 million (originally calculated by Mr. Boulton as an amount \"in excess of \u20ac100 million\", ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 5.99) for lost profits on sales of finished goods, based on:\n\na. The calculations contained in section 5 of Mr. Boulton's report dated 30 July 2010 and paragraphs 5.24 to 5.70 and 5.95 to 5.99 in particular; and\n\nb. The evidence referred to in the abovementioned section, including exhibits RB-2 and RB-4 (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 151-161).\n\n1012.\n\nMr. Boulton carries out a very specific lost profits analysis: he focuses on the impact of the increased cost of raw materials on sales of the EFDG companies' branded goods, and that consequent impact on profits.207 Mr. Boulton's analysis starts from the premise that the revocation of the incentives caused an increase in the cost of the Claimants' products, which in turn caused the Claimants to raise their prices. That price increase in turn caused the Claimants to lose market share, preventing them from making sales they otherwise would have made. This in turn caused a loss in profits.\n\nIn his Expert Report, Mr. Boulton also makes comments on the expert reports submitted by the Respondent's experts Dr. Robinson (on the effect of Romania's accession to the EU on the Claimants) and Mr. Ellison (on quantum in general). He also comments on the First Expert Report submitted by BCG on behalf of the Claimants and provides his own calculation of the impact of price increases on the Claimants' sales of branded products in Romania. It is on this latter analysis that the Claimants rely for this claim.\n\n1013.\n\nMr. Boulton's empirical analysis focuses on the relationship between increased prices and loss of market share. Mr. Boulton does not carry out an empirical analysis of the first two causal links (that revocation caused an increase in costs, and that this increase in costs caused the Claimants to raise their prices), but rather appears to accept them through a combination of reliance on evidence rendered by the Claimants (including Mr. V. Micula's Witness Statement) and of conclusions based on his experience (i.e., his expert opinion) as explained in more detail below.\n\n1014.\n\nMr. Boulton's calculation overlaps with:\n\na. Prof. Lessard's quantification of lost profits for the EFDG's incremental sales at RON 97.3 million, which on 30 September 2009 was approximately \u20ac28 million when grossed up for taxes (Prof. Lessard's Updated Summary of Damages distributed at the merits hearing), and\n\nb. BCG's quantification of the EFDG's lost profits on sales of finished goods at RON 2,423.20 million, which at the date of BCG's Reply Report (30 July 2010) was approximately \u20ac722 million (Second ER of BCG, p. 17).\n\n1015.\n\nMr. Boulton's methodology and conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n\na. Mr. Boulton focused on the relationship between price and market share (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6\u00b6 5.25-5.70; Appendix 5.1). He first identified eleven factors that may have an impact on market share.208 Out of these, he identified six that could have been affected by revocation (including cost structure and price decisions). Mr. Boulton stated that the factor with \"most obvious\" impact on market share was cost structure,209 but testified that he had only quantified the effect of price decisions, because it was the only one for which he had sufficient empirical data:\n\n\"[A]t a high level, what I did was say: is there a relationship between price and market share? And the answer to that is statistically \"yes\". I then cross-checked that statistics to make sure it made sense with what third-party research shows, which it does. I then sought to identify what price rises were made in response to revocation. And having done that, I quantified: what was the impact of those price rises on sales? And then [...] having identified the lost sales, you identify how much margin was lost and what profits have been lost.\" (Tr., Day 9, 159 (Boulton))\n\nb. Mr. Boulton's empirical analysis only focused on lost sales for the Claimants' \"own branded soft drinks products\". Mr. Boulton identified five products within this larger \"soft drinks\" category: carbonated sugar drinks (CSDs), mineral water, still drinks,210 nectars and juices. Of these five products, he then narrowed the analysis down to three: CSDs, nectars and juices. According to his testimony, these were the only products for which he was able to obtain sufficiently reliable and detailed price and market share data (relying on AC Nielsen data which the expert found trustworthy). In particular, Mr. Boulton excluded from his calculations losses related to mineral water where, in his submission, there is an element of government control that impacts price, as well as losses related to still drinks (i.e., soft drinks other than those identified above, for which he had insufficient historical price data)211 (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6\u00b6 5.36-5.70; Tr., Day 9, 167-168).\n\nc. Mr. Boulton calculated that, over the period 2004-2009, lost profits for loss of market share for CSDs, juices and nectars amounted to \u20ac88 million. After netting out the effect of the higher margin obtained from raising prices, Mr. Boulton concluded that the net effect on the Claimants was a loss of \u20ac28 million (RON 119.3 million at the time of his report) (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6\u00b6 5.36-5.70, Tr. Day 9, 168).212\n\nd. To do this, Mr. Boulton calculated a \"but for\" market share: as he explained it, he used \"the results of [his] regression analysis to say: if the price increases hadn't been made, what sales would have been achieved -- they would have been higher -- and then putting that back in as what would they then have been as a proportion of the total market.\" His conclusion was that \"the claimants' market share would have declined more slowly over the period, converging when the sugar stockpile ran out in 2011. So I have assumed that there is no benefit after 2011.\" For this calculation, he assumed that the Claimants would have had the advantage of a sugar stockpile that would have allowed the Claimants to continue without increasing their prices (about 18 months) (Tr., Day 9, 169-171 (Boulton)).\n\ne. Mr. Boulton then extrapolated the profits lost with respect to the Claimants' soft drinks business (\u20ac28 million) to all the EFDG companies' products, using a ratio based on what percentage soft drinks sales had in the total group's sales (in Mr. Boulton's submission, soft drinks accounted for 42% of the total value of sales made by the EFDG213). The exact result of this extrapolation would have been \u20ac66 million, but he rounded it down to \u20ac60 million (RON 255.7 million), because not all the products have the same sugar inputs (he stated that he did not have the data to make an exact calculation). This number is based solely on sales of the Claimants' products within Romania, and based only on the effect of price increases (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 5.70; Appendix 5.1; Tr., Day 9, 177 (Boulton)).\n\nf. After arriving at this \u20ac60 million number, Mr. Boulton's overall conclusion (which he acknowledged was his subjective \"expert opinion\") was that the Claimants suffered a loss \"in excess of \u20ac100 million\" (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 5.99; Tr., Day 9, 177 (Boulton)). He justified this increase because in the original calculation:\n\ni. He did not take into account the impact of revocation on other factors that could affect market share, such as marketing, market share of other products, and the availability of working capital.\n\nii. He used data from AC Nielsen, a well known global marketing company, which \"almost certainly understates the size of the whole market\", making his calculations \"very conservative\".\n\niii. He ignored export markets, which were included in the much higher BCG calculation (Tr., Day 9, 178 (Boulton)).\n\ng. The \u20ac100 million refers to losses over the period running from January 2005 through mid-2011. Mr. Boulton explained that \"[i]t's certainly a convergence period post when the incentives would have ended, but on the assumption that there would have been a significant stockpile of sugar and prices would have come down and converged. But the vast majority of those losses are 2005-2009\" (Tr., Day 9, 221-222).\n\nThese eleven factors were: macroeconomic factors, market structure, barriers to entry, competitive behavior, price decisions, cost structure, existing knowledge of the market, an established distribution network, market share of other products, marketing and availability of working capital (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 5.24).\n\nWith respect to cost structure, Mr. Boulton explained: \"Of course, if the price of sugar goes up, then that changes the cost structure of the claimants' businesses for CSDs. That in turn is likely to affect price decisions and/or the ability to respond to competitive behaviour. It's much harder to maintain a price positioning below most of your competitors if you've lost your cost advantage.\" (Tr., Day 9, 157158 (Boulton)).\n\nIn some places, Mr. Boulton refers to still drinks simply as \"soft drinks\", which may lead to confusion (see, e.g., Mr. Boulton's Presentation at the Merits Hearing, Slide 19). In this section the Tribunal refers to them as \"still drinks\", which was the terminology used by Mr. Boulton in his expert report.\n\nFor these last two categories, Mr. Boulton stated that \"price rises may still have been made in response to the Revocation, but I have not included any losses as a result in my calculations\" (Mr. Boulton's Presentation at the Merits Hearing, Slide 19). See also Tr., Day 9, 218-219, where Mr. Boulton repeats that he has quantified no loss for mineral water.\n\nThis reflects the corrected figures submitted by Mr. Boulton on 17 August 2010 (Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 18 August 2010 and attachments).\n\nMr. Boulton refers to Appendix 5-1 of his report.\n\n1016.\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Boulton's analysis, if not with his full calculation. It seems difficult to dispute that the increased cost of raw materials caused by the revocation of the incentives would have an impact on the prices of the Claimants' products, thereby probably leading to a decrease in market share and lost sales, and consequently lost profits. As explained below, on the facts, the Tribunal finds that this has indeed been the case.\n\n1017.\n\nFirst, this claim focuses on profits deriving from a business that the Claimants were actually engaged in, and is calculated on the basis of profits actually made in the past. The Claimants had a proven record of profitability regarding the sale of their own branded goods.\n\n1018.\n\nThe Respondent's main criticism has rather to do with causation. Romania argues that Mr. Boulton's report is premised on the assumption that the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility caused the Claimants to raise the prices of their finished goods, which in turn caused them to lose market share. But this, according to Romania, is false.\n\na. First, Romania argues that the prices of EFDG products were rising as early as January 2004, long before revocation (which took place in February 2005), so there could be no causal link with revocation (R-PHB, \u00b6 300). Mr. Boulton accepts that the rise in prices predated revocation (starting in 2004), but states that his \"understanding is the price decisions made in 2004 were a response to first of all the rumours and then the announcement of revocation\" (Tr., Day 9, 200). Romania argues that Mr. Boulton admitted that this assumption was based entirely on the Claimants' witness evidence, which Romania argues is unreliable, but this is not entirely accurate. Mr. Boulton did not state that he relied exclusively on the Claimants' witness evidence; he also drew a conclusion (or an inference) from the evidential pattern and timing of the price increase. In addition, he noted that the loss of market share was not due only to an increase in prices in 2004, but to an inability to reverse them after revocation (Tr., Day 9, 200, 210-212 (Rubins/Boulton)).\n\nb. Second, Romania argues that price increases in 2004 could not have been a response to rumors or announcements of revocation, because the Miculas testified that in January 2004 they still did not believe that the incentives would be revoked. In fact, Ioan Micula testified that he first became concerned with the revocation at the beginning of 2004 after Prime Minister Nastase's interview on TV in January 2004, so the timing of the price increase is not inconsistent with his testimony (Tr., Day 2, 220 (I. Micula)). It is true however that Viorel Micula testified that he was not certain that the incentives would be withdrawn until the fall of 2004 (Tr., Day 4, 199 (V. Micula)).\n\nc. Third, Romania argues that the price increases in 2004 could not have been a response to rumors or announcements of revocation because Mr. Balog testified and Mr. Gamecho confirmed that the Claimants had purchased enough duty-free sugar to delay the economic effect of the repeal until the second half of 2006 (see First WS of C. Balog, \u00b6 7, Tr., Day 4, 28 (Gamecho)). Romania is correct: the witnesses did say that, and Mr. Boulton accepted that, if that was correct it \"must follow\" that the actual cost of sugar to the claimants wouldn't have risen until the end of 2006 (Tr., Day 9, 195-196).\n\n1019.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered Romania's arguments on causation. But absent another, more plausible explanation for this increase in prices, the Tribunal has difficulty rejecting the causation sequence used by Mr. Boulton. It is undisputed that the revocation of the incentives had an impact on the Claimants' costs. It cannot be seriously disputed that this cost increase eventually would have had an impact on their prices. The increase in the Claimants' prices started in January 2004, which coincides with Prime Minister Nastase's announcement of the revocation. Even if the Claimants had a stockpile that lasted them through 2006, they may have increased their prices to anticipate future losses or smooth out the rise of their prices. In any event, as Mr. Boulton testified, the issue is not just the increase in prices in 2004, but the Claimants' inability to lower them in the future. In any event, while this is a different question, Mr. Boulton only quantified damages after revocation (to be accurate, from January 2005) (Tr., Day 9, 196-197 (Rubins/ Boulton)).\n\n1020.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that, with respect to this particular claim, the Claimants have proved with sufficient certainty that, as a result of the revocation of the incentives, they were deprived of profits that they would otherwise have earned. The question that remains is: what is the value of this loss?\n\n1021.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Mr. Boulton's first step in the quantification of this claim, that is, his quantification of lost profits related to lost sales of soft drinks for \u20ac28 million. It finds Mr. Boulton's methodology and conclusions reliable and conservative to this point. In particular:\n\na. Mr. Boulton did not conclude that, but for revocation, the Claimants would have maintained their entire market share. Mr. Boulton conceded that there has been a significant fall in market share over the last five years.214 As a result he concluded that \"about half of that is referable to revocation, and about half of it is referable to all of the other competitive forces in the market and would have happened anyway\" (Tr., Day 9, 155 (Boulton)).\n\nb. Although he looked at prices that increased in 2004, he did not quantify damages prior to 1 January 2005. Indeed, he rejected the suggestion that he should have calculated damages since 2004 (when revocation was almost certain), stating:\n\n\"Yes, I think my clients would fairly put to me that I am being overly cautious. They would believe that a greater magnitude of the price increases were their response to revocation. I am seeking always to try to maintain, where things are uncertain, as much caution in my figures as I can.\" (Tr., Day 9, 167)\n\nc. Mr. Boulton used AC Nielsen data, which was lower than the Claimants' figures and the Euromonitor figures relied upon by BCG, and which may have understated the size of the market. This was because, in his view, AC Nielsen was the only data provider that gave him a full data set of the Claimants' sales and prices and their competitors, and to be rigorous he had to use this data consistently. However, he stated that this had a significant impact on his calculations: according to Mr. Boulton, if he had used Euromonitor, his calculation would have been more than \u20ac10 million higher every year (Tr., Day 9, 175-176 (Boulton)).\n\nd. Mr. Boulton ignored export markets in preparing his calculations, which the Tribunal finds appropriate considering that it is difficult to predict how the Claimants' products would have fared in export markets after EU accession.\n\nMr. Boulton testified that the fall in market share started in 2004, not in 2002 (Tr., Day 9, 164 (Boulton)). The Tribunal thus understands that, when Mr. Boulton states that market share has fallen \"over the last five years\", he is referring to the period 2004-2009.\n\n1022.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds Romania's additional criticisms of Mr. Boulton's report, to the extent that they refer to the first step of his analysis, unfounded. In particular, Romania argues that \"even if there had been an anti-temporal causal link between repeal in 2005 and increased prices in 2004, Mr Boulton's analysis would still be deeply flawed\", because he assumed that EFDG's entire loss of market share resulted from rising prices, and ignored the other 10 factors he identified that could affect market share\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 303). Mr. Boulton admitted that he has only quantified the effect of price increases, but denied that he has ignored the other factors or that this makes his quantification inaccurate. Specifically, Mr. Boulton explained: \"What I have done is calculate by how much the fall in market share was attributable to the relative price increases, and that is the pink line. Therefore, I am not ignoring, as has been suggested, all of the other factors that affect market share, because they are all in that line. They are all in the actual line and they are also all in my adjusted actual. All I have done is adjust for the effect of price increases\" (Tr., Day 9, 169, referring to slide 15 of his presentation). The Tribunal is satisfied with Mr. Boulton's response.\n\n1023.\n\nThe second and third steps of Mr. Boulton's analysis are however less straightforward.\n\n1024.\n\nTo recall, Mr. Boulton's second step in the analysis was to extrapolate the profits lost with respect to the Claimants' soft drinks business (\u20ac28 million) to all the EFDG companies' products, using a ratio based on what percentage soft drinks sales had in the total group's sales (42%). The exact result of this extrapolation would have been \u20ac66 million, but Mr. Boulton rounded it down to \u20ac60 million (RON 255.7 million), because not all the products have the same sugar inputs (he stated that he did not have the data to make an exact calculation) (Tr., Day 9, 177 (Boulton)).\n\n1025.\n\nAfter arriving at this number, Mr. Boulton went a step further, and concluded that the Claimants actually suffered a loss of at least \u20ac100 million. Mr. Boulton justified this increase in the original calculation (which he acknowledged was his subjective \"expert opinion\") because in the original calculation:\n\na. He did not take into account the impact of revocation on other factors that could affect market share, such as marketing, market share of other products, and the availability of working capital.\n\nb. He used AC Nielsen data, which \"almost certainly understates the size of the whole market\", making his calculations \"very conservative\".\n\nc. He ignored export markets, which were included in the much higher BCG calculation (Tr., Day 9, 178 (Boulton)).\n\n1026.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes both of these steps. First, Romania argues that Mr. Boulton extrapolated his estimate of \u20ac28 million for soft drinks across the EFDG's entire business, arriving at \u20ac60 million, but in so doing he included products (such as beer) which use no sugar. Mr. Boulton defended his position as follows:\n\n\"Q. Given that discussion we've just had, isn't it fair to say that \u20ac60 million extrapolated by a direct ratio, even rounded down, is bound to be an overstatement within the bounds of this calculation?\n\nA. Well, I think that's a fair question to put, because it's something I have worried about in thinking about how to get to those numbers.\n\nThe reason that I was comfortable with the conclusion I came to is partly because my five products include some for which I found nil effect. So if you like, if you look at my slide 18, the bottom-left quadrant includes big categories like alcohol and beer where the incentives would not have a big effect. But my top-left box from which I am extrapolating includes mineral water. So I haven't just chosen the products that are affected, like CSDs and extrapolated to all products; I have chosen a mix of products, including mineral water, for which I've quantified no loss, and extrapolated that across all products.\n\nSo it's not, I think, as open to criticism as you are suggesting. It is uncertain; I tried to say that. It's why I round it down.\n\nThe other factor is, of course, the price increases may have been put through on other products, even where there wasn't the direct raw material cost impact coming through. Essentially pricing decisions were made in response to revocation, even where there wasn't that raw material impact.\n\nSo could I argue that 60 million was definitely a better number than 50 million? No. Am I comfortable that I considered the relevant factors in coming to my conclusion? Yes.\n\nQ. When you say \"comfortable\", you think it's probable that that's the right number, that is the amount, \u20ac60 million?\n\nA. That would be my best estimate of what the loss was across these 14 categories, before taking into account the other factors that I look at about total size of the market and other impacts of revocation on market share.\"\n\n(Tr., Day 9, 218-219)\n\n1027.\n\nRomania also argues that Mr. Boulton \"inflated\" his \u20ac60 million figure to a level in excess of \u20ac100 million \"without any support or explanation\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 304), adding that this \u20ac100 million figure is a \"guess, based on no calculations whatsoever\" (RPHB, \u00b6 214).\n\n1028.\n\nThe Tribunal has duly noted Romania's objections. However, it is evident to the Tribunal that the Claimants' losses under this claim are not limited to \u20ac28 million lost in relation to soft drinks. It is undisputed that the Claimants sold other products that did contain sugar, whose prices would have been affected by the increased cost of sugar. As noted in paragraph 1008 above, once the fact of damage has been established, the Tribunal has wide discretion to establish its exact amount, provided that the Claimants have provided a basis for that calculation.\n\n1029.\n\nIn the absence of exact data related to other sugar-containing products, the Tribunal accepts that an extrapolation may be appropriate. However, Mr. Boulton's analysis is premised on the assumption that an increased cost of sugar caused an increase in prices of certain products. It is thus not reasonable to extrapolate the profits lost on soft drinks containing sugar to products that do not contain sugar. The Tribunal is not fully satisfied with Mr. Boulton's explanation, cited above, as to why that extrapolation was reasonable. For the same reason, the Tribunal cannot agree with Mr. Boulton's conclusion that \u20ac28 million accurately reflects the losses related to an increased cost of sugar for 42% of the Claimants' total sales, because that 42% includes mineral water, which does not contain sugar.215 According to the table provided on page 5 of Appendix 5-1 to Mr. Boulton's report, sugar-containing soft drinks (that is, CSDs, other soft drinks and juices/nectars) account for 32.76% of the Claimants' total sales over the period 2004-2008).216 The Tribunal therefore rejects the specific calculations in the extrapolation carried out by Mr. Boulton.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Claimants' entire soft drinks business (including the five categories identified by Mr. Boulton in para. 1018(b) above) account for 42% of the Claimants' total sales. See Table A5-1.1 in Appendix 5-1 of Mr. Boulton's report, p. 5.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this table does not distinguish between CSDs and still drinks, so it assumes they both categories fall under the label \"soft drinks\".\n\n1030.\n\nInstead, and in the exercise of its discretion in the calculation of damages, the Tribunal will extrapolate the Claimants' losses in sugar-containing soft drinks to the Claimants' other sugar-containing products. In the absence of an exact breakdown of what products contain sugar, the Tribunal has assumed that the following categories of products identified in Table A5-1.1 of Appendix 5-1 of Mr. Boulton's report contain sugar in some measure: soft drinks, juices and nectars, alcoholic drinks, biscuits, tomato sauce/ketchup, co-extruded products, breakfast cereals, and sticks. Based on the information provided in Table A5-1.1 of Mr. Boulton's report, the Tribunal has concluded that sugar-containing soft drinks account for approximately 54% of the EFDG's total sales in sugar-containing products (which amount to approximately 850 million over a period between 2004 and 2008). If the losses calculated by Mr. Boulton for sugar-containing soft drinks (i.e., \u20ac28 million) are then extrapolated to the remaining sugar-containing product line, the result is \u20ac51.6 million.217\n\nThe Tribunal will not set out in detail its calculations. It suffices to say that the results of the Tribunal's calculations are confirmed by the fact that 54% (i.e., the percentage of sugar-containing soft drinks in the EFDG's total sales of sugar containing products) of \u20ac51.6 million (the Tribunal's calculation of overall losses in sugar-containing products) is \u20ac28 million (Mr. Boulton's calculation of losses in sugar-containing soft-drinks).\n\n1031.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Mr. Boulton's third step, in which he concludes that the Claimants actually suffered a loss of at least \u20ac100 million. Mr. Boulton conceded that he was unable to quantify this step, which is testimony to his professional integrity; however, the Tribunal is not prepared to accept an increase of \u20ac40 million (equivalent to 67% of the amount he arrives to for the entire product line) solely on the basis of Mr. Boulton's \"subjective expert opinion\" (Tr., Day 9, 177 (Boulton)). In addition, the Tribunal finds that the arguments advanced by Mr. Boulton in order to reach this number are not satisfactory for the following reasons:\n\na. The fact that Mr. Boulton used conservative data, such as AC Nielsen data, should not be used as a reason to inflate the results by 67%. If the use of conservative figures is deemed warranted and justified, this approach should not be reversed subsequently, especially on the basis of assumptions, even where -as in this case - the assumptions are based on the expert's professional experience.\n\nb. Similarly, Mr. Boulton himself stated that he was unable to quantify exactly the impact of the revocation on other factors that could affect market share, such as marketing, market share of other products, and the availability of working capital. In these circumstances, there is no sufficient factual basis for Mr. Boulton's final number, and an increase of 67% appears unjustified.\n\nc. Given the uncertainties that the Claimants' business would have faced after Romania entered the EU, the Tribunal does not believe that it would be appropriate to consider export markets in its calculation of damages.\n\n1032.\n\nThat being said, although Mr. Boulton has failed to prove that the Claimants have suffered a loss of \u20ac100 million, the factors outlined in the preceding paragraph suffice to convince the Tribunal that the Claimants have lost profits in excess of \u20ac51.6 million as a result of lost sales of finished goods. In particular, the Tribunal is satisfied that the revocation of the incentives must have had an impact on other factors that could affect market share, such as marketing, market share of other products and the availability of working capital, an impact which Mr. Boulton was unable to quantify. The Tribunal is not well-positioned to quantify the economic impact of factors that the expert himself was unable to quantify, however, it is satisfied that an additional damage was indeed suffered. Having reached that conclusion, and in the exercise of its discretion to quantify damages, the Tribunal is prepared to return to the initial figure proposed by Mr. Boulton in his second step, that is, \u20ac60 million.\n\n1033.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal values the lost profits suffered by the Claimants for lost sales of finished goods at \u20ac60 million. In his report, Mr. Boulton calculates this to be equivalent to RON 255.7 million at the exchange rate of the date of his report (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 5.70).218 The Claimants have made their claims in RON; as a result, the Tribunal finds that it would be improper to use a different exchange rate and will in particular derive the consequences from this finding when it comes to compute the interest on the claims. Thus, the Tribunal values the lost profits suffered by the Claimants for lost sales of finished goods in RON, namely at RON 255.7 million.\n\nIndeed, although Mr. Boulton quantifies the claim in Euro, his model was principally denominated in RON. Mr. Boulton explains that \"[w]ith the exception of transportation and distribution costs, my model is denominated in RON. I have converted the RON values into Euros on a monthly basis in my model. However, for illustrative purposes here, I have used the 30 July 2010 \u20ac:RON exchange rate [equivalent to 1:4.26179, as noted in \u00b6 5.69] to convert my Euro denominated calculations back into RON\" (ER of R. Boulton, fn. 125, p. 54).\n\n**c. Lost profits on sales of sugar containing products (SCPs)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1034.\n\nIn addition to their claim for lost profits on sales of finished goods, the Claimants claim lost profits on sales of sugar containing products (\"SCPs\") following the revocation of the incentives, in the amount of RON 492.3 million (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 162-170). This claim is cumulatively based on:\n\na. The calculations contained in section 4 of Mr. Osborne's first report and paragraphs 4.25 and 4.31 in particular;\n\nb. The calculations contained in section 5 of Mr. Osborne's second report;\n\nc. The calculations contained in Dr. Fry's reports of December 2009 and July 2010; and\n\nd. The evidence referred to in the abovementioned sections and reports, including paragraph 69 of Mr. Viorel Micula's witness statement dated 22 December 2009, paragraphs 82 and 124 of Mr. Halbac's witness statement dated 22 December 2009, paragraph 17 of Mr. Halbac's witness statement dated 30 July 2010, and exhibits CO-1.19 and CO-13.1.\n\n1035.\n\nThis claim can be summarized as follows. Relying on the evidence cited above, the Claimants assert that, from 2005, they planned on manufacturing SCPs and selling those SCPs to industrial third parties. They further assert that, as a result of the revocation of the incentives, they were unable to do so. As a result, they now claim for the lost profits they would have allegedly made had they been able to sell SCPs to third parties.\n\n1036.\n\nFor the quantification of this claim, the Claimants rely on the expert reports prepared by Dr. Fry (of LMC International) and Mr. Osborne (of FTI). In fact, the quantification analysis is carried out by Dr. Fry; Mr. Osborne has adopted his estimates, added interest and grossed-up for taxes (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.31; Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 5.3, 1.19).\n\n1037.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Fry asserts that the SCP opportunity would have been worth \u20ac131 million to the Claimants had they been able to take advantage of it (Second ER of J. Fry, p. 5). Dr. Fry's quantification is based on the following main assumptions (some of which are the result of his own expert opinion):\n\na. That, with the price advantage the Raw Materials Incentive would have given the Claimants, they would have been able to capture 90% of the Romanian SCP market (excluding sales of SCPs from domestic sugar beet production, with about half of the market captured in 2005). The Claimants argue that Dr. Fry has successfully responded to all criticisms leveled at this conclusion (see C-PHB, \u00b6 164).\n\nb. That the Claimants, in taking advantage of the SCP opportunity, would not have undermined or come into conflict with the EU's sugar regime. This is because the EU's sugar regime defends a reference price and in so doing provides the Commission with mechanisms to deal with all kinds of events (see C-PHB, \u00b6 165).\n\n1038.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants assert that \"[a]t no stage of the proceedings has the Respondent ever alleged that sales of SCPs to industrial third parties would have been unlawful under Romanian law or outside what was permitted pursuant to the EGO 24 regime\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 168).\n\n1039.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that \"the additional capacity to enable the Claimants to engage in sales of SCPs would have attracted a premium in the valuation of the European Food and Drinks Companies prior to Revocation. This capacity gave the Claimants an option to generate incremental cash from a structural cost advantage relative to other sugar suppliers in the market and as such, would definitely have had a value\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 170). However, they do not attempt to give a value to this premium.\n\n1040.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes this claim for the following reasons (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 244-254; R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23):\n\na. First, the Respondent argues that there is no evidentiary support for this claim. It notes that, in the five years during which the Claimants had access to the Raw Materials Incentive, no SCPs were ever marketed or sold to an industrial third party. Likewise, the Respondent notes that there is no contemporaneous evidence in the record reflecting the alleged intention to pursue the SCP opportunity. The Respondent argues that this claim is premised solely on Mr. Viorel Micula's and Mr. Halbac's testimony, which it characterizes as unreliable.\n\nb. Second, for this same reason, the Respondent argues that there is no evidence of the scale upon which the SCP opportunity would have allegedly been pursued.\n\nc. Third, the Respondent argues that the assumptions that underlie Dr. Fry's calculations are unreasonable. In particular, the Respondent contends that it is unreasonable to assume that the EFDG would have captured 90% of the Romanian market, on the further assumption that the EFDG's competitors (including Coca-Cola) would have been willing to purchase SCPs from EFDG and that all sugar producers capable of producing SCPs would have allowed their businesses to be wiped out (with the exception of sugar beet producers, who would have been able to survive on break-even margins). The Respondent also argues that it is unreasonable to assume that this strategy would have been legal as a matter of Romanian and EU law, or that Romania would have been able to maintain the customs duty exemption until March 2009 (R-PHB, \u00b6 247).\n\n1041.\n\nAfter analyzing the evidence before it, the Tribunal rejects this claim. In particular, it finds that the Claimants have not proved with sufficient certainty that, but for the revocation, they would have earned profits as a result of sales of SCPs to industrial third parties. First, it is undisputed that the Claimants never sold SCPs to industrial third parties (Section (i) below). Second, the Claimants have not proven that they would have in fact engaged in the business of selling SCPs to industrial third parties (Section (ii) below). The Tribunal therefore does not need to address the quantum of the alleged lost profits.\n\n**i. The Claimants never sold SCPs to industrial third parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1042.\n\nIt is uncontested that the Claimants never sold SCPs to industrial third parties. Mr. Osborne stated in his first report and confirmed at the hearing that \"[t]he opportunity to sell sugar-based products is not one that was ever pursued. The objective of the Micula brothers had rather been to build higher value-added businesses including manufacturing finished goods\" (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.26; Tr., Day 10, 66-67 (Osborne)).\n\n1043.\n\nIn this respect, Mr. Halbac and Mr. Osborne both acknowledged that European Food only sold SCPs to other members of the EFDG. Specifically:\n\na. Mr. Osborne states that \"[p]rior to revocation, European Food was processing sugar and selling intermediate sugar products to industrial users, in the way posited by LMC, although primarily to European Drinks\" (Second ER of C. Osborne \u00b6 5.5). Mr. Osborne cites Exh. CO-19.1, but this exhibit only reflects sales of SCPs from European Food to other EFDG companies (specifically, European Drinks and Original Prod SRL).\n\nb. Mr. Halbac states that \"European Food has been selling intermediate sugar products to industrial users since 2000, when it first began selling sugar syrup\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 3), but then he clarifies that \"[w]hile many of European Food's customer's [sic] were EFDG related companies, this does not change the fact that European Food was well versed in selling intermediate products. Further, European Food had been selling these products to unrelated third party customers for some time before revocation, contrary to Romania's position\" *(Id*., note 3). But Mr. Halbac does not say that European Food sold *SCPs* to industrial third party customers.\n\nc. Indeed, Mr. Halbac was not able to cite to a single invoice clearly reflecting sales of SCPs to industrial third party customers. All invoices cited refer either to sales of SCPs to other EFDG companies, or sales of other intermediate products (not SCPs) to third parties. Specifically:\n\ni. Exh. C-840, C-841, C-842 and C-839 contain invoices for sugar syrup sales from European Food to European Drinks from 2002 to 2005.\n\nii. Exh. C-954 to C-958 are all bulk sales invoices for wafers, cocoa, and other sugar products from European Food to TGIE (another member of the EFDG) from 2002 to 2005.\n\niii. Mr. Halbac cites one invoice that could refer to sales to third parties, but the names are illegible and no translation was provided (Exh. C-959). In any event, most of the products may not be SCPs (e.g., tomato paste, ketchup, mustard, cereals), although there appears to be some reference to products containing cocoa, which presumably could involve SCPs. Importantly, there appears to be no mention of sugar syrup. The Tribunal cannot confirm, especially as the document is in Romanian.\n\n1044.\n\nGiven that no sales of SCPs to industrial third parties were proven to have been made, it also was not proven that the Claimants ever earned profits as a result of this activity. Thus, there is no proven record of profitability to support the Claimants' lost profits claim. As stated at paragraph 1010 above, the absence of a proven record of profitability need not necessarily be fatal to a lost profits claim. However, in this particular case the Claimants have not met their burden of proving that they would have in fact engaged in the business of selling SCPs to industrial third parties, as discussed below.\n\n**ii. The Claimants have not proven that they would have in fact engaged in the business of selling SCPs to industrial third parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1045.\n\nThe evidence in the record does not support, with the requisite degree of certainty, a finding that the Claimants would have in fact pursued the SCP opportunity. None of the Claimants' experts could identify any contemporaneous evidence of an intention to pursue the SCP opportunity (Tr., Day 8, 46 (Lessard); Tr., Day 10, 66-70 (Osborne); Tr., Day 11, 224-225 (Fry)). The Claimants rely heavily on witness evidence, in particular by Mr. Viorel Micula and Mr. Halbac, but the Tribunal finds this evidence unconvincing.\n\n1046.\n\nMr. Viorel Micula simply asserts that \"[f]rom 2005, we had planned on manufacturing from raw sugar, sugar-based products such as sugar syrup, and then selling these sugar-based products to industrial third-parties\" (Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6 69). Mr. Viorel Micula does not cite any documentary evidence.\n\n1047.\n\nIn his second witness Statement, Mr. Halbac testifies that the Claimants intended to sell SCPs to third party industrial consumers (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). In that statement, he links the expansion of the chocolate cream line, done in December 2004 (although according to him it was planned since 2002) to an increased capacity to process sugar and produce SCPs, thus allegedly allowing for sales of SCPs. He also suggests that EFDG was already selling SCPs to industrial consumers (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 3-7), but as stated above, this only referred to customers within the EFDG. Mr. Halbac also testifies that EFDG had the capacity to produce, sell and distribute SCPs to third parties (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 25-55).\n\n1048.\n\nThe Tribunal has several comments on Mr. Halbac's statements. First, it is puzzling that Mr. Halbac did not mention sales of SCPs to third parties in his First Witness Statement. There Mr. Halbac referred only to the internal use of SCPs by EFDG companies (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17; 81-120). Mr. Halbac did make one statement at paragraph 118 of his First Witness Statement that could potentially have referred to sales of SCPs (specifically, chocolate cream) to third parties, but this is unclear.219 In any event, in his First Witness Statement he makes no mention of sugar syrup, which is a crucial aspect of the Claimants' SCP claim.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Halbac stated that \"[w]hen we extended the chocolate cream line, we were planning for future developments such as the chocolate tablet line, the cream filled biscuit line, and the bulk delivery of chocolate cream for patisseries or other food producers. However, these projects were never realized due to the fact that we lost the EGO raw materials incentive\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 118).\n\n1049.\n\nSecond, Mr. Halbac's statements do not prove that the Claimants had the capacity to sell SCPs to third parties at the scale assumed by Dr. Fry, Prof. Lessard and Mr. Osborne. Indeed, although Mr. Halbac's statements could support the assertion that the December 2004 expansion of the chocolate cream line was sufficient to sell chocolate cream to industrial third parties, it does not support the conclusion that this expansion gave the Claimants sufficient capacity to sell powdered sugar or sugar syrup to industrial customers.\n\na. With respect to sugar syrup, Mr. Halbac states that \"[b]efore the December 2004 expansion, we did not have the capacity to sell powdered sugar to industrial consumers. To prepare for these sales, we expanded our handling system with additional Reimelt and Wiener equipment. This equipment is identified in the attached diagram\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 23). However, the \"attached diagram\" (Exh. C-848) is an unsigned diagram in English, dated 09.04.03, that does not prove that the equipment was actually bought and installed.\n\nb. Similarly, neither Mr. Halbac's statements nor the evidence cited prove that the Claimants had the capacity to sell sugar syrup to third party industrial customers. Mr. Halbac merely states that \"[i]n addition to powdered sugar products and chocolate cream, EFDG planned to extend its sale of sugar syrup to third party industrial consumers. As previously stated, European Food was already selling significant amounts of sugar syrup to European Drinks for the soft drink production. These sales were processed just as they would be if European Food sold sugar syrup to a completely unrelated company, and each sale was invoiced.\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 24). There is no reference to how the 2004 expansion of the chocolate cream line could have impacted the production of sugar syrup. Perhaps the implication is that the Claimants already had that capacity. However, as stated above, European Food never did sell sugar syrup to industrial third parties. If this was such a profitable venture and the Claimants already had the capacity to do so, it is difficult to understand why they did not pursue this opportunity before. There is no credible contemporaneous evidence that the Claimants contemplated or made any preparatory work for the sale of sugar syrup or significant quantities of SCPs to third-party industrial users, be it in or outside Romania. One would for instance have expected some internal correspondence or exchanges of memos as to the abandonment or alteration of such plans in relation to the repeal of the incentives.\n\n1050.\n\nIn turn, Mr. Osborne's position seems to be that the SCP opportunity was possible and valuable for the Claimants, and given their financial constraints he concludes that they would have \"undoubtedly\" pursued it. Specifically, Mr. Osborne makes the following statements:\n\na. \"With the EGO 24/1998 raw materials incentive in place, the Claimant Companies ***could have made*** additional sales of sugar-based products to industrial users of sugar outside of the Companies controlled by the individual Claimants, in the same way that it does to Companies that are controlled by the Claimants. Post revocation of the raw materials incentive however, its cost advantage in the purchase of sugar for processing into such products had been removed.\" (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.25, emphasis added)\n\nb. \"The opportunity to sell sugar-based products is not one that was ever pursued. The objective of the Micula brothers had rather been to build higher value-added businesses including manufacturing finished goods. Given the financial constraints that the Companies are now under, however, the opportunity ***would have been valuable***, and ***would undoubtedly have been exploited*** \" (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.26; emphasis added).\n\nc. \"Selling intermediate sugar products to industrial customers that were not under common ownership was not the brothers' primary strategy from the outset of the EGO 24/1998 investment programme. However, it was an ***obvious potential source of significant incremental cash flow*** should the risks they were taking in investing in new businesses and new facilities crystallise on the downside, as they did\" (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 5.1, emphasis added).\n\nd. \"During 2004 when the EBITDA contribution of European Food and soft drinks declined, and the import duty on refined sugar was doubled to 90%, the brothers were preparing to process and sell intermediate sugar products in large quantities to third parties. ***The brothers believed that this would allow them to avoid financial constraints*** within the corporate Claimants, and any negative effects on the other companies they owned\" (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 5.2. Mr. Osborne relies here on the Third WS of V. Micula, \u00b6 69, emphasis added).\n\ne. \"Given the value of the opportunity, as set out by LMC, it appears to me that ***the*** ***natural assumption is that the opportunity would have been pursued***, at least at the point at which it became important to the financial well-being of the Companies\" (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 5.6).\n\nf. \"The EGO 24/1998 incentives allowed the corporate Claimants to sell intermediate sugar products to industrial customers. In fact sales of such products were only ever made to companies under common ownership, but ***there was scope to sell to third parties had the need arisen***. This could have been highly cash generative, especially towards the end of the original incentives period after Romania's accession to the EU\" (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 7.28).\n\n1051.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Mr. Halbac's or Mr. Osborne's statements as proof with sufficient certainty that the Claimants would have in fact sold SCPs to third parties. Even if the Claimants had the capacity to do so, capacity alone does not provide sufficient certainty that an opportunity would have been pursued and that it would have been profitable. Nor can Mr. Osborne's assertions as to the reasonableness of this plan establish with sufficient certainty that the Claimants would have in fact pursued the SCP opportunity. Reasonable and viable as it may have been, Mr. Osborne is only speculating. In the Tribunal's view, this does not meet the standard of sufficient certainty. Excellent prospects of profitability may contribute to prove that an opportunity would have existed, especially from the vantage point of retrospective view rather than actual prediction, but this is still a far cry from demonstrating that this opportunity could and would have been availed of.\n\n1052.\n\nThe Tribunal is likewise not persuaded by the Claimants' explanations for the lack of documentary evidence. Relying on Mr. Boulton, the Claimants argue that it is \"completely unrealistic\" to treat the EFDG companies as though they are quoted public companies with documents prepared for every single decision, plan and aspect of the business. Although this may be true, this does not dispense with the requirement of proving their lost profits case with sufficient certainty. The Claimants also quote Prof. Lessard, who stated that \"as an economic matter, the fact that Claimants invested to develop this capacity and the related product standards and permits is stronger evidence of their intent than would be internal memoranda, corporate resolutions, or other formalities\" (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 57). The Tribunal also accepts that in theory this could be true. However, it has found no convincing evidence that the Claimants indeed invested specifically with the purpose of developing this capacity. Although there is evidence that they invested to expand the chocolate cream line, it is unclear whether this gave them the capacity to sell SCPs (especially sugar syrup and powdered sugar) to industrial third parties at the scale that they allege. And even if they had this capacity, this is not in itself proof that they intended to produce different types of SCPs in large quantities to sell to industrial third parties.\n\n1053.\n\nThe Tribunal is also troubled by the fact the timing of the alleged SCP opportunity. In particular, if this opportunity was so attractive, why did the Claimants not pursue it earlier?\n\n1054.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there are \"proper explanations as to why the SCP opportunity was not pursued prior to the unlawful premature revocation of the Incentives\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 167). According to the Claimants:\n\na. The evidence shows, and both Professor Lessard and Mr. Osborne explained during the course of the hearing, that the reason why the SCP opportunity became attractive at the start of 2005 is that the customs duties on sugar doubled at about that time (Exh. C-805; Tr., Day 8, 22 (Lessard); Tr., Day 10, 67 (Osborne); Second ER of D. Lessard, Exhibit A).\n\nb. As explained by Mr. Osborne, the SCP opportunity, being reliant on the Raw Materials Incentive, was not a long-term business proposition but instead was helpful for cash generation. The suggestion seems to be that it was not necessary to pursue it before the Claimants became cash constrained (Tr., Day 10, 67-68 (Osborne)).\n\nc. Mr Osborne also explained that as the financial ratios of the European Food and Drinks Companies were starting to decline by 2005 (though they were not poor), the SCP opportunity and its ability to be highly cash generative became more attractive (Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 5.2).\n\nd. Additionally, it was only after the expansion of the Claimants' sugar production facilities was completed in December 2004 that the Claimants had sufficient capacity to produce and sell SCPs to industrial third parties in addition to selling their private label goods (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 23).\n\n1055.\n\nThe Tribunal has the following comments:\n\na. First, if the SCP opportunity only became attractive in 2005 because of an increase in customs duties, it can hardly have been part of the Claimants' original plan. Thus, there was no ongoing investment plan that was frustrated by revocation.\n\nb. Second, by 2005 revocation had already been announced. Thus, the SCP opportunity cannot be said to have properly existed pre-revocation.\n\nc. Third, the expansion of the chocolate cream line (which purports to serve as intention of pursuing this opportunity) was made in December 2004. If the SPC opportunity only became attractive in 2005 because of an increase in customs duties in 2005, the purpose of the chocolate cream line expansion must have been other than pursuing the SCP opportunity. Indeed, Mr. Halbac asserts that this had been planned as early as 2002 (*see* Second WS of M. Halbac, fn. 8 at \u00b6 19).\n\n1056.\n\nIn view of the above, there does not appear to be in the record sufficient evidence of existing and concrete plans rather than, in the most favorable hypothesis for the Claimants, some general speculations that the Claimants might have gone into such sales if certain events would have materialized. In addition, at best, this opportunity appears to have been thought of when the revocation became imminent, as a life saver of sorts to help the Claimants out of financial distress, a mitigating measure to obtain cash flows in times of financial constraint. Indeed, Mr. Osborne's comments cited at paragraph 1050 above seem to suggest this. This is also confirmed by the following statements by Mr. Osborne:\n\n\"1.13 My own view remains that the Claimants had the ***motive, the means and the opportunity*** to generate significant profits from expanding the sales of intermediate sugar products. As I have said, the existence of the opportunity does not appear to me to be contested; and Professor Lessard has dealt with the question of whether the Claimants had the means to take advantage of that opportunity.\n\n1.14 The fact that the Claimants had not done so, prior to revocation, goes in my view to the question of *motive*. Mr Ellison suggests that it is odd that the \"quasi-arbitrage opportunity\" was not pursued, prior to revocation, given the high profits apparently available and the low associated risk.\n\n1.15 I do not find it odd: nothing in the history of the Claimants' operations in Romania suggests to me that the Claimants were motivated to maximise either short-term profitability or personal gain; and all of the interactions that I have had during the course of multiple site visits have suggested the reverse - that they were motivated primarily to build a long term, sustainable business.\n\n1.16 For much of the period up to revocation, ***that motivation would not*** ***have been compatible with the exploitation of the opportunity to expand sales of intermediate sugar products***. Once the Claimants started to become financially constrained, however, the motivations would have been precisely aligned, since the survival of the underlying and potentially sustainable business would have been at stake.\n\n1.17 To repeat a point that I have made before, it appears to me that ***the*** ***natural assumption is that the Claimants would have taken*** ***advantage of the opportunity, as soon as it became expedient or necessary to do so***. As I demonstrate in Section 6 of this report, ***it did indeed become necessary, for reasons connected with the scale of the investments undertaken by the Claimants***.\"\n\n(Second ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6\u00b6 1.13-1.17).\n\n1057.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Mr. Osborne's conclusions as sufficient evidence of intent to pursue the SCP opportunity. Even if the Claimants had the motive, the means and the opportunity to generate profits from expanding the sales of SCPs to third parties, this does not provide sufficient certainty that, but for the revocation, the Claimants would in fact have engaged in the sale of SCPs to third parties. Absent other convincing evidence in this respect, the Tribunal dismisses this claim.\n\n**d. Lost profits incurred as a result of the Claimants' inability to complete the Incremental Investments**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Overview of the Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1058.\n\nThe Claimants' primary expectation damages case (Method A) is premised on the existence of an alleged ten-year plan to capitalize on the incentives and to complete an expanded manufacturing platform that would have performed profitably after the incentives expired (C-PHB, \u00b6 97). This platform allegedly included a malt manufacturing plant, a can manufacturing plant, and a co-generation plant (which the Claimants collectively call the \"Incremental Investments\"). As part of Method A, the Claimants claim the profits that these Incremental Investments would have generated but for the revocation.\n\n1059.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Claimants never implemented the Incremental Investments. The Claimants are requesting, in their own words, \"damages for lost cash flows that Claimants expected to receive from certain projects that they intended to implement as part of their business plan, and would have implemented, but for the premature revocation of the incentives\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 595, emphasis in original). Specifically, the Claimants claim:\n\na. RON 28 million in lost profits from the inability to complete a **malt manufacturing plant**. They base this claim on Prof. Lessard's first and second reports (First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 97-99, Fig. 22, Table 7; Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 99-103, 113-122, Fig. 16), the evidence cited in those reports, including Mr. Halbac's two witness statements, and the figures contained in Updated Summary of Damages Separating Interest (in RON), Tab 2 of Mr. Schwartz's Opening Presentation;\n\nb. RON 720.4 million in lost profits from inability to complete a **can manufacturing plant**. The Claimants base this claim on Prof. Lessard's first and second reports (First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 105-110, Fig. 23, Table 9 and 10; Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 104-107, 113-122); Prof. Steenkamp's Expert Report, including Table 15; the evidence cited in those reports, including Mr. Halbac's two witness statements, and the figures contained in Updated Summary of Damages Separating Interest (in RON), Tab 2 of Mr. Schwartz's Opening Presentation.\n\nc. RON 712.6 million from the inability to complete a **co-generation plant**. They base this claim on Prof. Lessard's first and second expert reports (First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 100-104 Table 4; Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 108-111); the evidence cited in those reports, including Mr. Baciu's witness statement, and figures contained in Updated Summary of Damages Separating Interest (in RON), Tab 2 of Mr. Schwartz's Opening Presentation.\n\n1060.\n\nThe Claimants assert that they had planned to implement the Incremental Investments, and had in fact taken steps towards their implementation, but the revocation of the incentives deprived them of both the cash and financing leverage necessary to \"complete\" these Incremental Investments. Relying on the principle of full reparation enshrined in Article 31 of the ILC Articles, as articulated by the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case, the Claimants' argument is that, but for the revocation, they would have implemented the Incremental Investments; consequently, to put them back in the position they would have been but for the revocation, the Tribunal should award them the future net cash flows that these plants would have generated.\n\n1061.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to prove with reasonable or sufficient certainty their claims for lost profits related to the Incremental Investments.\n\n1062.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that there is no proof that the Incremental Investments would have been undertaken at all. The Respondent notes that Prof. Lessard, despite multiple site visits, meetings with the Claimants' employees, and having relied on much of the information provided by the Claimants, testified that he considered the Incremental Investments to be merely \"plausible\" (by which he appeared to mean that they would have made \"economic sense\"), but was unwilling to characterize them as \"probable\" (Tr., Day 8, 40-2), which the Respondent argues is the minimal standard under international law. Contrary to the Claimants' suggestion, the Respondent denies that all that remained was to \"complete\" the Incremental Investments. The Respondent argues that to make this assertion the Claimants have mischaracterized the documentary evidence and manipulated witness testimony.\n\n1063.\n\nSecond, even if there was no doubt that the Incremental Investments would have been undertaken, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot meet the sufficient certainty standard to establish that they would have been profitable, or what would have been the level of such projected profits, because the Incremental Investments were not going concerns and had no proven record of profitability. As noted above, the Respondent submits that international law precludes any award of prospective damages for projects that have not commenced, and that the reasonable certainty standard cannot be satisfied in the absence of a going concern and a proven record of profitability.\n\n1064.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to prove that the revocation of the incentives was the dominant or proximate cause of their failure to implement the Incremental Investments. The Respondent argues that the financial distress that allegedly prevented the Claimants from implementing the Incremental Investments is attributable to causes other than the revocation of the incentives.\n\n**ii. The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n1065.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' claims for lost profits allegedly incurred as a result of their inability to complete the Incremental Investments. It is undisputed that none of the facilities that would have allegedly generated the lost profits claimed (i.e., the malt plant, the canning plant and the cogeneration plant) existed in their complete, revenue-generating form at the time of revocation. Instead, the Claimants claim that they intended to build these facilities, and that these facilities were at various stages of completion. The Claimants also argue that the Incremental Investments were consistent with their integrated business model, and submit this as further proof of their intention to complete these facilities. However, after an analysis of the record, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to prove with sufficient certainty that they would have indeed implemented the Incremental Investments that serve as the basis for this lost profits claim.\n\n1066.\n\nIn the following sections, the Tribunal addresses the evidence and arguments submitted by the Claimants with respect to each of the Incremental Investments, as well as their general arguments with respect to their integrated business model and advance planning for the Incremental Investments.\n\n*(a) The Claimants\u2019 integrated business model - Advance planning for the Incremental Investments*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1067.\n\nIn support of their intention to implement the Incremental Investments, the Claimants contend that the Incremental Investments were necessary to the success of the Claimants' overall business model, which they argue was designed to take advantage of the incentives' ten-year duration to build out a manufacturing platform that would be sustainable upon the expiry of the incentives in 2009. The Claimants argue that the Incremental Investments were tied to the brewery, which they claim was also an integral part of their plan for retaining profitability beyond the expiry of the incentives in 2009, because beer was not as dependent on the incentives as their soft drinks or food business. Specifically, they argue that:\n\na. The malt manufacturing plant would have improved the cost effectiveness of the brewery, improving the Claimants' competitiveness in the beer market;\n\nb. The can manufacturing plant would have permitted the Claimants to competitively expand their beer sales into the private label market; and\n\nc. The co-generation plant would have capitalized on the brewery's waste products to reduce the Claimants' overall energy costs and improve the Claimants' cost and price competitiveness. It would have also provided revenue from the sale of energy and green certificates to third parties.\n\n(C-PHB, \u00b6 171; Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; First and Second WS of S. Baciu).\n\n1068.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their model was driven by both the ten-year term of the incentives and the 20-year obligation to continue operations in the disfavored region imposed by EGO 24 (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 172-173). This assertion is supported mainly by:\n\na. Mr. Ioan Micula's oral testimony, where he states that their strategy after 1999 was \"to use the temporary facilities for ten years to turn them into permanent advantages. [...] By way of these temporary facilities, we tried in fact to turn them into permanent standing facilities by building up those components of the equipment that could be used after termination of the facilities\" (Tr., Day 3, 33-35 (I. Micula)).\n\nb. Prof. Lessard's description of the Claimants' business model, which he explains \"involved a high degree of commitment [\u2026] because the Claimants had to build factories and produce successful products well within the ten-year period that the Incentives were available in order to create a base that would sustain their activities for the ten years they were obligated to remain in business after the Incentives expired\" (First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 39).\n\n1069.\n\nThe Claimants argue that these facilities made economic sense in the context of their integrated platform and would have been easy to \"plug in\" to that platform. Through the witness testimony of Mr. Halbac (and to a lesser extent, Mr. Baciu), the Claimants claim that their infrastructure was engineered in such a way that new production facilities could be easily connected to it.\n\n1070.\n\nMr. Halbac explained (and the Respondent did not dispute) that the region in which the Claimants invested did not have the infrastructure in place to support large production facilities. As a result, it was necessary to invest heavily in basic utilities such as reliable electricity, gas, and water supply to support each of the production sites (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 45). Mr. Halbac asserted that the basic utilities were built on a larger scale than the companies needed at that time due to the obligation under the EGO 24 to maintain the investment for 20 years, and because the Claimants wanted to make use of the networks for future projects. As a result, the infrastructure was engineered in such a way that it could be easily connected to new production facilities (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 46).\n\n1071.\n\nIn his First Witness Statement, Mr. Halbac included diagrams showing the integration of the different facilities. He stated that the dashed lines in the diagrams \"represent investments that EFDG has not completed, but that could have been easily integrated into EFDG's existing utility connections, had early revocation of the EGO 24 incentives not constrained our cash\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 50). He also testified that \"[t]he ability of EFDG to engineer and construct utility networks was absolutely critical, since the State did not provide these utilities for us. We planned ahead and built these networks so that they could support additional production capacities, and as a result, we have been able to expand our facilities fairly easily. This also means that the projects we have been unable to complete could be easily added to our existing network. Thus, EFDG's initial planning for the shared infrastructure has saved considerable amounts of money, because the infrastructure does not have to be duplicated at each site. These cost savings have been invested in the expansion and integration of the business\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61).\n\n1072.\n\nOn the basis of Mr. Halbac's testimony and other evidence in the record, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the Claimants built a highly integrated platform that allowed them to save costs if they decided to insert new product lines or plants. However, this does not provide sufficient certainty that the Claimants would have in fact built a malt plant, a can manufacturing plant and/or a co-generation plant. This finding is in line with the general pattern of conduct evinced by the Individual Claimants and the EFDG: they built up and expanded their businesses with foresight, with the intent always to preserve as many options as possible and keep flexible in order to be able to seize those opportunities which would actually materialize at the right time depending on market conditions and financial possibilities, among other considerations. This speaks for the fact that the two Individual Claimants are savvy and experienced business people, which their very success also establishes, but it does not prove that they would actually have embarked on all of the options that they had envisaged at one point or another.\n\n1073.\n\nIndeed, there is virtually no contemporaneous evidence of advance planning for any of the Incremental investments. There are no specific feasibility plans for any of the plants, nor is there any record of them in the 2000, 2002 or 2003 PWC business plans (Exh. R-204, R-214 and R-215). Other than a few quotes and invoices, the Claimants have not been able to point to any internal documents, such as budget, memos or correspondence evidencing their intention to build these plants. This is particularly surprising considering that Mr. Halbac testified that EFDG had a \"development department\" specifically created to reduce costs associated with future investments (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 20-34). According to Mr. Halbac, this development department consisted of a group of engineers that \"cover virtually every aspect of any investment, including mechanical engineers, architectural engineers, electric engineers, civil engineers, structural engineers, and even engineers who focus solely on plumbing\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 21). Mr. Halbac also testified that for each new project, this department organized a team of project managers responsible for the optimum realization of the investments, starting from the initial contracts. Mr. Halbac even included a diagram titled \"EFG Plant Building\" (First WS of M. Halbac, p. 13) illustrating \"EFDG's planning and implementation process for new investments\". However, despite the existence of this team of engineers and highly organized and structured process, there is not a single internal plan, memo or email documenting the Claimants' intention to pursue the Incremental Investments.\n\n1074.\n\nAs discussed in detail in the sections that follow, the documentary evidence in the record refers mainly to correspondence with and quotations from third parties for equipment necessary to develop these projects. Although it does evidence an interest in these projects as potential investments, it does not prove that the Claimants would have in fact invested in them.\n\n1075.\n\nDespite this lack of evidence of advance planning, the Claimants contend that they in fact took steps to materialize the Incremental Investments, which in their view shows that they intended to pursue them (indeed, they argue that only final steps were needed to complete them). The Claimants argue that they were a family-run business that took decisions verbally and did not usually operate on the basis of written plans. They submit that the development of the brewery is evidence of this, because it was built despite the absence of written plans and despite the fact that it was not mentioned in the 2000 or 2003 PWC business plans. Indeed, they point out that according to the 2003 PWC business plan, no major capital investment was planned or needed over the period 2003 to 2007, and despite that statement, the Claimants' heaviest capital investments occurred from 2003 to 2007 (including the expansion of the brewery) (C-PHB, \u00b6 179). The Tribunal has duly considered this argument. However, as discussed below, it finds that the steps identified by the Claimants as evidence of their intention to implement the Incremental Investments do not show with sufficient certainty that these investments would in fact have been undertaken.\n\n*(b) The malt manufacturing plant*\n----------------------------------\n\n1076.\n\nMr. Halbac testified that, because malt is one of the main ingredients used in beer production, \"we had been exploring options for building a malt plant ever since we considered building the brewery. This is because we knew that we could realize significant cost savings if we produced our own malt instead of importing or buying it on the domestic market\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 145).\n\n1077.\n\nHowever, in his Second Witness Statement Mr. Halbac clarified that the plans to construct or complete the malt plan were not immediate. Although he stated that the Claimants always considered the malt plant as a portion of their brewery, he clarified that they \"would complete [it] at a critical point in time to increase the brewery's overall efficiency\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 57). He also stated that at the time that the Claimants constructed the initial stages of the brewery (and later its expansion), it was \"unnecessary for [the Claimants] to construct a complete malt plant.\" This was because they were still benefitting from EGO 24 and could import malt without paying customs duties. However, he added that \"we knew that these Incentives would not last forever, and that it would be important for us to make preparations for the malt plant so that we could eventually control our malt production and not rely on outside sources for the main ingredient to one of our most successful products - beer\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 60). This suggests that the Claimants may have been considering the construction of a malt plant from early on, but they did not specifically plan to build one at any particular time until the expiry of the incentives was near.\n\n1078.\n\nThe documentary evidence suggests that the possibility of building a malt plant was indeed considered by the Claimants from at least 2002. There is evidence of correspondence with Buhler and Schmidt-Seeger for the construction of a malt plant during 2002,220 including quotations for malt plants of various capacities (Exh. C-335; C-659; C-628; C-658; C-336221). However, the Claimants do not appear to have acted upon these quotations.\n\nAlthough Mr. Halbac testified that their \"first offer for equipment came from Seeger in 1997\", that offer was not submitted.\n\nExh. C-335 is a quotation dated 19 March 2002 from Schmidt-Seeger for a malt plant with a capacity of 23,000 tons; Exh. C-659 is an email from Buhler dated 19 March 2002 with an attached quotation for a malt plant with a capacity of 35,000 tons; Exh. C-628 is an email from Buhler dated 22 April 2002 mentioning the layout (sent by a previous email) for a malt plant with a capacity of 35,000 tons; Exh. C-658 is an email from Buhler dated 2 August 2002 attaching a revised quotation for a capacity of 22,960 tons worth over \u20ac3,9 million but with the possibility of extension to 34,440 tons; and Exh. C-336 is a quotation from Schmidt-Seeger dated 4 November 2002 for the establishment components of a malt plant with a capacity of 37,000 - 50,000 tons.\n\n1079.\n\nMr. Halbac testified that, at the time of the revocation, the Claimants already had many of the necessary components for a malt plant, including equipment for barley reception, silos for barley, transport, conveying, and cleaning systems for barley, utilities including steam supply, water, water treatment, compressed air, electrical, and cooling systems, malt transport, cleaning, and silos for storing malt (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 146-151, Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 57-65; Tr., Day 7, 141-144). According to Mr. Halbac, this accounted for 60% of the malt plant (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 61). Mr. Halbac testified that the only missing elements were the germination equipment, construction of the actual building and final connection of utilities to finish the integration into the brewery (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 61-65; Tr., Day 7, 143-144). He also testified that Claimants had taken steps to acquire these missing elements, including the finalization of a contract to purchase the germination machine and negotiations with the EBRD for the necessary financing.\n\n1080.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the malt manufacturing plant was nearly finished, as the Claimants claim. It notes that the Claimants never bought a germination machine, which was the central component of the malt plant (R-PHB, \u00b6 259). The Respondent also argues that the Claimants have sought to pass off infrastructure and equipment used for other manufacturing processes as specifically meant for the malt plant. In particular, the Respondent argues that the empty silo that Mr. Halbac testified was reserved for barley was in fact constructed before EGO 24 (Mr. Halbac testified it was built before 2000) and could have been used for other purposes than storing grains for a malt plant (R-PHB, \u00b6 260 and Tr., Day 7, 169 (Halbac)). The Respondent also asserts that Mr. Halbac222 admitted that the transportation system for malt was in fact used for malt purchased from third parties (R-PHB, \u00b6 260 and Tr., Day 7, 148 (Halbac)).\n\nThe Respondent refers to Mr. Baciu, but the citation is to Mr. Halbac's testimony.\n\n1081.\n\nThe Tribunal's review of the documentary evidence confirms that, at the time of the revocation of the incentives, the Claimants did indeed have the components identified by Mr. Halbac. However, the Claimants have not established that any of those components were purchased exclusively for a malt plant. Indeed, many of them appear to have been for the brewery's normal operation. In particular:\n\na. The Claimants appear to have bought malt handling equipment, including silos and conveyor systems in 2004 (Exh. C-970 contains invoices dated November 2002 from Schmidt-Seeger), and invoices dated November 2004 from Priv\u00e9 and Denis (Exh. C-967-968)).223 However, it is unclear whether this equipment was bought in connection with a malt *manufacturing* plant, rather than malt *handling* related to a brewery. As the Respondent notes, Mr. Halbac testified at the hearing that the silos and conveying systems were also used for other grains, although the silo reserved for barley was empty (Tr., Day 7, 145-148). Mr. Halbac also stated that the transportation system could be used for both malt and barley, but he also testified that the transportation system \"was conceived to fit the malt plant\", and in the absence of the malt plant to process the barley it was being used to transport malt only (Tr., Day 7, 146-148 (Halbac)).\n\nb. With respect to utilities, Mr. Halbac testified that when the Claimants built the brewery they constructed a steam pipeline with sufficient capacity to supply both the brewery in its expanded form (which would account for 50% of the pipeline's capacity), and the malt and can manufacturing plants (which would account for the remaining 50% of the pipeline's capacity) (Tr., Day 7, 149-153 (Halbac); Exh. C-647, a certificate of completion of the steam pipe).\n\nExh. C-970 contains invoices dated November 2002 from Schmidt-Seeger), and Exh. C-967-968 contain invoices dated November 2004 from Priv\u00e9 and Denis.\n\n1082.\n\nEven if this equipment had been intended exclusively for the malt plant (which the Tribunal finds has not been established), it is undisputed that the Claimants were missing key elements for a malt plant, in particular the germination machine and the building. Although there is evidence in the record to support the Claimants' assertion that they intended to buy a germination machine and construct the building to house the malt plant, most of this evidence post-dates the revocation of the incentives. In particular:\n\na. Mr. Halbac testified that the Claimants had purchased land in 2000-2001 with an estimated value of \u20ac1 million, which they set aside for the malt plant (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 62), and that the Claimants had \"gained approval from the State to construct the building\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 62). Indeed, the Claimants submitted an Urban Planning Certificate that certifies that the land it refers to may be used to build a malt plant (Exh. C-976), but this certificate was issued on 5 Dec. 2005 (i.e., post-revocation). The certificate also states that it is not in lieu of the relevant building permit.\n\nb. Mr. Halbac referred to a geotechnical study conducted by the Claimants for the malt plant (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 62). This study is indeed in the record (Exh. C-978), but it is dated \"2005\", which means it was carried out after the announcement of the revocation in November 2004.\n\nc. Mr. Halbac also testified that the Claimants had ordered the structural building design to the Romanian company IPROLAN (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 63). However, the engineering design contract with IPROLAN (Exh. C-704) is dated 19 June 2006, more than a year after the revocation.\n\nd. Mr. Halbac also testified that the Claimants had a contract in place with Lausmann GmbH for the germination machine (Tr., Day 7, 149 (Halbac); Exh. C-478). At the hearing, the Claimants stated that the document only concerned a germination machine (Tr., Day 7, 172 (Fleuriet)). However, this contract appears to involve more than just a germination machine, as Article 1.1 of the contract mentions a \"complete malt producing plant, spare parts, wear parts and accessories as described in the Appendix 1\", which in turn includes, among others, steeping, cleaning, kilning and transport equipment. In addition, the contract post-dates the revocation (Exh. C-478).224\n\ne. Finally, the record confirms that in the Claimants' negotiations with the EBRD for a potential loan referred to financing for the \"potential acquisition, installation and operation of a malt processing plant with a capacity of 30,000 tons\" (Exh. C-744, C-745, C-746).225 However, these documents are from 2006, and therefore postdate the revocation.\n\nOn its front page, the contract is dated 6 July 2005, but the final price appears to have been negotiated in December 2006 (the date \"19.12.2006\" is handwritten in Appendix 1 next to the final negotiated price (\u20ac 4,425 million)\n\nAlthough the Claimants argue that negotiations with EBRD involved financing of a \"germination machine\", the EBRD documents refer to a full \"malt processing plant\".\n\n1083.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion from the available evidence is that the Claimants contemplated the possibility of building a malt plant from at least 2002, and invested in certain cost efficiencies that they added to the brewery. They also planned ahead with respect to utilities, making sure that the steam pipe could service the brewery as well as future plants. However, they did not plan to build a complete malt manufacturing plant (i.e., a plant that could process barley into malt rather than handle ready-made malt) until close to the expiry of the incentives, presumably because prior to that it was cheaper for them to import duty-free malt. This would explain why their more serious efforts to set up this plant (financing with the EBRD, geotechnical study, contract for germination and other equipment) came in 2005 and 2006, after the early revocation of the incentives.\n\n1084.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this means that, although there is evidence of the Claimants' intention to build a malt manufacturing plant sometime in the future, the Claimants have not proven with sufficient certainty that they planned to build it prior to expiry of the incentives (whether by their early revocation in 2005 or their scheduled expiry in 2009). Nor is it accurate to say that at the date of the revocation the Claimants had built 60% of a malt manufacturing plant. At the date of the revocation, the Claimants could only boast certain minor equipment and cost efficiencies that would have made it relatively easy and less expensive to construct and operate a malt manufacturing plant. What they had was a highly integrated platform to which a malt plant could easily have been added. This would prove again that the Claimants are savvy business people. This does not provide sufficient certainty that, but for the revocation of the incentives, they would have built a malt manufacturing plant.\n\n*(c) The can manufacturing plant*\n---------------------------------\n\n1085.\n\nWith respect to their intention to build a can manufacturing plant, the Claimants again rely heavily on Mr. Halbac's testimony.\n\n1086.\n\nMr. Halbac testified that it is very expensive to buy and transport aluminum cans, while it is much cheaper to transport the raw materials needed to produce the cans. He further testified that EFDG had always understood that they would save money by importing raw materials to make their own cans. \"Thus, ever since we started considering a brewery, we planned to construct a nearby can making facility.\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 156-157).\n\n1087.\n\nMr. Halbac also testified that \"[t]here is a significant canned beer market in both the Romanian and export markets\", and that while the Claimants were building the brewery, they \"became even more interested in the prospect of having [their] own can plant\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 162). In addition, Mr. Halbac stated that by reducing the can costs, they could reduce the price for which they sold their canned beer to about the same price as their PET bottled-beer, which would have made them more competitive in both the domestic and export beer markets by increasing their shelf space, which would have in turn increased sales to consumers (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 168). Mr. Halbac also testified that canned beer has a better shelf life than PET bottled beer and is cheaper to transport, which is why it was their preferred method of bottling for their export beer (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 169).\n\n1088.\n\nThe evidence in the record suggests that the Claimants did begin to consider building a can plant as early as 1998. Specifically, Mr. Halbac testified that in 1997/1998, the Claimants contacted various American companies to investigate the relevant technologies and visited a trade show in Denver and production facilities (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 158). The correspondence submitted as Exh. C-844-846 refers to meetings with Mr. Halbac in 1998 at the vendors' respective booths at \"Cannex \u201898\" in Denver, Colorado. Mr. Halbac testified that the Claimants \"continued to receive and study vendor proposals\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 162), and indeed, the record includes correspondence and quotations related to, inter alia, a turn-key canning plant and can manufacturing equipment and accessories (Exh. C-337, C-844, C-845, C-856, C-847).226\n\nExh. C-337 contains a proposal from Pac International to Rieni Drinks, dated 20 May 1998. The detailed quotation concerns a turn-key canning plant offered for a price of over $2.6 million. Exh. C-844 is a letter of 18 May 1998 from Cambridge Applied Systems, Inc. (US), to Mr. Halbac concerning requested information on viscometers. Exh. C-845 is a letter 5 June 1998 from Kerry (UK) to Mr. Halbac with an offer for a \"Kerry Seam Plus Station\". Exh. C-846 is a letter of 30 June 1998 from Chemetall (Sweden) to Mr. Halbac concerning, i.a., can washer treatments. Exh. C-847 is a letter of 9 July 1998 from Omnitech International, Inc. (US), to Mr. Halbac with an offer for can manufacturing equipment and accessories offered at a price of $19.2 million.\n\n1089.\n\nEfforts to find suppliers appear to have continued in the following years. Mr. Halbac testified that \"[t]o determine whether the can plant was a viable option, our engineers attended a variety of symposiums and expositions. For instance, in 2002, we visited the Metpak exhibition in Essen, Germany to find possible suppliers for the can plant. After this exhibition, we decided we would construct the can plant after the brewery was complete.\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 162).\n\n1090.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to Exh. C-388, C-339 and C-343, which are quotations from 2006-2008 in relation to a can manufacturing plant. In particular, the Claimants appear to have engaged in negotiations with TG Can which included the possibility of financing of supply credit (Exh. C-339; Tr., Day 7, 168 (Halbac)).\n\n1091.\n\nIn addition to the documents cited above, the Claimants argue that their intention to build a can manufacturing plant is supported by the fact that they took certain steps and made investments in preparation for this plant. At the hearing, Mr. Halbac testified that about 50% of the can manufacturing plant had been either built or purchased (Tr., Day 7, 166). Using as an example an offer from PAC International for a turnkey can manufacturing facility (Exh. C-337), Mr. Halbac testified that the Claimants had already completed the following elements of the plant: support systems equipment area, warehousing, utility and steam supply systems, demineralization system, cooling and hot water systems, compressed air system, waste water treatment, electrical shop and quality control lab equipment, chemical storage, machine shop, and specialized can printing and labeling equipment (Tr., Day 7, 156-159 (Halbac)). According to the Claimants, the only missing elements to complete the can plant were the building (Tr., Day 7, 157 (Halbac)), and the can manufacturing machines for producing the aluminum cans (Tr., Day 7, 165 (Halbac)).\n\n1092.\n\nAs with the malt plant, the Respondent denies that any of these alleged steps or investments support the Claimants' intention to build a can plant. The Respondent argues that the Claimants have sought to pass equipment used for other manufacturing processes as evidence of a nearly completed can plant, although the most basic components of the plant were missing (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 262-264).\n\n1093.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, although there is evidence suggesting that the Claimants indeed contemplated the possibility of building a can manufacturing plant, the evidence of concrete plans or specific steps taken to materialize this project is weak. The documentation cited above shows that the Claimants had an interest in purchasing elements for a can manufacturing plant, but it does not prove that they seriously planned to purchase them, in particular considering that this interest did not materialize within an almost 10-year span.\n\n1094.\n\nSimilarly, while there is evidence to support Mr. Halbac's assertions that the Claimants already had many components necessary for building a can plant, most of these components appear to refer to shared utilities, land or facilities. Specifically:\n\na. As mentioned above for the malt plant, Mr. Halbac testified that the steam pipe was built with an expanded capacity, so that 50% was reserved for the can and malt facilities (C-PHB, \u00b6 196 and Tr., Day 7, 152-153 (Halbac); Exh. C-649). In other words, it was not built specifically for the can plant.\n\nb. Mr. Halbac also testified that, in late 1999, the Claimants set aside approxim ately 50,000 square meters of land for a can factory (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 80). There is little evidence in the record of this land other than a photograph that was shown during the 2010 hearing. It is also unclear whether this land was purchased especially for the can plant. In his first witness statement Mr. Halbac had testified that the Claimants had available land located next to the brewery in Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti West, which made sense because it would have allowed the canning plant to utilize EDFG's existing infrastructure and become integrated with the rest of the plants, and they would use a significant number of the cans to bottle beer from the brewery (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 164). The timing of this step and the absence of purchase documentation suggests that reserve land was indeed available but not that specific investments were made to acquire the land in connection with the can plant.\n\n1095.\n\nThat being said, some equipment appears to have been bought with the can plant in mind, although again it is unclear if the equipment could also be used in other manufacturing processes. Specifically:\n\na. Mr. Halbac testified that the grinding machine at the repair shop was purchased in 2002 especially for the can manufacturing plant (Tr., Day 7, 161-163). However, it is unclear why this machine was bought in 2002 if no can plant existed at the time. It is also unclear whether it was also used in other manufacturing processes.\n\nb. Mr. Halbac testified that \"one of the most difficult processes in can making is the design and production of the printing plates - which they have been able to do since 2000.\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 90). For this purpose, the Claimants argue that they invested heavily in can printing plates and production equipment as well as film printing machines for the labeling of cans (C-PHB, \u00b6 196). The Claimants submitted invoices to support this (Exh. C-951, C-946, C-942). Some of these invoices are from 1998 and pre-date the construction of the brewery, so it seems unlikely that the equipment related to beer cans. The Respondent also argues that machinery used to manufacture and wash printing plates could be used to print on cans, but was acquired and used in the Claimants' business to produce other types of packages (R-PHB, \u00b6 262). However, Mr. Halbac testified that \"[o]ne of the machines is equipped so as to be able to produce special plates for cans....So we bought that type of machinery instead of the cylindric one in order to be able to manufacture plates for the cans as well\" (Tr., Day 7, 171 (Halbac)). Mr. Halbac also testified that no one sold unprinted cans, so they could not have used the plates to print on purchased cans as suggested by the Respondent (Tr. Day 7, 171-172 (Halbac)).\n\nc. Mr. Halbac also testified that in 2003, allegedly anticipating a can making line being constructed in Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u015fti, EFDG invested \u20ac128,000 in the relocation of its can filling line to Dragane\u015fti. An offer from Krones for new can conveyor equipment offered at a price of \u20ac120,000 was apparently accepted in this regard (Exh. C-644).\n\n1096.\n\nDespite the purchase of this equipment, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the can plant project was 50% complete, as the Claimants assert, or that it was seriously planned by the Claimants. Even if this equipment was purchased with a possible can plant in mind, the Claimants were also using it for other purposes. In addition, the relocation of the can *filling* line does not necessarily imply that a can *making* line will be subsequently built. More importantly, it is undisputed that the Claimants never purchased the can manufacturing machines for producing the aluminum cans. As a result, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not proved with sufficient certainty that but for the revocation they would have built the can manufacturing plant.\n\n*(d) The co-generation plant*\n-----------------------------\n\n1097.\n\nMr. Baciu and Mr. Halbac testified that from early on EFDG intended to build a cogeneration plant to reduce internal operational costs. The co-generation plant would accomplish this by reducing EFDG's dependence on outside fuel, reducing energy costs, and using waste from the company's production processes (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 18; First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 56-59). Mr. Baciu also testified that after Romania passed renewable energy laws in 2004, EFDG's intention was to produce energy to sell electricity to the wholesale market, as well as green certificates (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24-29). As a result, the profits that the co-generation plant would have allegedly made rested on both savings on operational costs and the sale of electricity/green certificates to third parties. The Respondent alleges, and Prof. Lessard confirmed at the hearing, that the green certificates accounted for 72% of the value that Prof. Lessard attributed to the project (Tr., Day 7, 109; Tr., Day 8, 95-96).\n\n1098.\n\nAccording to Mr. Baciu, EFDG planned to construct a 20 MW electricity co-generation plant. The estimated cost to build the plant was \u20ac20 million (including equipment and connection) (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 30-32).\n\n1099.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to prove with sufficient certainty that they would have built a co-generation plant. Although there is some evidence that the Claimants considered the option of building a co-generation plant in the future, the evidence of advance planning or specific steps in the implementation of such a plant is inconclusive at best.\n\n1100.\n\nAccording to Mr. Baciu, the co-generation plant was part of EFDG's plans from its early days. He testified that the Claimants began contemplating co-generation in the late 1990s, when they considered establishing beverage production lines in Bucharest, and continued with this plan when they established their food business in Bihor after the passage of GD 194/1999.\n\n1101.\n\nThe record confirms that the Claimants had an interest in building a co-generation plant as early as 1998, and contacted several manufacturers for this purpose. The record includes several offers or quotations for a co-generation plant between 1998 and 1999 (Exh. C-821, C-822, C-823).227 The Claimants appear to have started to consider co-generation more seriously in 2002:\n\na. In 2002, the Claimants contracted with ABB to implement switch-gear technology in the substation, which would allow them to reverse the flow of electricity from a future co-generation source into the national distribution network (Exh. C-480).\n\nb. Also in 2002, the Claimants contracted with Biothane International (Biothane) for the construction of their waste water treatment plant. Mr. Baciu explains that they also discussed the possibility of using the by-products of this facility as possible renewable energy sources. These discussions evolved into discussions for the construction of a co-generation plant (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 1 9-22).228 However, there seems to have been no follow-up to this correspondence, and the Biothane co-generation project did not materialize. Indeed, in 2003 the Claimants initiated correspondence with Schmidt for biomass testing (Exh. C-712), and made inquiries with General Electric for turbines (Exh. C-708229) (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 44).\n\nExh. C-821 is an offer/quotation from ABB dated 4 February 1999; Exh. C-822 is a preliminary proposal from Hyundai dated 3 November 1998, and Exh. C-823 is a quotation from Mannesman dated 19 February 1999.\n\nThe record includes:  \n \u25a0 Meeting Minutes from 16 April 2002 (Exh. C-483) between European Food and Biothane anticipating potential construction of a co-generation plant, where equipment and next steps were discussed;  \n \u25a0 An email from Biothane to European Drinks, 2 May 2002 (Exh, C-484), documenting European Food Group's May 2002 delivery of a sample dried material (DDGS) to determine composition and biodegradability for fuel component testing.  \n \u25a0 An email from Christian Flora of EFDG to Biothane dated 27 May 2002 (Exh. C-484, second page), referring to various \"problems\" related to the \"project\". Among other matters, Mr. Flora requested the final lay-out drawings, asked about the correct foundation they should build for tanks, requested an offer for tanks and engineering for the boiler, and a time schedule. However, given that the subject line contains the initials \"wwtp\", this appears to refer to the waste water treatment plant rather than the co-generation plant.  \n \u25a0 An email from Biothane to European Drinks, 20 August 2002 (Exh. C-482), referencing a quotation for the construction of a co-generation plant.\n\nExh. C-708 is an undated presentation from General Electric regarding turbines suitable for cogeneration\n\n1102.\n\nThe Claimants' interest in a co-generation plant seems to have grown when Romania passed renewable energy laws. Although the laws were not passed until 2004, Mr. Baciu testified that around 2002 they already anticipated that these laws would be passed (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 23). According to Mr. Baciu, \"[t]his probability of cogeneration as a revenue generator gave us another reason to seriously consider construction of our own co-generation facility. Thus, we knew that we could produce energy for our facilities at a lower cost than what we were currently paying in electricity from the State's distribution network, and we knew that any additional energy we produced had the potential to be sold\" (*Id*.). When Romania did pass the renewable energy laws in 2004, their attractiveness was enhanced by the possibility of trading green certificates. However, as a result of the revocation of the incentives, Mr. Baciu states that \"we were unable to continue with our planned expansion and integration (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 25). Mr. Baciu explains that this came at a great detriment to their company, because subsequent changes in Romania's renewable energy laws would have enabled them to earn more green certificates than under the original law (specifically, three instead of one per MWh produced), and they would have been entitled to sell these green certificates at a higher value (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 26).\n\n1103.\n\nThe Claimants continued to receive quotations for a co-generation plant after revocation. The Claimants submitted two offers from Siemens dated November 2005 and July 2006 for a turbine and generator and other equipment (Exh. C-687, C-708). Mr. Baciu also testified that in 2009 they received a quotation for a 20 MW cogeneration plant from Bio-Energieanlagen, which estimated the project at less than \u20ac20 million (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 43).\n\n1104.\n\nThe Claimants' continued interest in a co-generation plant is also evidenced by the EBRD loan negotiation documents. As discussed above, during 2005 and 2006 the Claimants carried out negotiations with the EBRD regarding possible development financing. In addition to the malt plant, the early documents related to those negotiations mentioned the construction of a co-generation plant. Specifically, the cogeneration plant was mentioned in the EBRD Environmental Questionnaire dated 12 March 2005 (Exh. C-743) and the first draft Loan Agreement dated 16 June 2006 (Exh. C-745). However, it is not mentioned in either the Term Sheet dated 4 March 2006 (Exh. C-744) or the last draft Loan Agreement dated 2 November 2006 (Exh. C-746). Thus, it would appear that the project either was dropped entirely or at least that by 2 November 2006 (over 20 months after the revocation) it had not yet reached a level of concrete planning.\n\n1105.\n\nHowever, despite the evidence of the Claimants' continuing interest in building a cogeneration plant (which spans several years), other than Mr. Baciu's testimony, there is no documentary evidence of concrete internal planning of such a project:\n\na. Mr. Baciu asserts that when the Claimants developed the lay-out of their factories, they \"kept in mind\" where an optimal place for the co-generation plant would be, and bought 20 hectares of land for this purpose (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5). However, there is no record of this advance planning in internal plans for the factories, nor documentary evidence of the purchase of land.\n\nb. There is no feasibility study or other preliminary study. The Respondent pointed out during the cross-examination of Mr. Baciu that the Claimants had carried out a feasibility study for a corn mill valued at \u20ac4.8 million, and found it surprising that the Claimants had not carried out a similar feasibility study for a co-generation plant that would cost approximately \u20ac20 million. Mr. Baciu admitted that in the case of the co-generation plant, \"no feasibility study was made; only some calculations, engineering calculations\" (Tr., Day 7, 120 (Baciu)). However, Mr. Baciu was not able to point to any documentary evidence of these alleged calculations. He stated that they \"just calculated internally\" for themselves, and \"never kept the figures\". He added that these were not financial calculations, only simple calculations involving \"the rough cost of the raw materials involved\" and \"the availability of [these] raw materials\", that these calculations were \"very easy to do\" and that this was \"not the kind of document that you save and keep\" (Tr., Day 7, 120 (Baciu)).\n\nc. Mr. Baciu submitted for the purposes of this arbitration a diagram showing an overview of the co-generation project at page 5 of his second witness statement showing how the different components fit in, but no such diagram or plan is found among the Claimants' contemporaneous evidence.\n\n1106.\n\nIrrespective of the available documentation, the Claimants argue that their intention to build a co-generation plant is evidenced by the steps they took to complete it. Indeed, Mr. Baciu testified that at the date of the revocation of the incentives they had acquired or constructed most of the components of a co-generation plant, as discussed in sub-paragraphs (a) through (g) below. However, although the existence of these components appears to be undisputed, the Tribunal is not persuaded that these components were acquired or constructed specifically with the co-generation plant in mind, or that at the date of the revocation of the incentives the co-generation plant was as near completion as the Claimants suggest. Specifically:\n\na. Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had set aside 20 hectares of land, which would be used for the plant itself and for biomass storage (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 38, 43; Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 5 and related photographs). However, there is insufficient evidence showing when this land was acquired or with what purpose.\n\nb. Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had the biomass needed for co-generation, which came from by-products or waste from the products used for food production (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; 18-23). According to Mr. Baciu, this was \"the most important component\" of a co-generation facility (Tr., Day 7, 95, 99 (Baciu)). However, Mr. Baciu acknowledged that for the size of plant they were considering (20 MW), they would need to purchase additional biomass (Tr., Day 7; 126 (Baciu)). Specifically, a 20 MW electricity co-generation plant would need 160,000 metric tons of biomass, of which 90,000 to 110,000 metric tons would come from internal sources. The remainder would have to be purchased from third parties, but Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants were well-positioned to buy them at competitive rates and had a transportation system in place (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 33-38).\n\nc. Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had acquired the equipment for the preparation, conditioning, storing and handling of the biomass sources. Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had \"already built and already mastered the process of collecting, storing, handling, and drying these types of biomass\" (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 11; 24; Mr. Baciu also included several photographs of existing biomass conditioning installations and storage areas, and explained the process (Second WS of S. Baciu, pp. 6-21). With respect to conditioning, Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had mincers for solid biomass, centrifuges for humid biomass, and dryers (Tr., Day 7, 96-97 (Baciu)). With respect to storage and handling, Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had silos, platforms, transportation equipment and loading equipment (Tr., Day 7, 97 (Baciu)). This appears to be undisputed, although it is unclear how much of this equipment was purchased for the cogeneration plant.\n\nd. Mr. Baciu also testified that the Claimants had biogas, produced at the Claimants' wastewater treatment plant. The biogas would serve as catalyst in burning the biomass to produce steam and electricity (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 21-22).\n\ne. Mr. Baciu further testified that the Claimants had built an electrical substation precisely designed with plat space and additional electrical control capacity for constructing and handling co-generation, including step-up transformation capability and an installed switchgear that permits re-direction of co-generated power directly into the State's transmission lines (C-PHB, \u00b6 202; Second WS of\n\nS. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 33-45). However, it is undisputed that the substation was not built exclusively for the co-generation plant, but to provide electricity to the group's production facilities (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 3). The Tribunal does not doubt that the substation was built with the capacity to eventually \"plug in\" a co-generation plant: (i) both Mr. Baciu and Mr. Halbac testified that when they built the substation, they also planned for the construction of a co-generation plant (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 18; First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 56), and that \"[m]any of the features on the substation were placed there only because we had already planned the construction of a co-generation plant\" (First WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 56); (ii) as noted above, Mr. Baciu testified that, with the co-generation plant in mind, in 2002 the Claimants contracted with ABB to implement switch-gear technology in the substation, which would allow them to reverse the flow of electricity into the national distribution network;230 and (iii) the power plant appears to have been found suitable for co-generation.231 However, this only proves that the Claimants designed their substation in a way that would allow them to easily plug in a cogeneration plant; it does not prove that they would have actually built such a plant.\n\nf. Mr. Baciu also testified that the Claimants built an electrical conversion plant to raise the current from 20 kv to 110 kv power (Tr., Day 7, 99 (Baciu)). However, it is unclear whether this was part of the electrical substation or was purchased specifically for the co-generation plant.\n\ng. Finally, Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had a connection to the national power grid, which allowed them to take power from the grid or supply power (Tr., Day 7, 99 (Baciu)). Mr. Baciu also qualified this as one of the most important components for a co-generation plant, together with the biomass source (*Id*.). Once again, for what that connection was specifically built beyond the Claimants' ongoing operations remains unclear.\n\nThe record includes a contract dated 2001-2002 with ABB for electric switchgear (Exh. C-480), but from the English translation it is impossible to determine if the equipment was bought with cogeneration as the purpose.\n\nMr. Baciu testified that a state-owned electric company subordinated to the Ministry of Economy acknowledged in 2010 that the \"110/20kV power station European Drinks Sudrigiu has been such designed and made to allow the beneficiary S.C. European Drinks to deliver in SEN its own electricity (BIOMASS COGENERATION), by cell no. 3 and cell no. 20.\" (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 45; Exh. C-820).\n\n1107.\n\nAccording to Mr. Baciu, the only missing components to complete a co-generation plant were:\n\na. The turbine, which the Claimants would have to purchase, and for which they received several quotations from suppliers (Tr., Day 7, 98 (Baciu); Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 35). Presumably Mr. Baciu refers to the quotations cited in paragraphs 1101 and 1103 above.\n\nb. A dedicated boiler for steam generation to run the turbine, which would have been designed and largely manufactured in-house.\n\nc. The building to house the plant.\n\n1108.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the most important (and missing) parts of the cogeneration plant were the boiler and turbine and not the biomass and connection to the power grid as claimed by Mr. Baciu (R-PHB, \u00b6 256). The Tribunal must agree. Mr. Baciu testified (both in his WS and in cross-examination) that although most of the biomass would come from internal sources, they would need to purchase part of it from third parties (First WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 36; Tr., Day 7, 126 (Rubins/Baciu). As the Respondent points out, this shows that having one's own source of biomass is not essential to the operation of a co-generation plant, although it would of course mean a cost advantage. With respect to the connection to the power grid, Mr. Baciu clarified that by \"important\", he meant \"difficult to obtain.\" In particular, the connection to the national power grid was a huge advantage for them because it was very difficult for other investors to obtain (Tr., Day 7, 102-104 (President L\u00e9vy/Baciu)). However, it cannot be disputed that the boiler and the turbine are crucial elements of a cogeneration plant, without which no energy can be produced.\n\n1109.\n\nMr. Baciu also testified that the Claimants had \"all the necessary authorizations\" to operate a co-generation facility, but in cross-examination he was obliged to retract in part. Mr. Baciu confirmed that they would have needed an authorization from the water management authorities for the boiler, an environmental authorization, an electricity generation license, and an electric supply license, none of which the Claimants had yet obtained. However, with respect to generation he stressed that the company had an authorization as a distributor and eligible consumer, and \"most likely would have obtained\" the generation license and electric supply license as well. (Tr., Day 7, 123-126 (Rubins/Baciu)). The Respondent argues that Mr. Baciu testified falsely on this point. However, while notable, Mr. Baciu's contradictory statements could have been the result of a misunderstanding during his oral examination: indeed, Mr. Baciu clarified that when he responded to Mr. Fleuriet's question in direct examination, he \"understood that his question referred to the 110 plant and the connection to the national system\" (Tr., Day 7, 123-124 (Rubins/Baciu)).232\n\nThe Respondent also contends that Mr. Baciu was unable to specify which company (or companies) was/were meant to make the investments required to build the co-generation plant (Tr., Day 7, 105-106 (Baciu)). However, this does not show much. Mr. Baciu was an engineer; it is not likely that he was privy to the Claimants' strategic corporate decisions with respect to the channeling of investments.\n\n1110.\n\nFinally, Mr. Baciu testified that the Claimants had \"mastered the technological process for turning prepared biomass and biogas into steam and electricity\", as well as considerable engineering expertise and experience designing boilers. In this respect, Mr. Baciu testified that after revocation (around 2010) the Claimants built three biomass boilers which are currently in operation (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6\u00b6 25-31). Indeed, from Mr. Baciu's testimony it appears that the Claimants are already using biomass to produce energy. Specifically, Mr. Baciu states that \"[i]n these existing boilers, we burn our existing biomass and biogas, capture the steam produced, and use it to run our factories. This reduces our heavy fuel oil costs and the emission of carbon dioxide that results from burning heavy fuel oil\" (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 26). Mr. Baciu also testified that the operation of these boilers was similar to that needed for the co-generation process, but they operated at lower capacities and pressures (Tr., Day 7, 97 (Baciu)). Mr. Baciu also clarified that these boilers started operating in May 2010 (Second WS of S. Baciu, \u00b6 31). Although this shows the Claimants' capacity to use biomass to produce energy, steam to be precise, for their own consumption, it also shows that, without the turbine, they could not claim to have a co-generation plant. In particular, without the turbine they could not sell energy to third parties through green certificates, which is the main source of the profits they claim.\n\n1111.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion from the evidence discussed above is that the Claimants have not shown with sufficient certainty that they would have implemented a cogeneration plant. The record does suggest that, despite the absence of evidence with respect to internal planning, the Claimants considered implementing ways to turn biomass and biogas into steam and electricity. However, that does not show that they would have built an actual co-generation plant. The Claimants requested quotations as early as 1998, and continued to show interest in 2002 and 2003, but it took them seven years from then to go into and to master the process of using their own biomass and biogas for fuel, which they only started doing in 2010 (after the revocation). In addition, the lack of a building, boiler and a turbine, along with the lack of licenses and authorizations, indicates that at the time of the revocation of the incentives the co-generation project was not as close to completion as the Claimants contend.\n\n*(e) Conclusions*\n-----------------\n\n1112.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence analyzed above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not proven with sufficient certainty that, but for the revocation, they would have implemented the Incremental Investments.\n\n1113.\n\nWith respect to their alleged intention to build these facilities, the Claimants rely heavily on witness testimony. In fact, other than offers and quotes provided by third party suppliers, there is surprisingly little contemporaneous evidence of advance planning predating the revocation. There is not a single business plan, feasibility study, internal memo or budget documenting the Claimants' intention to build these facilities. The construction of these plants thus seems to have been a desirable possibility for the Claimants, which they investigated with third party suppliers, but which never materialized into concrete plans.\n\n1114.\n\nThe Tribunal does not doubt that the Incremental Investments were consistent with the Claimants' integration model, and would have complemented it very well. Mr. Halbac and Mr. Baciu describe very persuasively the cost-efficiencies that the Claimants could have achieved. As Prof. Lessard testified on cross-examination, the investments were \"plausible\" (by which he seems to have meant that they made economic sense). However, this does not prove with sufficient certainty that the Claimants would have actually implemented those investments. After the fact, it is always possible to say that one would have engaged into an activity which turns out to have been potentially fruitful: this does not suffice, as it is necessary to prove with sufficient certainty that an intention to do so would have materialized but for the wrongful act. Contemporaneous evidence is not indispensable but, in this instance, its absence does not help the Claimants.\n\n1115.\n\nThe Tribunal has also given due consideration to the Claimants' argument that, as a family business, they did not make plans on paper, and that the best evidence of their intentions are the steps they took to materialize these investments. However, although there is some evidence of steps taken to further these investments, the record shows that the Claimants had built or acquired almost exclusively equipment that could be used with their existing platform (i.e., utilities, electric connections, transportation, storage and handling systems). Some of this equipment created cost efficiencies that would have made it easy to \"plug in\" the Incremental Investments, but for each of the Incremental Investments the Claimants still had to purchase the key equipment that would in fact allow them to operate these Incremental Investments as separate profit-making activities. For instance, for the malt plant, they still needed to purchase the germination machine; for the can manufacturing plant, they still needed to purchase the can manufacturing machines, and for the co-generation plant, they still needed to purchase the turbine and manufacture the boiler. As a result, the steps taken by the Claimants do not show with sufficient certainty that the Incremental Investments were projects at an advanced stage of completion, nor that the Claimants clearly intended to carry them out in the near future. They have proved that they had an option to build these Incremental Investments and that they were contemplating them as a possibility, but not more.\n\n1116.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that these conclusions would have been altered by conducting a site visit as proposed by the Claimants. After a full review of the record, the Tribunal confirms the views it expressed in its Procedural Order dated 20 January 2011. In particular, the Tribunal confirms that a site visit was not necessary nor useful for the resolution of the dispute, as it would not have supplied further evidence of the Claimants' intention to pursue the Incremental Investments than that already in the record. Due to the characteristics of a site visit, it could not have provided further useful, certainly not documentary, evidence of advance planning of these investments; rather, it would have allowed the Tribunal to see the size and characteristics of the Claimants' integrated platform and their ability to easily implement the Incremental Investments, which is sufficiently confirmed by evidence in the record (including the 17-minute video of the site and the Incremental Investments attached as Exhibit C-987, as well as the witness statements of Mr. Halbac and Mr. Baciu, which contain numerous color photographs and diagrams that explain the characteristics and distribution of the site, their oral testimonies and the documentary evidence they cite in their witness statements). However, the fact that the Tribunal has found that Claimants' platform was highly integrated and that they had made certain investments that would have made it easy to add the Incremental Investments does not provide sufficient certainty that, but for the revocation of the incentives, the Claimants would have implemented these projects.\n\n1117.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not proven with sufficient certainty that they would have in fact engaged in the activity that they claim would have earned the profits they were allegedly deprived of. In particular, the Claimants have not established that the lost profits that they claim in relation to the Incremental Investments \"were *reasonably* anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible.\"233\n\nMarjorie M. Whiteman, Damages in International Law, vol. II (1937), p. 1837 (emphasis in original); *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, \u00b6 104.\n\n1118.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal rejects all lost profits claims related to the Incremental Investments.\n\n**4. Financial penalties for failure to pay taxes**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Overview**\n---------------\n\n1119.\n\nIt is undisputed that, following the revocation of the incentives, the Claimants have failed to pay certain tax debts to Romania. The Claimants do not question these debts, which they acknowledge are owed.\n\n1120.\n\nHowever, the Claimants argue that their failure to pay these tax debts has caused them to incur substantial financial penalties, which are attributable to the Respondent's conduct and thus require compensation. Indeed, the Claimants contend that the tax penalties that they incurred post-revocation (from 2006 onwards), were \"a direct result of the financial constraints caused by Revocation\". Specifically, the Claimants argue that if they had been able to benefit from the Raw Materials Incentive until 2009, they would have been able to pay their tax debts to Romania and, as a result, would not have incurred the substantial tax penalties that have accrued since the revocation. Thus, to place them back in the position they would have been but for the revocation, the Tribunal should award them these penalties (CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 132, 142).\n\n1121.\n\nThe Claimants claim damages for two sets of financial penalties (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 140, 144):\n\na. Financial penalties incurred but not yet paid as a result of the Claimants being financially constrained due to the losses incurred as a result of the revocation, in the amount of RON 63.65 million. The Claimants bring this claim unless Romania waives such tax penalties and declares that it shall waive or reimburse all additional financial penalties imposed or assessed until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\nb. Financial penalties incurred and paid by the EFDG companies in the period 1 April 2005 to 30 September 2010, in the amount of RON 40 million.\n\n1122.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, because the Respondent's conduct caused the financial penalties to accrue, the unpaid portion of those penalties should be awarded to the Claimants (if not waived by Romania), and the portion of those penalties that the Claimants have already paid should be awarded back to the Claimants (C-PHB, \u00b6 143).\n\n1123.\n\nBoth claims are cumulatively based on the following evidence (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 131 and 141):\n\na. The calculations contained in paragraphs 85 and 86 and Table 4 of Professor Lessard's first report, dated 22 December 2009;\n\nb. The calculations contained in paragraphs 132 to 135 of Professor Lessard's second report, dated 30 July 2010;\n\nc. The calculations contained in paragraph 3.25 and table 4 of Mr. Osborne's first report and the calculations contained in section 8 of Mr. Osborne's second report;\n\nd. Updated Summary of Damages from Penalties Avoided, Tab 51 from Mr. Schwartz's Opening Presentation;\n\ne. Professor Lessard's corrected tables handed out by counsel at the hearing on 16 November 2010, table 4, page 2;\n\nf. The evidence referred to in the abovementioned sections, paragraphs and tables, including Exh. CO-1.19 (\"Workings for December 2009 report\") (submitted as an exhibit to Mr. Osborne's second report).\n\n1124.\n\nThe two claims concern tax penalties incurred not only by the Corporate Claimants, but also by other companies of the group which are not parties to this arbitration (specifically, European Drinks, Edri Trading, Original Products, Rieni Drinks, Scandic Distilleries, TGIE, Tonical Trading, and West Leasing).\n\n1125.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest the calculations performed by Mr. Osborne or Prof. Lessard. Rather, it contests the existence of a causal link between the revocation and the accrual of the tax penalties, and criticizes the Claimants' experts for simply assuming that such a causal link existed. The Respondent argues that the Claimants' experts did not conduct their own analysis of the evidence but simply assumed (or \"understood\" or \"believed\") it to be true and simply added up the figures. (R-SPHB, \u00b6 16). The Respondent points to:\n\na. Professor Lessard's assertion in his first report that \"with revocation of the incentives, EFDG entered a sustained cash crunch\";\n\nb. Mr. Osborne's assertion that \"since the Companies became financially constrained (2006) significant penalties have accrued on debts to the state\";\n\nc. Professor Lessard's \"understand[ing] that penalties in earlier periods were in some cases caused by unanticipated changes in Romanian tax or excise regulations\" and his \"understand[ing]\" that the terms of EFDG's credit lines did not permit the Claimants to pay down existing state debts (there being no evidence supporting either \"understanding\"); and\n\nd. Mr. Osborne's \"belief\" that penalties \"are likely to have arisen only because of the financial constraints the Companies have been under since 2006\".\n\n1126.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these assumptions are in turn based solely on Mr. Ioan Micula's assertion that \"we suffered delays in making required tax payments to the State because of the cash constraints caused by the State's termination of the incentives\" (Third WS of I. Micula, \u00b6 95). The Respondent argues that this is not evidence and stresses that \"the Claimants must *prove* that they *could not* pay their taxes *because of* repeal of the Facilities\" (R-SPHB, \u00b6 17, emphasis in original). The Respondent denies that the Claimants have proved this. To the contrary, it argues that the evidence in the record in fact demonstrates that there is no causal link between the revocation of the incentives and the incurred tax penalties.\n\n1127.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proven that they could not pay their taxes, nor have they proved that this alleged inability to do so was caused by the revocation of the incentives (R-SPHB, \u00b6 17). In particular, the Respondent argues that:\n\na. The Claimants did indeed have access to funds, but chose to spend them elsewhere. The Respondent notes that it is undisputed that the Claimants spent \u20ac182 million on other projects and developments after the repeal of the Raw Materials Facility, at the same time that the EFDG companies were not paying their taxes and consequently incurring penalties.\n\nb. The Claimants had access to financing at competitive interest rates after repeal, and thus could have borrowed to cover their tax debts.\n\nc. While the Claimants assert that they could not pay the taxes they owed because of financial difficulties, Mr. Osborne accepted that those financial difficulties would have occurred in any event, even without repeal of the Raw Materials Facility. (Tr., Day 10, 137 (Osborne, acknowledging that \"absent sales of SCPs, and assuming all else equal, they would have been in trouble, if I can put it that way.\")).\n\nd. EFDG's financial statements show that the Claimants were in arrears on taxes and incurred penalties in every year before the revocation of the incentives.234 According to the Respondent, there is not a single year, at any time in the Corporate Claimants' history, in which the Corporate Claimants did not incur fresh penalties for non-payment of taxes. That includes the period in 2004-05 in which the Claimants say they paid down their tax debts. The Respondent argues that there is therefore no basis to infer that the Claimants would have paid their taxes in and after 2006 if they had been able to, and hence no basis to infer that their failure to do so proves that they could not (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 340; First ER of J. Ellison, Section 9; Second ER of J. Ellison, Section 8).\n\ne. EFDG entered into various tax-rescheduling agreements with Romania in 2001, 2002 and 2003, through which Romania forgave millions of Euro in tax penalties due from the Claimants. The Respondent argues that \"it thus appears that the Claimants chose not to pay their taxes as part of a long-standing business strategy, hoping to negotiate advantageous restructuring of their tax debts and to use the funds that otherwise would have been paid to the state for other purposes. That this gamble ultimately did not pay off is a far cry from a causal link between the repeal of the facilities and the Claimants' inability to pay taxes. Indeed, it reveals the entire tax-penalty claim to be an unseemly perpetuation of improper practices against Romania, which the Claimants ask this Tribunal to endorse and continue\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 341; Second ER of J. Ellison, Section 8). The Respondent further notes (and the Claimants acknowledge) that these rescheduling agreements (and forgiveness of debts granted by Romania) are the main reason why the Claimants reduced their tax debts by 2005 (R-SPHB, fn. 27; *see* \u00b6 1132 below).\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimants' experts for failing to mention this state of affairs. In particular, the Respondent notes that the table of penalties paid to the State presented in Mr. Osborne's First Report (Table 4, p. 22) covers only 2006-2009, while his working papers include payments as far back as 2002 (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 340).\n\n1128.\n\nFinally, the Respondent stresses that the Claimants have failed to produce evidence (other than witness testimony and experts relying on these witnesses) in support of their claim (R-SPHB, \u00b6 18). Specifically, according to the Respondent:\n\na. There is no contemporaneous correspondence with the Romanian tax authorities or internal documents explaining why they were not paying taxes;\n\nb. There is no correspondence with banks refusing to grant loans due to financial constraints;\n\nc. There is no evidence of the \"business necessities\" on which they spent the \u20ac182 million that they acknowledge was spent after the revocation of the incentives to other ends. The only documentary evidence that Mr. Halbac could point out to was for \u20ac5 million in relation to the brewery (Exh. C-306). (R-PHB, \u00b6 627).\n\n1129.\n\nThe Respondent also points out that \"the vast majority\" of the taxes (and resulting penalties) owed to Romania by the EFDG companies relates to VAT payments and employee social security contributions.235 The Respondent thus argues that the Claimants have improperly retained money that belongs to their customers and employees. In other words, the Claimants have improperly used \"other people's money\" to finance their operations. The Respondent argues that this seriously undermines their claim, in particular with respect to VAT, because the Claimants had the cash on hand to remit the required amount of VAT, but failed to do so. This failure cannot be attributed to reduced cash flows (R-PHB, \u00b6 295; Exh. A to F to the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures; Respondent's Rejoinder on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 18; Respondent's Opposition to Provisional Measures, fn. 9).\n\nIn its Application to Revoke Provisional Measures, the Respondent alleges that VAT comprised approximately 43% of the tax liabilities incurred by EFDG from January 2010 to February 2012 (RApplication to Revoke PM, fn. 85; EFDG tax payment tables, RA-17).\n\n1130.\n\nWith respect to the availability of cash and post-revocation investments, the Claimants acknowledge that they invested approximately \u20ac182 million postrevocation, but contend that these investments were for business necessities in order to continue the operation of the companies, comply with legal requirements and meet contractual obligations (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 128; Tr., Day 8, 69 (Lessard); Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 145-167).\n\n1131.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the Respondent's additional arguments undermine their claim for damages for tax penalties incurred after the revocation of the incentives (CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 132-139). First, the Claimants deny that the mere existence of penalties prior to the revocation negates the causal link between the revocation and penalties post-revocation. As Prof. Lessard explains: \"If the penalties post Revocation could have been avoided absent Revocation and not otherwise, then the fact of earlier penalties does not change the impact on damages\" (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 134).\n\n1132.\n\nSecond, the Claimants reject the Respondent's contention that they had a \"strategy\" of not paying taxes:\n\na. The Claimants contend that the tax arrears and penalties that they incurred in the years prior to the revocation were not due to any such business strategy, but were caused by hyperinflation, regulatory changes and widespread economic difficulties throughout Romania during that period. Romania has suggested that this does not explain the Claimants' situation because they could not have been the only taxpayers affected by this (Second ER of J. Ellison, \u00b6 8.2.3). The Claimants agree but contend that Romania misses the point: the fact is that the period of hyperinflation in Romania was widespread and recognized by the government. Indeed, through the enactment of EGO 163/2000 and EGO 40/2002 (Exh. J and K to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures), Romania acknowledged \"the great number of taxpayers recorded with outstanding budget debts\" as \"the outcome of the economic environment\". These two normative acts offered extensions to taxpayers in arrears and reductions or eliminations of penalties under strict conditions, which the Claimants took advantage of. The Claimants made the additional investments required by Romania for the rescheduling of the debts, and the Claimants paid off outstanding debts in advance of the deadline imposed by Romania under the agreements. The Claimants note that the Respondent has not disputed those facts (C-PHB, \u00b6 137).\n\nb. The Claimants argue that they had fully paid off their tax arrears at the time of Revocation, a fact that the Respondent does not dispute (C-PHB, \u00b6 138).\n\nc. The Claimants deny that they are tax evaders, as they made partial payments on their outstanding state debts after the revocation when they were financially able to do so. For instance, the outstanding balance on state debts decreased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Thus, the Claimants reject any contention that they have deliberately avoided paying taxes or have acted in any way other than in good faith regarding their taxes (C-PHB, \u00b6 139).\n\nd. The Claimants argue that their claim for penalties already paid to Romania is further evidence that the Claimants have not altogether avoided paying their outstanding tax debts (C-PHB, \u00b6 143).\n\n1133.\n\nThe Claimants do not deny that the unpaid taxes for which they are being charged penalties include VAT. However, they dispute the Respondent's calculations of EFDG's tax payments submitted as Exh. RA-17, including VAT calculations (Claimants' Response to Romania's Application to Revoke PM, \u00b6 68). Specifically, the Claimants argue that:\n\na. The Respondent has erroneously duplicated European Food's VAT liability and payments and the figures in the section dealing with persons with disabilities, and\n\nb. The Respondent has erroneously included interest and penalties on unpaid VAT for European Food and Rieni Drinks.\n\n1134.\n\nAt Exh. CA-23 of their Response, the Claimants provide a \"full analysis\" of the Respondent's Exh. RA-17. However, the Claimants do not explain what is the impact of these recalculations on the amount and percentage of VAT owed.\n\n**b. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1135.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Claimants did not pay some of their taxes, and that, as a result, they accrued significant financial penalties.\n\n1136.\n\nThe key question to determine whether this damages claim has merit is whether the Claimants have been able to establish a sufficient causal link between the repeal of the EGO 24 incentives and their failure to pay their taxes. In essence, the Claimants are arguing that, but for the revocation of the incentives, they would have paid their taxes, but because of the revocation, they suffered financial constraints that prevented them from doing so. Thus, the argument goes, to place them back in the position in which they would have been but for the revocation, the Tribunal must award them the penalties they have already paid and those which they will be forced to pay (unless the Respondent waives the latter).\n\n1137.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, to determine whether such a sufficient causal link exists between the Respondent's breach of the BIT and the losses alleged, the Claimants must prove:\n\na. First, that after the revocation of the incentives, the Claimants could not pay their taxes. In other words, that they did not, as a matter of fact, have sufficient funds to pay their taxes.\n\nb. Second, that the dominant cause for this lack of sufficient funds (or the financial constraints that prevented them from borrowing them) was the revocation of the incentives.\n\nc. Third, that but for that lack of sufficient funds, they would have paid their taxes.\n\n1138.\n\nThe Tribunal has found it unnecessary to address points (b) and (c) because it has come to the conclusion that the Claimants have not proved that, as a matter of fact, they had insufficient funds to pay their taxes. In the view of the Tribunal, the relevant question is whether the Claimants had sufficient funds to pay their taxes and to meet the needs of their business, giving due deference to the business judgment of the owners and managers of the business.\n\n1139.\n\nThe Tribunal has first tried to establish from the information in the record what was the amount of the EFDG companies' principal tax debts, which they allegedly could not pay after revocation. This information turned out to be difficult to locate in the Claimants' submissions on the merits, but additional information was provided in the context of the Claimants' various requests for provisional measures on which Romania commented. The Tribunal has found in particular two useful sources: (i) the table provided at paragraph 140 of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, and (ii) footnote 5 of the Claimants' letter of 9 November 2012.\n\n1140.\n\nThe table provided by the Claimants at paragraph 140 of the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief shows the outstanding balance of the Claimants' principal tax debt and penalties from 1 January 2005 up to 30 September 2010, as follows:\n\nSource: Data from EFDG Overdue State Debt and Penalties Expense.xls produced as backup to December 22.2009 Lessard Report, with updated data through September 30, 2010.\n\n1141.\n\nThe Claimants provide the amounts in RON and on a quarterly basis. It would appear from this table that, at the end of 2005, the outstanding balance of the Claimants' principal tax debt was approximately RON 18 million (today approximately \u20ac4 million236), and that by the end of 2006 this outstanding balance was less than RON 5 million (today approximately \u20ac1.1 million), with minimal penalties. However, by the end of 2007 the outstanding balance for the principal tax debt had risen to approximately RON 30 million (today approximately \u20ac6.7 million). Even then, their tax penalties were relatively minor. Since then there has been a steady rise, with its highest point at the end of 2009, where the outstanding principal tax debt appears to have been approximately RON 150 million (today approximately \u20ac33.7 million).\n\nAll Euro amounts in this section reflect the exchange rate of 9 December 2013 of 4.4482 RON/EUR. Source: European Central Bank.\n\n1142.\n\nThese figures are roughly consistent with the Claimants' assertion in footnote 5 of their letter of 9 November 2012, where they stated that \"[i]n March 2006, the EFDC companies had virtually no outstanding tax debt [...]. By the end of 2006, as a result of the premature revocation of the EGO 24 incentives, the EFDC companies accumulated tax debts in the amount of \u20ac4.8 million. By 20 September 2012, as a result of draconian interest and penalties imposed, the EFDC companies' total outstanding tax debt had increased to \u20ac104.1 million.\" Indeed, the first quarter of 2007 shows a principal tax debt of approximately RON 20 million (today approximately \u20ac4.5 million) and no accrued penalties.\n\n1143.\n\nFrom these numbers, the Tribunal concludes that, in 2007, the Claimants would have needed approximately \u20ac5 million to completely pay off their tax debt.\n\n1144.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Parties' arguments on the availability of cash or financing for the payment of tax debts. The Respondent argues that the Claimants (i) did indeed have cash on hand, but chose to spend it elsewhere, and (ii) had access to financing from the EBRD and other banks, but chose not to use it.\n\n1145.\n\nWith respect to the first point, it is undisputed that the Claimants spent \u20ac182 million on other projects and developments after repeal of the Raw Materials Facility (Tr., Day 8, 69 (Lessard); Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 128). The Respondent argues that these funds would have been sufficient to satisfy the Claimants' tax debts (and to fund the Incremental Investments).\n\n1146.\n\nThe Claimants defend their decision to spend money on other operations and expenditures after the revocation of the incentives. Mr. Halbac testified that \"[i]t was determined that we would make investments in our business necessities, as a way of remaining competitive with the business adventures that we did have, and conform ing to legal requirements imposed on food and beverage manufacturers\" (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6 147). In particular, he testified that these expenditures were made to maintain their existing manufacturing platform, preserve their existing market positions, and comply with health and safety laws. According to Mr. Halbac, the Claimants spent approximately \u20ac140 million in investments they considered to be business necessities, and an additional \u20ac27 million in normal maintenance costs. Although Mr. Halbac described these expenditures in some detail (including a breakdown of the various costs), with one exception237 he submitted no documentary evidence in support of his assertions (Second WS of M. Halbac, \u00b6\u00b6 145-167).\n\nThat exception is a contract with Krones dated 10 May 2004 (Exh. 306) for \u20ac 5.2 million related to the expansion of the brewery. [Mr. Halbac mistakenly refers to Exh. 305, and also mistakenly notes the date as 10 May 2003.]\n\n1147.\n\nIn turn, Prof. Lessard stated that \"total investment by EFDG since 2005 has been \u20ac182 million\", noting that \"[t]he majority of these investments were non-discretionary\" (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 127-128). According to Prof. Lessard, the Claimants had identified five categories of investments: fiscal legal obligations, food safety obligations, environmental legal obligations, investments to fulfill contracts signed before the revocation of the incentives, and \"business necessities\", as reflected in Figure 17 of his Second Expert Report, copied below:\n\n1148.\n\nOf these five categories, Prof. Lessard stated that only the first four categories were effectively \"non-discretionary investments\", which he defined as \"amounts that EFDG was required to spend to comply with legal or contractual obligations.\" He stated that these non-discretionary projects accounted for 60% of the investments made since 2005. The remaining 40% was invested in projects that the EFDG considered to be \"business necessities\" (as shown in the table, these amounted to approximately \u20ac70 million). As examples of these \"business necessities\", Prof. Lessard referred to capital expenditures required to maintain the EFDG's existing productive capacity, to the purchase of beer dispensers and new coolers that allowed distribution of beer in draft form, or to the installation of equipment that allowed the EFDG to produce 2.5 liter bottles for mineral water and soft drinks (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130).\n\n1149.\n\nThe Respondent contests the sufficiency of the evidence provided by Mr. Halbac and Prof. Lessard. The Claimants argue that the Respondent had ample opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Halbac about these expenditures and their necessity, but chose not to do so (C-PHB, \u00b6 189). The Respondent in turn argues that there was no need to cross-examine him, because (with the aforementioned exception) Mr. Halbac's assertions were unsupported by documentary evidence (R-PHB, \u00b6 627). In addition, the Respondent points out that Prof. Lessard acknowledged that his understanding with respect to the non-discretionary nature of the Claimants' expenditures postrevocation came from discussions with the Claimants and their personnel (in particular Mr. Halbac), and could cite no documentary evidence in support of his assertion (indeed, in cross-examination Prof. Lessard acknowledged he had not seen any invoices justifying such \"non-discretionary investments\" or \"business necessities\") (Tr., Day 8, 70-71 (Lessard)).\n\n1150.\n\nIn view of the available evidence, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants' assertion that they did not have enough cash to pay their tax debts and, at the same time, meet the needs of their business. The Tribunal reaches that conclusion taking into account the need for the Claimants to be able to continue with their business operations and to exercise managerial discretion in doing so. As noted above, the Claimants could have paid off their outstanding tax debts in full by devoting a mere \u20ac5 million in 2007 for that purpose. But instead of paying these tax debts, the Claimants chose to spend over \u20ac70 million in \"business necessities\"238, despite the fact that the payment of taxes to the State qualifies as a non-discretionary expenditure required to comply with fiscal legal obligations (indeed, Prof. Lessard includes fiscal legal obligations in his description of non-discretionary expenditures). This evidences that the Claimants had made a decision selectively to allocate their available funds among the five categories of \"investments\" they have identified. Expressed otherwise, they had a policy that they would pay taxes if that payment appeared to be sensible in view of the circumstances. In fact, the Claimants do have an earlier history of not paying their taxes, which corroborates that inference.\n\nAs shown in Figure 17 of Second ER of D. Lessard, cited above.\n\n1151.\n\nThe Tribunal does not doubt that the Claimants' investments in these \"business necessities\" were made with the underlying objective to maintain the competitive nature of their business. However, paying taxes is a legal obligation, and not paying them has legal and financial consequences attached to it. The fact of the matter is that, assuming that Prof. Lessard is correct in saying that 60% of the Claimants' expenditures since 2005 were non-discretionary, the Claimants still had approximately \u20ac70 million that they chose to use in other investments or activities. In other words, the Claimants made a conscious choice not to pay \u20ac5 million to extinguish their tax debt in 2007, in favor of making other investments.\n\n1152.\n\nThis may have been a business decision, based on the hope that, by investing in other business activities, the Claimants would have generated more cash than what they would eventually have to pay in taxes and accrued penalties. Prof. Lessard confirmed this at the hearing when, asked why the Claimants had chosen to invest in business necessities instead of in the Incremental Investments, he stated that \"the only inference I can make is that the economics of those expenditures [the alleged business necessities] were even better than the economics of these projects [the Incremental Investments]\" (Tr., Day 8, 71 (Lessard)). Prof. Lessard also stated that the investments in business necessities \"heavily leveraged Claimants' existing assets, and it is reasonable for Claimants to have assumed that they would provide high incremental returns. Thus, Mr. Ellison's suggestion that EFDG could or should have diverted investment from these actual uses to alternative uses is incorrect\" (Second ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 130).\n\n1153.\n\nWhat Prof. Lessard seems to be implying is that, economically, it made more sense to spend the available funds on the business necessities because it would have been more profitable than paying taxes (or building the Incremental Investments). In the case of tax payment (which is by definition not a profitable activity), the implication is that the Claimants believed that the profits they would generate from these business necessities would be higher than the penalties they would accrue by failing to pay their tax debts. Indeed, Prof. Lessard accepted as much in cross-examination:\n\nQ: [...] The claimants had \u20ac182 million to invest after revocation; correct?\n\nA. They spent that amount on various projects, yes.\n\nQ. They chose not to spend any of that amount to pay down the remaining tax debts; correct?\n\nA. Which tells one that they had at least a 36% internal rate of return on the projects they invested in, because that's the cost of the penalties.\n\nQ. Okay. But they chose not to spend this amount to pay down their tax debts; correct?\n\nA. That's correct.\n\n(Tr., Day 8, 85 (Rubins/Lessard)).\n\n1154.\n\nIn other words, the Claimants' decision not to pay their tax debts was a strategic choice, which eventually proved to be the wrong one. The Claimants apparently exercised their business judgment, analyzed the pros and cons, and decided to invest in other projects rather than pay their taxes. But this does not mean that they did not have sufficient funds to pay them and still carry on with their business. It is evident from the record that they did have sufficient funds to pay their taxes, at least at a given juncture, namely in 2007. In the Tribunal's view, this fatally severs the chain of causation. Romania cannot be held liable for the Claimants' bad business decisions, especially if such decisions may have implied failure to comply with certain legal obligations, namely the payment of taxes.\n\n1155.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal does not need to address the remaining elements of proof identified in paragraph 1137 above. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses this claim.\n\n**D. THE RESPONDENT'S DEFENSE THAT ACCESSION TO THE EU BENEFITED THECLAIMANTS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1156.\n\nIn addition to its specific defenses on each of the Claimants' damages claims, the Respondent argues that, even if the Claimants had to pay more for certain raw materials as a result of the repeal of the incentives, this does not necessarily mean that they were harmed overall. To the contrary, the Respondent contends that the Claimants received economic benefits from EU accession that must be taken into account when assessing what compensation is due (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 415-421; RPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 329-331).\n\n1157.\n\nRelying on two expert reports by Dr. Bill Robinson of KPMG Forensic, the Respondent contends that the EU accession process brought \"price stability, increased trade, FDI, reduced risk premia, strong institutions and a marked acceleration in economic growth\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 417, First ER of B. Robinson, sections 5.3 and 5.4). Specifically, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants benefited from \"increased domestic sales due to increased local expenditure on food and beverages (over 42% between 2001 and 2008), an increase of sales abroad due to an expanded export market (between 13% and 30% higher in each year between 2002 and 2008), and access to duty-free imports through the EU customs union\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 418; First ER of B. Robinson, sections 6.2 and 6.3).\n\n1158.\n\nUsing a macroeconomic approach, Dr. Robinson evaluated the tangible benefits of EU accession on 1 January 2007 to the Claimants' business. To quantify these benefits, Dr. Robinson calculated the impact on the Claimants' business of three counterfactual situations (Romania joins the EU in 2009, Romania joins the EU in 2011, or Romania never joins the EU at all), using the following methodology:\n\nFor every percentage point reduction in Romanian GDP growth, the evidence suggests a 0.77 percentage point reduction in growth of expenditure of food and drink and hence (assuming a constant share of Accession-driven growth) in EFDG's sales. By applying actual and counterfactual rates of growth to variable costs and revenues shown in EFDG's financial statements, I calculate the net present value of the effect on EFDG's profits of Romania's Accession in 2007 compared with three counterfactual scenarios [...]. (First ER of B. Robinson, \u00b6 8.1.8)\n\n1159.\n\nAs explained by Dr. Robinson, he tried to assess the effect of a scenario in which the Claimants had access to the incentives but did not have access to the other benefits provided by the EU:\n\n[\u2026] in that world, where they can still have the import exemptions, I am taking it as instructed that they would not have been in the EU, or that accession would have been delayed for a couple of years, and in that world, although they would have had these nice cheap sugar imports, they wouldn't have sold so much soft drink. And my calculation tries to show, as it were, [\u2026] that net effect (Tr., Day 11, 184 (Robinson)).\n\n1160.\n\nDr. Robinson concluded that:\n\na. Had EU accession been delayed by two years, the Claimants would have lost \u20ac18.9 million in profits;\n\nb. Had EU accession been delayed by an additional two years (*i.e.* four years in total), the Claimants would have lost \u20ac34.4 million in profits, and\n\nc. Had EU accession not happened at all, the Claimants would have lost \u20ac235 million (First ER of B. Robinson, \u00b6 8.1.8).\n\n1161.\n\nDr. Robinson confirmed his conclusions in his second report, which responded to Mr. Boulton's criticisms. In particular, he noted that Mr. Boulton had not disputed Romania's growth in prosperity over the last decade, which in his opinion was largely due to EU membership (Second ER of B. Robinson, \u00b6 3.6.1).\n\n1162.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent argues that \"Romania's EU accession resulted in tangible financial benefits for the Claimants that offset any short-term disadvantages from repeal of the Facilities\" (which in the Respondent's view are limited to the Claimants' direct losses claims), and that \"[o]nce this adjustment has been made, the Claimants' direct losses are reduced to nil\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 421).\n\n1163.\n\nRelying on *Metalpar v. Argentina239 and GAMI v. Mexico*,240 the Respondent contends that in situations where state measures both harmed and benefited a claimant's business activities, tribunals have taken the positive impact into account in assessing what compensation is due. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent stated that \"[s]ince the advantages of EU membership would have been lost or at least delayed had Romania maintained state aid (including the EGO 24/1998 facilities), these advantages must be considered to be a benefit accruing to the Claimants as a result of the repeal, to be deducted from any compensation assessed as a result of Romania's alleged breaches\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 416). However, in its Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent clarified that it \"is not making a counterclaim or seeking a set-off against an award of damages\"; it \"simply asks the Tribunal to take into account the important benefits to the Claimants arising out of EU accession in determining the extent to which the Claimants were harmed as a result of Romania's actions\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 331; see also R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 415, and Tr., Day 2, 198-200 (Rubins)).\n\n*Metalpar v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 218-233.\n\n*GAMI v. Mexico,* \u00b6\u00b6 83-87.\n\n1164.\n\nIn turn, the Claimants argue that Dr. Robinson's analysis should be disregarded, both with respect to expectation damages as well as reliance damages, as it is \"entirely unsupported by authority\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 230).\n\n1165.\n\nMore specific comments are provided by the Claimants' expert, Mr. Boulton. Mr. Boulton criticizes Dr. Robinson's report as \"deeply flawed\" (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 2.2), because:\n\na. \"Dr Robinson applies a macroeconomic approach to what is essentially a microeconomic question. In other words, Dr Robinson takes a top down approach to estimating the effect of the EU accession on Romania as a whole, and then simply assumes that the Claimants have benefitted pro rata to the national economy\" (*Id*.), and\n\nb. \"Dr Robinson does not consider whether there is any evidence that the Claimants have in fact benefitted from EU accession and ignores those factors that might have had a negative impact\" (*Id*.).\n\n1166.\n\nIn particular, Mr. Boulton criticizes Dr. Robinson for failing to perform an analysis of the Claimants' financial statements to confirm that they have in fact benefitted from EU accession (*Id*., \u00b6 3.10), for failing to take into account the impact of EU accession on the level of competition faced by the Claimants (*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 3.17-3.22), and for ignoring the potential effect of EU accession on the Claimants' fixed costs, in particular with respect to EU health and safety legislation (*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 3.26-3.28). As a result, in Mr. Boulton's opinion, Dr. Robinson fails to establish that the Claimants have in fact benefitted at all from EU accession (*Id*., \u00b6 2.3).\n\n1167.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent's defense. As a legal matter, it is unclear whether EU accession, an act of general application in Romania which produced effects on every single person, should be accepted as an act having specific effect with respect to specific persons, such as the mitigation of a specific damage. Even if that were possible (a question that the Tribunal does not need to answer), the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's defense on its merits. The issue is what effect EU accession had on the damages suffered by the Claimants. The Respondent contends that EU accession had a mitigating effect on the Claimants' damages, because accession would have had the effect of increasing their sales and therefore their profits. However, the Respondent has not provided a convincing quantification of this effect: the Tribunal does not find that Dr. Robinson's macroeconomic analysis proves the extent, if any, of the benefits of EU accession to the Claimants in particular.\n\n1168.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Dr. Robinson's methodology. It is theoretically possible to attempt to quantify the benefits that accession brought the Claimants by assessing the Claimants' situation in a counterfactual world where accession was delayed or did not happen at all; however, this evaluation must be made with a view to the specific circumstances of the case and a global assessment is relevant only if it is a means to ascertain the effects of accession in the specific case. As Mr. Boulton states, it seems overly simplistic to extrapolate the macroeconomic impact of EU accession on the Romanian economy as a whole to the microeconomic impact on the Claimants (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 3.15). Although EU accession may have benefitted the Romanian economy as a whole, the extent of the benefits (and the costs) of EU accession will have varied greatly across different industries and companies. Indeed, Dr. Robinson accepted in cross-examination that EU accession could have had varying impacts on existing businesses in Romania (helping some and hurting others, even in the same sector). He also accepted that the costs of EU accession could be widely different for Romanian businesses in the same sector (Tr., Day 11, 184-185 (Fleuriet/Robinson)).\n\n1169.\n\nHowever, Dr. Robinson appears to have focused only on the benefits of EU accession, but ignored the costs. For instance, he did not take into consideration in his calculations that the EFDG's labor costs could rise as a result of accession. Although he stated that his underlying model considered increases in labor costs, he \"took the view that they would not change as a result of accession\" (*Id*., 188 (Robinson)). Nor did he consider that the increased sales that he estimated as a result of accession would have required an increase in the Claimants' labor costs: \"I did not increase wage costs because I thought that additional volumes could be sold with the same labour force, and my evidence for that is that volumes at the time were lower than they had been, and I don't imagine the factory had shrunk\" (Tr., Day 11, 203 (Robinson)).\n\n1170.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Robinson did not consider that EU accession could have the effect of decreasing the Claimants' sales as a result of the increased costs and prices due to the revocation of the incentives (a loss of a competitive edge):\n\nQ. Now, you did not account for any lost sales that the claimants may have experienced as a result of paying increased Customs taxes, or as a result of them paying more domestically to avoid such taxes; correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. You have simply assumed -- just so we're clear, you have simply assumed that EU accession only had the positive impact of increased sales?\n\nA. Yes, because Mr Ellison did the negatives.\n\n(Tr., Day 11, 189 (Fleuriet/Robinson).\n\n1171.\n\nFurther, Dr. Robinson did not take into consideration the fixed costs and regulatory burdens imposed by EU accession (e.g., in matters of health, safety or environment), because in his opinion they had not changed (*Id*., 196-197). He acknowledged at the hearing that such costs could have affected the Claimants' performance, but decided that they ultimately did not affect his conclusions. Specifically, when counsel for the Claimants represented that the Claimants had incurred significant costs to comply with EU requirements on wooden pallets, Dr. Robinson made the following comments:\n\nQ. [\u2026] this is an example of one of the fixed costs that would have increased as a result of EU accession that you don't consider in your opinion; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. It's a pretty big omission, is it not, in your opinion, not to have considered increases in fixed costs that were required by -- required of our clients by virtue of the fact that Romania was acceding to the European Union?\n\nA. I don't think those are a very large sum in the general scheme of things. I mean, I worried about it, obviously, because I can see there is a case. I didn't worry about it too much, I mean, partly because, as I say, it's a level playing field; the competitors have those increases as well, so it doesn't mean they lose market share.\n\nI sort of comforted myself with the thought that many other judgments I had taken were really quite deliberately cautious. So the EU effect, you know, is 1.5 to 2, and I used 1.5. The food and drink is 1.1.\n\nNow, you might actually argue that the class of food and drink that EFDG are in are rather more towards the luxury end, with the soft drinks and so forth, so actually that would be a bigger number. But I went with the smaller number, which includes the potatoes and all those other very unelastic items.\n\nSo, yes, I haven't specifically allowed for these factors; I admit that. But I don't think it affects my conclusion.\n\n(Tr., Day 11, 198-199 (Fleuriet/Robinson)).\n\n1172.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that in re-direct examination Dr. Robinson clarified that, in the two scenarios involving delayed accession, all of those additional fixed costs would have happened to the Claimants anyway, it was just a question of when (Tr., Day 11, 209-210). However, that does not detract from the fact that EU accession brought a \"mixed bag of goods\" to Romanian companies, which included varying costs and benefits, all of which need to be assessed to understand the total impact of EU accession on the Claimants.\n\n1173.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the Respondent has failed to prove the extent, if any, of the benefits of EU accession to the Claimants. This does not mean that the Tribunal is oblivious to the fact that EU accession may have had an effect (whether positive or negative) on the Claimants' investments. This raises a procedural question, namely which party must bear the consequences of this uncertainty. It is the Claimants' burden to prove their damage and the Tribunal has found to what extent such damage has been proved. The Respondent has argued that the Claimants' experts have failed to take into consideration the effects of EU accession, and has endeavored to quantify such effects, but - in the Tribunal's view - unsuccessfully. First, the effects of EU accession appear to be mixed, both potentially increasing or decreasing the value of the investment. Second, it is legally difficult to see why an alleged advantage, from which the Claimants should have benefitted in any circumstances and which is available to their competitors, including those who are not located in the distressed zones, should be taken into consideration to their detriment.\n\n1174.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's defense to the extent that it requests a diminution of the damages awarded to the Claimants.\n\n**E. THE CLAIMANTS' REQUEST THAT DAMAGES BE AWARDED NET OF TAXES**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1175.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants had requested that any damages and interest payable be grossed up for taxes, as follows: \"Claimants' Permanent Investor Certificates, valid until April 1, 2009, contained profit tax exemption provisions. Therefore, Romania would not have taxed the additional profit arising from lower costs on raw materials from the customs tax exemption. But-for cash flows after April 1, 2009, reflect the 16% profit tax. However, Professor Lessard assumes that an award in this proceeding would be taxable. Therefore, in order for the Claimants to receive the full amount of direct damages from the loss of the customs tax exemption, the damages and interest through April 1, 2009, must be grossed up to reflect the tax payable on the award\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 652).\n\n1176.\n\nThe Respondent had contended that there is no merit to the Claimants' gross-up claim (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 431-436). Citing Romanian law provisions, it had argued that \"[t]he Corporate Claimants might also be able to set off tax losses against any future taxable profits (including a damages award). Moreover, to the extent that an award is paid to the Micula brothers, Romanian law provides that damages awards are nontaxable\" (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 434).241\n\nRomania relies on the Romanian Fiscal Code (Exh. R-200), Article 42(b), and the KPMG Damages Report, \u00b6 13.3.2.\n\n1177.\n\nHowever, in their Revised Request for Relief the Claimants did not include their request for gross-up, and instead requested, presumably for the same reasons, \"[t]he total amount of damages payable by the Respondent comprising the amounts set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 to be received net of any tax obligations imposed by Romania on the proceeds\" (Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6 4).\n\n1178.\n\nIn their Post-hearing Brief, the Claimants confirmed their primary position that the total amount of damages awarded should be \"received by the Claimants net of any tax obligations imposed by the Respondent on the proceeds\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 268). In their view, the position under Romanian law in relation to both the Individual Claimants and the Corporate Claimants is unclear, but it would be possible for an award to be taxable in both instances. That said, the Claimants asserted that they would maintain their gross-up claim if the Respondent stated that in its view taxes would be payable on an award. Otherwise, the Claimants stated that \"[s]hould the Respondent state in sufficiently clear terms that it will not tax any damages award in favour of the Claimants, the Claimants will not seek that that award be grossed-up for taxes\" (CPHB, \u00b6 269).\n\n1179.\n\nThe Respondent opposed the Claimants' request that the award be paid net of any taxes, and requested the Tribunal not to add any language to that effect. Given the EFDG companies' outstanding tax debts, the Respondent argued that such request \"could well lead to unknown and unintended consequences\". The Respondent urged the Tribunal to \"be cautious about phrasing any award in terms that the EFDG Companies might use in other proceedings\", adding that the language of the award with respect to taxes that the Claimants request is not commonly used in investment arbitration awards (R-PHB, \u00b6 322).\n\n1180.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no justification for providing that the amounts awarded be received net of taxes. First, part of the damages awarded, for instance the damages for increased cost of raw materials, are not profits at all, but a reimbursement of increased costs, even if they may have effect on the profits.\n\n1181.\n\nSecond, with respect to the part of the damages that does refer to lost profits, Mr. Boulton (on whose calculations the Tribunal has relied) has used gross profit margins for his calculations (ER of R. Boulton, \u00b6 5.63). The Tribunal understands from this that the profits calculated by Mr. Boulton are before tax, and thus absent the Profit Tax Exemption would have been subject to tax. The Respondent does not contest that, under EGO 24, until 1 April 2009 the Corporate Claimants were entitled to the Profit Tax Exemption. However, the Tribunal understands that this exemption would apply only to profits made by the Corporate Claimants, and the Claimants have not shown which company within the EFDG would have made the profits that are being awarded.\n\n1182.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is indeed aware of the tax dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent. Given this delicate situation which raises many questions of Romanian law and in view of all circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to use in the Award the language requested by the Claimants.\n\n1183.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Claimants' request that any damages be awarded net of taxes is dismissed.\n\n**F. TO WHOM SHOULD THE AWARD BE MADE?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' request for a different allocation of damages**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1184.\n\nUp until the hearing on the merits, the Claimants did not specify to whom an award should be made.\n\n1185.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants requested \"an award granting them the following relief\", *inter alia*, \"compensation to Claimants for all damages they have suffered, as set forth herein and as may be further developed and quantified in the course of this proceeding\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 666, second bullet point).\n\n1186.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, however, the Claimants stated that \"as a matter of investment treaty law, the Micula brothers are the foreign shareholders while the [C]orporate [C]laimants are the vehicles for some of their investments. For this reason, it's appropriate that any award granted by the Tribunal should be made only to the foreign shareholders protected by the Sweden-Romania BIT, Viorel and Ioan Micula, and [\u2026] they are agreed that as between themselves, the damages should be awarded on a 50/50 basis.\" Citing *Suez v. Argentina* and *PSEG v. Turkey*, the Claimants argued that this approach would be consistent with the approach taken in other treaty cases (Tr., Day 1, 143-145 (Reed)).\n\n1187.\n\nThe Claimants confirmed this position in their Revised Request for Relief submitted on 20 December 2010, where they requested that \"[a]ny damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to the [I]ndividual Claimants, Ioan Micula and Viorel Micula, to be divided between them on a 50:50 basis. In the alternative, any damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to all five Claimants\" (Revised Request for Relief, p. 1).\n\n1188.\n\nThis request was later confirmed in the Claimants' prayer for relief included at the end of their Post-Hearing Brief, in which \"the Claimants request an award granting them the relief set out in the Revised Request\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 279).242 This was further confirmed by the Claimants in their closing arguments during the hearing of June 2011.243 As a result, the Claimants have formally prayed for two alternatives:\n\na. That \"[a]ny damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to the [I]ndividual Claimants, Ioan Micula and Viorel Micula, to be divided between them on a 50:50 basis\" (Revised Request for Relief, p. 1).\n\nb. \"In the alternative, any damages payable, including interest and costs, should be awarded to all five Claimants\" (*Id*.).\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that in the body of their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants argued that \"[s]hould the Tribunal not award damages to the Individual Claimants alone, the Claimants' secondary position is that any \u2018reliance' damages, or damages calculated on the basis of the fair market value immediately before the alleged breach, awarded should be awarded to the Individual Claimants and any other damages should be awarded to all of the Claimants\", and that \"[t]heir tertiary position was that \"any award be made to each of the five Claimants\" (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 258-259). However, these arguments were not formulated as formal requests for relief and, as noted in paragraph 876 above, the Tribunal has focused on the Parties' formal requests for relief.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants did not contradict the President when he stated that he understood that the first two paragraphs at the beginning of page 1 of the Revised Request attached to the Claimants' letter of 20 December 2010 to be a prayer for relief (Tr., Day 12, 134-135 (President L\u00e9vy)).\n\n1189.\n\nIn its Procedural Order of 6 April 2011, which addressed the Respondent's objections to the Claimants' Revised Request for Relief, the Tribunal found that \"in requesting that any damages be awarded to Mr. Ioan Micula and Mr. Viorel Micula (the \"Individual Claimants\") on a 50/50 basis (second sentence of the Revised Request), and in the alternative that any damages be awarded to all five Claimants (third sentence of the Revised Request), the Claimants have reformulated their damages case.\" The Tribunal also found that \"this raises several issues of procedure and of the merits\" (P.O. of 6 April 2011, Section 3.3), and issued certain directions in this regard. Specifically, at Section 4.5 of that same Procedural Order, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to confirm that they wished to maintain their request (Section 4.5(a)). The Tribunal then directed the Parties to address the following matters in their post-hearing briefs (Section 4.5(b)):\n\n(i) Is it possible, as a matter of procedure and of the merits, for the claims of the Individual Claimants to be designated as either sole or principal claimants (as opposed to the Corporate Claimants, who would become subsidiary claimants) at this stage of the proceedings? In particular, would the Corporate Claimants need to waive their claims in favor of the Individual Claimants, and would this waiver be possible under Romanian and international law?\n\n(ii) What are the consequences of this new distribution of damages (if any) on the damages sought by the Claimants as pleaded to this date, both with respect to the factual and legal basis for the sought damages and their quantification?\n\n1190.\n\nIn addition, by letter of 6 May 2011, the Tribunal formulated certain questions to be addressed by the Parties with respect to the Claimants' damages case. In particular, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to address the following points in relation to their new request for allocation of damages:\n\n1.1 [\u2026]\n\na. Please address the Tribunal's questions under Section 4.5 of the P.O. of 6 April 2011. In this context, please clarify what is the exact status of the Corporate Claimants' claims. Are they subsidiary? Are they withdrawn? What are the consequences of either alternative?\n\nb. Please explain what is the legal basis on which the Tribunal should decline to award damages to the three Claimant Corporations and award damages only to the Individual Claimants? Is there a waiver of some kind by the Corporate Claimants?\n\nc. Please address the exact evidence in the record of the harm allegedly suffered by the Individual Claimants.\n\n(Tribunal's letter of 6 May 2011, Section III.A.1.1).\n\n1191.\n\nThe Parties' responses to these questions are set out in Section 2 below.\n\n**2. The Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**a. The Individual Claimants' right to claim damages in their capacity as shareholders**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1192.\n\nCiting a string of cases, the Claimants submit that, as a matter of investment treaty law, the Individual Claimants have the right to claim damages in their capacity as shareholders (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 232-238). According to the Claimants, it is well-established that shareholders have standing to bring claims under investment treaties and may submit claims independently from the corporate entities in which they hold shares without the participation of those corporate entities. This is particularly so in this case, where the BIT defines \"investment\" very broadly as \"any kind of asset owned or controlled invested directly or indirectly by an investor\". In the Claimants' view, this means that the BIT directly protects all the Individual Claimants' rights in the entire investment, including tangible assets and the PICs, rather than merely the individuals' shares. Given that during the jurisdictional phase the Tribunal found that the Individual Claimants were foreign investors covered by the BIT, it follows that they could have brought the claims independently and without the participation of the Corporate Claimants in relation to the entire investment. In the Claimants' view, the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility did not limit the scope of the Individual Claimants' claims to those of the Corporate Claimants; to the contrary, the Tribunal declined to determine every element of property over which it had jurisdiction.\n\n1193.\n\nWith respect to the damages that shareholders may claim as a result of an investment treaty violation, the Claimants contend that shareholders do not need to prove that they suffered harm directly and separately or independently from that suffered by the entity in which they hold shares. According to the Claimants, there is nothing in the BIT, the ICSID Convention or investment treaty law that would limit the rights of shareholders in this respect. For example:\n\na. In *Goetz v Burundi*, the tribunal observed that \"[\u2026] prior ICSID case-law does not restrict the capacity to act to only those legal persons that are directly affected by the alleged breaching measures; it extends that capacity to cover the shareholders in such legal persons, who are the actual investors.\"244\n\nb. In *Bogdanov v. Moldova*, the tribunal stated that \"[i]n the practice of investment arbitration it is generally accepted that the shareholders may be awarded indirect damages (SCHREUER. C. \"Shareholder Protection in International Investment Law\", cit, pp.18f.). The remedy that may be claimed by the Foreign Investor, therefore, is not limited to the damage directly affecting his rights as shareholder in the Local Investment Company, but extends to any losses affecting the assets of the Local Investment Company, including also any reduction in value of the assets due to any alleged breach of contract by the Respondent. The indirect damage suffered by the Foreign Investor, therefore, corresponds to the loss of the Local Investment Company [\u2026].\"245\n\n*Antoine Goetz and others v Republic of Burundi* (ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3), Award Embodying the Parties' Settlement Agreement, 10 February 1999, \u00b6 89, as translated in S.A. Alexandrov, \"The \u2018Baby Boom' of Treaty-Based Arbitrations and the Jurisdiction of ICSID Tribunals - Shareholders as \u2018Investors' under Investment Treaties\", Journal of World Investment & Trade, vol. 6, issue 3, June 2005, pages 393-398 (Exh. C-234).\n\n*Bogdanov v. Moldova* (BIT Arbitration under the Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce), Award, 22 September 2005, pp. 18-19.\n\n1194.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that, in cases where claims have been brought by both shareholders and the companies in which they hold shares, ICSID tribunals have awarded damages directly to the shareholders alone and without the need for those shareholders to quantify their losses separately from those of the companies. The Claimants rely on the following cases, among others:\n\na. *PSEG v. Turkey*, where the Tribunal, after noting that the project company was wholly owned by PSEG Global, decided to award all compensation to PSEG Global.246\n\nb. *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic*, where the tribunal awarded full damages to the parent company for losses suffered by its subsidiary following the subsidiary's loss of its quota.247\n\nc. *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, where claims were brought by both the parent shareholder (Vivendi) and its subsidiary, and the tribunal, after concluding that Argentina had breached its treaty obligations to both Vivendi and its subsidiary, stated that \"[a]s its 94.4% de facto shareholder, Vivendi is entitled to a 94.4% share of [the subsidiary's] damages\".248\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6 340.\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V.(Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007 (hereinafter *\"Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic\"*), \u00b6 367. (\"The Arbitral Tribunal is aware that the loss of quota was suffered primarily by Eastern Sugar Ceska Republika a.s. However, this is a practically wholly-owned subsidiary of the Claimant Eastern Sugar B.V and the value of the subsidiary is in the present circumstances in practical terms determined by the value of the quota allocated to it. The Arbitral Tribunal deems it correct to award to the Claimant full damages for Eastern Sugar Ceska Republika a.s.' loss of quota attributable to the Third Sugar Decree.\")\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v Argentine Republic*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007 (hereinafter *\"Vivendi v. Argentina II\"* or *\"Vivendi II\"*), \u00b6. 8.3.20).\n\n1195.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"[t]he Claimants have confounded two issues: the Miculas' standing to bring a claim and the quantum of damages to which they may be entitled\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 340, R-SPHB, \u00b6 53). The Respondent submits that, \"[w]hile the Miculas' *jus standi* is a matter of jurisdiction, the amount of damages they can be awarded is a separate substantive legal issue.\" The Respondent clarifies that it does not contest the Individual Claimants' standing to bring a claim in respect of their identified investment (their shareholdings), and notes that the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over claims arising from that investment. However, the Respondent emphasizes that that does not mean they are entitled to the same damages as the Corporate Claimants (R-PHB, \u00b6 340).\n\n1196.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the cases cited by the Claimants do not support the proposition that a shareholder can be compensated for the quantum of harm suffered directly from the corporation (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 343-345; R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55). For instance, in *PSEG v. Turkey*, a parent company was compensated for sunk costs that it had itself invested. In *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, the tribunal declined to award the claimant damages for harm to the local company's assets, and instead held that \"[t]he scope of the international law protection granted to the foreign investor in the present case is limited to a single item: the value of his share-holding in the joint-venture entity [\u2026].\"249 In *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic*, the Respondent did not contest the payment of damages to the parent company rather than to the subsidiary, and the claimant had presented a report calculating the loss of share value.250 In *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, the tribunal awarded the investment value of the concession, measured by the sunk costs that Vivendi had put into its local subsidiary.251 In other cases cited by the Claimants, tribunals have awarded damages to compensate shareholders for the loss of value in their equity participation, measured differently from the damages incurred by their subsidiaries (as was the case in *Enron v. Argentina* and *CMS v. Argentina*), or lost dividends (as was the case in *LG&E v. Argentina*). As a result, the Respondent contends that \"[s]hareholder damages are limited to losses suffered by the shareholder himself, such as any losses in the value of his shares or lost dividends\" (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 343-345).\n\n*AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, \u00b6 95.\n\n*Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 358.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina II*, \u00b6\u00b6 8.3.12-8.3.19.\n\n1197.\n\nCiting *Nykomb v. Latvia*252 and *Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico*,253 the Respondent argues that \"[u]nder principles of company law common to virtually all jurisdictions, it cannot be assumed that the harm suffered by even a 100% shareholder equates to the harm suffered by a corporation\" (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 343-348; R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). The Respondent submits in this respect that \"[t]his approach is clearly correct. As noted by the *Nykomb* tribunal, a number of deductions may be made to a company's income before it can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. To ignore this is to be blind to the legal and economic reality of equity ownership\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 346).\n\n*Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB v. The Republic of Latvia*, SCC Case No 118/2001, Award, 16 December 2003 (hereinafter *\"Nykomb v. Latvia\" or \"Nykomb\"*), p 39. (\"The Respondent has argued, and the Arbitral Tribunal must agree, that the reduced flow of income into Windau obviously does not cause an identical loss for Nykomb as an investor. [\u2026] [I]t is clear that the higher payments for electric power would not have flowed fully and directly through to Nykomb. The money would have been subject to Latvian taxes etc., would have been used to cover Windau's costs and down payments on Windau's loans etc., and disbursements to the shareholder would be subject to restrictions in Latvian company law on payment of dividends. An assessment of the Claimant's loss on or damage to its investment based directly on the reduced income flow into Windau is unfounded and must be rejected.\")\n\n*Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico*, \u00b6 12-50 (\"The Claimants' claims for compensation derive only from their status as investors with investments in the form of their respective minority shareholdings in the Concessionaire, as distinct from any claim by the Concessionaire itself. Perhaps inevitably, the Parties' submissions occasionally elided this important distinction, effectively treating the valuation of the Concessionaire's future profits (if any) as the relevant exercise for the assessment of compensation due to the Claimants. The exercise required of this Tribunal is, in contrast, the valuation of the Claimants' lost investments in the form of their shares in the Concessionaire and not, as such, the lost profits incurred by the Concessionaire under the Concession Agreement. The latter are not, of course, irrelevant; but they are not directly relevant as if the Claimants' claims were made by the Concessionaire itself.\")\n\n1198.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's arguments, the Claimants submit, relying on scholarly writings by Ripinsky and Williams, that \"two factors appear to be determinative of whether a shareholder can claim directly the losses of the underlying business or whether a shareholder is restricted to its flow-through damages [...] first the provisions of the relevant BIT; and second, whether the shareholders hold a majority or a minority interest\" (Tr., Day 12, 95 (Reed)). With respect to the first factor, a BIT's definition of investment will determine whether the protection to a shareholder extends only to its direct investments or also to its indirect investments. The Claimants argue that, if the definition of investment extends to a shareholder's indirect investments (as is the case here), then shareholders would be entitled to claim for harm to the assets of the underlying company. With respect to the second factor, the Claimants contend that it would be all the more appropriate to treat the underlying business unit as the protected investment when the shareholder owns a majority interest in the underlying company. In this regard, citing Ripinsky and Williams, they submit that \"[i]f the business unit in its entirety is considered to be the claimant's protected investment, then all of the damages caused to the business must be assumed to flow to the shareholder as the owner of the business, or part thereof, directly without distortion\" (Tr., Day 12, 102 (Reed)).254\n\nThe Claimants do not provide a citation for this, but the Tribunal notes that the text roughly corresponds to S. Ripinsky & K. Williams, Damages in International Investment Law (2008), pp. 149150.\n\n1199.\n\nThe Claimants argue that both of these factors were present in the cases cited by the Claimants where tribunals awarded the parent company the damages suffered by the subsidiary (*Azurix v. Argentina, Vivendi II, Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic*). By contrast, in all of the cases cited by the Respondent except one, at least one of the factors was missing. Specifically, in *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, the relevant BIT did not protect indirect investments of shareholders and the claimant was a minority shareholder, while in *Gemplus and Talsud* the claimants were minority shareholders (Tr., Day 12, 99-103 (Reed)).\n\n1200.\n\nThe Claimants concede that *Nykomb v. Latvia*, cited by the Respondent, does not conform to Ripinsky's and Williams' theory. However, they submit that there is a third factor that should be considered, namely \"whether the company in which the shareholder holds the shares was specifically set up for the purposes of carrying out the investment, and that is therefore whether the local entity is simply a vehicle for the investment, an investment vehicle\" (Tr., Day 12, 105 (Reed)). The Claimants point out that Nykomb had not incorporated the local entity, but had acquired the shares at a subsequent point in time, when the dispute had already arisen, and submit that these circumstances could have been a factor that led the tribunal to limit Nykomb's recovery to the value of its shares.\n\n1201.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Claimants submit that all of the cases cited by the Parties \"can be reconciled with the following proposition: that where a foreign investors [sic] incorporates an entity in the host state for the purposes of making an investment in the host state, and where the investor owns 100% interest or at least a majority interest in the entity thus created and controls it, and where the investment treaty protects both the investor's indirect and direct interests, the local entity can properly be viewed as a conduit or investment vehicle and the investor's protected interest is in the underlying business and assets carried out through the investment vehicle, such that the investor is entitled to claim the local entity's losses as its own\" (Tr., Day 12, 107-108 (Reed)). The Tribunal understands that the Claimants' position is that this is the case here: (i) Article 1(1) of the BIT does not limit its protection to the Individual Claimants' direct investments (their shares), but extends to their indirect interest in the underlying EFDG companies; (ii) the Individual Claimants own virtually 100% of the shares of the EFDG, and (iii) the Corporate Claimants were created as investment vehicles.\n\n1202.\n\nDespite these arguments, the Respondent contends that most of the cases cited by the Claimants do not support the right of shareholders to compensation for the profits lost by the underlying business of their company. For example, in *Siemens* the Tribunal refused to award damages to the shareholder for its subsidiary's lost profits; it only awarded Siemens the book value of the subsidiary itself. Similarly, it argues that claims for lost profits were rejected in *Vivendi II* and *Azurix v. Argentina* (Tr., Day 13, 249 (Rubins))\n\n1203.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that, \"as the present case shows, it would be fundamentally unjust to ignore the fact that shareholders are last in line for corporate assets. Those assets cannot go to shareholders if that means creditors cannot be paid in full\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 346). More specifically, the Respondent argues:\n\na. \"This is part of the basic bargain investors make when they choose to conduct business through corporations rather than in their own names. [\u2026] The Individual Claimants [\u2026] chose to run their food and drinks business through a complex network of corporations because it was advantageous to do so. They cannot now ignore the facts that the Corporate Claimants have separate legal personality; that the Individual Claimants do not own the corporations' assets; or that the corporations' creditors\u2014including the state, through its undisputed entitlement to overdue tax payments\u2014have the first claim on those assets, if (as the Claimants contend) the Corporate Claimants are incapable of paying their debts\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 347).\n\nb. \"[O]ne of the most obvious scenarios in which harm to a corporation causes no compensable harm to shareholders is when the corporation cannot pay its debts, so that the shares have no value in any event. This highlights an important reason for not diverting to the Individual Claimants damages actually suffered by the Corporate Claimants: the risk of a fraudulent conveyance\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 348). Indeed, the Respondent argues the Claimants \"acknowledge that the very reason they have suddenly requested that all damages go to the Individual Claimants is to avoid paying the Corporate Claimants' tax obligations\" (*Id*.).255\n\nThe Respondent cites a letter from King and Spalding dated 15 April 2011 (Exh. R-242), in which the Corporate Claimants state that they \"certainly have no intention of avoiding their liabilities to commercial creditors, in respect of whom they are not in default.\" The Respondent concludes that \"they apparently do intend to avoid their liability for taxes that they admit are overdue\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 348).\n\n1204.\n\nIn response to questions from the Tribunal regarding the protection of the Corporate Claimants' creditors (including Romania) in the case of an award to the Individual Claimants,256 the Claimants stated in their oral closing arguments:\n\n[T]hose points are kind of answered in allowing shareholders to bring these kind of claims. And the reason for that in investment law is they are the real parties in interest in these matters, and creditors, including state creditors, cannot think that they have a claim to these kinds of losses because they know that shareholders have their own rights in international law. So a creditor or the taxman has no expectation that they can recover these taxes or whatever on the basis of amounts to be awarded in an ICSID arbitration.\n\n[...]\n\nWith respect to the position of the [C]orporate [C]laimants and their creditors and employees if the Tribunal were to make an award to the shareholders, [\u2026] in our view strictly as a legal matter, the answer is that the BIT protects foreign investors and breaches of the foreign investors' rights entitled them to compensation, and the foreign investors are the real parties in interest, as has been decided in a number of cases. The fate of the investment vehicle doesn't come into the balance, strictly legally speaking, in our submission.\n\nAs a more pragmatic matter it seems to us that if you were to make the award that we urge, then my client -- Johnny Micula would have an award, and an award is not money. There would be a negotiation with the state and with the banks. Probably the banks would have to take a bit of a haircut because these are basically more or less sound businesses but crippled by debt. If the debt were relieved, things might be better. The state might have to do something as well.\n\nWe see it more as an issue that arises after an award rather than in arriving at the award, as a strict matter. I suppose if the parties can't agree, it is of course plausible that the companies will go into bankruptcy. That doesn't actually mean that people will lose jobs because the businesses will presumably be sold, new investors will be found, they won't have to carry those debts; they will remain with the bankrupt entities. The banks will presumably lose money if the assets aren't sufficient to cover all the debts. We think that's the proper view.\n\nWith that said, it does follow from some of the points that Professor Alexandrov made that you may be in a position to make a distinction between damages owed to the individual shareholders in their own right, and notably in relation to the investments of the companies that are not the corporate claimants, you may be able to take a view on the damages owed to the corporate claimants. So whilst we think that is possible, we don't actually think that is the right approach.\n\n(Tr., Day 12, 133-140 (Reed))\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Alexandrov asked counsel for Claimants: \"If the Tribunal decides to follow your suggestion and order payment to the two individual claimants, wouldn't the Tribunal expose respondent to a situation where respondent would not be able to collect principal due that is not disputed? [\u2026] [A]ssuming we agree with your legal proposition that the two individual claimants are entitled to the damages of the group, and that the damages should be paid to them, if there are any damages of course, the question then is [\u2026] if the Tribunal wants to protect Romania and make sure that Romania collects the debt that is owed by the corporate claimants, how do we reconcile that with the legal proposition that you are advancing that the shareholders are entitled to be paid the amount of damages?\" (Tr., Day 12, 132-134).\n\n1205.\n\nIn its closing statement, the Respondent strongly objected to the Claimants' comments in this respect. According to the Respondent, the Claimants' comments suggest that \"international law gives equity holders a right to take for themselves what may be their company's largest asset, a claim against the state, and creditors be damned\", which is a result that would be \"contrary to basic corporate law\" and could not be expected either by the Corporate Claimants' creditors or their employees (Tr., Day 13, 253 (Rubins)). Instead, the Respondent reiterates that \"the assets of a company, which includes all receivables, do not belong to the shareholders. The [C]orporate [C]laimants have obligations to third parties that rank higher in priority than dividends payments to shareholders: they need to pay corporate creditors, they need to pay their employees' salaries and they need to pay Romania for the undisputed taxes they owe. These are all ahead of them in line.\" (Tr., Day 13, 252 (Rubins)).\n\n1206.\n\nThe Respondent further criticized the Claimants' suggestion that an award of damages would be followed by a negotiation with the Romanian State and other creditors, arguing that the Claimants' position appeared to be that \"international law gives shareholders a stick with which to beat their creditors\" and that it allows them to \"empty the company of its assets under the guise of a BIT and then strike a deal the banks and the state can't refuse because they are holding all the cards\" (Tr., Day 13, 254 (Rubins)).\n\n**b. Is it possible for the Individual Claimants to be designated as the sole or principal claimants at this stage of the proceedings?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1207.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"[i]t is possible as a matter of both procedure and the merits for the Individual Claimants to be designated as the sole or principal claimants at this stage of the proceedings\" (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 239-243).\n\n1208.\n\nThe Claimants first argue that, as \"the Individual Claimants could have brought their claims independently without the participation of the Corporate Claimants in the first instance [\u2026] there is no legal basis why the Individual Claimants cannot become the sole or principal claimants at this stage\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 241). The Claimants rely on *Suez v. Argentina*, where the tribunal allowed the proceedings brought by the local company to be discontinued at the jurisdictional stage, noting that this discontinuance \"[\u2026] does not affect the rights of the Shareholder Claimants to bring a claim in ICSID arbitration under the two BITs in question. The Claimant Shareholders would have had a right to bring such claims independently without the participation of the [local company] in first instance.\"257 Although the Claimants acknowledge that in this case no discontinuance is being sought, and the Claimants' request for damages to be awarded to the Individual Claimants was made at the merits stage rather than at the jurisdictional stage, they argue that the tribunal's reasoning in *Suez v. Argentina* is equally applicable to the present case.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua* *S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17), Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 May 2006 (hereinafter *\"Suez v. Argentina\"*), \u00b6 51.\n\n1209.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants assert that \"the claims for monetary damages in this case have always related to the financial losses suffered by the individual shareholders. The Corporate Claimants were primarily included as Claimants five years ago as a result of the original alternative claim for restitution of the EGO 24 regime. Unlike monetary damages, which have consistently been awarded to shareholder claimants in BIT practice, restitution of a legal framework - essentially an order for specific performance - could only be awarded to the Corporate Claimants. Regardless, that claim for restitution was dropped at the beginning of the merits phase of this case. There has never been any question that this case involved claims for monetary damages, that the Micula brothers owned nearly 100% of the companies comprising the European Food and Drinks Companies, or that the brothers, as shareholders, were the Claimants who ultimately suffered the losses at issue in this dispute\" (CPHB, \u00b6 242).\n\n1210.\n\nIn light of the case law cited in the preceding section, the Claimants contend that awarding damages to the Individual Claimants is lawful under international law:\n\na. The Claimants emphasize that the investment vehicle in *Suez v. Argentina* was entitled to lawfully withdraw its claim, leaving only the shareholders as claimants. Similarly, the Claimants argue that \"as a matter of principle, it must be that in every case where both the shareholders and the local investment vehicle could have brought proceedings but only the shareholders did, the local investment vehicle \u2018waived' its rights to an award.\" In addition, they contend that \"had the Individual Claimants commenced these proceedings alone, this issue would likely never have arisen. Consequently, this is a non-issue about which the Tribunal need not concern itself further\" (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 244-245).\n\nb. The Claimants further submit that \"[t]he approach in international investment law is to award damages to the foreign investor, not to the investment vehicle incorporated in the host state.\" According to the Claimants, \"[t]here are sound policy reasons for this approach\", as the contrary \"would entirely undermine the protections afforded by investment treaties if states could breach their obligations to foreign investors, impose draconian penalties on the local investment vehicle and then demand that tribunals make payments only to the local investment vehicle on the basis that otherwise the investment vehicle will get away with not paying taxes and penalties (that it should never have incurred)\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 246).\n\n1211.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that awarding damages to the Individual Claimants is lawful under Romanian law (although they clarify that, in their view, Romanian law is irrelevant to this issue and the Tribunal should award damages in accordance with international law). Specifically, the Claimants argue that:\n\na. Pursuant to the \"principle of availability\", Romanian law recognizes the right of legal persons to exercise their civil rights as they see fit. According to the Claimants, this principle allows legal persons to determine whether or not they wish to commence legal proceedings, what claims or defenses to make in such proceedings, whether to discontinue or settle such proceedings, and whether to appeal or enforce any decision. The Claimants further submit that this principle gives to legal persons the right to agree that any damages award to which they are entitled be granted to other co-claimants with the same entitlement to such an award. Thus, pursuant to this principle the Corporate Claimants would be entitled to \"waive\" any rights they have to the award (C-PHB, \u00b6 249). In support of this contention, the Claimants cite article 129(6) of the Romanian Procedural Civil Code, which provides that \"[i]n all cases, the judges shall decide only regarding the request's object in dispute.\" According to the Claimants, \"[a]s it is applied, that provision supports the Claimants' contention that they can decide amongst themselves how the Tribunal is to award their damages. There is no requirement that the Corporate Claimants formally waive their claims in order to apply that principle\" (C-PHB, fn. 364).\n\nb. In addition, the Claimants submit that nothing in the Romanian Commercial Code or laws regulating companies, including Law 31/1990, would prevent the Corporate Claimants from assigning their rights to the award to the Individual Claimants (C-PHB, \u00b6 250).\n\n1212.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent submits that the Individual Claimants cannot be designated as sole or principal claimants at this stage without Romania's consent or without complying with certain legal requirements (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 335-338, R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64).\n\n1213.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, if the Individual Claimants were designated as sole Claimants at this late stage with the consent of the Corporate Claimants, that would constitute an abandonment of the Corporate Claimants' claims that would amount to a partial discontinuance of the proceeding. In that case, the Respondent argues that it would be entitled to an award with *res judicata* effect against the Corporate Claimants. The Respondent explains that the Corporate Claimants cannot discontinue the proceeding without Romania's consent under Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and that Romania will not consent to any resolution that would permit the Corporate Claimants later to revive claims or requested relief that they have pursued (or could have pursued) in this proceeding, or without compensation for wasted costs.\n\n1214.\n\nRomania further contends that the Claimants' reliance on *Suez v. Argentina* is inapposite, because in that case the local company's claims were withdrawn without objection by the Respondent. Here Romania has objected expressly: \"apart from the substantive unfairness to the Corporate Claimants' creditors, including Romania, of the proposed waiver, a respondent that has been made to defend proceedings for five years has a legitimate interest in both an award with *res judicata* effect and reimbursement of its wasted costs as conditions of a discontinuance\" (R-SPHB, \u00b6 61).\n\n1215.\n\nAccording to Romania, Romanian substantive and procedural law lead to the same conclusion. Citing Romanian case law, the Respondent submits that \"[a] court need not accept a claimant's withdrawal of claims over the respondent's objection; but if the court does accept the withdrawal, it must render a judgment extinguishing the underlying right and determining the costs consequences of the claimant's waiver\"258 (R-SPHB, \u00b6 61).\n\nThe Respondent cites Civil Decision 28/30 January 2008, Constanta Court of Appeal, Civil Section; High Court of Justice and Appeal of Romania Decision 3519/26 November, 2008; Romanian Civil Procedure Code, Article 247(1).\n\n1216.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, in any event, Romanian civil and company laws prohibit any action, including renunciation of claims, that could violate the rights of third parties, including removing assets from a company's patrimony to the detriment of creditors.259 Given the value of the Corporate Claimants' damages claims and the Claimants' assertion that the Corporate Claimants have zero equity value and cannot pay their overdue debts, the Respondent argues that relinquishing those claims would prejudice the rights of creditors. The Respondent notes that Romanian law permits an interested party, such as a creditor, to move to nullify the waiver.260 Romania, which is a substantial creditor, opposes the waiver, but notes that the other creditors of the Corporate Claimants may have no knowledge of a proposed waiver (R-SPHB, \u00b6 62).\n\nThe Respondent cites Law 31/1990, Article 237(3), Article 237(4), and Article 272 (1)(2).\n\nThe Respondent cites the Romanian Civil Code, Title III, Chapter III, Section II, Article 975.\n\n1217.\n\nEven if the Corporate Claimants were to waive their own damages claims, the Respondent argues that that would not be equivalent to assigning those claims to the Individual Claimants (R-PHB, \u00b6 336). Only by assignment, and not by waiver, could the Individual Claimants receive compensation for harm to the Corporate Claimants. However, the Respondent argues that \"Romanian law does not permit a debtor to give away an asset, receiving no payment in return, if that may frustrate creditors' ability to recover what they are owed. When the debtor is a corporation or limited liability company, the conditions are stricter, as such entities can only rarely make gratuitous transfers (particularly to their own shareholders). To effect an assignment, the Corporate Claimants and Individual Claimants would need to enter into an assignment agreement, on an arm's length basis - in other words, in which the Individual Claimants paid market value for the assignment. Procedurally, the assignment would have to be validly approved by a general meeting of shareholders, and it would have to be publicised in a manner set out by Romanian law if it were to have any effect against third parties - including, again, the Corporate Claimants' creditors who are not represented here\" (R-SPHB, \u00b6 63).261 Here, the Respondent points out that the Corporate Claimants have not assigned their claims to the Individual Claimants, and it is highly unlikely that such an assignment could be made without violating Romanian civil and criminal law (R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64).\n\nThe Respondent cites Law 99/1999, Title VI, Chapter 1, Article 2(a) and Chapter 3, Article 29, as well as Articles 1391 *et seq*. of the Romanian Civil Code.\n\n1218.\n\nWithout an assignment of the Corporate Claimants' claims, the Respondent contends that the Individual Claimants cannot receive compensation that they have not proven to be their own. As explained in the previous section, the Respondent submits that, if liability is proven, each Claimant would be entitled to compensation for harm to his or its own investment, and damage to the Corporate Claimants' assets cannot be equated with damage to the Individual Claimants' shares in the Corporate Claimants. As a result, the Claimants cannot properly ask the Tribunal to award to the Individual Claimants damages that would have been awarded to the Corporate Claimants had they not stepped aside. Thus, the request for \"all damages\" to be paid to the Individual Claimants cannot entitle them to anything more than compensation for losses they have suffered (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 336-337).\n\n1219.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, \"[f]or the same reason, it is irrelevant that the Individual Claimants could have chosen to bring a case by themselves, without joining the Corporate Claimants. Had they done so, they would have been entitled (assuming liability) only to damages they had suffered. [...] Whether the Corporate Claimants withdraw now, had never been in the case, or continue to pursue their own damages claims, the Individual Claimants would not be entitled to receive compensation that they have not proven to be their own\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 338).\n\n**c. The impact of the Claimants' requested allocation on the factual or legal bases for the claimed damages or their quantification**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1220.\n\nThe Claimants contend that \"[a]warding damages to the Individual Claimants alone does not have any consequences with respect to the factual or legal basis for the claimed damages or the quantification of those damages\" (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 251-254). The Claimants assert that the Individual Claimants own (directly or indirectly) virtually all of the shares in each of the companies of the EFDG. As a result, had the Individual Claimants commenced these proceedings on their own, as the Claimants argue that they were entitled to do, they could have claimed and been entitled to all of the damages being sought in these proceedings.\n\n1221.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent argues that the Individual Claimants are not entitled to any damages, because they have not proven the quantum of any loss. Indeed, the Respondent contends that there is no factual basis for any award of damages to the Individual Claimants, whether or not the Corporate Claimants stay in the case, because the Claimants have not assessed the damages incurred by the Individual Claimants, whether as shareholders of the Corporate Claimants or in any other capacity. The Respondent also argues that the Claimants have not justified their request for a different damages allocation, and that this request at such a late stage constitutes a change of position that should be taken into consideration when determining costs (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 332-350, R-SPHB, \u00b6\u00b6 53-65).\n\n1222.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, because they have not proved damages that they themselves have suffered (*i.e*., the diminution in value of their shares), the Individual Claimants should receive nothing. The Respondent adds that \"[t]his is the Individual Claimants' burden of proof, and they have not even attempted to quantify the loss in value of their shareholdings in the Corporate Claimants. The Claimants have consistently declined to instruct one of their many quantum experts to carry out such a valuation. It would be fundamentally improper, and improper to Romania, to excuse this willful failure of proof and guess at a damages figure for the Individual Claimants, which is the only basis on which any damages could be awarded to them\" (R-SPHB, \u00b6 65).\n\n1223.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's contentions, the Claimants argue that there is significant evidence in the record showing that the Individual Claimants have suffered harm as a result of the Respondent's unlawful actions (C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 255-257):\n\na. According to Mr. Osborne's calculations, in 2001 the EFDG had retained earnings of \u20ac152 million. The Claimants argue that this means that the EFDG companies could have paid to their shareholders (the Individual Claimants) \u20ac152 million at that time. The Claimants further assert that today the EFDG's retained earnings are gone and as such, the Micula brothers, as shareholders, have lost at least that \u20ac152 million (less the \u20ac17 million worth of dividends paid in the interim period) (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6\u00b6 3.27-3.30).\n\nb. In his reliance damages analysis, Mr. Osborne valued the Claimants' pre-EGO 24 businesses at \u20ac400 million.262 According to the Claimants, had the Individual Claimants sold their businesses at that time for that price, the Individual Claimants, in their capacity as shareholders, would likely have received the vast majority of this sale. Also relying on Mr. Osborne, the Claimants contend that, if the Miculas were to sell their businesses today, they would likely recover not a single lei. The Claimants argue that Mr. Ellison agreed that the value of the shares prior to the revocation could have been as high as \u20ac350 million and that the current value of the shares is likely to be nil or virtually nil (Tr., Day 12, 109110 (Reed); Tr., Day 10, 36-37 (Osborne)).\n\nc. The Individual Claimants have suffered losses even from an expectation damages perspective. The Claimants argue that, \"[h]ad the Claimants been able to make additional sales, due to the advantages of the Raw Materials Incentive (including an ability to sell their products at lower relative prices than their competitors to take advantage of the SCP opportunity) and by being able to complete the Incremental Investments (again by being able to take advantage of the incentives), the Claimants' businesses would have been more profitable, which would likely have led to increased dividends to the shareholders and/or the Individual Claimants being able to sell the businesses for a considerable profit.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 886 above, the Tribunal understands that the Claimants' final prayer on the basis of Mr. Osborne's reliance damages analysis is RON 811 million, not \u20ac400 million. That being said, as the Tribunal is not awarding any damages for this head of claim it is unnecessary to determine whether the Claimants could have augmented this claim.\n\n1224.\n\nWith respect to the impact of their requested allocation on the quantum of damages, in their closing statements the Claimants made the following comments (Tr., Day 12, 108-112 (Reed)):\n\na. \"If the Tribunal considers that the Micula brothers' protected investments in Romania include the underlying business assets, then no separate damages calculation is required: all the damages should be awarded to the brothers as 50/50 shareholders. There's no need for the [C]orporate [C]laimants to withdraw from the case or to waive any claim, and the award would be binding upon them.\" (Tr., Day 12, 108-109 (Reed)).\n\nb. In the Claimants' submission, the question of flow-through damages only arises if the Tribunal takes the view that only the Individual Claimants' shares constitute protected investments. In this case, their damages would be limited to the impact on the shares themselves, in particular to the loss of value of those shares. The Claimants argue that this loss of share value has been calculated by Mr. Osborne in his reliance damages analysis.263 As explained in the paragraph 1223.b above, the Claimants submit that, based on this analysis, the loss of value of the Individual Claimants' shares is \u20ac400 million.\n\nc. If, as in *Nykomb*, the Tribunal were inclined to take a stricter approach, and was inclined to limit the damages to the shareholders to amounts that would have been available to distribute as dividends, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal would still be able to establish quantum in this case. The Claimants argue that the Individual Claimants would have been entitled to take as dividends all of the retained earnings built up in the EFDG companies over the preceding years. The Claimants assert that the retained earnings of the EFDG companies over the years 1999-2004 amount to \u20ac173 million, a number that is not controversial as it is taken directly from the accounts and does not require computation. The Claimants argue that, because these amounts were earnings available for distribution as dividends, they take into account all of the creditors (Tr., Day 12, 110-111 (Reed)). The Claimants further contend that, under the *Nykomb* approach, the Individual Claimants would have been entitled to a proportion of the EFDG companies' future income (*i.e.* the Claimants' claims for expectation losses). The *Nykomb* tribunal assessed that the shareholders were entitled to one-third of the underlying company's losses, but the Claimants submit that under normal circumstances a higher proportion would be appropriate (Tr., Day 12, 110-112 (Reed)).\n\nThe Claimants refute the Respondent's suggestion that they did not instruct any of their experts to carry out an evaluation of the loss of value of the shares of the Individual Claimants in the EFDG: they argue that this evaluation was carried out by Mr. Osborne in his reliance damages analysis.\n\n1225.\n\nIn turn, the Respondent denies that the Individual Claimants' loss of shareholder value can be quantified on the basis of Mr. Osborne's reliance losses analysis:\n\na. The Respondent acknowledges that Mr. Osborne attempted to quantify the EFDG shareholder equity prior to the revocation by comparing EFDG to other publicly traded companies in the same line of business. However, the Respondent contends that the valuation date chosen by Mr. Osborne (2001) is not a proper valuation date because it is neither the date of the breach nor the date of the award. Rather, the Respondent argues that Mr. Osborne chose 2001 because it is the date of EFDG's financial peak, the \"year just before the straightline drop\" in the financials, \"so it's helpful to come up with a big number\" (Tr., Day 13, 250 (Rubins)).\n\nb. The Respondent also denies that Mr. Ellison confirmed a nil value for the EFDG today. The Respondent asserts that Mr. Ellison said that the value could be nil, but as he had not seen any audited financial statements for the EFDG since 2006, \"he could say nothing about the state of EFDG's business today, and [the Tribunal] can't know because of the absence of documentation\" (Tr., Day 13, 250 (Rubins)). Indeed, the Respondent asserts that, in their closing statements, the Claimants stated that the EFDG's business had been improving in 2009264 and that this was also confirmed by a better EBITDA in the financials (Tr., Day 13, 250-251 (Rubins)).\n\nc. The Respondent also notes that, according to Mr. Ellison, there was substantial shareholder equity in the business according to the 2009 draft financial statements, which suggests substantial remaining value for the Micula brothers. Specifically, the Respondent states that \"[a]ccording to the draft 2009 accounts, shareholder equity was RON 461.7 million; [\u2026] \u20ac109 million roughly. So by assuming a zero value today, which is what Mr. Osborne does, he was asking you to ignore that \u20ac109 million are there, and the claimants would be likely to access that money on liquidation\" (Tr., Day 13, 252 (Rubins)).\n\nThe Respondent notes that, in their closing statements, the Claimants admitted that \"on operating profits the company has actually performed better in 2009 than in 2008, although not well enough to meet their debt repayment obligations\" (Tr., Day 12, 119 (Reed), and that \"[t]hese are basically more or less sound businesses but crippled by debt. If the debt were relieved, things might be better\" (Tr., Day 12, 139 (Reed)).\n\n1226.\n\nInstead, the Respondent argues that the proper way to value the Individual Claimants' losses would have been \"to perform a DCF valuation of the claimants' business as it was just before repeal and as it would have been with the \u20ac8 million per year in facilities through 2009\", because this would have allowed the Tribunal to isolate the effect of the revocation. The Respondent \"infer[s] that the result of such conventional modelling would have revealed the limited direct impact on equity value\" (Tr., Day 13, 251-252 (Rubins)).\n\n1227.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that, \"[o]n this record, the only damages that have been quantified are damages allegedly incurred by EFDG companies, not all of which are claimants. The Tribunal should ensure that only damages proven to have been incurred by each Corporate Claimant are awarded to the specific Corporate Claimant that incurred them. [\u2026] [D]amages allegedly incurred by other entities cannot be recovered by any of the Claimants\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 350).\n\n1228.\n\nIn response to questions from the Tribunal, the Claimants clarified that, if the Tribunal were inclined to award damages to all five Claimants, the damages suffered by the Individual Claimants may not be coextensive with those suffered by the Corporate Claimants:\n\na. With respect to the reliance losses claim, the Corporate Claimants could not make the same claim as the Individual Claimants, because the reliance loss is calculated on the loss of value to all companies of the EFDG (Tr., Day 12, 129 (Reed)), not all of which are claimants here. Possibly somewhat contradictorily, the Claimants have also argued that, should the Tribunal award reliance damages, it would be inappropriate to award these damages to the Corporate Claimants. This is because the reliance damages approach looks at the value lost from the pre-EGO 24 businesses as a result of investing in reliance on the incentives. As the Corporate Claimants were specifically created in order to receive the incentives, had the Individual Claimants not invested in reliance on the incentives, it is likely that the Corporate Claimants would have never been created and thus would have never incurred a reliance loss (C-PHB, \u00b6 253).\n\nb. For similar reasons, should the Tribunal award damages by looking at the fair market value of the investment immediately before the breach, the Claimants contend that such an award ought to be made to the Individual Claimants to compensate them for the loss in value of their business (C-PHB, \u00b6 254).\n\nc. With respect to expectation losses, counsel for the Claimants first stated that \"they would not be coextensive if much of the loss was suffered outside of the three [C]orporate [C]laimants\", but then clarified that \"they may be more or less the same\", depending on which company had suffered most of the damages, adding that in his understanding \"most of the expectation damages would have been suffered by European Food\" (Tr., Day 12, 129-130 (Reed)).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis with respect to the requested allocation of damages**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' request that all damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1229.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects, for procedural reasons, the Claimants' request that all damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants.\n\n1230.\n\nRelying on *Suez v. Argentina*, the Claimants contend that, as \"the Individual Claimants could have brought their claims independently without the participation of the Corporate Claimants in the first instance [\u2026] there is no legal basis why the Individual Claimants cannot become the sole or principal claimants at this stage\" (CPHB, \u00b6 241).\n\n1231.\n\nThat the Individual Claimants could have brought claims on a stand-alone basis is not in dispute. However, the Tribunal disagrees with the consequences that the Claimants purport to derive from that observation. It is true that in *Suez v. Argentina* the tribunal, applying Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules,265 allowed the local company to withdraw its claim leaving only the shareholders as claimants.266 However, the local company in that case elected to pursue a very different route than that followed by the Corporate Claimants in this case. First, the investment vehicle expressly withdrew its claim and sought a discontinuance of the proceeding. Second, upon Argentina's request, the local company supplied the minutes of their shareholders meeting authorizing that discontinuance. Third, having received those assurances, Argentina consented to the discontinuance.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 44 provides: \"If a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall in an order fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance. If no objection is made in writing within the time limit, the other party shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance and the Tribunal, or if appropriate the Secretary-General, shall in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding. If objection is made, the proceeding shall continue.\"\n\n*Suez v. Argentina*, \u00b6 51.\n\n1232.\n\nHere the situation is quite different. The Corporate Claimants have not requested the discontinuance of the proceedings with respect to their claims. Quite to the contrary, the Corporate Claimants are still seeking alternative relief in case the Tribunal decides not to grant all damages to the Individual Claimants. As a result, Rule 44 is simply not applicable to the situation at hand.\n\n1233.\n\nEven if the Claimants' request could be interpreted as an implied request for a discontinuance with respect to the Corporate Claimants (*quod non*, because they have expressly stated that they are not seeking a discontinuance), the conditions set out by Rule 44 would not be satisfied because Romania has objected to such a discontinuance. Indeed, Romania has expressly stated that it will not consent to any resolution that would permit the Corporate Claimants to revive at a later date the claims or the relief that they have pursued (or could have pursued) in this proceeding, or without compensation for wasted costs.\n\n1234.\n\nRule 44 provides that if an objection is made, the \"proceeding shall continue\", regardless of the nature of the objection, or whether it is justified or not. In this case, moreover, Romania's objections are more than reasonable.\n\n1235.\n\nAs the Corporate Claimants have not discontinued their claims, it follows that they are not waiving their claims against Romania and, in fact, definitely maintain them in the event that the Tribunal should not make the award fully payable to the Individual Claimants. Moreover, there is nothing in the Claimants' submissions that could amount to a conditional waiver (that is, a waiver conditioned upon the Individual Claimants obtaining the requested relief). Even if the Corporate Claimants had indicated that they waived their claims against Romania, there is no evidence in the record establishing that such waiver would be valid, in particular under Romanian law (for instance, there are no shareholders' minutes or board resolutions from the Corporate Claimants or their shareholders authorizing such a waiver). In these circumstances, the Tribunal agrees with Romania that it is entitled to an award with *res judicata* effect against the Corporate Claimants.\n\n1236.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, whether the Individual Claimants could have been entitled to bring this case independently, without the participation of the Corporate Claimants, is irrelevant. They did not choose to do so. The fact is that this arbitration was commenced and pursued by five Claimants, all of whom have requested relief to this Tribunal. The Corporate Claimants have sought the same relief as the Individual Claimants and have not withdrawn their claims. The Tribunal must thus decide the claims raised by the five Claimants and not only the claims raised by two of them.\n\n1237.\n\nAll five Claimants have requested monetary relief. The Tribunal having found liability, the Claimants' request to have all damages awarded to the Individual Claimants would thus deprive the Corporate Claimants of a right (credit or account payable) to the relief requested. This would amount to the Corporate Claimants suffering a loss in the amounts owed in favor of their shareholders, which is particularly serious considering that the Claimants allege that the Corporate Claimants are unable to pay their debts. The Corporate Claimants would have to give their valid consent to such a conveyance, for instance, through an assignment of their claims to the Individual Claimants, an assignment that would have to comply with the relevant provisions of Romanian law. There is no evidence in the record that they have done so. Thus, as things stand, the Tribunal cannot disregard the Corporate Claimants' requests for relief.\n\n1238.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' request for all damages to be awarded to the Individual Claimants.\n\n**b. Allocation of damages to all five Claimants**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1239.\n\nAs previously explained, in calculating the total damages, the Tribunal has decided to follow the Claimants' primary damages methodology, which quantified expectation damages for the entire EFDG. The Tribunal has found that the Claimants have proven two groups of damages: (i) increased costs of raw materials (sugar, other raw materials other than PET, and the sugar stockpile) for a total of RON 120,733,229 (Section VII.C.2), and (ii) lost profits of RON 255,700,000 on the sale of finished goods (Section VII.C.3 above).\n\n1240.\n\nThe Tribunal still must consider whether, and how, the damages should be allocated among the five Claimants. The Tribunal has carefully considered the arguments of both sides. As discussed above, the Tribunal has concluded that (i) it cannot award the entirety of the damages to the Individual Claimants. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal has also concluded that it cannot (ii) award the entirety of the damages to the Corporate Claimants; (iii) allocate the damages to each of the five Claimants; or (iv) without double counting, compensate the Corporate Claimants for the direct harm they suffered and compensate the Individual Claimants for the indirect harm they suffered. As a result, the Tribunal shall not allocate the damages but shall award the entirety of the damages to the five Claimants collectively.\n\n1241.\n\nFirst, for the reasons set out in Section (a) above, the Tribunal cannot award the entirety of the damages to the Individual Claimants.\n\n1242.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal cannot award the entirety of the damages to the Corporate Claimants, for the simple reason that a portion of the damages are associated with *other* companies that the Individual Claimants own. The Corporate Claimants are not entitled to compensation for such damages.\n\n1243.\n\nThird, in Method A, the Claimants' principal expectation damages scenario (which the Tribunal has chosen to follow for the reasons set out in Section VII.C.1 above), the Claimants have made no attempt to allocate the damages among the five Claimants other than to request that the total damages be split evenly between the Individual Claimants.267 In addition, it is evident from the reports prepared by the Claimants' experts and from their oral testimony that, for each head of claim, they have quantified the losses for the entire EFDG, including damages suffered by the nonclaimant companies.268 While counsel for the Claimants asserted at the hearing on closing arguments that \"most of the expectation damages would have been suffered by European Food\" (Tr., Day 12, 130 (Reed)) and Prof. Lessard testified along the same lines during the merits hearing (Tr., Day 8, 118-121), neither the Claimants nor their experts have provided a figure for the damages suffered by each Claimant, or stated in what proportion these damages should be distributed. Nor does the record contain clear elements that would allow the Tribunal to carry out such an allocation. There is, therefore, no evidentiary basis for allocating the damages.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, at paragraph 258 of their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants stated that their secondary position was that \"any \u2018reliance' damages, or damages calculated on the basis of the fair market value immediately before the alleged breach, awarded should be awarded to the Individual Claimants and any other damages should be awarded to all of the Claimants\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 258). However, the Claimants have not made a formal prayer for this relief. Even if this statement could be construed to be a prayer for relief, the Tribunal rejects it on the merits. First, the Tribunal has not awarded any reliance damages nor damages based on the fair market value of the Claimants' investments immediately before the breach. In addition to favoring the Claimants' expectations damages case (as discussed in Section VII.C.1 above), the Tribunal does not find that the record contains a reliable quantification of the fair market value of the Claimants' investments immediately before the breach. The Tribunal understands that Mr. Osborne's analysis of reliance losses does not attempt to quantify the fair market value of the Claimants' business before the breach, but rather the value of the Claimants' pre-EGO 24 business, that is, money they could have invested elsewhere if they had not invested in reliance on the incentives. Even if Mr. Osborne's quantification could be understood to be a proxy for the fair market value of the business before the breach, the Tribunal cannot accept it, as the valuation date chosen by Mr. Osborne (2001) predates the revocation by over three years. In any event, the Claimants have not demonstrated how these reliance damages would be compatible with other damages, nor provided sufficient support for the allocation requested.\n\n*See, e.g.,* First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73; Tr., Day 8, 118-121 (Lessard); First ER of C. Osborne, fn. 1 and Appendix 2 (definition of \"Companies\"); ER of R. Boulton, p. i (definition of \"Companies\"); Second ER of BCG, p. 2; Tr., Day 10, 88-89 (Osborne).\n\n1244.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' failure to quantify damages for each Claimant is reason to deny the payment of some or all of the damages. According to the Respondent, \"the only damages that have been quantified are damages allegedly incurred by EFDG companies, not all of which are claimants. The Tribunal should ensure that only damages proven to have been incurred by each Corporate Claimant are awarded to the specific Corporate Claimant that incurred them. [\u2026] [D]amages allegedly incurred by other entities cannot be recovered by any of the Claimants\" (RPHB, \u00b6 350). The Respondent further argues that the Individual Claimants cannot be awarded damages suffered by the EFDG companies, because \"damage to the Corporate Claimants' assets cannot be equated with damage to the Individual Claimants' shares in the Corporate Claimants\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 336). Instead, the Respondent submits that \"[s]hareholder damages are limited to losses suffered by the shareholder himself, such as any losses in the value of his shares or lost dividends\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 344).\n\n1245.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Claimants have quantified the damage suffered by the entire EFDG, of which the Corporate Claimants are a part and of which the Individual Claimants own at least 99.96%. In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal does not find that the Claimants' failure to specify and prove the exact quantum of damages suffered by each one of the five Claimants is sufficient reason to deny the payment of the damages that have been quantified. The Tribunal is satisfied that some or most of the damage was directly suffered by the Corporate Claimants, and that virtually all of the damage was indirectly suffered by the Individual Claimants. There is nothing inconsistent between those two conclusions. Indeed, while the Tribunal will not enter into the discussion of whether shareholder damages are equivalent to the damages suffered by the underlying company,269 the Tribunal is satisfied that, given the size of the Individual Claimants' shareholding in the EFDG companies, the Individual Claimants indirectly suffered at least a large part, if not virtually all, of the damage suffered directly by the Corporate Claimants. Furthermore, the Tribunal has already found that, provided that the Individual Claimants can prove their ownership of the other companies in the EFDG and can prove that they have been affected in this regard by the Respondent's breaches of the BIT, they can claim for losses they have suffered indirectly through those companies (see Section VII.B.2 *supra*). The Tribunal has further found that the Individual Claimants have met that burden and are, therefore, entitled to damages suffered by the non-claimant EFDG entities as well. Having established that both the Corporate and Individual Claimants were harmed, the Tribunal is not comfortable with declining to award damages to one group or the other simply because it lacks the information needed to allocate the damages among them.\n\nIf the Tribunal had to address this matter, it would not do so unanimously.\n\n1246.\n\nFourth, on the current record, the Tribunal cannot separately award damages to the Corporate Claimants for their direct damages, and damages to the Individual Claimants for their indirect damages. In Method A, the Claimants have only quantified the direct damages suffered by the entire EFDG. The Tribunal has no basis to distinguish which part of those damages has been suffered directly by the Corporate Claimants, and which part has been suffered indirectly by the Individual Claimants as a result of their shareholdings in non-claimant companies of the EFDG. Nor can the Tribunal award the Corporate Claimants all of the direct damages quantified in Method A, and in addition award the Individual Claimants the reliance damages quantified in Method C.270 To do so would result in double recovery.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has rejected Method C, for the reasons set out in Section C.1 and fn. 267 above.\n\n1247.\n\nGiven these constraints, the Tribunal concludes that the appropriate way forward is, as the Claimants suggest, to award any damages, interest and costs to all five Claimants collectively, without allocating the damages among them. The Tribunal believes that this conclusion is particularly appropriate given that neither party has actually prayed for a particular allocation of damages among the five Claimants. The Claimants have requested that all damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants or, alternatively, to all five Claimants. They have not proffered adequate evidence or legal arguments to support a particular allocation. The Respondent also has not sought any particular allocation, other than to oppose Claimants' request that damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants. This Award thus disposes of the total amount that Romania has to pay fully to discharge its obligations and does not deal with the specific entitlement of each Claimant individually.\n\n1248.\n\nA tribunal should not pass judgment on what has not been claimed. In particular, if two or more claimants fail to request a specific allocation of damages and rather claim for common entitlement, there is no reason for a tribunal to determine which claimant is entitled to what, subject of course to counterclaims or defenses made by the respondent in this regard.\n\n**VIII. INTEREST**\n------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1249.\n\nUp until their Reply, the Claimants requested \"post-award interest (until the date Romania pays in full) at the highest possible lawful rate\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 657). The Claimants further requested that this interest be compounded, arguing that compound interest is the generally accepted standard in international investment arbitrations (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 657-658).\n\n1250.\n\nHowever, in their Revised Request for Relief the Claimants requested \"[a]n award of interest on the damages payable pursuant to paragraph 2 above calculated in the following manner:\n\n3.1 For losses as described in paragraphs 2.1(a) to (c) above [i.e., increased cost of raw materials], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR (Romanian Interbank Offer Rate) plus 5% from 1 March 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.2 For losses as described in paragraph 2.1(d) above [i.e., lost opportunity to stockpile sugar], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 July 2010 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.3 For penalties as described in paragraph 2.2A above [i.e., tax penalties already paid by the Claimants], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 July 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.4 For losses as described in paragraph 2.3 above [i.e., lost profits on sales of finished goods], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 May 2008 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.5 For losses as described in paragraph 2.4 above [i.e., lost sales of SCPs to third parties], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 March 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.6 For losses as described in paragraph 2.5 above [i.e., lost profits incurred due to the Claimants' inability to complete the Incremental Investments], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 30 September 2009 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.7 For losses as described in paragraph 2.6 above [i.e., the Claimants' alternative claim for lost sales on finished goods as calculated by BCG], interest compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 15 August 2007 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.8 For the amounts lost by the Claimants as a result of investing in reliance on the Incentives as described in paragraph 2.7 above [i.e., the Claimants' alternative claim for reliance losses], interest to be applied compounded on a quarterly basis at a rate of 3 month ROBOR plus 5% from 1 January 2002 until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award.\n\n3.9 The ROBOR rate to be applied in relation to paragraphs 3.1 to 3.8 above is to be the average annual rate for each year or part thereof.\n\n1251.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the Claimants' specified interest claim, but in its Procedural Order of 6 April 2011, the Tribunal found that there had been \"no detrimental reformulation of the Claimants' claim for interest\" (P.O. of 6 April 2011, \u00b6 3.2). The Tribunal does not see any good cause to change its view and, accordingly, will address the Claimants' request for interest as it was formulated in their Revised Request for Relief, to the extent that it refers to the heads of claim for which the Tribunal has decided to award damages.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n1252.\n\nThe Claimants request pre- and post-award interest at 3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis (Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6 3; R-PHB, \u00b6 261). The Claimants submit that this interest should be calculated from different starting dates depending on the head of claim, and run until the date of Romania's full and final satisfaction of the award (Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6 3).\n\n1253.\n\nWith respect to their request that interest be compounded, the Claimants argue that compound interest is the generally accepted standard in international investment arbitrations. In this respect, the Claimants note that since 2000, 16 out of 17 BIT tribunals ruling on BIT cases have awarded compound interest271 (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 657658).\n\nThe Claimants cite, inter alia, *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica*, \u00b6 104; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award, 8 December 2000 (hereinafter *\"Wena Hotels v. Egypt\"* or *\"Wena\"*), *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, \u00b6 9.2.6; *LG&E v. Argentina*, Award, 25 July 2007, \u00b6 103; *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6), Award, 12 April 2002, \u00b6 174; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16), Award, 2 October 2006, \u00b6 522; *Azurix v. Argentina*, \u00b6 440, *PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6 354; *Enron v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 451-52; *CMS v. Argentina*, \u00b6 471; *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt (* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15), Award, 1 June 2009, \u00b6 598.\n\n1254.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there are three reasons for awarding compound interest. First, the payment of compound interest \"furthers the principle of full compensation because it aids in restoring the claimant to the position where it would have been had the respondent not committed the breach\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 662). They add that \"[t]he role of interest is to compensate a claimant fully for the delay between the date of harm suffered and the award of damages. [...] [I]nterest awarded on a compound basis more accurately reflects what the claimant would have been able to earn on the sums owed if they had been paid in a timely manner\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 663). Second, the Claimants argue that an award of compound interest \"prevents unjust enrichment of the respondent by requiring it to pay compensation for the benefits received from using the money it wrongfully withheld\" (*Id*.) Third, the Claimants argue that awarding simple interest generally fails to compensate claimants fully, because the claimant is in essence making interest-free loans to the respondent. This in turn creates an incentive for respondents to delay the proceedings because they are able to profit from the use of the claimant's money during the pendency of the arbitration (or enforcement proceedings) (C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 663-664).272\n\nThe Claimants cite Jeffrey Col\u00f3n and Michael Knoll, Prejudgment Interest In International Arbitration, Vol. 4, Issue 6, TRANSNATIONAL DISPUTE MANAGEMENT 10 (Nov. 2007), and John Y. Gotanda, A Study of Interest, Villanova University School of Law Working Paper Series, Paper 83, at 4 (2007).\n\n1255.\n\nWith respect to the requested rate (ROBOR + 5%), the Claimants argue that this is the approximate rate at which they borrowed money during the relevant period. The Claimants acknowledge that the 5% above ROBOR is higher than that at which interest has been awarded in several other ICSID cases (which has tended to be 2% above LIBOR). However, the Claimants argue that in those cases the claimants were large, multinational companies, with greater access to funding, at lower rates, than the Claimants, who are not international companies and cannot borrow at only 2 points above the interbank offer rate. Thus, the Claimants argue that a higher rate is required in order to reflect the Claimants' higher actual borrowing costs and ensure that they are adequately compensated for the Respondent's breaches (C-PHB, \u00b6 262).\n\n1256.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Respondent's objections to an interest rate based on ROBOR are unsustainable. They argue that \"ROBOR is the rate at which banks lend to each other, that is set by the market and which accurately reflects Romania's underlying economic conditions. Therefore at times of high inflation, which occurred in Romania in the period relevant to this dispute, it is logical that ROBOR rose accordingly, including to 30% at one point. However, due to the manner in which ROBOR is calculated and applied, it cannot sensibly be contended that it is not an appropriate rate for the calculation of interest when a claimant borrows from Romanian banks and/or borrows in RON\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 263). The Claimants add that \"in the period 2005 to date (which is the period relevant to the Claimants' expectation damages claim), the average (mean) 3 month ROBOR rate was only approximately 8.9%, which is considerably below the 30% rate which the Respondent would have the Tribunal believe was the norm. In fact, for extended periods since 2005 the 3 month ROBOR rate has been below 5%. Tellingly, as at 10 January 2011 (the date of Freshfields' letter objecting to the Detailed Request), the 3 month ROBOR rate was only 5.16%\" (C-PHB, \u00b6 264). Finally, the Claimants note that Romania has charged the Claimants a penalty interest on unpaid taxes \"at a consistent annual rate of 36.5% (with an effective rate in excess of 40%)\", arguing that \"[i]f anything, the Claimants' use of ROBOR rates as the basis for their calculations is conservative when juxtaposed to the punitive, draconian interest rates imposed on the Claimants by the Respondent\" (*Id*.).\n\n1257.\n\nWith respect to the date from which interest must be calculated on the damages awarded by the Tribunal, the Claimants argue that \"each date is the approximate midpoint between the time the relevant loss or damage began to be incurred and the time when that loss or damage would have ceased to have been suffered\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 265). Specifically:\n\na. With respect to the claims for increased cost of sugar, PET and other raw materials, the Claimants claim interest calculated from 1 March 2007. This date is \"approximately the midpoint between the time at which the Incentives were prematurely revoked (22 February 2005) and the time when the Incentives were due to come to an end (31 March 2009)\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 265(a)).\n\nb. With respect to the claim for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in 2009, the Claimants request an award of interest calculated from 1 July 2010. According to the Claimants, this is \"the approximate midpoint between the time when the sugar stockpile would have started being used (31 March 2009) and the time, based on Mr Osborne's calculations, when it would have all been used (31 August 2011)\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 265(b)).\n\nc. With respect to their claim for lost profits on sales of finished goods, the Claimants claim interest from 1 May 2008, which is the approximate midpoint of the period for which Mr Boulton has calculated losses (1 January 2005 to 31 August 2011)\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 265(d)).\n\n1258.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"[t]he midpoint provides a sensible and practical date from which the Tribunal may make its calculations\" (C-Reply, \u00b6 266). It notes that this approach has been adopted by other tribunals, such as the tribunals in *PSEG v. Turkey* (where the tribunal chose the mean date of the seven year period during which the relevant expenses were incurred273), and *Nykomb v. Latvia* (where the tribunal awarded interest \"from the mid point of the respective periods up to the time of the award\"274).\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey*, \u00b6\u00b6 349-351.\n\n*Nykomb v. Latvia*, p. 43.\n\n**C. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n1259.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' interest claim should be rejected with respect to the interest rate, compounding and date of calculation (R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 325328).\n\n1260.\n\nWith respect to the interest rate, the Respondent contends that the rate requested by the Claimants (ROBOR + 5%) is far higher than that awarded by other investment arbitration tribunals, and could end up yielding a rate as high as 30%. The Respondent argues that this rate is at odds with the rates used by their own experts, noting that Mr. Osborne used EFDG's RON cost of debt for pre-award interest (about 11% according to Mr. Osborne, First Osborne Report, \u00b6 4.10), whereas Professor Lessard applied ROBOR without any premium (First ER of D. Lessard, \u00b6 111). The Respondent further argues that \"the proposed rate is based on speculation as to what the Claimants' borrowing costs could be, rather than on their actual borrowing costs\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 326). According to the Respondent, the record on the EFDG's borrowing costs \"reveals a rate of 5.88% for foreign currency and 10.75% for borrowings in RON\" (EFDG combined financial statements for the year 2006, 31 December 2006, Exh. JMHE-8, p 27), which is consistent with Mr. Gamecho's testimony that the Claimants had access to financing at rates of less than 5.5% (Tr., Day 4, 54 (Gamecho)). The Respondent further contends that there is no justification for the 5% premium.\n\n1261.\n\nThe Respondent also objects to a rate based on ROBOR. It argues that the fact the Claimants' claims are made in RON does not mean that the Tribunal must use a RON-based interest rate for pre-award interest. The Respondent argues that the Claimants had substantial loans in Euros and purchased many of their imports in Euros. The Respondent contends that \"the Claimants are subject to the inherent currency risks of their business\", and thus \"[i]t is not for Romania to subsidise that risk through payment of a higher interest rate. Therefore, only a pre-award interest rate that takes into account the fact that the Claimants can borrow in Euro would be appropriate\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 327).\n\n1262.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that any award of interest should be on a simple rather than compound basis. The Respondent relies on the Commentary to ILC Article 38, which states that \"[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest, and this is true even of those tribunals which hold claimants to be normally entitled to compensatory interest. [...] [G]iven the present state of international law it cannot be said that an injured [party] has any entitlement to compound interest, in the absence of special circumstances which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full reparation.\"275 The Respondent also relies on *ADM v. Mexico*,276*Feldman v. Mexico*,277*Biloune v. Ghana*,278 and *Occidental v. Ecuador*279 (R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 351, fn. 560).\n\nCommentary to ILC Article 38, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\n*Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05), Award, 21 November 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 294-297.\n\n*Feldman v. Mexico*, \u00b6\u00b6 205, 206 and 211.\n\n*Biloune v. Ghana*, pp 230 and 231.\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador*, \u00b6 211.\n\n1263.\n\nIn view of the above, the Respondent submits that \"the interest rate the Tribunal should apply for pre-award interest (the purpose of which is compensatory) is 3-month EURIBOR without any premium and on a simple basis\" (R-PHB, \u00b6 327). The Respondent further submits that \"any post-award interest should be set a 3-month ROBOR, without any premium, and on a simple basis.\" The Respondent does not make entirely clear the reasons for the difference in approach between pre- and postaward interest, nor does it explain further or in more detail why it should be awarded on a simple basis.\n\n1264.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimants have manipulated the starting dates for the calculation of interest in order to maximize their claim. It argues that \"[t]he selection of a mid-point date inflates the claim in this case in circumstances where the largest of the Claimants' alleged losses occurred after this arbitrary point in time. For example, selecting a mid-point start date in respect of sugar purchases ignores the fact that most sugar purchases were actually made in later years\" (RPHB, \u00b6 328). The Respondent adds that \"it would not have been difficult for the Claimants to present interest calculations starting from the dates when losses were allegedly suffered\", as Prof. Lessard did in his calculations (*Id*.).\n\n**D. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n1265.\n\nHaving found a breach of the BIT, the Tribunal must ensure that the Claimants are restored to the position they would have been had the breach not occurred. This includes awarding interest on the sums that the Claimants would have had if the breach had not occurred in order to compensate for the cost of money until the full payment of the Award. The Respondent does not dispute the principle that interest must be awarded; rather, it objects to the rate, compounding and date of calculation proposed by the Claimants.\n\n**1. Simple versus compound interest**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1266.\n\nThe overwhelming trend among investment tribunals is to award compound rather than simple interest. The reason is that an award of damages (including interest) must place the claimant in the position it would have been had it never been injured. As noted by the *Wena* tribunal, \"\u2018almost all financing and investment vehicles involve compound interest. [\u2026] If the claimant could have received compound interest merely by placing its money in a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle, it is neither logical nor equitable to award the claimant only simple interest.'\"280 The Commentary to ILC Article 38, on which the Respondent relies to object to compound interest, does not reflect the recent tribunal practice, with which the Tribunal agrees.\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* \u00b6 129 (citing John Y. Gotanda, Awarding Interest in International Arbitration, 90 Amer. J. Int'l L., 40, 61 (1996).\n\n1267.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus award compound interest, at the rate determined below.\n\n**2. Rate**\n-----------\n\n1268.\n\nThe Claimants request the same treatment for both pre- and post-award interest (3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis), starting from different dates depending on the claim. The Respondent requests that (i) pre-award interest be granted at a rate of 3-month EURIBOR without any premium and on a simple basis, while (ii) post-award interest should be set at 3-month ROBOR, without any premium, also on a simple basis.\n\n1269.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal does not see why the cost of the deprivation of money (which interest compensates) should be different before and after the Award, and neither Party has convinced it otherwise. Both are awarded to compensate a party for the deprivation of the use of its funds. The Tribunal will thus award pre- and post-award interest at the same rate.\n\n1270.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the appropriate rate is that which would compensate them for their cost of borrowing money during the relevant period. In the Tribunal's view, the Corporate Claimants' cost of debt should be assessed on the basis of operations in RON: the Claimants are Romanian nationals with their principal place of business in Romania, and the fact that they could borrow in Euro does not detract that the currency in the place where they operate was and remains RON.\n\n1271.\n\nThe Respondent objects to using a ROBOR-based rate, arguing that at times it has risen as high as 30% (R-PHB, \u00b6 325). It has not provided any sufficient evidence for this allegation, but the Claimants appear to accept that this in fact occurred at one point in time (C-PHB, \u00b6 263). In turn, the Claimants argue that in the period 2005 to the date of their Post-Hearing Brief, the average (mean) 3-month ROBOR rate was approximately 8.9%. This allegation is similarly insufficiently supported. This lack of evidence on the actual ROBOR rates is, however, irrelevant: as the Claimants note, the ROBOR rate is the rate at which Romanian banks lend to each other, and commercial borrowing rates will usually thus be ROBOR plus a premium. It is thus highly likely that any borrowing by the Claimants in Romania between 2005 and the date of payment of the award would have been and will be subject to a ROBORbased interest rate plus a premium. In any event, the rates reflected in the record (10.75% for RON-based operations for 2006, 13.8% for those operations in 2005, according to the Corporate Claimants' 2006 financials (Exh. JMHE-8, p. 27) and 11% according to Mr. Osborne (First ER of C. Osborne, \u00b6 4.10)), are closer to the Claimants' allegation that the mean 3-month ROBOR rate during the relevant period was 8.9%, than to the 30% rate alleged by the Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that a 3-month ROBOR plus a reasonable premium, compounded on a quarterly basis, is reasonable, 3-month ROBOR being computed at an average annual rate to be applied for each period of one year or part of a year.\n\n1272.\n\nThe question that remains is what premium is reasonable. The Claimants request 5% above the ROBOR rate. They argue that, because they are not international companies, they cannot borrow at only 2 points above the interbank offer rate (which is the premium that has been awarded by other investment tribunals). The Tribunal finds this argument persuasive: the Claimants probably would not have obtained better conditions. The Tribunal will thus award interest at 3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis.\n\n**3. Date of calculation**\n--------------------------\n\n1273.\n\nInterest must be calculated from the date on which the loss was suffered. This is usually the day on which the breach occurs. This cannot be the case or, at least, is not easily practicable when the damage is suffered progressively after the date of the breach, as has happened here. After the revocation of the incentives became effective on 22 February 2005, the Claimants incurred their damages progressively: they progressively purchased raw materials at a higher price, thus progressively incurring higher costs, and they progressively lost profits that they could have earned on the sales of their own finished goods. With respect to the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in 2009, because they were unable to stockpile sugar at that time, they progressively bought sugar at a higher price.\n\n1274.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the midpoint approach proposed by the Claimants is appropriate. Despite the Respondent's arguments, it would have been difficult and next to impossible for the Claimants to point out to the exact date on which this damage was suffered, while at the same time, damage has definitely been proved to exist during that period. Indeed, a part of the damage may have been suffered every day since the revocation. The Tribunal also notes that this midpoint approach has been used by other investment tribunals.281 And it does not seem that there exist circumstances in this arbitration that should detract as a matter of principle from this approach: for instance, the record does not point to a use of the stockpile that should not have been evenly spread over the months concerned (in which case the \"midpoint approach\" could lead to distortions).\n\n*See, e.g., PSEG v Turkey*, \u00b6\u00b6 349-351; *Nykomb v. Latvia*, p. 43.\n\n1275.\n\nFinally, with respect to lost profits, the Tribunal is aware that, according to the Commentary to ILC Article 38, \"[w]here a sum for loss of profits is included as part of the compensation for the injury caused by a wrongful act, an award of interest will be inappropriate if the injured State would thereby obtain double recovery\", because \"[a] capital sum cannot be earning interest and notionally employed in earning profits at one and the same time\" (Commentary to ILC Article 38, \u00b6 11). However, the Commentary goes on to say that \"interest may be due on the profits which would have been earned but which have been withheld from the original owner.\" The Tribunal understands that, by awarding interest on lost profits on sales of finished goods as of the midpoint in which the total quantified would have been earned, interest is only applied to amounts that would have been earned but were withheld from the Claimants.\n\n1276.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal awards interest, at 3-month ROBOR, the ROBOR being computed at an average annual rate to be applied for each period of one year or part of a year, plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis, calculated from the following dates until full payment of the award:\n\na. With respect to the claims for increased cost of sugar and other raw materials, interest shall be calculated from 1 March 2007, which is the approximate midpoint between the time at which the EGO 24 incentives were revoked (22 February 2005) and the time when the incentives were due to expire (31 March 2009).\n\nb. With respect to the claim for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in 2009, interest shall be calculated from 1 November 2009, which is the approximate midpoint between the time when the sugar stockpile would have started being used (31 March 2009) and the time, when it would have all been used (1 July 2010). The Tribunal is aware that, according to Mr. Osborne's calculations, the Claimants' optimal stockpile of 75,000 tonnes would have been used by 31 August 2011 (First ER of C. Osborne, fl4.10). However, the Tribunal has awarded this claim on the basis of Mr. Ellison's calculations, which account for a smaller stockpile of 30,000 tonnes. The Tribunal has thus adjusted Mr. Osborne's timing forecast to this smaller amount.\n\nc. With respect to the claim for lost profits on sales of finished goods, the interest shall be calculated from 1 May 2008, which is the approximate midpoint of the period for which Mr Boulton calculated losses (1 January 2005 to 31 August 2011) (C-Reply, \u00b6 265(d)).\n\n**IX. THE PARTIES' OTHER REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1277.\n\nIn the context of the Respondent's Application to Revoke Provisional Measures, both sides requested other specific relief that was deferred for determination to the final Award *(see* paragraph 111 above). These requests for relief concern (A) set-off of the amounts awarded to the Claimants against the EFDG's tax debts with Romania, and (B) post-award injunctive relief, as explained below.282\n\nAll briefs cited in this section relate to the Respondent's Application to Revoke Provisional Measures.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS CONCERNING SET-OFF OF THE AMOUNTS AWARDEDAGAINST THE EFDG'S TAX DEBTS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n1278.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, because of the EFDG's opaque intra-group finances and the prejudice to Romania's tax enforcement rights resulting from the Claimants' manipulation of provisional measures, if there were to be any monetary award in favor of any Claimant, the amount should be explicitly subject to set-off against all of the EFDG companies' tax debts (Respondent's Revocation Application, \u00b6 8(b)).\n\n1279.\n\nIn support of this request, the Respondent argues that, in its Supplemental Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal made a \"straightforward recommendation\" that the Individual Claimants should allow any award to them to be set off against the Corporate Claimants' tax debts \u2014 a recommendation that has been ignored by the Claimants (Respondent's Revocation Application, \u00b6 60(c)).\n\n1280.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to \"explicitly provide in the Award that any amount awarded to any of the Claimants, whether as damages, arbitration costs, or otherwise, is subject to set-off by Romania against the tax debts of all eleven EFDG companies, including lawful interest and penalties\" (Respondent's Revocation Application, \u00b6 87(c)).\n\n1281.\n\nThe Respondent maintained this request in its Reply on its Revocation Application (\u00b6\u00b6 2 and 41(c)), but did not provide further arguments or respond to the Claimants' comments set out below.\n\n**2. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n1282.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant the Respondent's set-off request, for three main reasons (Claimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 113- 116):\n\na. First, because it is procedurally improper: The Claimants contend that the Respondent has not established, or even argued beyond a cursory request, that it is entitled to a set-off. Such a new claim would have to be briefed and it is far too late in the arbitral process for that. In any event, the Claimants assert that such a set-off would be unnecessary because the Respondent has retained all of its rights to collect outstanding taxes from the EFDG (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 114).\n\nb. Second, because the parties against whom the set-off would be ordered (that is, the Claimants) are not identical to the parties who owe the debts: The Claimants argue that the Tribunal would thus lack the necessary jurisdiction. Relying on Article 8.1 of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, the Claimants add that \"[e]ligibility for set-off requires that the obligations be between the same parties\", which is an argument going to the merits (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 115 and fn. 113).\n\nc. Third, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *rationae materiae* because the Respondent's set-off request is not \"a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as it was not especially contracted for in an investment agreement and does not arise directly out of an investment (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 116).\n\n1283.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that, apart from any legal defense to the Respondent's set-off request, it would be fundamentally unfair to provide for a set-off, or for the Award (or at least a significant portion thereof, reflecting at least the value of the retained earnings at the time the incentives were withdrawn) to be made out to anyone but the Individual Claimants \"on a 50/50 basis\" (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 117). The Claimants contend that they are entitled to full compensation for their significant losses over the years due to the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives, and that allowing set-off would be unfair in the light of these losses (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 67-72).\n\n1284.\n\nThe Claimants add that a set-off would imply that the Individual Claimants should take personal responsibility for the EFDG companies' tax debts. In their view, this would not only be unfair to the Individual Claimants, but would also imply that the Individual Claimants, by paying further amounts to the ongoing business operations in Romania or paying debts relating to those investments, would be making additional investments, which are not reflected in the current damages claim and for which compensation would be owed (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 63-66).\n\n1285.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that if the Award is made out to the Individual Claimants alone, unless the Award is of a certain size, some creditors may not be paid in full, including the Respondent. In that case, they note that the EFDG companies may no longer be viable as going concerns. They argue that these are factors to consider in determining how the Award should be drafted, but they should not be at the forefront of the Tribunal's considerations, as the ICSID Convention was put in place to protect investors, not creditors (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 118). The Claimants further note that the Respondent did not respond substantively to their arguments, but merely referenced the Tribunal's recommendation. The Claimants argue that the Tribunal recommended that the Parties were free to agree to a set-off, and the Parties did not agree.\n\n1286.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Claimants request the Tribunal to \"issue a declaration that Romania is not entitled to set-off tax debts of the companies against an Award in favor of Claimants\" (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 127(c)).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1287.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered both sides' prayers for relief with respect to setoff, and dismisses them both.\n\n1288.\n\nFirst, both prayers have been made too late in the arbitral proceedings. To the extent that both requests are for declaratory relief to be given in the Award, the requests must be seen as ancillary claims covered by Article 46 of the ICSID Convention283 and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In particular, the Respondent has not raised the issue of set-off as a defense to the Claimants' claims: it has not requested an acknowledgment of set-off, nor for set-off to be ordered; it is seeking a declaration that any amounts awarded to any of the Claimants are subject to set-off by Romania against the tax debts of the EFDG companies. The Claimants request a declaration in the opposite sense. In this context, the Parties do not argue whether the legal conditions for set-off are satisfied, but discuss rather whether set-off should be allowed or not as a \"modus\" (qualification) added to any amount awarded. Such requests for declaratory relief must be treated as ancillary claims subject to the time limits set out in Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention provides: \"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n1289.\n\nPursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its observations thereon.\n\n1290.\n\nBoth Parties' requests regarding set-off have been made considerably past the time limits set out in Rule 40. The Respondent's request was made in its Application to Revoke Provisional Measures submitted on 1 August 2012, more than three years after the submission of its Counter-Memorial. Similarly, the Claimants' request was made in their Response to the Respondent's Application to Revoke Provisional Measures, submitted on 28 September 2012, almost two years after the submission of their Reply. The record does not evidence any good causes for such delay.\n\n1291.\n\nIf the Tribunal had not dismissed these requests on procedural grounds, it would have done so on the merits. Indeed, whether the Respondent has a right to set off the Award against the EFDG's tax debts would be (primarily at least) a matter of Romanian law and of enforcement of this Award. Romanian law establishes the conditions under which a set-off may be carried out and nothing the Tribunal says will affect that. In certain jurisdictions, set-off may even operate as a matter of law (*ipso iure)* when strict conditions are met *.* Thus, as a matter of principle, the Tribunal is not in a position to declare that Romania has a right to set-off the amounts awarded in this arbitration against the EFDG's tax debts. Whether Romania has a right to set-off the amounts awarded against the Claimants or other companies of the EFDG will depend on whether the conditions set out in Romanian law are fulfilled.\n\n1292.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to state that, in principle, Romania has a right to set-off, it would not be able to decide whether in this particular case such set-off is warranted. The Respondent has not explained why the (Romanian law) conditions for set-off are fulfilled in this case, what are the amounts to be set off, or which are the specific parties involved. The only apposite mention of legal principles applicable to set-off seems to be the Claimants' reference to the UNIDROIT Principles (see paragraph 1282 above) rather than applicable Romanian law. In addition, for the reasons set out in Section VII.F above, the Tribunal has declined to allocate the damages among the Claimants, and is instead awarding the totality of the damages to all five Claimants. Under the circumstances of the case itself, the Tribunal is simply not in a position to declare whether Romania is or is not entitled to set off an award in favor of the Claimants against the EFDG companies' tax debts.\n\n1293.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's request that the Award explicitly provide that any amount awarded to any of the Claimants is subject to setoff by Romania against the tax debts of the EFDG companies, without prejudice to the application of Romanian law, especially but not exclusively its dispositions for the satisfaction of tax debts.\n\n1294.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants' request for a declaration that Romania is not entitled to set off tax debts of the EFDG companies against the Award, again without prejudice to the application of Romanian law, including for the satisfaction of tax debts.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' REQUEST FOR POST-AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n1295.\n\nAgain in the context of the Respondent's Application to Revoke Provisional Measures, the Claimants request the Tribunal to provide in the Award that the Respondent \"is enjoined from any further tax collection measures of any kind in respect of the Claimants and the EFDC until such a time as the damages awarded by the Tribunal have been paid in full, and include a pecuniary alternative in case of nonperformance\" (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 75(b); *see also* Claimants' Response, \u00b6 127(b)).\n\n1296.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is obvious that Romania intends to collect on the taxes owed to it as soon as it can, by whatever means it can (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 108). The Claimants understand that the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal will come to an end upon issuance of the Award. They thus argue that for any award in their favor to have any meaning, equivalent relief to that granted under the provisional measures must be put in place in the Award until the Claimants are compensated in full (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 119; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 58).\n\n1297.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to order permanent injunctive relief. They rely on *Enron v. Argentina,*284 where the tribunal allegedly asserted that it had such power (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 122). The Claimants also rely on writings by Prof. Schreuer, as well as the Decision on Jurisdiction rendered by this very Tribunal (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55).\n\n*Enron v. Argentina (Decision on Jurisdiction)*, \u00b6\u00b6 77-79.\n\n1298.\n\nThe Claimants note that already in their First Application for Provisional Measures, they requested\n\nan Order preserving the status quo ante by instructing Respondent to withdraw or otherwise cease and desist from enforcing the abovedescribed seizure orders, or from implementing any new such orders against any of the EFDC prior to the Tribunal's issuance of its final award (***and that the award itself deal with the matter as appropriate at that*** ***time, such as by maintaining the Order in place until Romania has satisfied the terms of the award in full***) [\u2026] (Claimants' First Application for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 43, emphasis added).\n\n1299.\n\nThe Claimants recognize however that this relief has not been expressly requested, but submit that the Tribunal is empowered to make such an order under paragraph 6 of Claimants' Revised Request for Relief,285 which seeks \"[a]ny further relief that the Tribunal may deem fit and proper\" (Claimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 120-121; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 59).\n\nThe Claimants refer to their \"Detailed Request for Relief\", which the Tribunal refers to throughout this document as their \"Revised Request for Relief\".\n\n1300.\n\nIn the alternative, if the Tribunal concludes that it cannot order relief on the basis of the Revised Request for Relief as drafted, the Claimants request that the Tribunal permit the Claimants to add a specific request for injunctive relief to their Request for Relief pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Rules (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 123). The Claimants argue that the Respondent has already had notice of the Claimants' intentions and will suffer no prejudice as a result of the requested amendment to the Request for Relief. Specifically, the Claimants assert that the cover letter enclosing their Revised Request for Relief put Romania on notice that Claimants might seek to amend the requested relief \"[i]n the event that financial or operational circumstances materially change to Claimants' detriment prior to the Tribunal's issuance of its award\" (Claimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125).\n\n1301.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to conclude that Romania will suffer prejudice as a result of the requested amendment of the Request for Relief, the Claimants contend that such prejudice should be balanced against the greater harm that the Claimants would suffer if the request is not granted. According to the Claimants, \"it would be a fundamental denial of justice to Claimants and an absurd result if Romania could bankrupt the companies on the day after the Award was issued, prior to making payment, the timing of which is solely within its control\" (Claimants' Response, \u00b6 125).\n\n**2. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n1302.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' request must fail for the following reasons.\n\n1303.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that Provisional Measures are temporary in nature and cannot be upheld beyond the point where the proceedings come to an end. Relying on writings by Prof. Schreuer, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal's authority to grant interim relief pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules only extends throughout the arbitration and any provisional measure lapses automatically when a final award is rendered. According to the Respondent, this cannot be circumvented by including the provisional measures in the Award (Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 36).\n\n1304.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that it is irrelevant whether the Tribunal has the power to grant injunctive relief, because the legitimacy of the collection of taxes has never been subject matter of the proceedings leading to the Award. By contrast, in *Enron v. Argentina* the request for permanent injunctive relief was linked to taxes that were the basis for Enron's expropriation claim (Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 37).\n\n1305.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' new attempt to amend their Request for Relief is in fact a new claim submitted out of time. The Respondent notes that, pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, any incidental or additional claim must be presented no later than in the reply. The Respondent adds that such a new claim would require further written and oral proceedings, and the Claimants have failed to provide a justification for it (Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 38).\n\n1306.\n\nFourth, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' request to amend their Request for Relief involves relief in favor of eight EFDG companies that are not parties to the present arbitration, but Article 46 of the ICSID Convention does not permit extension of the dispute *ratione personae*. The fact that the Claimants purported to reserve their right to amend their Request for Relief is thus irrelevant, as the issues at stake in the provisional measures are not part of the dispute which forms the subject matter of the arbitration proceedings (Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 39).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1307.\n\nThere is no dispute that the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal in its five decisions on Provisional Measures will lapse upon the issuance of the Award. The Tribunal concurs with Prof. Schreuer when he states that\n\nThe provisional nature of interim measures implies that they are recommended only for the duration of the proceedings. [...] Provisional measures will lapse automatically upon the rendering of the tribunal's award. They will also lapse upon the discontinuance of the proceedings in accordance with Arbitration Rules 43-45. Although neither Art. 47 nor Arbitration Rule 39 say so explicitly, this is a consequence of their provisional nature.286\n\nC. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd edition (2009), pp. 774-775.\n\n1308.\n\nHowever, the Claimants are neither requesting the extension of these provisional measures beyond the Award, nor the recommendation of new provisional measures. The Claimants frame their request as one for \"permanent injunctive relief\". Thus, the threshold question is whether the Tribunal has the authority to issue permanent (or rather, definitive) injunctive relief in the Award, even if it is only temporary.\n\n1309.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility the Tribunal recognized its power to grant non-pecuniary relief (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 166).287 An ICSID tribunal's powers derive from the nature and purpose of its mandate, which in turn is defined by the parties' consent. In this case, such consent is reflected in the ICSID Convention, the BIT and the Claimants' request for arbitration. From these instruments it emerges that the Tribunal's task is to resolve the legal disputes between the Claimants and the Respondent arising directly out of the Claimants' investments in the territory of the Respondent which have their origin in the Respondent's breaches of the BIT. As none of the aforementioned instruments *expressis verbis* defines the powers granted to a tribunal nor limits the remedies available to the Claimants in the event of an internationally wrongful act,288 this Tribunal must conclude that its powers include all of those required to provide effective remedy in order to redress the injuries suffered by the Claimants as a result of such internationally wrongful acts, within the limits of the parties' requests for relief and provided that such relief is admissible under international law. In the Tribunal's view, such relief includes pecuniary and non-pecuniary relief.\n\nAt paragraph 166 of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Tribunal stated: \"Under the ICSID Convention, a tribunal has the power to order pecuniary or non-pecuniary remedies, including restitution, i.e., re-establishing the situation which existed before a wrongful act was committed. As Respondent itself admits, restitution is, in theory, a remedy that is available under the ICSID Convention (Tr. p. 56). That admission essentially disposes of the objection as an objection to jurisdiction and admissibility. The fact that restitution is a rarely ordered remedy is not relevant at this stage of the proceedings. Similarly, and contrary to Respondent's argument, the fact that such a remedy might not be enforceable pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention should not preclude a tribunal from ordering it. Remedies and enforcement are two distinct concepts.\"\n\nThe only remedy specified by the BIT is compensation in cases of expropriation (Article 4 of the BIT). However, the BIT does not specify what remedies are available in cases of breaches of other standards of protection.\n\n1310.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that, although Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that a state shall recognize an award as binding, it then proceeds to limit a state's obligation to enforce an award to the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award.289 However, this should not be interpreted as limiting ICSID tribunals to awarding pecuniary relief. As the Tribunal already stated, awarding remedies and enforcement are two distinct concepts.290 Moreover, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention confirm that \"the restriction in Article 54 to pecuniary obligations was based on doubts concerning the feasibility of an enforcement of non-pecuniary obligations and not on a desire to prohibit tribunals from imposing such obligations.\"291 Indeed, the fact that Article 54 found it necessary to specify that only pecuniary obligations could be enforced confirms that a tribunal has the power to order non-pecuniary relief.292\n\nArticle 54(1) of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part: \"Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. [\u2026].\"\n\n*See* Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 166.\n\nC. Schreuer, Non-Pecuniary Remedies in ICSID Arbitration, Arbitration International, Vol. 20, No. 4 (2004), pp. 325-326.\n\nIndeed, Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, which deals with the binding nature of the award rather than enforcement, provides that \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties\" and that \"[e]ach party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\", without limiting such binding nature to the non-pecuniary obligations imposed by the award.\n\n1311.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, such non-pecuniary relief may take many forms, such as restitution or specific performance.293 It may also take the form of definitive (i.e., not provisional) injunctive relief, if the Tribunal finds that such relief is necessary to ensure that the breach will be redressed. To quote Prof. Schreuer:\n\nThere is a wide range of possibilities for non-pecuniary obligations that awards might impose. [...] Possible obligations imposed upon the host State would include the restitution of seized property [...] or desistance from imposing unreasonable taxes. In the cases so far published, ICSID tribunals have framed the obligations imposed by their awards in pecuniary terms. This is not due to a belief that they lack the power to proceed otherwise. Rather, the cases involved situations in which the investment relationship had broken down and the claimants had defined their demands in pecuniary terms. [\u2026] It is likely that in the future more cases will arise, involving disputes stemming from ongoing relationships, in which awards providing for specific performance or injunctions will become relevant.294\n\nIn the state-to-state sphere, the ILC Articles expressly recognize a tribunal's power to grant nonpecuniary relief. Article 31 of the ILC Articles provides that \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" In turn, Article 34 provides that \"[f]ull reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\"\n\nC. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd ed. (2009), pp. 1137-1138. Prof. Schreuer adds that \"[t]ribunals imposing such non pecuniary obligations should keep the impossibility to enforce them in mind. Such awards should [...] provide for a pecuniary alternative in case of nonperformance such as liquidated damages, penalties or another obligation to pay a certain amount of money.\" (*Id*.)\n\n1312.\n\nFinally, the power to award injunctive relief has been affirmed by ICSID tribunals. For instance, in *Enron v. Argentina* the tribunal expressly concluded that \"in addition to declaratory powers, it has the power to order measures involving performance or injunction of certain acts.\"295\n\n*Enron v. Argentina (Decision on Jurisdiction)*, \u00b6 81.\n\n1313.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it has the power to grant injunctive relief in a final award. This relief, however, must be definitive (i.e., not provisional, not meant to \"preserve the respective rights of either party\" until final resolution of the dispute, which is the objective of provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention). The Tribunal prefers the term \"definitive\" to \"permanent\", as the relief granted may be temporary (i.e., granted only until a certain date or until a certain condition is met). However, as the Tribunal will become *functus officio* upon the rendering of the Award (subject to a party filing a claim for rectification, supplementary decision, interpretation or revision of the Award pursuant to Articles 49, 50 or 51 of the ICSID Convention), the injunctive relief granted cannot be later reconsidered or lifted by the Tribunal, as would be the case with provisional relief: such definitive injunctive relief would have *res judicata* effect.\n\n1314.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the Claimants' specific request for post-award injunctive relief.\n\n1315.\n\nThe first question that arises is whether this request for relief is timely. As a request for definitive relief in the Award, the request must be treated as an ancillary claim, and thus the conditions set out in Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (cited at paragraph 1289 above) apply.\n\n1316.\n\nThe Claimants formally articulated their request for post-award injunctive relief in their Response to the Respondent's Application to Revoke Provisional Measures, submitted on 28 September 2012, which is considerably past the submission of their Reply (submitted in December 2009). Although the Claimants had included a similar request in their First Application for Provisional Measures, submitted on 3 November 2010 on the eve of the hearing on the merits (see paragraph 1298 above), that request was also submitted after their Reply. In any event, as the Claimants themselves acknowledge, this request was made in the context of a request for provisional measures and was not formulated as a substantive request for relief in the award.\n\n1317.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their request is timely because the Tribunal is empowered to award post-award injunctive relief as a result of their request for \"[a]ny further relief that the Tribunal may deem fit and proper\" (Revised Request for Relief, \u00b6 6). A first question is whether, as a result of such a generic request, the Tribunal has the power to order relief that has not been expressly requested. Assuming that the Tribunal has the power and the discretion to make such an order (a matter that the Tribunal does not need to address), in the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal would not wish to exercise any such discretion to order definitive injunctive relief such as the relief sought by the Claimants without having been expressly requested to do so. In particular, the Tribunal would be loath to do so because that would defeat one of the *rationes legis* of Article 40, namely afford the Responding State the possibility fully to put its case in defense to a given relief before the evidentiary hearing and take advantage of that hearing to bring forth the correlative necessary evidence. The Respondent was not in a position at the time to predict that Claimants would subsequently come up with the disputed prayers or that the Tribunal would exercise its discretion, if it exists, in the way the Claimants are suggesting now.\n\n1318.\n\nThe Claimants' request for definitive injunctive relief is thus untimely, and it falls to the Tribunal to determine, upon justification by the Claimants and after considering the Respondent's objections, whether it authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceedings. After considering both Parties' arguments, the Tribunal finds that there is not a sufficient justification to authorize the presentation of this claim at this stage of the proceedings. Nor was there sufficient justification to authorize the presentation of this claim in September 2012, when the Claimants first formulated their request for definitive injunctive relief. The Claimants submitted their first application for provisional measures in November 2010. They thus had ample time since the occurrence of the facts that gave rise to their alleged need for injunctive relief to properly file for an ancillary claim for definitive relief in accordance with Rule 40. The Claimants have not justified why such a claim could not have been brought before September 2012. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants' request for definitive injunctive relief.\n\n1319.\n\nHad it not dismissed the claim on procedural grounds, the Tribunal would have done so on the merits. The Tribunal has dismissed the Claimants' argument that the Respondent's wrongful act (the breach of the BIT) caused them to incur the tax debts and penalties that are the basis for the Respondent's tax enforcement actions (*see* Section VII.C.4 above). Thus, while during the pendency of these proceedings the legitimacy of the tax penalties imposed upon the Claimants could be deemed to be part of the subject matter of the dispute, the Claimants' claims in that respect have been dismissed on the merits. Similarly, now that the proceedings are finalized, the Claimants have no independent right to the maintenance of a status quo or to a nonaggravation of the dispute that could require preservation. There is thus no justification for providing the requested additional and definitive injunctive relief in the Award.\n\n1320.\n\nFinally, although the Tribunal has the power to grant additional definitive injunctive relief in the Award, any such relief should be granted with the utmost caution. Once the Award is issued and subject to potential requests for rectification, supplementary decision, interpretation or revision, the Tribunal will become *functus officio*. It will not be able to reconsider the injunctive relief granted, which would have *res judicata* effect.\n\n1321.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that such additional relief is warranted. In its decisions on provisional measures, the Tribunal repeatedly stated that Romania must be allowed to collect the taxes due to it. While these proceedings were pending and for their duration, the Tribunal afforded protection to the Claimants in order, among other reasons, to maintain the status quo and prevent the aggravation of the dispute. The Tribunal recognized the benefits of preventing the Claimants' bankruptcy and allowing the Claimants' business to survive as a going concern. However, the Tribunal cannot do so indefinitely. It trusts that the Parties will find a way to pay their respective debts in a way that allows the Claimants' investment to continue contributing to the prosperity of Bihor County.\n\n1322.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants' request for post-award injunctive relief is dismissed. Accordingly, all provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal will cease to have effect as of the date of dispatch of this Award.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n1323.\n\nBoth sides request an award of costs in respect of the legal fees and expenses and the costs of arbitration incurred in connection with this proceeding and have filed submissions quantifying their fees and costs (Claimants' Request for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; Respondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 49).\n\n1324.\n\nThe Claimants' legal fees and expenses amount to EUR 18,409,213 or RON 86,478,476. They have advanced USD 1,510,000 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses, including the lodging fee of USD 25,000. The Claimants seek an award of the entirety of these costs and compound interest at a rate of 3-month ROBOR plus 5% until the date of payment.\n\n1325.\n\nThe Respondent's legal fees and expenses amount to EUR 11,499,347.97. It has advanced USD 1,485,000 to ICSID.\n\n1326.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including legal fees and expenses, between the Parties as it deems appropriate, pursuant to Article 61 of the ICSID Convention. Both sides argue that a costs award is warranted because they should prevail in the arbitration and because the other party has conducted the arbitration in a manner which has led to delay and increased costs.\n\n1327.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all the circumstances of this case: the procedure (including the jurisdictional phase, the Parties' requests for production of documents, the Claimants' requests for provisional measures, the Respondent's request for revocation of provisional measures, the Claimants' request for a site visit, the merits phase of the proceeding, the Claimants' revised request for relief, and multiple hearings) as well as the Parties' substantive arguments on jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits. As evidenced by Section II above, there were numerous procedural issues and difficult legal questions involved in the jurisdictional and merits phases. Many of these issues were far from clear-cut and involved meritorious arguments by both Parties. The Claimants have prevailed on jurisdiction and have established a breach of the fair and equitable standard under the BIT. They have, however, only been partially successful in regard to their claims for damages, which evolved during the proceedings.\n\n1328.\n\nIn light of these factors, the Tribunal has concluded that it is fair overall that both sides (that is, the five Claimants on one side and the Respondent on the other) bear the costs of the arbitration (the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre) in equal shares, and that each side bears its own legal and other costs incurred in connection with this case.296\n\nThe Parties will receive a statement of the account from the ICSID Secretariat. Any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties.\n\n**XI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n1329.\n\nFor the reasons stated in the body of this Award, the Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\na. The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has violated Article 2(4) of the BIT by failing to observe obligations entered into with the Claimants with regard to their investments is dismissed by majority.\n\nb. The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has violated Article 2(3) of the BIT by failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants' investments is upheld by majority. In view of this decision, the Tribunal does not need to determine whether the Respondent has breached the BIT by impairing the Claimants' investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures (Article 2(3) of the BIT, second part) or by expropriating the Claimants' investments without the payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation (Article 4(1) of the BIT).\n\nc. As a result of the Respondent's breach of the BIT, the Claimants are awarded and the Respondent is ordered to pay RON 376,433,229 as damages, broken down as follows:\n\ni. RON 85,100,000 for increased costs of sugar;\n\nii. RON 17,500,000 for increased costs of raw materials other than sugar or PET;\n\niii. RON 18,133,229 for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar; and\n\niv. RON 255,700,000 for lost profits on sales of finished goods.\n\nd. The Respondent is ordered to pay interest on the amount specified in subparagraph (c) above, at 3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis, calculated from the following dates until full payment of the Award:\n\ni. With respect to the claims for increased cost of sugar and other raw materials, interest shall be calculated from 1 March 2007.\n\nii. With respect to the claim for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar, interest shall be calculated from 1 November 2009.\n\niii. With respect to the claim for lost profits on sales of finished goods, interest shall be calculated from 1 May 2008.\n\ne. The Claimants on one side and the Respondent on the other shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares, and each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs incurred in connection with this case.\n\nf. All provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal will cease to have effect as of the date of dispatch of this Award.\n\ng. All other claims or prayers for relief are dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision of the European Commission Prohibiting Enforcement of the Arbitral Award", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2015-03-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the European Commission Prohibiting Enforcement of the Arbitral Award\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n------------------------\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 108(2) thereof (1),\n\nWith effect from 1 December 2009, Articles 87, and 88 of the EC Treaty have become Articles 107 and 108, respectively, of the Treaty.

PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nBy award of 11 December 2013 ('the Award'), an arbitration tribunal ('the Tribunal') established under the auspices of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ('ICSID') in the case *Micula a.o.* v *Romania* (3) awarded compensation in favour of the five claimants (the brothers Viorel and Ioan Micula and the companies S.C. European Food SA, S.C. Starmill S.R.L., and S.C. Multipack, all owned by the Micula brothers; collectively, 'the claimants') against Romania in the amount of RON 376 433 229 (ca. EUR 82 million (4)) for Romania's failure to ensure a fair and equitable treatment of the claimants' investments, which amounted to a violation by Romania of Article 2(3) of the Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments ('the BIT') (5). In addition, the Tribunal decided that interest should accrue on that sum until Romania's full implementation of the Award. By 11 December 2013, the total amount thus owed by Romania to the claimants amounted to RON 791 882 452 (ca. EUR 178 million (6)).\n\nICSID Case No ARB/05/20, *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, SC European Food SA, SC Starmill SRI, SC Multipack SRL* v *Romania*, final award of 11 December 2013.\n\nReference exchange rate of the European Central Bank on 11 December 2013: 1 EUR = 4,45 RON.\n\nThe BIT entered into force on 1 April 2003.\n\nSee footnote 4.\n\n2.\n\nBy letter of 31 January 2014, the Commission services informed the Romanian authorities that any implemen- tation or execution of the Award would constitute new aid and would have to be notified to the Commission.\n\n3.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the Romanian authorities informed the Commission services that they had partially implemented the Award by offsetting a portion of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal against taxes owed by one of the claimants, namely S.C. European Food SA, to the Romanian authorities. The tax debt that was thus offset amounted to RON 337 492 864 (ca. EUR 76 million (7)). Romania further sought clarification from the Commission services as to the possibility of paying the outstanding amount to a natural person (the brothers Viorel and Ioan Micula or any other natural person to whom the claim may be assigned).\n\nReference exchange rate of the European Central Bank on 15 January 2014: 1 EUR = 4,52 RON.\n\n4.\n\nOn 12 March 2014, the Commission services requested further information from Romania regarding the envisaged further implementation or execution of the Award, which Romania provided by letter of 26 March 2014.\n\n5.\n\nOn 1 April 2014, the Commission services alerted the Romanian authorities as to the possibility of issuing a suspension injunction to ensure that no further incompatible State aid would be paid out and sought Romania's comments thereon. By letter of 7 April 2014, Romania declared that it did not wish to comment on the possibility of the Commission issuing a suspension injunction.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 26 May 2014, the Commission informed Romania of its decision to issue a suspension injunction ('the suspension injunction') pursuant to Article 11(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 (8), obliging Romania to suspend any action which may lead to the implementation or execution of the part of the Award that had not yet been paid, as that would constitute payment of unlawful State aid, until the Commission has taken a final decision on the compatibility of that State aid with the internal market.\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1).\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 1 October 2014, the Commission informed Romania that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) of the Treaty ('the opening decision') in respect of the partial implementation of the Award by Romania that took place in early 2014 (9) as well as in respect of any further implementation or execution of the Award.\n\nSee recital 3.\n\n8.\n\nThe Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the *Official Journal of the European Union* (10) on 7 November 2014. By that decision, the Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments.\n\nSee footnote 2.\n\n9.\n\nRomania submitted its comments on the opening decision on 26 November 2014. The claimants submitted comments as an interested party on 8 December 2014, after the rejection, by the Commission, of their request to have a longer period of time available for submitting their comments. The claimants' comments were forwarded to Romania, which was given the opportunity to react; Romania's observations on the claimants' comments were received on 27 January 2015.\n\n10.\n\nThe claimants also requested access to all written correspondence between the Commission and Romania contained in the case file. The request was rejected on 19 December 2014 and the rejection was affirmed on 2 March 2015.\n\n11.\n\nBy letters of 9 and 11 March 2015 the Romanian authorities informed the Commission that in the period 5 February to 25 February 2015, the court-appointed executor seized an additional amount of RON 9 197 482 from the Ministry of Finance and that a voluntary payment of the remaining amount (i.e. RON 466 760 066) (11) was made by the Ministry of Finance into a blocked account opened in the name of the five claimants.\n\nAn additional RON 6 028 608 have been transferred on the blocked account as compensation for the execution costs.\n\n**2. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n*The State aid law applicable in Romania before its accession to the Union*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 1 February 1995, the Europe Agreement ('EA') between the European Community (the 'Community') and its Member States, on the one hand, and Romania, on the other hand, entered into force (12). The aim of the EA was to prepare Romania for accession to the Union. Article 64(1)(iii) of the EA declared incompatible with the proper functioning of the EA any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods in so far as they may affect trade between the Union and Romania. According to Article 64(2) EA, any practices contrary to this Article had to be assessed 'on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community' (now Articles 101, 102 and 107 of the Treaty). This dynamic reference to 'criteria arising from the application of the rules' refers to all Union rules on State aid, including those governing the grant of regional State aid (13). In addition to the substantive obligation to comply with Union State aid law, Articles 69 and 71 of the EA obliged Romania to harmonise its domestic legislation with the *acquis communautaire*, expressly mentioning Union competition law and thus Union State aid law which forms part thereof. Accordingly, the EA obliged Romania, and Romania committed, to comply with the entire corpus of Union State aid law. Furthermore, the EA has been part of the domestic legal order after been ratified by law 20/1993 by the national Parliament and published in the national Official Journal on 12 April 1993 (14).\n\nOJ L 357, 31.12.1994, p. 2.\n\nSee also Article 2 of the Implementing Rules to Decision No 4/2000 of the EU-Romania Association Council of 10 April 2001 adopting the implementing rules for the application of the provisions on State aid referred to in Articles 64(1)(iii) and (2) pursuant to Article 64(3) of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, and in Article 9(1)(iii) and (2) of Protocol 2 on European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) products to that Agreement (OJ L 138, 22.5.2001, p. 16).\n\n*Monitorul Oficial,* first part, No 73 of 12 April 1993.\n\n13.\n\nIn order to comply with its harmonisation obligation under the EA, Romania passed Law No 143/1999 on State aid ('State aid law') in 1999, which entered into force on 1 January 2000. That law included the same definition of State aid as that contained in Article 64 of the EA and under Union law. That law also designated the Romanian Competition Council (15) and the Romanian Competition Office (16) as its national State aid surveillance authorities competent for assessing the compatibility of State aid granted by Romania to undertakings (17) and laid down the procedure to be followed for the notification and authorisation of State aid which was modelled on Article 108 of the Treaty.\n\nThe Competition Council was and is an autonomous administrative authority in the field of competition law and State aid law with regulatory and investigative powers, similar to the European Commission in the field of competition and State aid law.\n\nThe Competition Office was a specialised authority subordinate to the government. The main responsibilities of the Office were: (i) to carry out investigations and to survey the effective enforcement of legal provisions and the decisions of the Competition Council; (ii) to supervise the setting of prices by public entities and public companies; and (iii) to ensure transparency of State aid, and to monitor and report State aid expenditure.\n\nBy Article 1 of the implementing rules to Decision No 4/2000 the EU-Romania Association Council designated the Competition Council and Competition Office as the Romanian entities responsible for surveying and assessing the compatibility of State aid with the 1995 Europe Agreement.\n\n*The investment incentives scheme*\n----------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 2 October 1998, Romania enacted Emergency Government Ordinance 24/1998 ('EGO 24'), granting certain investors in disfavoured regions a series of incentives, inter alia:\n\n\u2014 Article 6(1)(a): an exemption from payment of custom duties and value added tax on machinery, tools, installations, equipment, means of transportation, other goods subject to depreciation which are imported or manufactured domestically with the purpose of making investments in that region ('Machinery Facility'),\n\n\u2014 Article 6(1)(b): refunds of customs duties on raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary for achieving the investor's own production in that region ('Raw Materials Facility'),\n\n\u2014 Article 6(1)(c): an exemption from payment of profit tax during the period for which the relevant area is designated as a disfavoured region ('Profit Tax Facility').\n\n15.\n\nThe Romanian Government determined which regions should be designated as disfavoured and for how long, up to a maximum of 10 years. By decision of 25 March 1999, the Government declared the mining area of **S** tei-Nucet, Bihor county, to be a disfavoured region for 10 years, effective on 1 April 1999.\n\n16.\n\nOn 15 May 2000, the Romanian Competition Council adopted Decision No 244/2000, in which it found that several of the incentives offered under EGO 24 distorted competition. It considered that '[e]xemption from customs duty on raw materials are deemed State aid for operating purposes... leading to distortion of competition' and decided that 'the reimbursement of customs duties on imported raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary for own production purposes within an area... shall be deleted'. That decision was adopted as a result of the notification by the national agency for regional development (the aid grantor under EGO 24) to the Competition Council, in accordance with Law No 143/1999, of envisaged modifications to EGO 24 included in the draft Emergency Government Ordinance 75/2000 ('EGO 75'). Amongst other modifications notified, the Romanian legislator envisaged replacing the reimbursement of custom duties under Article 6(1)(b) of EGO 24 (the Raw Materials Facility) with an exemption from custom duties on imported raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary for own production purposes. In Decision No 244/2000, the Competition Council granted conditional authorisation to draft EGO 75, provided the following conditions were complied with: (i) the facilities under Article 6(1)(b) of EGO 24 should be repealed and the envisaged amendment to replace the reimbursement of custom duties with an exemption from custom duties should be withdrawn; and (ii) the envisaged amendments to Article 6(1)(c) of the EGO 24 (the Profit Tax Facility) would be limited only to the profit that is reinvested.\n\n17.\n\nOn 1 July 2000, EGO 75 entered into force. EGO 75, as adopted, did not, however, comply with the Competition Council's conditions to repeal the Raw Materials Facility and withdraw the envisaged amendment thereto. Instead, it amended Article 6(1)(b) of EGO 24 by replacing the refund on customs duties under the Raw Materials Facility with an exemption on customs duties on imported raw materials in direct contravention of Decision No 244/2000.\n\n18.\n\nThe Competition Council challenged the failure to implement its decision before the Bucharest Court of Appeal, which however dismissed the application on 26 January 2001 as inadmissible (18). The inadmissibility was grounded on the fact that EGO 75 was considered a legislative, not an administrative measure, the legality of which the Competition Council could not contest under Law No 143/1999 and that any conflicts between legal provisions had to be resolved by the government and parliament without interference from the courts. The High Court of Cassation of Justice of Romania rejected the Competition Council's appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision on 19 February 2002 as inadmissible on similar grounds (19).\n\nCivil Decision No 26; see Award, paragraph 219.\n\nSee Award, paragraph 224.\n\n19.\n\nIn February 2000, Romania began accession talks to the Union. Competition policy, including compliance with Union State aid rules, formed part of those negotiations. In the context of those negotiations, the Union Common Position of 21 November 2001 noted that 'there are a number of existing as well as new incompatible aid schemes which have not been brought into line with the acquis', including 'facilities provided under [EGO 24 and EGO 75]' (20).\n\nEuropean Union Common Position of 21 November 2001, CONF-RO 43/01, p. 4. During the accession process of an applicant country, the Commission regularly proposes and the Council adopts so-called common positions, in which the progress of the candidate country towards compliance with the accession criteria is evaluated.\n\n20.\n\nOn 31 August 2004, Romania repealed all the incentives provided under EGO 24, as amended by EGO 75, except the Profit Tax Facility. The revocation of the EGO 24 incentives took effect on 22 February 2005. The report accompanying the act repealing EGO 24, as amended by EGO 75, explained: 'In order to meet the criteria in the Community rules on State aid, and also to complete the negotiations under Chapter No 6 \u2014 Competition Policy it is necessary to eliminate all forms of State aid in national legislation incompatible with the acquis communautaire in this area and, in this respect, it is proposed to repeal [...] the provisions of Article 6 paragraph (1), letter (b), letter (d) and letter (e) of the Emergency Government Ordinance No 24/1998 on the disadvantaged areas [...] (21).'\n\nSubstantiation Report accompanying EGO 94/2004, 26 August 2004, pp. 12-13.\n\n*he claimants' investments and ICSID arbitration proceedings*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe claimants made certain investments in area of **S** tei-Nucet, Bihor County, Romania, in the early 2000s. On 1 June 2000, S.C. European Food SA obtained a permanent investor certificate, while S.C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack obtained their permanent investor certificates ('PICs') on 17 May 2002, thereby making those companies eligible to benefit from the scheme set up by EGO 24, as amended by EGO 75, for investments made by them from those dates onwards in the region of **S** tei-Nucet, Bihor county, Romania.\n\n22.\n\nIn 2003, Romania and Sweden concluded the BIT, which granted each country's investors (including for investments entered into prior to the entry into force of the BIT (22)) certain protections when investing in the other country. The BIT guaranteed, inter alia, the covered investments' fair and equitable treatment in the host state, which was interpreted to also include a protection of the investors' legitimate expectations. It also allowed the investors to institute proceedings before an international arbitration tribunal in case they believed their rights under the BIT were violated by the host state. As the Micula brothers hold Swedish citizenship, they claimed that their investments in Romania were covered by the BIT.\n\nArticle 9(1) of the BIT.\n\n23.\n\nOn 28 July 2005, and in reaction to the revocation of the investment incentives under EGO 24, the claimants requested the establishment of an arbitration tribunal pursuant to the dispute settlement provisions of the BIT. By decision of 24 September 2008, the Tribunal found that the claimants' claims were admissible. The claimants had initially requested the re-establishment of the EGO 24 investment incentives that had been revoked as of 22 February 2005. However, during the proceedings, the claimants partially withdrew their claim in 2009 and instead requested compensation for damages resulting from the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives. The claimants alleged that by revoking the incentives, Romania had infringed their legitimate expectations that those incentives would be available, in substance, until 1 April 2009. Thus, according to the claimants, Romania had violated its obligation of fair and equitable treatment owed to them as Swedish investors under Article 2(3) of the BIT.\n\n24.\n\nIn the course of the arbitration proceedings, the Commission intervened as *amicus curiae*. In its intervention, submitted on 20 July 2009, the Commission explained that the EGO 24 incentives were: 'incompatible with the Community rules on regional aid. In particular, the incentives did not respect the requirements of Community law as regards eligible costs and aid intensities. Moreover, the facilities constituted operating aid, which is proscribed under regional aid rules'.\n\n25.\n\nThe Commission also observed that '[a]ny ruling reinstating the privileges abolished by Romania, or compensating the claimants for the loss of these privileges, would lead to the granting of new aid which would not be compatible with the EC Treaty'. It also advised the Tribunal that the 'execution of [any award requiring Romania to re-establish investment schemes which have been found incompatible with the internal market during accession negotiations] can thus not take place if it would contradict the rules of EU State aid policy'.\n\n26.\n\nIn the Award of 11 December 2013, the Tribunal found that by revoking the EGO 24 incentives, Romania 'violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations with respect to the availability of the EGO 24 incentives' until 1 April 2009 (23). The Tribunal further concluded that, with the exception of maintaining the investors' obligations under EGO 24 after revocation of the relevant incentives, 'Romania's repeal of the incentives was a reasonable action in pursuit of a rational policy.' (24) However, the Tribunal went on to state that (25): '[T]his conclusion does not detract from the Tribunal's holding [...] above that Romania undermined the Claimants' legitimate expec-  tations with respect to the continued availability of the incentives until 1 April 2009. As a result, Romania's actions, although for the most part appropriately and narrowly tailored in pursuit of a rational policy, were unfair or inequitable vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants'.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded its analysis by stating that (26): '[B]y repealing the EGO 24 incentives prior to 1 April 2009, Romania did not act unreasonably or in bad faith (except that [Romania] acted unreasonably by maintaining investors' obligations after terminating the incentives). The Tribunal, however, concludes by majority that Romania violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations that those incentives would be available, in substantially the same form, until 1 April 2009. Romania also failed to act transparently by failing to inform the Claimants in a timely manner that the regime would be terminated prior to its stated date of expiration. As a result, the Tribunal finds that Romania failed to \"ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments\" of the Claimants in the meaning of Article 2(3) of the BIT'.\n\nAward, paragraph 725.\n\nAward, paragraph 827.\n\nSee footnote 24.\n\nAward, paragraph 872.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal further decided that Romania had to pay damages to the claimants (27). In total, the Tribunal awarded the claimants RON 376 433 229 plus interest. The damages are made up as follows: the Tribunal found that Romania had to pay the claimants RON 85,1 million (28) in damages for the increased cost of sugar (for the import of which the claimants had to pay customs duties after the revocation of the Raw Materials Facility), RON 17,5 million (29) in damages for the increased cost of raw materials other than sugar and PET (30), RON 18,1 mil-  lion (31) in damages for the loss of the ability to stockpile sugar at lower prices, and RON 255,7 million (32) in damages for lost profit deriving from lost sales of finished goods. In addition, the Tribunal ordered Romania to pay interest (ROBOR plus 5 %), calculated from 1 March 2007 with respect to the increased cost of sugar and other raw materials, from 1 November 2009 with respect to loss of ability to stockpile sugar, and from 1 May 2008 with respect to lost profits. On the date of the Award, the principal and interest due to the claimants amounted to RON 791 882 452, as illustrated in the table.\n\n**Damages and interest as awarded to the claimants by the Award**\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Damages awarded | Amount (in RON) | Interest calculated from |\n| Increased cost of sugar | 85 100 000 | 1 March 2007 |\n| Increased cost of raw materials other than sugar or PET | 17 500 000 | 1 March 2007 |\n| Lost opportunity to stockpile sugar | 18 133 229 | 1 November 2009 |\n| Lost profits on the sale of finished goods | 255 700 000 | 1 May 2008 |\n|  |  | Total including interest on 11 December 2013: |\n| **TOTAL** | **376 433 229** | **RON 791 882 452** |\n\nAward, paragraphs 875 et seq.\n\nThis amount is calculated for imports made during 22 February 2005 and 31 March 2009.\n\nSee footnote 28.\n\nThe claimants asked for compensation for the increased cost of PET. However, the Tribunal rejected this claims on the basis that the claimants had never in fact benefited from the Raw Materials Facility with respect to PET imports.\n\nThis amount is calculated on the basis of custom duties charged on imported sugar and that would have been avoided, if the claimant had had the opportunity to stockpile sugar before the envisaged expiry of the EGO (i.e. 1 April 2009). The benchmark is based on stockpiles in 2004/2005.\n\nLost profits are calculated over the period 2004-2008 for loss of market shares of soft drinks and other products that did contain sugar. The claim is that after the revocation of the EGO incentives, the costs increased leading to higher prices and thus to lower market shares.\n\n*The ICSID annulment proceedings*\n---------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 April 2014, Romania filed an application for the annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18 March 1965 ('ICSID Convention') before an ad hoc committee. Due to the procedural rules applicable to those proceedings, Romania has not provided the Commission with its application. However, it has become clear that in its application, Romania also requested the ad hoc committee to order a stay of enforcement of the Award until the committee had ruled on the application for annulment. By letter of 18 August 2014, Romania informed the Commission that by order of 7 August 2014, the ad hoc committee granted a stay of enforcement of the Award under the condition that Romania deposit, within one month, the following assurances: 'Romania commits itself subject to no conditions whatsoever (including those related to [EU] Law or decisions) to effect the full payment of its pecuniary obligation imposed by the Award in ICSID Case No ARB/05/20 \u2014 and owed to Claimants \u2014 to the extent that the Award is not annulled \u2014 following the notification of the Decision on annulment'.\n\n29.\n\nAt the request of Romania, the Commission explained to Romania that it could not provide the unconditional commitment that it would pay the compensation awarded under the Award to the claimants even if that entailed a violation of its obligations under Union law and regardless of any decision of the Commission. Romania replied accordingly to the ad hoc committee which lifted the stay of enforcement of the Award as of 7 September 2014.\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 October 2014, the Commission submitted an application to the ad hoc committee for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in the annulment proceedings. Leave to intervene was granted by the ad hoc committee on 4 December 2014 and the Commission submitted its *amicus curiae* brief in those proceedings on 9 January 2015.\n\n*The claimants' actions for recognition and execution of the Award in Romanian and US courts*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Romanian authorities further informed the Commission services about the national proceedings introduced by the claimants to enforce the award. In February 2014, Viorel Micula introduced first the court proceedings with a view to recognise the award on the basis of the New Procedural Civil Code (Articles 1124-1132) (33). On 7 May 2014, the Commission intervened in those proceedings pursuant to Article 23a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. However, Viorel Micula withdrew his action on 28 May 2014 and therefore no judgement has been rendered. Separately, on 18 March 2014 the other four claimants (S.C. European Food SA, S.C. Starmill S.R.L., S.C. Multipack, and Mr Ion Micula) initiated court proceedings in Romania with a view to enforcing the Award pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention requesting the payment of 80 % of the outstanding amount (i.e. RON 301 146 583) and the corresponding interest.\n\nCase No 3456/3/2014, Bucharest Tribunal.\n\n32.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, the Bucharest Tribunal allowed the execution of the Award as requested by the four claimants considering that, on the basis of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention which has been ratified by Romania and is part of the domestic legal order, the Award is a directly enforceable act and must be treated as a final domestic judgment, thus obviating the procedure to recognise the Award on the basis of the Romanian New Procedural Civil Code (Articles 1123-1132) (34). On 30 March 2014, an executor started the enforcement procedure by setting the Romanian Ministry of Finance a deadline of 6 months to pay to the four claimants 80 % of the Award plus the interests and other costs.\n\nOrder issued by Bucharest Tribunal in Case No 9261/3/2014, Section IV Civil.\n\n33.\n\nRomania challenged the execution of the Award before the Bucharest Tribunal and asked for interim measures, i.e. a temporary suspension of execution until the case had been decided on the merits (35). On 14 May 2014, the Bucharest Court temporarily suspended the execution of the Award until a decision on the merits of Romania's challenge and request to suspend the execution had been taken. On 26 May 2014, the Commission intervened in those proceedings pursuant to Article 23a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. The Commission invited the Bucharest Tribunal to suspend and annul the forced execution of the Award. In the alternative, the Commission invited the Bucharest Tribunal to refer a preliminary question to the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU').\n\nCase No 15755/3/2014, Bucharest Tribunal, Section III Civil.\n\n34.\n\nOn 23 September 2014, the Bucharest Tribunal, in the interim measure case, lifted the suspension and rejected Romania's request for a suspension of the execution of the Award. The primary reason for that rejection was the lifting of the stay of enforcement of the Award by the ICSID ad hoc committee on 7 September 2014 (see recital 29). On 30 September 2014, Romania decided to appeal the decision of Bucharest Tribunal of 23 September 2014 (36). On 13 October 2014, the Bucharest Tribunal rejected the request to send preliminary questions to the CJEU on the basis of Article 267 of the Treaty. On 17 October 2014, against the backdrop of the Commission decision of 1 October 2014 to open the formal investigation procedure, in the context of the case No 15755/3/2014 before the Bucharest Tribunal, Romania again requested interim measures in the form of the suspension of the forced execution of the Award.\n\nCase No 15755/3/2014/a1, Bucharest Court of Appeal, Section IV Civil.\n\n35.\n\nDespite the obligation of all Romanian authorities, including the judiciary, to comply with the Commission decisions of 26 May 2014 and 1 October 2014, the executor appointed by the Bucharest Tribunal issued orders on 31 October 2014 to seize the accounts of Romania's Ministry of Finance and seek the execution of 80 % of the Award. As a result of the letters of attachment issued by the executor, some parts of the Ministry of Finance's state treasury and bank accounts are currently frozen.\n\n36.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the Bucharest Tribunal also rejected Romania's main action against the execution order of 24 March 2014, including the request for interim measures of 17 October 2014. On 14 January 2015, Romania has appealed the decision of the Bucharest Tribunal (37). On 24 February 2015, the Bucharest Court of Appeal lifted the decision of the Bucharest Tribunal of 23 September 2014 and suspended the forced execution until the appeal against the decision of Bucharest Tribunal of 24 November 2014 is decided. The Commission has decided to seek leave to intervene in those appeal proceedings on the basis of Article 23a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\n\nSee footnote 36.\n\n37.\n\nOn 5 January 2015, the court-appointed executor seized RON 36 484 232 (ca. EUR 8,1 million (38)) from Romania's Ministry of Finance. Of this sum, the executor subsequently transferred RON 34 004 232 (ca. EUR 7,56 million) in equal parts to three of the five claimants, and kept the remainder as compensation for execution costs. Between 5 February and 25 February 2015, the court-appointed executor seized an additional RON 9 197 482 (ca. EUR 2 million) (39) from the Ministry of Finance. On 9 March 2015 the Ministry of Finance voluntarily transferred the remaining amount of RON 472 788 675 (ca. EUR 106,5 million (40)) (including the costs of court appointed executor of RON 6 028 608) into a blocked account in the name of the five claimants in order to implement the Award. However, the five claimants can withdraw the money only if the Commission decides that the State aid granted on the basis of the Award is compatible with the internal market.\n\nReference exchange rate of the European Central Bank on 5 January 2015: 1 EUR = 4,49 RON.\n\nSee footnote 38.\n\nReference exchange rate of the European Central Bank on 9 March 2015: 1 EUR = 4,44 RON.\n\n38.\n\nThe Commission has furthermore discovered that Mr Viorel Micula also initiated an action for enforcement against Romania before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (41). That case is pending. The Commission intends to apply for leave to file an *amicus curiae* brief in those proceedings. Mr Viorel Micula also initiated further enforcement proceedings against Romania before the Romanian courts on 3 October 2014, but that claim was rejected by the Bucharest Tribunal on 3 November 2014.\n\nCase No 1-14-cv-600 Viorel Micula v Government of Romania in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \u2014 Petition to confirm ICSID award and enter judgment.\n\n**3. DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURE AND GROUNDS FOR INITIATING THE PROCEDURE**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Description of the measure*\n----------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe measure under assessment is the payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal by virtue of the Award, whether by implementation or execution of that Award, plus the interest that has accrued since the Award was issued.\n\n40.\n\nAs noted in recital 3, Romania already partially paid out that compensation in early 2014 by offsetting tax debts owed by one of the claimants, S.C. European Food SA, to the Romanian State. The tax debts thus offset amount to RON 337 492 864 (ca. EUR 76 million (42)).\n\nSee footnote 7.\n\n41.\n\nAs noted in recital 37, the court-appointed executor seized RON 45 681 714 (ca. EUR 10,17 million (43)) from Romania's Ministry of Finance in order to execute the Award. Furthermore, the Romanian authorities have trans-  ferred the remaining amount of RON 472 788 675 (ca. EUR 106,5 million (44)) (including the costs of court appointed executor of RON 6 028 608) into a blocked account in the name of the five claimants.\n\nSee footnote 38.\n\nSee footnote 40.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Romanian authorities the arbitration award has been fully implemented.\n\n*Grounds for initiating the formal investigation procedure*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn the opening decision, the Commission reached the preliminary conclusion that payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants through the implementation or execution of the Award constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty. This preliminary conclusion rests on the preliminary findings that:\n\n\u2014 the five claimants constitute one economic unit that must be qualified as an undertaking,\n\n\u2014 payment of the awarded compensation would grant the claimants an economic advantage not otherwise available on the market,\n\n\u2014 the presence of an advantage is not precluded by the fact that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is designated as compensation for damages, since the Award does not fall within the scope of the *Asteris* case-law distinguishing damages from State aid,\n\n\u2014 the advantage granted is selective, since only the claimants would benefit from the measure,\n\n\u2014 the advantage is granted from state resources, since the relevant payments would be made from the state budget, and the decision to grant the advantage is imputable to Romania, regardless of whether Romania implemented the Award voluntarily or on the order of a court,\n\n\u2014 payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants distorts competition and affects trade between Member States.\n\n44.\n\nThe Commission then determined that the application of the State aid rules in this case does not affect rights and obligations protected by Article 351 of the Treaty. The Commission further found that payment of the compen-  sation awarded to the claimants would constitute new aid, since the implementation or execution of the Award would take place after Romania's accession to the Union, and that it did not matter that some of the costs which the measure would *de facto* reimburse were incurred by the claimants before accession. Finally, the Commission reached the preliminary conclusion that the payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants through the implementation or execution of the Award would not be compatible with the internal market, since it would not fulfil the applicable compatibility conditions for regional aid.\n\n**4. COMMENTS FROM ROMANIA**\n----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nRomania points out, first, that under Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention, to which Romania became a party in 1975, each state party 'shall recognise an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that state'. Romania argues that the consequence of this clause is that every state party has an obligation to recognise and enforce an ICSID arbitral award the execution of which has not been stayed in accordance with the rules under the ICSID Convention, with there being no possibility of appeal against such an award before the national courts.\n\n46.\n\nSecond, Romania stresses that the Romanian government is bound to comply with the Romanian constitution, which bars it from unduly influencing national judges as regards the question of whether or not to enforce the Award. It stresses that the national court autonomously decided that the various acts issued by the Commission in 2014 could not suspend the enforcement of the Award under Romanian law. Romania argues further that, while according to the Romanian constitution Union law generally takes precedence over (ordinary) Romanian national law, Union law could not overrule the Romanian constitution itself.\n\n47.\n\nThird, Romania submits that the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal should not be treated as new incompatible aid, but as compensation for damages within the meaning of the *Asteris* case-law. Romania objects, in particular, to the application of the *Lucchini* case-law to the present case, arguing that the factual background distinguishes the present case from that adjudicated upon by the CJEU in *Lucchini* (45).\n\nSee opening decision, recital 39.\n\n48.\n\nFinally, Romania repeatedly stresses the conflict borne out in the present case between Romania's obligations under the ICSID Convention and under Union law. It submits that until it has been determined at ICSID level whether the ICSID Convention or Union law should take precedence, the implementation or execution of an ICSID award should not be considered to constitute illegal State aid.\n\n**5. COMMENTS FROM INTERESTED PARTIES**\n---------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe only interested party to submit observations on the opening decision was the claimants in the arbitration proceedings giving rise to the Award. The claimants contest the preliminary findings contained in the opening decision. In particular, they make observations regarding (i) the background of the case; and (ii) the allegedly incorrect description of the measure; they argue that (iii) there is no conflict between Union State aid rules and intra-EU BITs; they submit that (iv) the implementation or execution of the Award does not constitute State aid; or (v) at least not new aid; they assert that if characterised as aid; (vi) the implementation or execution of the Award would be compatible aid; they maintain that (vii) the protection of legitimate expectations precludes the Commission from adopting a negative decision; and finally they argue that (viii) the Commission must take steps to properly involve the claimants in the investigation procedure.\n\n*Regarding the background of the case*\n--------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe claimants explain that after the collapse of the communist regime in 1989, Romania found itself in a state of dire economic deprivation. The situation was such that when Romania started the accession process to the European Union in 1995, it was far from meeting the Union's accession criteria. In order to accelerate economic development and reduce regional disparities, the Romanian government established a framework for regional development and shortly thereafter adopted EGO 24 to incentivise private sector investments in disfavoured regions. The EGO 24 incentives were aimed solely at investors creating jobs in the most disadvantaged regions in one of the poorest countries in Europe. In this context, the claimants stress in particular that EGO 24 did not only provide advantages to investors, but also imposed obligations, such as the duty to create jobs and employ previously unemployed workers, develop and produce new materials in a disfavoured region, maintain the head office of the newly established companies in the disfavoured region, and the obligation to apply for and receive a PIC.\n\n51.\n\nThe claimants further explain that their companies obtained PICs between 2000 and 2002 for investing in Bihor County. Under the terms of those PICs, which were valid until 1 April 2009, the claimants committed to maintaining their investments for 'twice the period of time in which [the claimants] enjoyed the advantages' put in place by EGO 24. Through their investments, the claimants claim to have created approximately 9 000 new jobs, of which 7 000 continue to exist to this day. The claimants further assert that their investments led to significant spillover effects in the region. The conclusion that the claimants draw from these observations is that through their investments they contributed to alleviating the hardship brought about by the dire economic conditions in the Bihor County region and have improved the quality of life in that region.\n\n52.\n\nWith respect to the State aid laws in place in Romania prior to Romania's accession to the Union, the claimants argue that since EGO 24 was set up before Law No 143/1999 entered into force, EGO 24 was existing aid for the purpose of that law and did not have to be authorised by the Competition Council. The claimants also recall that while the Competition Council attempted to challenge EGO 75 in Romania's courts, it did not contest the compatibility of EGO 24 with Law No 143/1999. The claimants also recall that, with the exception of the EU Common Position of 21 November 2001, no statement issued by the Union in the course of the accession process specifically identified EGO 24 as being problematic from a State aid perspective.\n\n53.\n\nFinally, the claimants state that any failure to fully implement the Award, or the recovery of the part that has already been implemented by means of setting of the claimant's tax debts against the compensation owed, would be disastrous for the claimants and the region, jeopardising thousands of jobs and reversing the economic development that took place in the region.\n\n*Regarding the description of the measure*\n------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe claimants argue that the opening decision is not consistent when it comes to identifying the relevant measure. Referring to recitals 25 and 26 of the opening decision, the claimants stress that while the Commission claims to be investigating only the implementation or execution of the Award, in reality it is challenging the underlying EGO 24 scheme. The claimants also assert that, in any event, it has never been validly established that EGO 24 amounted to incompatible State aid.\n\n55.\n\nAsserting further that the opening decision mischaracterises the Award, the claimants argue that the Award exclusively grants compensation for damages arising from Romania's violation of the BIT and does not replicate the EGO 24 benefits. Indeed, according to the claimants the Tribunal did not award compensation for the premature revocation of EGO 24 incentives per se, but rather that the measures found to be in breach of the BIT are that Romania acted unreasonably by: (i) maintaining as a whole the investor's obligation under EGO 24 despite having revoked virtually all the benefits thereunder; (ii) by undermining the claimants' legitimate expec-  tations with respect to the continued availability of the EGO 24 incentives; and (iii) by being insufficiently transparent with the claimants.\n\n56.\n\nThe claimants furthermore put forward that the opening decision is based on the presumption that EGO 24 constituted incompatible aid, and that this presumption is flawed because EGO 24's compatibility as regional aid has never been validly determined.\n\n*Regarding the lack of conflict between the Union State aid rules and intra-EU BITs*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nReferring to recitals 51 to 55 of the opening decision, the claimants assert that provisions of Union law dealing with international law obligations of Member States are irrelevant in this case, as there is no conflict between Union State aid law and the BIT. Centrally, the claimants argue that any conflict is excluded by the fact that the arbitral proceedings in question were initiated before Romania acceded to the Union. Romania's obligation to implement the Award is said to stem from the point in time at which the alleged violation of the BIT occurred, i.e. before Romania's accession to the Union, and is thus unaffected by Union law.\n\n*Regarding the characterisation of the implementation/execution of the Award as State aid*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe claimants submit that the implementation or execution of the Award by Romania does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.\n\n59.\n\nFirst, while they do not dispute the qualification of S.C. European Food SA, S.C. Starmill S.R.L., and S.C. Multipack as undertakings, the claimants assert that Ioan and Viorel Micula cannot themselves be said to be engaged in economic activities. Particularly, the fact that the Micula brothers hold shares in various undertakings is said to be insufficient to qualify them as undertakings themselves. The claimants also maintain that the three aforementioned companies and the Micula brothers cannot be treated as a single economic unit, as the brothers' interests are not identical to those of the companies.\n\n60.\n\nSecond, the claimants emphasise that implementing the Award does not confer an advantage upon them. They argue that measures which serve to fulfil legal obligations, such as the payment of compensation for damages, do not constitute preferential treatment of undertakings. In this context, the claimants assert that the Commission cannot rely on Advocate-General Colomer's statement in *Atzeni*, since that case related to damages paid to a beneficiary in compensation for the recovery of incompatible aid that had already been paid out. The claimants maintain that, in contrast, in the present case no State aid \u2014 much less unlawful State aid \u2014 had been paid out to them, thus distinguishing it from *Atzeni*. Similarly, the claimants maintain that the present case cannot be equated with the cases cited in the opening decision in which contract clauses indemnifying beneficiaries for recovery of incompatible State were judged to constitute State aid themselves.\n\n61.\n\nThe claimants further maintain that the implementation or execution of the Award would fall squarely under the *Asteris* case-law. They argue that the rationale behind the *Asteris* case-law, as well as such cases as *Denkavit* (46) and *ThyssenKrupp* (47), is that payment of damages is not within the discretion of Member States, so that it cannot qualify as State aid. Romania's commitments under the BIT are further claimed to be an expression of general rules of liability to which the *Asteris* case-law applies. Regarding the Commission's argument that *Asteris* does not apply to damages awarded on the basis of intra-EU BITs considered incompatible with Union law, the claimants maintain that any such incompatibility would not render the Award granted on the basis of such a BIT void. Implemen-  tation or execution of the Award could furthermore not be seen as granting State aid 'by the back door', as the Award does not reinstate the abolished EGO 24 scheme; rather, the Award is said to grant damages for Romania's autonomous decision to, inter alia, maintain an unreasonable burden imposed on the claimants.\n\nCase 61/79 *Amministrazione delle finanze dello Stato* v *Denkavit italiana* EU:C:1980:100.\n\nCommission Decision 2008/408/EC of 20 November 2007 on the State aid C 36/A/06 (ex NN 38/06) implemented by Italy in favour of ThyssenKrupp, Cementir and Nuove Terni Industrie Chimiche (OJ L 144, 4.6.2008, p. 37).\n\n62.\n\nThe claimants further assert that the Commission's arguments regarding the incompatibility of the BIT with Union law are irrelevant, since the dispute leading to the arbitral proceedings and ultimately the Award arose before Romania's accession to the Union. Arguing that the Commission's argumentation in the opening decision is based on mistakenly linking the implementation/execution of the Award with the incompatibility of the EGO 24 scheme, the claimants reassert that in any event the Award did not grant damages on the basis of Romania's decision to comply with Union State aid rules.\n\n63.\n\nThe claimants further dispute that the CJEU's decision in *Lucchini*, which the Commission referred to in the opening decision, has any relevance for the present case. In their view, *Lucchini* establishes only that provisions of national law cannot frustrate the recovery of incompatible aid, and has no bearing on the implementation/execution of an arbitral award granting damages for the breach of a BIT.\n\n64.\n\nThird, as regards the imputability of the implementation/execution of the Award to Romania, the claimants argue that the Commission's assessment cannot rely on the imputability of EGO 24 itself. They maintain further that the implementation/execution of an ICSID award is an automatic and involuntary consequence of Romania's obligations under the ICSID Convention. Any involuntary act is, according to the claimants, not imputable to the state and cannot constitute State aid. They stress further that ICSID awards are not open to review by national courts and their enforcement cannot be blocked for reasons of domestic *ordre public* or incompatibility with Union law.\n\n65.\n\nThe claimants further argue that Romania's obligations under the ICSID Convention were not affected by Romania's subsequent membership to the Union. They explain that since the alleged breach of the BIT and the institution of proceedings occurred before Romania acceded to the Union, EU law is not applicable to the present case.\n\n66.\n\nFourth, with respect to selectivity, the claimants claim that implementation/execution of the Award is not selective, since BITs and the ICSID Convention establish a system of general liability that is equally applicable to any investor. Damages awarded under this system are, accordingly, not selective. In this context, the claimants also quote a statement allegedly made by the Commission that 'BITs, although conferring a benefit by securing property rights abroad, technically cannot qualify as [S]tate aid prohibited by Article 107(1) [of the Treaty] since the benefit does not favour certain undertakings or the production of certain goods but is granted generally to all investors irrespective of the sector they operate in.'\n\n67.\n\nFinally, the claimants deny that implementing the Award would be liable to distort competition and affect trade between Member States. They claim that the reasoning contained in the opening decision cannot apply to the Micula brothers, who are allegedly not engaged in any economic activity, with the consequence that any payments to them cannot distort competition or affect trade between Member States. More generally, the claimants argue that implementing the Award would not grant the claimants an advantage, so that any effect on competition or trade can be excluded.\n\n*Regarding the characterisation of the implementation/execution of the Award as new aid*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe claimants further take issue with the characterisation of the implementation/execution of the Award as new aid. They note that the only events that took place after Romania's accession were the adoption of the Award itself and the execution thereof. Romania's execution in particular is said to be a mere automatic consequence of the Award, rather than the result of a distinct decision. The relevant points in time were, according to the claimants, the enactment of EGO 24, the issuance of PICs to the claimants, or at the latest the conclusion of the BIT. The claimants also rely on case-law and Commission practice on state guarantees (according to which the relevant point in time is when the guarantee is given, not when it is invoked or payments issued) to argue that where compensation is paid based on a commitment included in an international agreement, the date of the conclusion of that agreement should be considered decisive.\n\n*Regarding the compatibility of the implementation/execution of the Award*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe claimants first claim that where the Commission is investigating non-notified aid, and the Member State concerned fails to bring forward any compatibility argument whatsoever, the Commission is under a duty to consider whether the aid may be compatible under any applicable rules or guidelines, if necessary by requesting further information from the Member State or the beneficiary.\n\n70.\n\nAs regards the preliminary compatibility analysis contained in the opening decision, the claimants maintain that it is conceptually flawed since it applies the current Regional Aid Guidelines ('RAG') to the implementation/execution of the Award, even though it is plainly obvious that the implementation/execution of the Award is not motivated by any regional development objective. In the claimants' opinion, and stressing again that the opening decision wrongly assumes that implementing the Award would retroactively reinstate EGO 24, the only aid that could have been granted were the benefits under the EGO 24 scheme. The EGO 24 should then have been assessed under the 1998 RAG, under which they should have been found compatible.\n\n71.\n\nThe claimants next assert that there has never been a valid formal decision establishing that EGO 24 constitutes incompatible State aid. The decision of the Romanian Competition Council (Decision No 244) denouncing EGO 24 was, according to the claimants, defective, as it did not assess compatibility and failed to provide reasoning for its findings. In addition, the claimants argued that the adoption of EGO 75, which reaffirmed EGO 24, by the Romanian Government overrode the Competition Council's decision. They further argue that the rejection of the Competition Council's challenges against EGO 75 before Romanian courts is further proof that EGO 24 and EGO 75 took precedence over the Competition Council's decision.\n\n72.\n\nThe claimants further assert that the Commission had and has no competence to review EGO 24, even inci-  dentally. The relevant parts of EGO 24 were revoked before Romania's accession to the Union. In so far as the Award is seen as reinstating aid granted under EGO 24, the claimants thus assert that the Commission has no competence of review. In this context, they refer also to the Commission decision in State aid case N 380/2004, where the Commission found that implementing an arbitral award after accession which had been rendered before accession and related entirely to periods before accession did not constitute new aid.\n\n73.\n\nFinally, the claimants argue that EGO 24 and individual incentives under EGO 24 were compatible with the internal market pursuant to the applicable 1998 RAG, given that all the compatibility conditions were fulfilled. In this context, they assert, first, that EGO 24 can in fact be seen as compatible investment aid, rather than operating aid, and, second, that even if perceived as operating aid, EGO 24 was still compatible.\n\n*Regarding legitimate expectations*\n-----------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe claimants claim that a Commission decision finding that the implementation or execution of the Award contravenes State aid rules would violate the claimants' legitimate expectations. They argue that the Union expressly encouraged Romania to conclude BITs with Member States prior to Romania's accession; that the Commission continues to support the conclusion of BITs; that the claimants relied on their expectation that the arbitral proceedings would allow them to receive compensation for the damage caused by Romania's decision to maintain all the investors' obligations under EGO 24; and that there is no overriding public interest in setting aside the claimants' legitimate expectations.\n\n*Regarding the claimants' procedural rights*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nFinally, the claimants assert that according to case-law interested parties 'have the right to be involved in the administrative procedure to the extent appropriate in the light of the circumstances of the case' (48). Arguing that Romania has failed to properly involve the claimants in the State aid procedure, which allegedly placed the claimants at a particular disadvantage, the claimants warn that failure on the part of the Commission to enable the claimants to properly defend their interests by involving them more fully in the procedure could vitiate the Commission's final decision. The claimants conclude by noting that the Commission's practice in State aid cases in general does not sufficiently safeguard the alleged beneficiaries' procedural rights, and is, by failing to provide an effective remedy, contrary to Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 47 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nReferring to Case T-68/03 *Olympiaki Aeroporia Ypiresies*, EU:T:2007:253, paragraph 42.\n\n**6. COMMENTS FROM ROMANIA ON THIRD PARTY COMMENTS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn its response to the comments submitted by the claimants, Romania first rejects the claim that Ioan and Viorel Micula could not themselves be considered to constitute undertakings for the purpose of the application of EU State aid law. Romania argues that the five claimants should rather be regarded as one economic unit, since the Micula brothers exert direct or indirect control over the corporate claimants. To underpin this assertion, Romania explains, inter alia, that during the negotiations between Romania and the claimants that took place after the Award was issued the Micula brothers took formal decision on behalf of the three corporate claimants.\n\n77.\n\nSecond, Romania rebuts the claimants' attempt to deny the connection between the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives and the granting of damages under the Award. It maintains that it is clear from the Award that the value of the damages was established by the Tribunal on the basis of the economic advantages that the claimants would have obtained if the incentives had been maintained.\n\n78.\n\nThird, as regards the claimants' assertion that they had not been and are not being properly involved in the State aid investigation, Romania denies that it failed to immediately forward the opening decision to the claimants. It further asserts that Romania is under no legal obligation to involve the claimants more fully than is and has been the case.\n\n**7. ASSESSMENT**\n-----------------\n\n7.1. **Existence of aid**\n-------------------------\n\n79.\n\nArticle 107(1) of the Treaty provides that 'aid granted by a Member State or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market'. Accordingly, a measure constitutes State aid if the following four cumulative conditions are met:\n\n\u2014 the measure must confer a selective economic advantage upon an undertaking,\n\n\u2014 the measure must be imputable to the state and financed through state resources,\n\n\u2014 the measure must distort or threaten to distort competition,\n\n\u2014 the measure must have the potential to affect trade between Member States.\n\n80.\n\nThe Commission stresses that the notion of State aid is an objective and legal concept defined directly by the Treaty. To establish whether a particular measure constitutes State aid depends not on the intentions or justifi-  cations of the Member States when granting it, but on the effects of the measure in question (49).\n\nCase C-487/06 P *British Aggregates* v *Commission* EU:C:2008:757, paragraphs 85 and 89 and the case-law cited, and Case C-279/08 P *Commission* v *Netherlands (NOx)* EU:C:2011:551, paragraph 51.\n\n*Undertaking*\n-------------\n\n81.\n\nThe CJEU has consistently defined undertakings as entities engaged in an economic activity, regardless of their legal status and the way in which they are financed (50). The classification of a particular entity thus depends entirely on the nature of its activities.\n\nJoined Cases C-180/98 to C-184/98 *Pavlov and Others* EU:C:2000:428, paragraph 74.\n\n82.\n\nSeparate legal entities may be considered to form one economic unit for the purpose of the application of State aid rules. That economic unit is then considered to be the relevant undertaking. As the CJEU has previously held, '[i]n competition law, the term \"undertaking\" must be understood as designating an economic unit [...] even if in law that economic unit consists of several persons, natural or legal.' (51) To determine whether several entities form an economic unit, the CJEU looks at the existence of a controlling share or functional, economic or organic links (52).\n\nCase C-1 70/83 *Hydrotherm* EU:C:1984:271, paragraph 11. See also Case T-137/02 *Pollmeier Malchow* v *Commission* EU:T:2004:304, paragraph 50.\n\nCase C-480/09 P *Acea Electrabel Produzione SpA* v *Commission* EU:C:2010:787 paragraphs 47 to 55; Case C-222/04 *Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze SpA and Others* EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 112.\n\n83.\n\nThe claimants in the arbitration proceedings giving rise to the Award are the brothers Ioan Micula and Viorel Micula and three companies owned by them (S.C. European Food SA, S.C. Starmill S.R.L., and S.C. Multipack). It is clear that the three companies are engaged in economic activities, as they specialise in industrial manufacturing of food products, milling products, and plastic packaging, respectively. The three companies therefore constitute undertakings. This characterisation is not disputed by the claimants.\n\n84.\n\nThe claimants maintain, however, that the Micula brothers themselves cannot, as natural persons, be considered to constitute undertakings for the purposes of Article 107(1) of the Treaty, and that accordingly funds paid out to them in implementation or execution of the Award would not constitute State aid. In particular, the interests of the Micula brothers are said not to coincide with those of the three corporate claimants.\n\n85.\n\nThe Commission finds, however, that the three companies and the Micula brothers together constitute a single economic unit for the purpose of the application of the State aid rules. This economic unit is therefore considered the relevant undertaking.\n\n86.\n\nThis finding relies, first, on the fact that the Micula brothers have, directly or indirectly, virtually exclusive ownership of the three corporate claimants, thus demonstrating a controlling interest over those companies.\n\n87.\n\nSecond, this finding takes into account that the corporate claimants form part of a larger group of companies, the European Food and Drinks Group ('EFDG'). During the arbitral proceedings, the Micula brothers also claimed compensation for other companies forming part of EFDG that allegedly suffered losses as a result of Romania's actions giving rise to the proceedings. In fact, rather than claiming and quantifying separate losses for each corporate claimant and the two individual claimants, the claimants based their application for compensation on the losses allegedly suffered by EFDG as a whole. After examining the ownership structure of EFDG and deter-  mining that the Micula brothers, directly or indirectly, owned at least 99,96 % of the all companies in EFDG for which the Micula brothers claimed damages (these are European Drinks SA, Rieni Drinks SA, Scandic Distilleries SA, Transilvania General Import-Export S.R.L., West Leasing S.R.L), the Tribunal accepted this approach and allowed the claimants to seek compensation for the losses of EFDG as a whole (53). This behaviour of the claimants during the arbitral proceedings and the corresponding determinations of the Tribunal demonstrate that the Micula brothers and the three corporate claimants, as well as the aforementioned companies forming part of EFDG, form a single economic unit with a single economic interest.\n\nSee Award, paragraphs 935-936 and 943.\n\n88.\n\nThird, the characterisation of the Micula brothers and their companies as one economic unit is further reinforced by how the Award eventually awarded compensation to them. Rather than apportioning compensation individually to each of the five claimants, the Award awarded the compensation to them 'collectively' on the basis of a 'common entitlement'. The fact that the five claimants together (i.e., including the corporate claimants) asked the Tribunal to award all compensation only to the Micula brothers shows that the corporate claimants have no autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis the Micula brothers. The Tribunal finally allowed each claimant to recover the entire amount of compensation awarded, and then to allocate that compensation among the claimants however they deem fit, regardless of the damages actually sustained by each claimant.\n\n89.\n\nThe foregoing conclusion is not affected by the claimants' argument that the present case must be distinguished from the *Hydrotherm* judgment, as the natural person in that case was a partner personally liable for the financial obligations of the various companies with which he was considered to constitute a single economic unit, whereas the Micula brothers are not so personally liable. In response, the Commission recalls that in the relevant para-  graphs of its *Hydrotherm* judgment the CJEU did not mention the personal liability of the natural person in question at all; rather, the CJEU limited itself to pointing out that the natural person in question 'has complete control' of the companies in question (54). As already mentioned, by virtue of their ownership the Micula brothers similarly have complete control over the corporate claimants, and in fact the other relevant EFDG companies.\n\nCase C-170/83 *Hydrotherm* EU:C:1984:271, paragraph 10.\n\n90.\n\nThe Commission also considers, contrary to the assertions of the claimants, that the logic underpinning the *Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze* judgment is equally applicable in this case. In that judgment, the CJEU recognised that an economic activity can be exercised by an entity directly or indirectly, through controlling an operator as part of an economic unit which they form together. Although the CJEU acknowledges that the mere fact of holding shares, even controlling shareholdings, is insufficient to characterise as economic an activity of the entity holding those shares when it gives rise only to the exercise of the rights attached to the status of shareholder or member, as well as the receipt of dividends, which are merely the fruits of the ownership of an asset, it is clear that the present situation is different. Indeed, according to the CJEU 'an entity which, owning controlling shareholdings in a company, actually exercises that control by involving itself directly or indirectly in the management thereof must be regarded as taking part in the economic activity carried on by the controlled undertaking.' (55) The CJEU was also concerned to point out that 'simple separation of an undertaking into two different entities' cannot be sufficient to circumvent State aid rules (56). This rationale also applies where one of the two entities concerned is a natural person. Otherwise granting aid to a natural person who is the controlling shareholder of an undertaking would not be considered to constitute State aid, even though the natural person could use that aid for the benefit of the undertakings which it controls. Indeed, in the present case, it cannot make any difference for the purposes of applying the State aid rules whether the compensation collectively awarded to all five claimants by the Tribunal is paid out to the Micula brothers or to the companies owned by them.\n\nCase C-222/04 *Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze SpA and Others* EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 112.\n\nCase C-222/04 *Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze SpA and Others* EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 114.\n\n91.\n\nIn conclusion, the Commission finds that the Micula brothers and the three corporate claimants together form a single economic unit that constitutes an undertaking for the purpose of applying Article 107(1) of the Treaty. The other EFDG companies for whose alleged losses the Micula brothers were awarded compensation by virtue of the Award (European Drinks SA, Rieni Drinks SA, Scandic Distilleries SA, Transilvania General Import-Export S.R.L., West Leasing S.R.L) (57) likewise form part of this single economic unit. The final beneficiary of the aid measure is this single economic unit, made up of the five claimants and those EFDG companies.\n\nSee recitals 87 and 88.\n\n*Economic advantage (1)*\n------------------------\n\n92.\n\nAn advantage, as required by Article 107(1) of the Treaty, is any economic benefit which an undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions, i.e. in the absence of the state intervention (58). The precise form of the measure is irrelevant for establishing whether it confers an economic advantage on the undertaking. The notion of advantage includes, for example, all situations where undertakings are relieved of inherent costs of their economic activities.\n\nCase C-39/94 *SFEI and Others* EU:C:1996:285, paragraph 60; Case C-342/96 *Spain* v *Commission* EU:C:1999:210, paragraph 41.\n\n93.\n\nBy the Award, the Tribunal has awarded the claimants compensation of RON 376 433 229 plus interest against Romania. To fully understand why the implementation or execution of the Award grants the claimants an economic advantage, it is first instructive to examine on which basis the Tribunal determined that compensation should be paid out to the claimants in that Award.\n\n94.\n\nAfter it had decided that Romania had breached the BIT, the Tribunal explained that damages had to be awarded on the basis of the principle that 'the claimant must be placed back in the position it would have been \"in all probability\" but for the international wrong' (59). It further explained that only losses that are causally linked to the act constituting the international wrong could be compensated by means of damages, and that 'all of the violations of the BIT alleged by the Claimants arise from the same fact: the premature revocation of the [EGO 24] incentives or in direct connection with that premature revocation' (60). In assessing the precise compensation due to the claimants, the Tribunal took into account whether losses were in reality incurred and whether they were directly related to the revocation of the incentive scheme. For instance, with regard to the damages awarded for the increased price of sugar, the Tribunal held (61): 'Both the existence of the damage and the causal link between the revocation of the incentives and the damage suffered have been adequately proved. There is no dispute that, as a result of the revocation of the Raw Materials Incentive, the Claimants were required to pay an increased amount for the sugar they purchased after February 2005'.\n\nAward, paragraph 917.\n\nAward, paragraph 928.\n\nAward, paragraph 953.\n\n95.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it is clear that through the implementation or execution of the Award, Romania grants the claimants an amount corresponding exactly to the advantages foreseen under the abolished EGO 24 scheme from the moment it was repealed (22 February 2005) until its scheduled expiry (1 April 2009). More precisely, implementing or executing the Award *de facto* reimburses customs duties charged on imported sugar and other raw materials between 22 February 2005 and 31 March 2009, as well as the customs duties charged on imported sugar that the claimants would have avoided if they had had the opportunity to stockpile sugar before the schedule expiration of the EGO 24 facilities on 31 March 2009. In addition, to ensure that the claimants fully benefit from an amount corresponding to that of the abolished scheme and are 'placed back in the position it would have been \"in all probability\" ', the Tribunal also awarded interest and compensation for the allegedly lost opportunity and lost profit (62). In effect, the implementation or execution of the Award re-establishes the situation the claimants would have, in all likelihood, found themselves in if the EGO 24 scheme had never been repealed.\n\nSee recital 27 for the description of the amounts due under the arbitration award.\n\n96.\n\nAccordingly, the implementation or execution of the Award grants the claimants an economic advantage not otherwise available on the market. First, the costs of raw materials, as inputs for final products, constitute ordinary operating expenses of undertakings, and relieving them of a part of their ordinary operating expenses grants them a distinct advantage. Second, granting the claimants compensation for lost profits because they had to bear their own operating expenses themselves likewise constitutes an economic advantage not available under normal market conditions and in absence of the Award; under normal market conditions, the undertaking would have had to bear itself the costs inherent in its economic activity and would therefore not have generated these profits. Third, paying interest to the claimants on payments that were allegedly due in the past, but which themselves must be qualified as conferring an advantage, confers a separate and additional advantage. Again, under normal market conditions and in the absence of the Award, the undertaking would have had to bear its ordinary operating expenses, would have not generated the allegedly lost profits, and would therefore not have been able to draw an interest on this capital. In fact, by repealing the EGO 24 scheme, Romania re-established normal conditions of competition on the market on which the claimants operate, and any attempt to compensate the claimants for the consequences of the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives grants an advantage not available under those normal market conditions.\n\n97.\n\nThe claimants' attempts to separate the award of compensation from the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives are unconvincing. The claimants argue: '[I]n the present case the ICSID Tribunal concluded that the decision to comply with EU State aid rules complied with Romania's obligations under the BIT and did not award damages to the Claimants on this basis. Instead, the ICSID Tribunal awarded damages for the Romanian state's wrongdoing consisting in maintaining obligations imposed in relation to EGO 24 after the withdrawal of the scheme and non-transparent behaviour towards the investors'.\n\n98.\n\nThis description of the Award is inaccurate and in any event fails to consider the effects of implementing/executing the Award. It has been already pointed out that the Tribunal considered that the alleged breaches of the BIT all resulted from 'the premature revocation of the incentives or in direct connection with that premature revoca-  tion' (63), and awarded damages for losses resulting directly from the revocation of the incentive scheme. The Tribunal was also already quoted as stating that (64): '[B]y repealing the EGO 24 incentives prior to 1 April 2009, Romania did not act unreasonably or in bad faith (except that [Romania] acted unreasonably by maintaining investors' obligations after terminating the incentives). The Tribunal, however, concludes by majority that Romania violated the Claimants' legitimate expectations that those incentives would be available, in substantially the same form, until 1 April 2009. Romania also failed to act transparently by failing to inform the Claimants in a timely manner that the regime would be terminated prior to its stated date of expiration. As a result, the Tribunal finds that Romania failed to \"ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments\" of the Claimants in the meaning of Article 2(3) of the BIT'.\n\nAward, paragraph 928.\n\nAward, paragraph 872.\n\n99.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, it cannot be maintained, as the claimants do, that the Tribunal found Romania's decision to comply with Union State aid rules by revoking EGO 24 not to have been in breach of the BIT, or that it did not award damages on that basis (65). The Commission notes that in justifying its decision to award compensation for increased prices and the loss of the ability to stockpile, as well as lost profits, the Tribunal referred only to damages incurred by the claimants as a result of the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives (66). Notably, the Tribunal did not refer to, or award additional damages on the basis of, its finding that Romania acted unreasonably in maintaining the investors' obligations under EGO 24 and failed to act transparently.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives violated the claimants' legitimate expectations before it even considered the reasonableness or transparency of Romania's actions (Award, paragraphs 725, 726; reasonableness and transparency were only considered in paragraphs 727 et seq. and 837 et seq., respectively). There is thus no basis for maintaining, as the claimants suggest, that the Tribunal's finding of a breach of the BIT was conditioned on the unreasonableness of keeping in place the investors' obligations under EGO 24 or on the insufficient transparency of Romania's actions.\n\nAward, paragraphs 953, 961, 971, 984, 1 016, 1 020, 1 136.\n\n*Economic advantage (2): damages and State aid*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe presence of an advantage is, contrary to the submission of the claimants, furthermore not precluded by the fact that the payment of the compensation awarded to the complainants by the Tribunal through the implemen-  tation or execution of the Award entails a payment of compensation for damages. The central question in this regard is whether the principles laid down in the CJEU's *Asteris* (67) judgment are applicable to the case at hand. In its judgment in *Asteris*, the CJEU set out that State aid 'is fundamentally different in its legal nature from damages which the competent national authorities may be ordered to pay to individuals in compensation for the damage they have caused to those individuals.' (68) The claimants argue that the present case falls squarely under this case-law, and that any attempt by the Commission to distinguish the *Asteris* case from the one at hand is unconvincing. The Commission disagrees with this position.\n\nJoined Cases 106/87 to 120/87 *Asteris* EU:C:1988:457.\n\nJoined Cases 106/87 to 120/87 *Asteris* EU:C:1988:457, paragraph 23.\n\n101.\n\nThe Commission observes, first, that the *Asteris* case arose out of a very different context than the present case. In the former case, the CJEU rendered a judgment in response to a reference for a preliminary ruling by a Greek court by which the CJEU was asked to pronounce itself on the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member States to entertain claims for damages brought by individuals against national authorities in respect of non-payment of aid under the Union's common agricultural policy. The non-payment of aid was not the result of a broken promise by the Greek authorities to grant that aid, but rather the consequence of the inclusion of technical errors by the Commission in a regulation. The affected undertakings had already brought an action for damages against the Commission before the CJEU, which had rejected it as unfounded. In response to the reference for a preliminary ruling, the CJEU specified in its judgment that since it had previously dismissed the action for damages against the Commission, any action for damages against the Greek state would have to be on different grounds from the action against the Commission it dismissed, that is to say a wrongful act of the Greek authorities themselves. Notably, the CJEU did not state that an award of damages equal to an amount of illegal State aid promised but not paid out would not amount to State aid itself. Thus, it does not follow from the *Asteris* judgment that every award of damages is automatically outside the scope of Union State aid law, as the claimants seem to argue. Rather, in cases of liability based on the wrongful conduct of national authorities, no advantage is granted to an undertaking where such liability merely ensures that the damaged party is given what it is entitled to, just as any other undertaking would be, under the general rules of civil liability in that Member State. Compensation granted under those general rules of civil liability differ from State aid to the extent that they cannot result in the damaged individual being better off after receiving compensation.\n\n102.\n\nSecond, for compensation to fall outside the Union State aid rules under the *Asteris* case-law it must be based on a general rule of compensation (69). In the present case, the compensation has been awarded to the claimants on the basis of an intra-EU BIT which the Commission considers invalid as of Romania's accession to the Union. The Commission has consistently taken the view that intra-EU BITs, such as the BIT upon which the claimants base their claim (70), are contrary to Union law since they are incompatible with provisions of the Union Treaties and should therefore be considered invalid (71). The Commission has repeatedly made this view known to the Member States, including the Member States in question.\n\nSee Commission Decision of 16 June 2004 on Dutch aid in favour of Akzo-Nobel in order to minimise chlorine transports (Case N 304/2003), summary notice in OJ C 81, 2.4.2005, p. 4; see also Commission Decision of 20 December 2006 on Dutch aid for relocation of car dismantling company Steenbergen (Case N 575/05), summary notice in OJ C 80, 13.4.2007, p. 1.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Commission would also consider invalid the intra-EU BITs at the basis of the arbitral proceedings listed in footnote 53 of the application.\n\nSee response of Commissioner De Gucht to Parliamentary oral Question O-000043/2013/rev.1 in which he stated *'The Commission agrees that bilateral and investment treaties (BITS) between EU Member States do not comply with EU law'*, debate of the plenary of 22 May 2013. See, further, Commission Staff Working Document of 3 February 2012 on capital movements and investments in the EU \u2014 Commission Services' Paper on Market Monitoring, SWD(2012)6 final, page 13. See also, Commission Staff Working Document of 15 April 2013 on the free movement of capital in the EU, SWD(2013)146 final, pages 11 and 14; Commission Staff Working Document of 18 March 2014 on the free movement of capital in the EU, SWD(2014)115 final, page 12; and European Commission, Monitoring activities and analysis, Bilateral Investment Treaties between EU Member States (intra-EU BITs) 2012; available at: http://ec.europa.eu/internal\\_market/capital/analysis/monitoring\\_activities\\_and\\_analysis/index\\_en.htm\n\n103.\n\nThird, the Commission notes that the purpose of the Award is to compensate the applicants for the incentives which Romania had promised them under EGO 24 (modified by EGO 75) but had been required to abolish by the Union to complete the negotiation process for its accession to the Union. Thus, in contrast to the *Asteris* case, the reason the applicants claim compensation in this case is because they were denied the incentives Romania promised to grant them in violation of its obligations under Article 64 of the Europe Agreement and Law No 143/1999 as interpreted by Decision No 244/2000 of the Romanian Competition Council not to grant unlawful State aid. However, as Advocate-General Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer has explained (72), an award of damages equal to the sum of the amounts of aid that were envisaged to be granted would constitute an indirect grant of State aid found to be illegal and incompatible with the internal market. Following that line, the General Court has considered indemnification clauses for the recovery of State aid to constitute State aid (73). Moreover, in the judgment in *Lucchini*, the CJEU held that a national court was prevented from applying national law where the application of that law would have the effect to 'frustrate the application of Community law in so far as it would make it impossible to recover State aid that was granted in breach of Community law' (74).\n\nOpinion of 28 April 2005 in Joined Cases C-346/03 and C-529/03 *Atzori* ECLI:EU:C:2005:256, paragraph 198.\n\nCase T-384/08 *Elliniki Nafpigokataskevastiki AE Chartofylakeiou* v *Commission* EU:T:2011:650, and Case T-565/08 *Corsica Ferries* v *Commission* EU:T:2012:415, paragraphs 23, 114 and 120 to 131. See also, by analogy, Case C-111/10 *Commission* v *Council* EU:C:2013:785, paragraph 44.\n\nCase C-119/05 *Lucchini* EU:C:2007:434, paragraph 59.\n\n104.\n\nThe attempts by the claimants to distinguish those cases from the present case are unconvincing. What matters is not that the precise facts underlying those cases differ from those of the present case, but the principle informing those cases, which is that national law, including liability arrangements under national law, cannot be applied where doing so would frustrate the application of Union State aid law and thus ultimately result in the grant of illegal State aid. In this light, the *Asteris* case does not exempt damages awarded as compensation for the recovery of illegal State aid or the failure to receive illegal State aid. The Commission considers that same principle to apply where the liability flows from an international law treaty concluded between two Member States (such as an intra-EU BIT) the application of which gives rise to the grant of State aid. Where giving effect to an intra-EU treaty by a Member State would frustrate the application of Union law, that Member State must uphold Union law since Union primary law, such as Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty, takes precedence over that Member State's international obligations.\n\n105.\n\nThe claimants' contention that there has never been a valid formal decision establishing that EGO 24 constitutes illegal State aid nor that those incentives were incompatible with the internal market is irrelevant in this respect, since it is the implementation/execution of the Award and not the investment incentives promised under EGO 24 which constitute the contested measure and form the basis of the present Decision. Indeed, considering EGO 24 was abolished on 22 February 2005 and no aid was disbursed under that legislation after that date, neither the Romanian Competition Council nor the Commission could conclude in a formal decision that EGO 24 gave rise to incompatible State aid in the period 22 February 2005 to 1 April 2009, which is the period for the which the Award grants compensation to the claimants.\n\n106.\n\nFor that very reason, there is also no need for the Commission to adopt a formal decision finding the existence of State aid in cases where a national court or an arbitral tribunal awards compensation against a Member State for the withdrawal of an aid measure. Article 107(1) of the Treaty contains a general prohibition on the grant of State aid 'in any form whatsoever'. The precise form of the measure is thus irrelevant in establishing whether it confers an economic advantage on the undertaking (75). Thus, if the State aid is granted through the implementation or execution of a judgment or an award, which the Commission considers to be the case in relation to the Award, it is in relation to that implementation or execution that the Commission must show that the cumulative conditions of Article 107(1) of the Treaty are fulfilled and that that aid is incompatible with the internal market.\n\nCase C-280/00 *Altmark Trans* EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 84.\n\n107.\n\nIn any event, the Commission recalls that the Romanian Competition Council, several Union Common Positions and the Romanian Government upon repealing EGO 24 all concluded that EGO 24 gave rise to unlawful State aid under the Europe Agreement, Decision No 4/2000 of the EU-Romania Association Council, Law No 143/99 and the *acquis communautaire*. Moreover, Decision No 244/2000 of the Romanian Competition Council has never been challenged nor annulled, but only ignored by the Romanian legislator through the adoption of EGO 75 contrary to the provisions of Law No 143/1999 on State aid and thus in violation of its obligations under the European Agreement and Decision No 4/2000 of the EU-Romania Association Council. The Union then insisted Romania comply with that decision, its obligations under Europe Agreement and the *acquis communautaire* in the context of the accession negotiations, which the latter did by repealing EGO 24.\n\n108.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Commission concludes that payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal through the implementation or execution of the Award constitutes an economic advantage in favour of the claimants that they would not have obtained under normal market conditions.\n\n*Selectivity*\n-------------\n\n109.\n\nNot all measures which grant an undertaking an economic advantage constitute State aid, but only those which confer an economic advantage in a selective manner upon certain undertakings or categories of undertakings or to certain economic sectors.\n\n110.\n\nThe Award awards compensation only to the claimants. Therefore by paying that compensation, either through the implementation or execution of the Award, Romania grants an advantage only to the claimants. The measure is thus selective.\n\n111.\n\nMoreover, as follows from the *Asteris* judgment, compensation for damages will not selectively benefit an indi-  vidual undertaking only insofar as that compensation follows from the application of a general rule of law for government liability which every individual can invoke, so that it excludes that any compensation granted confers a selective benefit on certain groups in society. The contested measure, which follows from the application of the provisions of the BIT, does not comply with this requirement for all of the reasons in the present case.\n\n112.\n\nFirst, the BIT only confers this right of compensation to a certain group of investors, that is, to investors of the two Member States covered by the intra-EU BIT, i.e. Sweden and Romania. Accordingly, not every similarly situated Union investor could rely on that BIT to claim damages corresponding to the incentives promised under the abolished EGO 24 aid scheme, but only investors of a certain nationality. Thus, to the extent that paying compensation awarded to an investor pursuant to a BIT amounts to granting an advantage, the advantage is selective. As regards the claimants' contention that the general character of the benefits provided by BITs has previously been recognised by the Commission (see recital 66), the statement cited by the claimants in support of that claim is not in fact a Commission statement at all, but an excerpt from a study prepared by an external contractor for the Policy Department of the European Parliament's Directorate-General for External Policies. Secondly, in order to discard any doubts about the ownership of the opinions expressed in this study, it contains a disclaimer specifying that the author bears the sole responsibility for them and that they do not reflect the official position of the European Parliament. The statement made in this report cannot be imputed to the Commission and is irrelevant for the case at hand.\n\n113.\n\nSecond, the contested measure compensates the applicants for the repeal of investment incentives which them-  selves are selective in nature. Indeed, the incentives offered under EGO 24 were only available to undertakings investing in certain regions. Accordingly, the compensation awarded to the complainants by the Tribunal should in themselves be considered selective since they correspond to the advantages promised under the abolished EGO 24.\n\n114.\n\nIn any event, the Commission considers the BIT upon which the Tribunal awarded compensation to the claimants to have been rendered invalid upon Romania's accession to the Union, so that it cannot be considered to form the basis for a general rule of law for government liability which every investor can rely upon.\n\n115.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, the Commission concludes that the implementation or execution of the Award grants the claimants a selective advantage.\n\n*State resources*\n-----------------\n\n116.\n\nOnly advantages granted directly or indirectly through state resources can constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty. In the present case, Romania has already partially implemented the Award by setting it off part of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal against taxes owed by one of the claimants to the Romanian State. The court-appointed executor has furthermore seized funds from state accounts to satisfy the claimants' outstanding claims under the Award. Direct payments from the state budget, the foregoing of state income by writing off taxes owed, or the transfer of other state assets (such as shares in other undertakings or the transfer of seized assets) to the claimants, whether made voluntarily or through court-ordered execution, are all to be regarded as measures financed through state resources.\n\n*Imputability*\n--------------\n\n117.\n\nFor a selective advantage to constitute aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty, it must, inter alia, be imputable to the state (76). In the present case, the claimants maintain that since the implementation of the Award is 'an automatic and involuntary consequence of Romania's obligations under the ICSID Convention, it is clearly not imputable to the State, and thus cannot constitute State aid'. The main thrust of the claimants' argument is that since Romania is under an international law obligation to implement the Award, doing so is not imputable to the State. The Commission disagrees with this line of reasoning and considers the measure imputable to Romania for the following reasons.\n\nCase T-351/02 *Deutsche Bahn AG v Commission* EU:T:2006:104, paragraph 101.\n\n118.\n\nThe Commission notes at the outset that the voluntary agreement of Romania to enter into the BIT, in particular Article 7 thereof, created the conditions for the selective advantage resulting from the Award as explained in recitals 110 et seq.\n\n119.\n\nMoreover, if Romania voluntarily implements the Award by paying out the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal, there is no question that that action is imputable to the Romanian state. That is, in any event, the case for the portion of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Award which Romania offset against taxes owed by one of the claimants, namely S.C. European Food SA, to the Romanian authorities. That is also the case when Romania decided to voluntarily pay out the outstanding compensation awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n120.\n\nFinally, every act of Romania's state organs is imputable to Romania. Those state organs include the Member State's government and other public authorities. Notably, also domestic courts of a state and court-appointed executors and bailiffs are to be considered organs of that state and are thus bound under Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union by their duty of sincere cooperation vis-\u00e0-vis the Union. Accordingly, the actions of domestic courts and court-appointed executors and bailiffs are imputable to the Romanian state, so that if Romania is compelled to compensate the claimants under the Award by the action of its courts or court-appointed executors and bailiffs, that action is also imputable to the Romanian state. Union law recognises only a narrow exemption from this general principle of imputability: a measure is not imputable to a Member State if that Member State is under an obligation under Union law to implement that measure without any discretion. In that case, the measure stems from an act of the Union legislature and is not imputable to the State. It is, however, undisputed that Romania is not obliged by Union law to implement the Award. Any decision to implement or execute the Award, whether taken by the Romanian government or Romania's domestic courts, is thus imputable to the Romanian State\n\n121.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission concludes that the measure is imputable to Romania.\n\n*Distortion of competition and effect on trade*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nA measure granted by the state is considered to distort or threaten to distort competition when it is liable to improve the competitive position of the recipient compared to other undertakings with which it competes (77). For all practical purposes, a distortion of competition within the meaning of Article 107 of the Treaty is thus assumed as soon as the state grants a financial advantage to an undertaking in a liberalised sector where there is, or could be, competition. An advantage granted to an undertaking that distorts competition will normally also be liable to affect trade between Member States. Trade between Member States is affected where a measure strengthens the competitive position of the beneficiary undertaking as compared with other undertakings competing in intra-Community trade (78).\n\nCase 730/79 *Phillip Morris* EU:C:1980:209, paragraph 11. Joined Cases T-298/97, T-312/97 etc. *Alzetta* EU:T:2000:151, paragraph 80.\n\nCase T-288/97 *Friulia Venezia Giulia* EU:T:2001:115, paragraph 41.\n\n123.\n\nThe Commission already concluded (see recitals 81 et seq.) that the claimants jointly form a single economic unit, which in turn constitute the relevant undertaking for the purpose of the application of Union State aid rules. That undertaking is active on a liberalised market, competing with other undertakings. The Commission has also concluded that payment of compensation to the claimants, whether by implementing or executing the Award, would improve their competitive position as compared to other undertakings with which they compete, who have not received similar compensation for the withdrawal of unlawful State aid. The compensation provided for by the Award is based on an amount corresponding to the customs duties charged on raw materials, lost profits and interest on the total sum of damages awarded. The costs of raw materials, as inputs for final products, constitute ordinary operating expenses of undertakings. Relieving the applicants of a part of their ordinary operating expenses grants them a distinct competitive advantage, as does compensating the applicants for lost profits and the payment of interest. The claimants are engaged in manufacturing food products, milling products, and plastic packaging. A liberalised market exists for all those products, so that any advantage granted to the claimants is liable to distort competition. Considering that the products primarily produced by the claimants can and indeed are widely traded between Member States, it is clear that any advantage granted to the claimants is also liable to affect trade between Member States.\n\n124.\n\nThe Commission notes that the claimants' arguments denying a distortion of competition merely repeat the assertions that the Micula brothers cannot be considered as undertakings and that the implementation of the Award would not grant the claimants any advantage. Both assertions were already extensively addressed above (see recitals 81 et seq. and 92 et seq.) and require no further comments.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n125.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Commission considers that the payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal amounts to State aid for the purposes of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.\n\n7.2. **The application of the State aid rules does not affect rights and obligations protected by Article 351 of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nArticle 351 of the Treaty provides that '[t]he rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded [...] for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties'. In the present case, the rights and obligations on which the claimants rely are those arising from the BIT.\n\n127.\n\nIt is clear from the wording of Article 351 of the Treaty that it does not apply in the present case, since the BIT is a treaty concluded between two Member States of the Union, Sweden and Romania, and not a treaty 'between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other'. Accordingly, the application of State aid law in the present case does not affect rights and obligation protected under Article 351 of the Treaty.\n\n128.\n\nIn this context, the Commission recalls that different rules apply under Union law to intra-EU BITs, on the one hand, and BITs concluded between a Member State of the Union and a third country, on the other. In the case of intra-EU BITs, the Commission takes the view that such agreements are contrary to Union law, incompatible with provisions of the Union Treaties and should therefore be considered invalid. By contrast, BITs concluded between a Member State of the Union and a third country are governed by Regulation (EU) No 1219/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (79) which establishes transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries until those agreements are progressively replaced by agreements of the Union relating to the same subject matter, in light of the Union's exclusive competence with respect to the common commercial policy under which foreign direct investment falls (80).\n\nRegulation (EU) No 1219/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries (OJ L 351, 20.12.2012, p. 40).\n\nArticle 3(1)(e) of the Treaty.\n\n129.\n\nRomania is also a party to the multilateral ICSID Convention, to which it has acceded prior to its accession to the Union. However, because no third country Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention is party to the BIT involved in the present proceedings, Article 351 is not relevant for this case.\n\n7.3. **New aid**\n----------------\n\n130.\n\nArticle 107(1) of the Treaty provides that State aid is, in principle, incompatible with the internal market. Unless an aid measure is declared to be compatible with the internal market by the Commission, the Member States are prohibited from putting State aid measures into effect. Under Article 108(3) of the Treaty, a Member State must notify any plans to alter or grant aid to the Commission and shall not put its proposed measure into effect until the Commission has taken a final decision on that measure's compatibility with the internal market.\n\n131.\n\nThe obligation not to put into effect any aid measure without a final decision from the Commission on the compatibility of that aid measure only applies, of course, to aid measures put into effect after the entry into force of the Treaty for the Member State concerned. For Romania, the Treaty entered into force on 1 January 2007.\n\n132.\n\nThe claimants dispute that the implementation or execution of the Award would constitute 'new aid' within the meaning of Article 1(c) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. They maintain that even if the Commission's assessment is correct *quod non* and the implementation or execution of the Award would constitute aid, the date of the grant of that aid would be the initial granting of benefits under EGO 24 to the claimants, which took place in 2000 and 2002 and thus before Romania's accession to the Union. According to the claimants, the very latest point in time which could be considered the granting date is the entry into force of the BIT, on which the Award is based, and which entered into force in 2003.\n\n133.\n\nThe Commission disagrees with the claimants and considers that payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal, whether through the implementation or execution of the Award, amounts to new aid and is thus subject to the full State aid control mechanism set out in Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty. According to the case-law of the CJEU, aid must be considered to be granted at the time that an unconditional right to receive it is conferred on the beneficiary under the applicable national rules (81). Neither the adoption of EGO 24 on 2 October 1998, nor the designation of **S** tei-Nucet, Bihor county, as a disfavoured region for 10 years (effective on 1 April 1999), nor the grant of permanent investor certificates to S.C. European Food SA (on 1 June 2000) and S.C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack (on 17 May 2002) conferred on the claimants an unconditional right to obtain the Raw Material Facility until 1 April 2009. Rather, a right to that Facility was only obtained by a company eligible for aid under the scheme set up by EGO 24:\n\n\u2014 under the initial scheme set up by EGO 24: when the regional development agency approved the company's production sales documents attesting that an import of raw materials intended for integration into internal production had taken place, giving right to a reimbursement of customs duties paid (82), and\n\n\u2014 after the Raw Material Facility of EGO 24 was transformed into an exemption from customs duties under EGO 75: when a company eligible for aid under that scheme imported raw materials for integration into internal production and requested the exemption from the border control authorities on the basis of duly justified documents.\n\nCase C-129/12 *Magdeburger M\u00fchlenwerke* EU:C:2013:200, paragraph 40.\n\nAn English-language translation of the initial provision providing for the Raw Materials Facility (which is the investment incentive the revocation of which led to damages being awarded to the applicants under the Award) can be found at paragraph 148 of the Award. According to that translation, Article 6(1)(b) provides that 'Privately held companies, Romanian legal entities, as well as small or family business, authorised pursuant to the Decree-Law No 54/1990 concerning the organisation and operation of free initiativebased economic activities that are headquartered and conduct business within the disadvantaged region, will be granted the following advantages for their new investments in the these regions: [...] refunds of customs duties on raw materials, spare parts and/or components necessary of achieving the investor's own production in that region. The refunds will be made based on the approval by the regional development agencies of the companies' production sales documents. The funds necessary for the refund of the customs duties will be provided to the Agency for Regional Development from the Regional development Fund. In case of unprivileged regions belonging to two or more administrative-territorial units, the funds necessary for the refund of the customs duties will be provided by the National Agency for Regional Development from the National Development Fund [the \"**Raw Materials Incentive**\" or \"**Raw Materials Facility**\"]'.\n\n134.\n\nSince the scheme set up by EGO 24, as modified by EGO 75, was revoked on 22 February 2005, no right to aid could be obtained by any company after that date under the national regulatory framework by importing raw materials into Romania for integration into internal production. Thus, the applicants' claim for compensation from the Romanian state derives only from the Award in conjunction with Romanian domestic law giving it legal effect in Romania's domestic legal order. As the Award was rendered and risks being implemented or executed after Romania acceded to the Union, the unconditional right under Romanian domestic law to receive the compensation awarded by the Tribunal, arising from the ratification of the ISCID Convention integrating it in Romania's domestic legal order and thus giving the Award legal effect in Romania's domestic legal, was conferred on the claimants only after Romania's accession to the Union.\n\n135.\n\nIt is also important to note in this regard that the Award grants to the claimants compensation in an amount corresponding to the advantages foreseen under the abolished Raw Materials Facility of the EGO 24 scheme from the moment that that legislation was repealed (22 February 2005) until its alleged scheduled expiry (1 April 2009). That period comprises a little over 49 months, during the majority of which (27 months) Romania was a full member of the Union directly subjected to the State aid discipline laid down in the Treaty. In addition, the Award grants to the claimants compensation for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar in 2009, assuming that the connected losses were incurred between 31 March 2009 and 1 July 2010. These alleged losses were thus incurred entirely after Romania had acceded to the Union in 2007. Finally, the Tribunal awarded compensation for lost profits, taking into account claimed losses incurred between 1 January 2005 and 31 August 2011. That period comprises 80 months, during the vast majority of which (56 months) Romania was a full member of the Union directly subjected to the State aid discipline laid down in the Treaty.\n\n136.\n\nFinally, the EGO 24 incentive scheme is not mentioned in Annex V, chapter 2, n.1 of the Act of Accession of Romania to the Union which exhaustively lists the State aid measures which would be considered existing aid upon Romania's accession to the Union (83) (84).\n\nThe three categories of existing aid mentioned in the Act of Accession are:  \n\u2014 aid measures put into effect before 10 December 1994,  \n\u2014 aid measures listed in the Appendix to this Annex,  \n\u2014 aid measures which prior to the date of accession were assessed by the State aid monitoring authority of the new Member State and found to be compatible with the *acquis*, and to which the Commission did not raise an objection on the ground of serious doubts as to the compatibility of the measure with the common market, pursuant to the procedure set out in paragraph 2.  \nAny decision to execute the Award is not covered by any of these three categories. Even if it were considered that implementation of the Award merely reinstates the claimants' rights pursuant to EGO 24 as if the relevant incentives thereunder had not been repealed before their scheduled expiration, that retroactive reinstatement would still need to be considered as 'new aid' as of the accession of Romania to the Union.\n\nSee also Joint Cases T-80/06 and T-182/09 *Budapesti Erom\u00fc* EU:T:2012:65, paragraph 54.\n\n137.\n\nThe fact that neither the Act of Accession nor the Treaty were applicable to Romania at the time when Romania allegedly breached its obligations under the BIT by revoking the aid scheme established by EGO 24 or when the claimants brought their claims under the BIT before the Tribunal is irrelevant. At neither point did the claimants obtain an unconditional right to the payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal, which is the measure under consideration. It is only when the Tribunal established that there was a breach of Article 2(3) of the BIT by rendering the Award on 11 December 2013, in conjunction with Romanian domestic law giving legal effect in Romania's domestic legal order to the Award, that the claimants received an unconditional right to that compen-  sation which they could enforce against Romania. That date was after Romania's accession to the European Union.\n\n138.\n\nThe claimants' case therefore is not comparable to the Commission's decision in Case N 380/04 to which they refer. Case N 380/04 concerned a contract concluded between the company Latvijas G **a** ze ('LG') and Latvia in 1997. When a dispute arose between LG and Latvia over the latter's obligations under the contract, commercial arbitration proceedings were initiated in Stockholm under Uncitral rules. The arbitration tribunal established for those proceedings decided, on 19 June 2003, that Latvia owed LG compensation for the period 10 January 2001 until 10 March 2003. Latvia did not comply with the arbitral award before it acceded to the Union on 1 May 2004 and notified the envisaged implementation of that award to the Commission after accession. In its decision, the Commission observed that the compensation obligation arose on the basis of the 1997 contract, that the compensation awarded by the arbitration tribunal related in its entirety to a period before Latvia's accession, and that the arbitral award itself was issued before Latvia's accession to the Union. On this basis, the Commission concluded that 'the payment [...] of the damages awarded by the Tribunal [...] constitute a mere act of imple  mentation of a measure that crystallised entirely before accession' and that implementing the 2003 arbitral award could not be regarded as constituting 'new aid'. Furthermore, the Commission's decision in Case N 380/04 itself points out that it did not prejudge the analysis of possible future payments under the contract that related to periods after accession, thus narrowly limiting the approach chosen to the specific facts notified by Latvia.\n\n139.\n\nBy contrast, in the present case the compensation obligation arises from the Award, which was rendered in 2013, the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal relates for the most part to the period after Romania acceded to the Union and the Award itself was issued almost seven years after Romania acceded to the Union. Finally, the decision in Case N 380/04 differs most starkly to the present case in that there was no indication in the former case that by implementing or executing the 2003 arbitral award LG would obtain unlawful State aid which Latvia had promised to grant contrary to its State aid obligations as a candidate country acceding to the Union.\n\n140.\n\nThe Commission therefore finds that the payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants constitutes new aid and that that measure can only be put into effect if and after the Commission has authorised it under the State aid rules.\n\n7.4. **Illegality under Article 108(3) of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe compensation awarded by the Tribunal has already been partially paid out by Romania to the claimants through the offsetting of certain tax debts owed by one of the claimants, S.C. European Food SA, to the Romanian state. Since that partial implementation of the Award was not notified to the Commission by Romania, the measure has unlawfully been put into effect in violation of Article 108(3) of the Treaty. Any further payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal, whether by implementation or execution of the Award, that the Commission is either unaware of or that might occur after the adoption of this Decision would, for the same reasons, also constitute a violation of Romania's obligation to comply with Article 108(3) of the Treaty.\n\n7.5. **Compatibility with the internal market**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nAt the outset, the Commission recalls that when assessing the compatibility of a measure with the internal market under Articles 107(2) and 107(3) of the Treaty, the burden of proof is the principal responsibility of the Member State (85). In this context, the Commission also recalls that a State aid measure cannot be declared compatible with the internal market, if it entails a non-severable violation of other specific provisions of the Treaty (86). At present, Romania has presented no arguments that could justify the measure under Articles 107(2) and 107(3) of the Treaty. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, the Commission considers it appropriate to undertake a compatibility assessment of its own motion.\n\nCase T-68/03 *Olympiaki Aeroporia Ypiresies AE* v *Commission* EU:T:2007:253, paragraph 34.\n\nCase C-225/91 *Matra* v *Commission* EU:C:1993:239, paragraph 41.\n\n143.\n\nThe claimants contend that the measure constitutes compatible regional aid. On the basis of Article 107(3)(a) and 107(3)(c) of the Treaty, the Commission may consider compatible with the internal market State aid to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the Union. The conditions under which aid to promote regional development can be considered compatible with the internal market are set out in the Guidelines on regional State aid for 2014-2020 ('RAG 2014'). Recital 188 of those Guidelines explains that they apply for assessing the compatibility of all regional aid intended to be awarded after 30 June 2014. This means that regional aid awarded unlawfully or regional aid intended to be awarded before 1 July 2014 are to be assessed in accordance with the Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013 (87) ('RAG 2007').\n\nGuidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013 (OJ C 54, 4.3.2006, p. 13).\n\n144.\n\nAs explained in recital 134, an unconditional right to the aid was granted to the claimants when the Award was issued on 11 December 2013, in conjunction with Romanian domestic law giving legal effect in Romania's domestic legal order to the Award, that is, before the entry into force of the RAG 2014. Therefore, the payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants should be assessed under the RAG 2007.\n\n145.\n\nIn those guidelines, the Commission sets out that regional aid aimed at reducing the current expenses of an undertaking constitutes operating aid and will not be regarded as compatible with the internal market, unless it is awarded in exceptional circumstances to tackle specific handicaps faced by undertakings in disadvantaged regions falling within the scope of Article 107(3)(a) of the of the Treaty (88).\n\nRAG 2007, point 76.\n\n146.\n\nIn the present case, the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal refers to the losses directly linked to the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives and are aimed at placing the beneficiary in the position in which it would 'in all probability' have found itself in had the EGO 24 incentives had not been revoked. In effect, the implementation of the award re-establishes the situation in which the claimants would have, in all likelihood, found themselves if EGO 24 had never been repealed by Romania. As the advantages granted under EGO 24 were connected to the recurrent costs of the claimants and were not linked to an initial investment, those advantages constituted operating aid. Therefore, placing the beneficiary in the position in which it would have been if the EGO 24 incentives had not been revoked and thus compensating the losses linked to this revocation constitutes operating aid. As explained in recitals 92 et seq., payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal in reality retroactively reduces the operating expenses incurred by them pursuing their economic activity under normal market conditions.\n\n147.\n\nAccording to points 76, 77 and 79 of the RAG 2007, operating aid is normally prohibited, and can be granted only exceptionally in Article 107(3)(a) regions provided that:\n\n\u2014 it is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development (targeted),\n\n\u2014 its nature and its level is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate,\n\n\u2014 it is temporary and reduced over time, and should be phased out when the regions concerned achieve real convergence with the wealthier areas of the EU,\n\n\u2014 in principle it is granted in respect of a predefined set of eligible expenditures or costs and limited to a certain proportion of those costs,\n\n\u2014 the Member State has committed itself to respect detailed reporting rules, as laid down in point 83 of the RAG 2007.\n\n148.\n\nThe economic activities benefitting from the implementation of the Award are located in an area falling within the scope of Article 107(3)(a) of the of the Treaty, as established by the Commission in the decision of the regional aid map for Romania for 2007-2013 (89) and for 2014-2020 (90).\n\nCommission Decision N 2/07, summary notice in OJ C 73, 30.3.2007, p. 15.\n\nCommission Decision SA 38364, summary notice in OJ C 233, 18.7.2014, p. 1.\n\n149.\n\nHowever, the Commission fails to see how the payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants is justified in terms of its contribution to the regional development of the areas concerned. The operating aid resulting from that payment is not aimed at contributing to the common equity objective as required under Article 107(3)(a) of the Treaty, but merely at compensating the beneficiary for the losses incurred from the revocation of EGO 24 before its envisaged expiry date. This results in free money for the claimants without any positive impact on the development of the region.\n\n150.\n\nIt is not sufficient that the economic activity is located in 'an area' to assume that the measure is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate, since it must first be demonstrated what these handicaps are and, second, how they create an obstacle to the development of the region concerned. In the absence of any proof, the Commission could not identify the specific handicaps the aid measures would seek to alleviate.\n\n151.\n\nThe payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal is temporary in nature, as it has no effects after the implementation or execution of the Award is completed. However, it is not limited to a certain portion of predefined costs, since that compensation is aimed at ensuring that all losses incurred by the claimants are covered.\n\n152.\n\nIn view of the above, the Commission considers that the payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal does not comply with the RAG 2007 and can therefore not be declared compatible with the internal market. As no other basis of compatibility is otherwise applicable, the Commission considers that the compatibility of the aid measure has not been established.\n\n7.6. **Conclusion on the assessment of the aid measure**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe foregoing analysis indicates that the payment of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants amounts to the granting of incompatible new aid which is incompatible with the Treaty. The Commission regrets that Romania has already partially paid out that compensation by offsetting tax debts owed by one of the claimants, S.C. European Food SA, to the Romanian state against part of that compensation, as well as by the action taken by the court-appointed executor.\n\n**8. RECOVERY**\n---------------\n\n154.\n\nIn accordance with the Treaty and the CJEU's established case-law, the Commission is competent to decide that the Member State concerned must abolish or alter aid when it has found that it is incompatible with the internal market (91). The Court has also consistently held that the obligation on a Member State to abolish aid regarded by the Commission as being incompatible with the internal market is designed to re-establish the previously existing situation (92). In this context, the Court has stated that that objective is attained once the recipient has repaid the amounts granted by way of unlawful aid, thus forfeiting the advantage which it had enjoyed over its competitors on the market, and the situation prior to the payment of the aid is restored (93). Following that case-law, Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 provides that 'where negative decisions are taken in respect of unlawful aid, the Commission shall decide that the Member State concerned shall take all necessary measures to recover the aid from the beneficiary [...].'\n\nCase C-70/72 *Commission* v *Germany* EU:C:1973:87, paragraph 13.\n\nJoined cases C-278/92, C-279/92 and C-280/92 *Spain* v *Commission* EU:C:1994:325, paragraph 75.\n\nCase C-75/97 *Belgium* v *Commission* EU:C:1999:311, paragraphs 64-65.\n\n155.\n\nThe claimants contend that they had a legitimate expectation that the incentives granted under EGO 24 were lawful and that they could benefit from those incentives until their scheduled expiry on 1 April 2009. The Commission observes, in that regard, that Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 further specifies that '[t]he Commission shall not require recovery of the aid if this would be contrary to a general principle of [Union] law.' The principle of the protection of legitimate expectations has been recognised by the CJEU to constitute such a general principle of Union law. The Commission does not consider, however, that the claimants can claim such a legitimate expectation.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to the case-law of the CJEU, save in exceptional circumstances, undertakings to which an aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in Article 108(3) of the Treaty. The CJEU, in its more recent case-law, has declared that in the absence of sufficiently precise assurances arising from a positive action taken by the Commission, which has the exclusive competence to authorise the grant of State aid by the Member States of the Union, that lead the beneficiary to believe that the measure does not constitute State aid, no exceptional circum-  stances can warrant the application of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations to prevent recovery if that aid measure was not notified to the Commission (94). Indeed, it is long-standing case-law that the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations cannot be relied upon against a precise provision of Union law and that the conduct of a national authority responsible for applying Union law, which acts in breach of that law, cannot give rise to legitimate expectations on the part of an economic operator that he will benefit from treatment which is contrary to that law (95). A diligent economic operator must be assumed to be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed (96).\n\nCase C-148/04 *Unicredito Italiano* EU:C:2005:774, paragraphs 104 to 111.\n\nJudgment in Case C-217/06 *Commission* v *Italy* EU:C:2007:580, point 23 and the case-law cited.\n\nCase C-5/89 *Commission* v *Germany* EU:C:1990:320, paragraph 14.\n\n157.\n\nThe Commission notes that, as regards the compensation awarded by the Tribunal to the claimants, it should have been clear without any doubt to the claimants even before that aid was granted to them through the adoption of the Award, in conjunction with Romanian domestic law giving legal effect in Romania's domestic legal order to the Award, that the Commission considered payment of that compensation to give rise to unlawful and incom-  patible State aid. That position was expressly communicated to the Tribunal on 20 July 2009 and communicated to the claimants.\n\n158.\n\nAs regards the claimants' claim that they had a legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 were lawful and would remain in place until 1 April 2009, the Commission recalls, as a preliminary matter, that it is the payment of compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal and not EGO 24 that form the basis for this Decision. Nevertheless, the Commission adds, for the sake of completeness, that the claimants cannot justifiably claim a legitimate expectation as to the validity and continued existence of that scheme until 1 April 2009. As regards that scheme, it was not the Commission, but the Romanian Competition Council, which, by virtue of Decision No 4/2000 of the EU-Romania Association Council and Romanian Law No 143/1999 on State aid, was responsible for the monitoring and authorisation of the grant of State aid prior to Romania's accession to the Union. The Commission notes in that regard that EGO 24 was notified to the Romanian Competition Council in light of the modifications envisaged by EGO 75 and that the Romanian Competition Council, by its Decision No 244/2000 of 15 May 2000, found those incentives to constitute incompatible State aid. It was after the adoption of that decision, on 1 June 2000, that S.C. European Food SA obtained its PIC, which made it eligible to obtain State aid under the scheme set up by EGO 24 as explained in recital 133. However, that does not mean the aid was granted on that date, as explained in recital 134.\n\n159.\n\nIt follows from that at the time S.C. European Food SA was granted the unlawful State aid provided by EGO 24, which is in any event after 1 June 2000, it must have been fully aware of the Romanian Competition Council's decision of 15 May 2000 declaring the EGO 24 incentives to be incompatible State aid. Moreover, it must also have been aware of the Europe Agreement, which entered into force on 1 January 1995, and Romanian Law No 143/1999 on State aid, which entered into force on 1 January 2000, both of which prohibited Romania from granting State aid and conferred the power on the Romanian Competition Council to authorise the grant of new State aid. Absent such an authorisation from the Competition Council and in line with the case-law of the CJEU, which applied by virtue of the Article 64 of the 1995 Europe Agreement, Article 1 of the Implementing Rules to Decision No 4/2000 of the EU-Romanian Association Council and the *acquis communautaire*, S.C. European Food SA could never have entertained a legitimate expectation that the incentives granted under EGO 24 constituted compatible State aid, regardless of the subsequent actions of the Romanian Government after Decision No 244/2000 was adopted. The same reasoning obviously applies to Multipack and Starmill, which only obtained their PICs on 17 May 2002, two years after Decision No 244/2000 was adopted. Thus, the claimants cannot even validly claim a legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 scheme constituted lawful State aid, which the Commission considers irrelevant for the purposes of the present Decision.\n\n160.\n\nTherefore, any payment of the compensation awarded to the claimants by the Tribunal must be recovered by Romania since that payment constitutes unlawful and incompatible State aid. As the five claimants, together with the other relevant EFDG companies constitute a single economic unit (see recital 91), the five claimants and the other relevant EFDG companies shall be jointly liable to repay the State aid received by any one of them to the Romanian state. According to Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 the aid to be recovered pursuant to a recovery decision shall include interest at an appropriate rate fixed by the Commission. Interest shall be payable from the date on which the unlawful aid was at the disposal of the beneficiary until the date of its recovery. Article 14(3) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 provides that recovery shall be effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures under the national law of the Member State concerned, provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of the Commission's decision. To this effect and in the event of a procedure before national courts, the Member States concerned shall take all necessary steps which are available in their respective legal systems, including provisional measures, without prejudice to Union law.\n\n161.\n\nThe Commission observes in this respect that Romania has already offset the amount of RON 337 492 864 (ca. EUR 76 million (97)) against tax debts owed by one of the claimants, S.C. European Food SA. The Commission further observes that on 5 January 2015 the court-appointed executor seized RON 36 484 232 (ca. EUR 8,1 mil-  lion (98)) from Romania's Ministry of Finance and subsequently transferred RON 34 004 232 (ca. EUR 7,56 million) in equal parts to three of the five claimants, and kept the remainder as compensation for execution costs. Between 5 February and 25 February 2015, the court-appointed executor seized a further RON 9 197 482 (ca. EUR 2 million) (99) from the bank accounts of the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the Commission takes note of the fact that the Romanian authorities have voluntarily transferred RON 472 788 675 (ca. EUR 106,5 million (100)) (including the costs of court appointed executor of RON 6 028 608) into a blocked account in the name of the five claimants. Those sums, as well as any further payments to the claimants in fulfilment of the Award which have taken or will take place, must be recovered by Romania. Accordingly, the Commission,\n\nSee footnote 7.\n\nSee footnote 38.\n\nSee footnote 38.\n\nSee footnote 40.\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n--------------------------\n\n*Article 1*\n\nThe payment of the compensation awarded by the arbitral tribunal established under the auspices of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) by award of 11 December 2013 in Case No ARB/05/20 *Micula a.o.* v *Romania* (101) to the single economic unit comprising Viorel Micula, Ioan Micula, S.C.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT, REGISTRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 9, 2014, Romania (\"Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") an application requesting the annulment of the Award rendered on December 11, 2013 (\"Award\") in the case (\"Original Proceeding\") between Mr. Ioan Micula, Mr. Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. (\"Individual Claimants\" for the first two, \"Corporate Claimants\" for the latter three, and \"Respondents on Annulment\" or \"Claimants\" for all Claimants combined) and Romania. The Application on Annulment (\"Application\") was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), and was accompanied by five exhibits (RA-1 to RA-5). Romania sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nRomania also requested a stay of enforcement of the Award (\"Stay Request\") under Rule 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, concerning the amount of RON 376,433,229 and interest in favor of the Claimants in the Original Proceeding.\n\n3.\n\nOn April 18, 2014, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee\") pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of May 12, 2014, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that a Committee had been constituted - composed of Dr. Claus von Wobeser (Mexican) as President, and Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades (Spanish) and Judge Abdulqawi A. Yusuf (Somali) as Members - and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Martina Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn May 16, 2014, the Centre was notified that Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants had retained new counsel and was provided with powers of attorney for the law firm of Mannheimer Swartling, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n**2. FIRST SESSION, PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1 AND PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS BASED ON MANIFEST LACK OF LEGAL MERIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn June 2, 2014, the ICSID Secretariat circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1, and invited the Parties to consult and revert to the Committee with their joint proposals and/or any separate proposals on items on which they were unable to reach agreement.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 11, 2014, the Respondents on Annulment filed preliminary objections pursuant to the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(5) and 53 (\"Preliminary Objections\"), requesting the dismissal of the Application for manifest lack of legal merit. The Preliminary Objections were accompanied by 11 factual exhibits (CA-10 to CA-20) and 38 legal authorities (CAL-17 to CAL-54).\n\n8.\n\nOn June 13, 2014, the Committee invited the Respondents on Annulment to file a rejoinder by July 27, 2014.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of June 16, 2014, accompanied by Exhibit RA-11, the Applicant requested the dismissal of the Preliminary Objections. According to the Applicant, because the applicable arbitration rules to the annulment proceeding are the 2003 Arbitration Rules, Rule 41(5) of the 2006 Arbitration Rules does not apply. The Committee invited the Parties to comment on this matter by June 19, 2014.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 19, 2014, the Parties submitted their positions on the applicable rules and other procedural matters in the form of a mark-up of draft Procedural Order No. 1. In addition, on the same date, the Respondents on Annulment filed their comments on the Applicant's letter of June 16, 2014.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of June 23, 2014, upon leave granted by the Committee, the Respondents on Annulment filed their further response to the request to dismiss the Preliminary Objections.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 23, 2014, the Committee held its first session by telephone conference. Those participating in the session were:\n\nParticipating on behalf of Applicant\n\nMr. D. Brian King, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP Dr. Boris Kasolowsky, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP Ms. Manuela Nestor, Nestor Nestor Diculescu Kingston Petersen Ms. Dana Stan, Ministry of Public Finance, Romania Mr. Radu Palan, Ministry of Public Finance, Romania Mr. Victor Str\u00e2mbeanu, Ministry of Public Finance, Romania\n\nParticipating on behalf of Mr. Ioan Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C.\n\nStarmill S.R.L., and S.C. Multipack S.R.L.\n\nProf. Kaj Hob\u00e9r, Mannheimer Swartling\n\nMr. Jakob Ragnwaldh, Mannheimer Swartling\n\nMr. Ioan Micula, Respondent on Annulment\n\nMs. Oana Popa, Legal Adviser at European Food S.A.\n\nParticipating on behalf of Mr. Viorel Micula\n\nDr. Yas Banifatemi, Shearman & Sterling LLP\n\nDr. Veronika Korom, Shearman & Sterling LLP\n\nMr. Viorel Micula, Respondent on Annulment\n\nMs. Ioana Aron Blahuta, Legal Adviser at European Drinks S.A.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 25, 2014, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural matters discussed at the first session. Among other things, it was decided that the place of proceedings would be Paris, France, and that the language of the proceedings would be English.\n\n14.\n\nOn the same date, the Committee issued a separate Decision on Applicable Arbitration Rules and on Preliminary Objections. The issue was whether the Preliminary Objections advanced by the Claimants were admissible: while Rule 41(5) of the 2006 Arbitration Rules allow a party to make a preliminary objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit, there is no equivalent under the 2003 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant argued that the 2006 Arbitration Rules, which provide for an expedited process for preliminary objections (Rule 41(5)), are not applicable in the present case. The Applicant noted that the Parties agreed in 2006 at the First Session in the Original Proceeding that the proceeding would be governed by the 2003 Rules. Second, it argued that, under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, the applicable rules are those in force at the time of the parties' consent to arbitration. Under Article 52(4) of the Convention, Article 44 applies *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings. According to the Applicant, the date of consent for arbitration (July 28, 2005, the date the Claimants accepted Romania's offer to arbitrate by filing the request for arbitration), is the same for the purposes of the annulment phase, as it is part of the same arbitration proceeding.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondents on Annulment contended that an annulment proceeding is an entirely new procedure, which is not a continuation of the arbitration proceeding and which is governed by the rules in force at the time when the annulment proceeding is initiated, in this case the 2006 Rules since the Application for Annulment was filed in 2014.\n\n17.\n\nHaving considered the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention (Articles 44 and 52(4)) and the Arbitration Rules (Arbitration Rules 19 and 53), the Committee noted that the parties are permitted to reach new agreements on procedural matters in the annulment phase, but that, if the parties do not agree, the Committee must apply the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n18.\n\nUnder Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, the arbitration rules applicable to the annulment proceeding are those in force as of the disputing parties' consent to ICSID arbitration, which in this instance was given in 2005 at the time of the applicability of the 2003 Arbitration Rules.1 In concluding that the 2003 Arbitration Rules apply, the Committee stated:\n\nFirst, as noted by the Applicant, the idea of Article 44 of the Convention was to freeze the applicable rules so as not to impose on parties consenting to ICSID arbitration provisions that they are not aware of and might not approve. Second, the filing of an application for annulment cannot be viewed, *mutatis mutandis*, as equivalent to the parties' consent to ICSID arbitration. Annulment is a remedy available within the framework of an arbitration and is thus dependent on the consent given in the original proceeding. The only relevance of the date of filing of the annulment application is in respect of the time limit to apply for annulment.2\n\nDecision on Applicable Arbitration Rules and on Preliminary Objections, June 25, 2014, paras. 21-22.\n\n*Id*., para. 28.\n\n19.\n\nThe Committee noted that it had \"taken due note of the urgency of certain matters raised by the Respondents on Annulment\" and had \"adopted a procedural calendar which takes into account both parties' interests and which the Committee believes will expedite the annulment proceeding.\"3 The Committee further undertook to \"make its best effort to issue a timely decision on annulment\" and other decisions.4\n\n*Id*., para. 29.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n20.\n\nAs a result of its decision on the applicable arbitration rules, the Committee thus rejected the Preliminary Objections, without prejudice for these objections to be heard on the merits of the Application.\n\n**3. APPLICANT'S REQUEST FOR A CONTINUED STAY OF ENFORCEMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 14 May 2014, the Committee, pursuant to Arbitration Rules 54(1) and (4), invited Romania to file its reasons for the Stay Request by May 22, 2014, and the Respondents on Annulment to file their observations on the Stay Request by May 30, 2014.\n\n22.\n\nThe Parties were also informed that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award would remain in place while the Committee considered the Applicant's request and were invited to notify the Committee as soon as possible should either Party wish to invoke the expedited procedure envisaged in Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n23.\n\nOn May 22, 2014, Romania filed its Stay Request, accompanied by five factual exhibits (RA-6 to RA-10) and 13 legal authorities (RAL-1 to RAL-13).\n\n24.\n\nOn June 10, 2014, after an extension, the Respondents on Annulment submitted their observations on the Stay Request. These were accompanied by nine factual exhibits (CA-1 to CA-9) and 16 legal authorities (CAL-1 to CAL-16).\n\n25.\n\nOn June 20, 2014, the Applicant filed a Reply to the Stay Request, accompanied by seven factual exhibits (RA-12 to RA-18) and 20 legal authorities (RAL-14 to RAL-33).\n\n26.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Respondents on Annulment filed a Rejoinder to the Stay Request, accompanied by eight factual exhibits (CA-21 to CA-28).\n\n27.\n\nOn July 2, 2014, the Applicant requested leave from the Committee to address \"new factual and legal allegations\" filed by the Respondents on Annulment in their Reply to the Stay Request. On July 3, 2014, the Committee granted the requested leave until July 9, 2014.\n\n28.\n\nThe Applicant sought to stay paragraph 1329 of the Award until the Committee rendered a decision on the Application. The Applicant argued that enforcement of the Award would cause Romania to breach its obligations under Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\"), which might lead to infringement proceedings against Romania before the European Court of Justice (\"ECJ\"). If the stay of enforcement were not continued, it would cause Romania to be in the position of having to choose between violating the ICSID Convention or violating EU law.\n\n29.\n\nIn addition, the Applicant contended that it was unable to comply with the terms of compensation as set out in the Award because the Tribunal had failed to specify how the payment of damages to each Claimant should be allocated.5 Allowing enforcement would thus put Romania at risk of over-compensating the Claimants. The Applicant contended that this danger could already be seen by the enforcement actions that were currently pending, in which Mr. Viorel Micula was seeking compensation to the full amount of the Award, and Mr. Ioan Micula and the Corporate Claimants were seeking enforcement of 80% of the full sum of the Award. If enforcement were not stayed and the Claimants were successful in enforcing the Award, Romania would be liable to pay amounts that substantially exceeded the total sum awarded. It argued that such payment would be nearly impossible to recoup if the Application were upheld, since the Corporate Claimants were on the brink of bankruptcy, and recovering assets from individual claimants is challenging.\n\nStay Request, paras. 16-17.\n\n30.\n\nRomania further argued that if the Committee were to decide to grant a stay of enforcement, the stay should not be conditional, as such requirements are usually only placed upon countries that are in continuous breach of the ICSID Convention, which Romania is not.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondents on Annulment opposed the Stay Request on the grounds that Romania failed to show exceptional circumstances for the Stay. They alleged that Romania was already actively refusing to comply with the Award, e.g. by challenging domestic enforcement proceedings, and that it had given no reasonable assurance that it would comply with the Award if the Application were unsuccessful. According to the Respondents on Annulment, the delayed enforcement of the Award would risk the financial ruin of the Corporate Claimants. They requested that, if granted, the stay should be conditioned upon security deposited into an escrow account.\n\n32.\n\nOn August 7, 2014, the Committee issued a Decision on the Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, granting the stay of enforcement on the condition that the Applicant provide a written assurance to comply with the Award if it were upheld.\n\n33.\n\nIn its decision, the Committee noted that there is no presumption of an automatic stay of enforcement nor a presumption that a stay of enforcement is an exceptional measure. It further stated:\n\nArticle 52(5) does not indicate that one particular party bears the burden of establishing circumstances requiring a stay. It rather seems that establishing the existence of such circumstances is part of the Committee's discretionary power, and that Article 54(4) requires the applicant to specify the circumstances requiring the stay.6\n\nDecision on the Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, August 7, 2014, para. 37.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to the Committee, the analysis of whether or not a stay should be granted is very much fact driven based on the circumstances of each case. The Committee found that the continued stay of enforcement of the Award was justified in this case because, among other factors, the risk of non-recoupment for Romania was significant. The Committee dismissed the assertion that the Corporate Claimants would be in the position to reimburse Romania should the annulment be successful because the Claimants themselves had indicated that a delayed enforcement of the Award might lead to adverse economic consequences. The Committee also concluded that there had not been adequate evidence showing that the Individual Claimants' properties and assets were sufficient to reimburse Romania.\n\n35.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee was not convinced that Romania would comply with the Award following a decision on annulment dismissing the Application in view of its ambiguous positions, which, on the one hand, conditioned the enforcement on the European Commission's (\"EC\") interpretation of European Union (\"EU\") law and, on the other hand, insisted on setting off a portion of the amounts due under the Award against the Corporate Claimants' tax debts in Romania. The Committee concluded that this militated in favor of a conditional stay of enforcement, as there was a \"probable risk\" that the payment obligations would not be complied with by the Applicant.7\n\n*Id*., para. 60.\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee found that an appropriate condition, in this case, was a written undertaking by Romania confirming its obligation to enforce the Award under Article 53 of the Convention, which, according to the Committee, \"is as important as the right to pursue annulment under Article 52 of the Convention *.* \"8 The Committee thus instructed the Applicant to provide the following statement within 30 days of notification of the Decision on the Stay Request:\n\nRomania commits itself subject to no conditions whatsoever (including those related to EC law or decisions) to effect the full payment of its pecuniary obligation imposed by the Award in ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20- and owed to Claimants- to the extent that the Award is not annulled- following the notification of the Decision on annulment.9\n\n*Id*., para. 63.\n\n*Id*., para. 66.\n\n37.\n\nRomania subsequently declined to provide such written undertaking and, on September 7, 2014, the stay of enforcement of the Award was therefore automatically revoked (see below).\n\n**4. CLAIMANTS' REQUEST FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nOn June 10, 2014, the Respondents on Annulment filed a Request for Provisional Measures accompanied by nine factual exhibits (CA-1 to CA-9) and 16 legal authorities (CAL-1 to CAL-16).\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondents on Annulment requested provisional measures to prevent Romania from taking \"enforcement measures against the European Food and Drinks Companies (\"EFDC\"), which may result in the bankruptcy of these companies before the Committee renders its decision on the Application.\"10 Specifically, the Claimants requested that the Committee order the Applicant to:\n\n[C]ease and desist from implementing any seizure order against any of the EFDC (as defined above), and to refrain from taking any other measures against any of the EFDC that would risk jeopardizing the continuation of the business of the EFDC, or the enforcement of the award, until Romania has satisfied the terms of the Award in full [...J.11\n\nDecision on the Request for Provisional Measures Filed by the Respondents on Annulment, August 18, 2014, para. 16.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants argued that the Committee has the power to order provisional measures under Arbitration Rules 39 and 53. According to the Claimants, under Arbitration Rule 53, Rules 39 and 40 apply *mutandis mutatis* to annulment proceedings. In the alternative, the Claimants argued that the Committee has the power to order provisional measures under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that they have a right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute, which includes the right to remain in business without permitting Romania to bankrupt the EFDC before the Committee issues a decision on annulment. The requirements of necessity and urgency have been met as there is a risk that the EFDC would otherwise go out of business well before the decision on annulment is issued. The Claimants stated that there is thus a direct link between the harm they seek to avoid and the annulment proceeding.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants noted that the Tribunal had granted provisional measures arising from the same circumstances in the Original Proceeding in regard to all of the EFDC, recognizing their link with Messrs. Ioan and Viorel Micula, who directly and indirectly own the companies.\n\n43.\n\nOn June 20, 2014, pursuant to the Tribunal's directions, the Applicant filed its observations on the Request for Provisional Measures, accompanied by seven factual exhibits (RA-12 to RA-18) and 20 legal authorities (RAL-14 to RAL-33).\n\n44.\n\nThe Applicant argued that neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules give *ad hoc* committees the power to grant provisional measures, even when the requesting party seeks continuation or reinstatement of provisional measures recommended by a tribunal in a prior arbitration proceeding. This is apparent from ICSID Convention Article 52(4), which explicitly states that Article 47 providing for provisional measures does not apply to annulment proceedings.\n\n45.\n\nThe Applicant further argued that, even if the Committee were to find that it has the competence to grant provisional measures, the request fails on the merits. Provisional measures cannot be granted to non-parties, and several of the EFDC are non-Parties. In any event, the conditions for granting provisional measures have not been met because the Claimants have not shown that their right derives from a specific issue in question in the annulment proceeding, they have not shown that Romania's actions would cause irreparable prejudice to the EFDC companies, and they have not shown that there is any urgency. The previously granted provisional measures have expired and Romania is thus entitled to seek to enforce the tax debts of the EFDC under Romanian law.\n\n46.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, the Respondents on Annulment filed a Reply, accompanied by eight factual exhibits (CA-21 to CA-28), and on July 9, 2014, the Applicant filed a Rejoinder, accompanied by 18 factual exhibits (RA-19 to RA-36) and one legal authority (RAL-34).\n\n47.\n\nOn August 18, 2014, the Committee dismissed the request in its Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures. The Committee stated:\n\n36. The Committee considers that the annulment proceeding, by its very nature, has a limited scope and function, established under Article 52 of the Convention, with respect to the award of the tribunal and its possible annulment on one of the specified grounds listed in Article 52(1). Also, the Committee notes that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal and cannot consider the substance of a dispute, nor can it entertain again the arguments of the parties relating to their respective rights in the dispute adjudicated by the tribunal.\n\n37. Taking into consideration the limited scope of the annulment proceeding, at this stage of the annulment proceeding, as distinguished from the proceedings before the Tribunal, the rights of the Respondents on annulment relate mainly to the enforcement of the Award.12\n\n*Id*., paras. 36-37.\n\n48.\n\nThe Committee determined that, since it had already granted a conditional stay of enforcement of the Award, the Claimants' rights in the annulment proceeding had already been protected. It further stated:\n\n39. The Claimants also appear to be seeking the protection of their rights to the preservation of the \" *status quo* \" between the parties, but that is neither the purpose for which provisional measures should be granted nor does it fall within the scope and functions of the annulment proceedings as foreseen in Article 52 of the Convention.\n\n40. Moreover, the Committee considers it has not been clearly demonstrated by the Claimants that there is a risk of irreparable damage to rights relating to this stage of the proceedings before the decision of the Committee on the annulment application is issued. Indeed, the conditional stay of enforcement protects the rights of the Claimants in these proceedings.\n\n41. Assuming that the Committee was competent to issue provisional measures at this stage of the proceeding, there would have to be a direct link between the provisional measures sought and the rights which form the subject of the annulment proceedings, and not the rights in dispute between the parties on the merits of the case on which the Award has already been issued.13\n\n*Id*., paras. 39-41.\n\n49.\n\nThe Committee concluded that the rights for which protection was sought in this case did not relate to the annulment proceedings, noting that there was a difference between the issues and rights in dispute in an arbitration proceeding and in an annulment proceeding.\n\n**5. REVOCATION OF THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nBy letter of September 8, 2014, the Applicant requested an extension of time to file an assurance for the continued stay of enforcement of the Award in light of the EC's injunction of May 26, 2014 against Romania pending the EC's final decision on whether the execution of the Award constitutes unlawful State aid. The Applicant's request for an extension was accompanied by an annex, a letter from the EC to Romania dated September 4, 2014 (Annex 1), in which the EC stated that Romania could not provide any assurance that was contrary to EU law. The same day, the Committee invited the Claimants to file any comments on the letter by September 11, 2014.\n\n51.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, the Claimants submitted their comments, contending that the stay of enforcement had already automatically expired as of midnight September 6, 2014 under paragraphs 67 and 69 of the Decision on the Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter of September 15, 2014, the Committee confirmed that, pursuant to the terms of the Committee's Decision on the Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award of August 7, 2014, the stay of enforcement of the Award was automatically revoked as of September 7, 2014.\n\n**6. EC'S APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO INTERVENE AS A NON-DISPUTING PARTY**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, the EC (\"non-disputing Party\"), represented by Mr. Davide Grespan, Mr. Tim Maxian Rusche and Mr. Paul-John Loewenthal, members of its Legal Service, as agents, filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-disputing Party (\"EC's Application\"). The EC requested to file a written *amicus curiae* submission in support of the annulment of the Award, to be granted access to documents filed in the annulment proceeding and to provide oral testimony at hearings.\n\n54.\n\nThe EC argued that it was able to intervene as a non-disputing Party under Rules 37(2) and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (2006). The EC also stated that Article 23(a)(2) of Regulation (EC) No. 659/1999, which is applicable to all EU Member States, supports its claim that it has a significant interest in arbitration proceedings in which EU State aid rules may be discussed. As a guardian of the treaties relating to investment protection within the EU, and as it has a central role in the interpretation and application of the rules on State aid under the TFEU, the EC claimed that it had a particular interest in the annulment proceedings and could assist the Committee in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing perspective, particular knowledge and/or insight that differs from that of the disputing Parties. In addition, the EC noted that it had been allowed to participate as a non-disputing Party in the Original Proceeding.\n\n55.\n\nThe Committee invited both Parties to submit observations on the EC's Application by October 23, 2014. The Claimants filed their observations accordingly, accompanied by eight annexes (Annex A to Annex H). Concurrently, the Applicant informed the Committee that it had no objections to the EC's Application. The Parties were subsequently invited to file follow-up comments. On November 5, 2014, the Applicant filed its Reply to the Claimants' observations, accompanied by seven annexes (Annex A to Annex G), and, on November 12, 2014, the Claimants filed their response to the Reply, accompanied by one annex (Annex I).\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants contended that the Committee did not have the power to allow the EC to intervene in the proceedings under the applicable 2003 Arbitration Rules, as these do not provide for non-disputing party participation. Furthermore, according to the Claimants, there has never been a successful application for intervention by a non-disputing party in an annulment proceeding. In *Iberdrola v. Guatemala*, the Committee had rejected such applications because of the \"narrow nature of annulment proceedings.\"14\n\n*Iberdrola Energ\u00eda S.A. v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5), unpublished decision by the *ad hoc* Committee, February 12, 2014, as reported in Investment Arbitration Reporter on July 9, 2014 (Claimants' Letter of October 23, 2014, Annex A).\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants argued that, in any event, the Application must be denied because it does not meet the requirements. The circumstances in the annulment proceeding are very different from those in the Original Proceeding in which the Tribunal allowed the EC to participate, and the EC cannot re-argue issues which have already been decided by the Tribunal and which are irrelevant for the purposes of the annulment. The EC, therefore, cannot have a significant interest in the proceeding and cannot provide the Committee with the relevant expertise relating to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n58.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants submitted that the EC's participation would cause them unfair prejudice because it would prolong the proceedings and enable the EC to pursue a policy objective aligned with that of the Applicant, in effect acting as an advocate for Romania.\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicant was in favor of allowing the EC to intervene as non-disputing Party. It proffered that there is an established practice of permitting non-disputing party participation under the 2003 Arbitration Rules and argued that this was possible under the general power in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, applied *mutatis mutandis* to the annulment proceedings. The Applicant rejected the Claimants' argument that there has never been nondisputing party participation permitted in an annulment proceeding, citing *Siemens v. Argentina* and *Iberdrola v. Guatemala*, clarifying that in the latter case, the Committee considered that it had the power to allow *amicus curiae* submissions but dismissed the application due to untimeliness.15\n\nDecision on the Application of the EC to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, December 3, 2014, para. 25, citing the Applicant's Reply to the Claimants' Observations on the EC's Application, p. 2.\n\n60.\n\nRomania argued that the EC's Application meets the requirements established by the jurisprudence at the time of the application of the 2003 Rules. It stated that the Committee would be assisted by the EC's expertise on EU State aid rules and the interaction between EU law and public international law, which are matters of the public interest since they impact other EU Member States. Romania noted that tribunals have consistently allowed the EC to participate in investment arbitration cases and that it is not aware of any cases in which the EC was not permitted to participate as a non-disputing party due to perceived lack of independence in relation to the parties.\n\n61.\n\nOn December 3, 2014, the Committee issued a Decision on the EC's Application to file a Written Submission, granting leave to the EC to participate as a non-disputing Party.\n\n62.\n\nThe Committee held that it \"has the authority to permit a non-disputing party to file a written submission in the context of the annulment proceeding pursuant to the inherent powers recognized in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, applicable *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings under Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention.\"16 The Committee noted that, in line with *Vivendi v. Argentina*, three criteria must be met to allow a non-disputing party to participate in the proceedings: (i) the subject matter of the application must be appropriate; (ii) the applicant must be suitable to act as *amicus curiae* ; and (iii) procedural fairness must be respected.17\n\n*Id*., para. 30.\n\n*Aguas Argentinas, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), Order in Response to a Petition for Transparency and Participation as Amicus Curiae, May 19, 2005, para. 17 *et seq* (Claimants' Letter of October 23, 2014, Annex D) *.*\n\n63.\n\nThe Committee noted that, due to the limited scope of annulment proceedings, a request for leave by a non-disputing party must be dealt with in a more restrictive and circumscribed manner. However, as long as that limited scope is fully observed, a non-disputing party may be allowed to file an *amicus curiae* submission limited to matters directly related to the grounds for annulment. The Committee accepted the EC's position that it had an interest in acting as a non-disputing Party and found that the EC had satisfactorily established that it had the \"expertise, experience and independence to be of assistance\" in the annulment proceeding. It also found that an intervention by the EC would not be prejudicial to the Parties or prolong the proceedings, as long as its submission adhered to certain conditions:\n\n(i) the submission must be limited to the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention; (ii) the EC would not be granted access to the documents filed by the Parties in the annulment proceeding; and (iii) the EC would not be permitted to attend the hearings as the Claimants had opposed such attendance. The Committee stated that the EC's role in the annulment proceeding was different than in the Original Proceeding, and was limited to its knowledge and perspective directly related to the grounds for annulment.\n\n64.\n\nTherefore, on December 3, 2014, the Committee informed the EC that it was granted leave to file a single submission as *amicus curiae* by January 2, 2015. Following the EC's request for an extension of time until January 16, 2015, and the Parties' comments on such request, the Committee granted an extension to file the submission by January 9, 2015. On that date, the EC filed its written submission (the \"EC Submission\"), accompanied by 21 factual exhibits (EC-001 to EC-021).\n\n65.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, the Applicant filed its Reply on Annulment, which contained its observations on the EC Submission. The Claimants' observations on the EC Submission were included in their Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n**7. WRITTEN PROCEDURE AND CORRESPONDENCE RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD AND THE EC \"FINAL DECISION\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, the Applicant requested leave to file an expert report with its Memorial on Annulment, further to Item 14.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, in regard to expert testimony on the question of the applicable law (including EU law) and its consequences as raised in the Application for Annulment, which the Claimants objected to by letter of July 21, 2014. By letter of July 28, 2014, the Committee rejected the Applicant's request because it considered that Romania had not established that such an expert report was relevant for the consideration of the grounds for annulment as required by Item 14.2 of the Procedural Order, but stated that the Applicant would be free to request to submit an expert report at a later stage.\n\n67.\n\nOn September 8, 2014, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment, accompanied by eight factual exhibits (RA-37 to RA-44) and 37 legal authorities (RAL-35 to RAL-71), as well as 11 factual exhibits from the original proceeding (C-49, C-52, R-10, R-27, R-37, R-65, R-68, R-86, R-91, R-94 and EC-2).\n\n68.\n\nOn December 2, 2014, after an extension and subsequent modification of the procedural calendar, the Respondents on Annulment filed a Counter-Memorial on Annulment, accompanied by 11 factual exhibits (CA-28 to CA-38), 26 legal authorities (CAL-55 to CAL-80) and one annex (Annex 1), as well as ten factual exhibits and legal authorities from the original proceeding (C-38, C-62, C-312, C-565, C-592, R-3, R-5, R-10, RL-8 and RL-34).\n\n69.\n\nBy letter of January 26, 2015, a revised procedural calendar was dispatched to the Parties to reflect their agreement regarding the filing of submissions and the hearing on annulment.\n\n70.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Counsel for Mr. Viorel Micula informed ICSID that their client had commenced enforcement proceedings before the Bucharest Tribunal in Romania and had been instructed by that tribunal to produce an apostille stamp or other certification that would authenticate or certify the Award. Counsel therefore requested an attestation from the Secretary-General of ICSID that no such apostille stamp or other certification of the Award was required. On the same date, the Secretary-General confirmed that no formal requirements were necessary for the purposes of recognition or enforcement of an Award under the ICSID Convention other than a copy of the Award certified by the Secretary-General pursuant to the Convention.\n\n71.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, the Applicant filed a Reply on Annulment, accompanied by 65 factual exhibits (RA-45 to RA-109) and 23 legal authorities (RAL-72 to RAL-94), as well as 12 factual exhibits from the Original Proceeding (C-42, C-43, C-44, C-318, EC-5, R-73, R-75, R-77, R-78, R-79, R-85 and R-87).\n\n72.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, due to Romania's actions in domestic enforcement proceedings initiated by the Claimants, the Claimants requested the Committee to order the Applicant to:\n\n(i) comply with its obligations under Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention and cease all actions against the enforcement of the Award in reliance of EU law or Romanian law, including any actions before domestic or foreign courts, and\n\n(ii) effect full payment of the pecuniary obligation imposed in the Award, subject to no conditions whatsoever.18\n\nLetter from Counsel for the Claimants to the *ad hoc* Committee, March 16, 2015, p. 5 (accompanied by Annexes A-J).\n\n73.\n\nRomania had sought and been granted a stay of enforcement of the Award by the Bucharest Court of Appeal, following an appeal of a ruling by the Bucharest Tribunal rejecting such stay. The Bucharest Court of Appeal had found in favor of the Applicant's argument that the enforcement should be stayed pending the appeal concerning the enforceability of the Award, based on Romania's argument that it was manifestly contrary to the TFEU. In addition, because of the EC's investigation into the legality of the Award, on March 6, 2015, Romania passed Law No. 20/2015, which suspended all of the enforcement actions initiated by the Claimants as of March 9, 2015. According to Romania, Law No. 20/2015 is aimed at reconciling the two competing international obligations under the ICSID Convention and EU law. The Applicant had therefore placed the outstanding amount due under the Award in an escrow account in the Claimants' names, to be released to them if it were permitted by the EC in its forthcoming decision.\n\n74.\n\nThe Committee addressed the Claimants' request by letter of March 26, 2015. It recalled its letter of September 15, 2014 confirming that the stay of enforcement of the Award had been revoked as of September 7, 2014. It reconfirmed that the stay was revoked and that it had dealt with the issue of the stay of enforcement of the Award to the extent it fell within the competence of the Committee.\n\n75.\n\nBy letter of May 6, 2015, the Applicant informed the Committee that the EC had handed down its final decision on State aid on March 30, 2015 (\"Final Decision\"), in which \"the EC found that any payment under the Award constitutes State aid that is incompatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\"19 According to Romania, since the Final Decision had been rendered, the Applicant had to recover the amounts paid under the Award or face infringement proceedings before the ECJ. As a result, this placed Romania in an impossible predicament of conflicting international obligations. By agreement of the Parties, the Final Decision was subsequently admitted into the record of the annulment proceeding and assigned Exhibit No. RA-110.\n\n*Id*., p. 1.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants requested and were granted leave to address the Applicant's letter of May 6, 2015 in their Rejoinder.\n\n77.\n\nOn June 9, 2015, the Respondents on Annulment filed a Rejoinder on Annulment, accompanied by 31 factual exhibits (CA-39 to CA-69) and 14 legal exhibits (CAL-81 to CAL-94), as well as one exhibit from the original proceeding (C-271).\n\n78.\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the Respondents on Annulment filed a letter accompanied by eight factual exhibits (CA-70 to CA-77) concerning various enforcement proceedings. As leave had not been granted to file the submission, the Applicant was invited to comment. By communication of September 11, 2015, the Applicant objected to the admissibility of the Claimants' submission. On September 13, 2015, the Claimants requested the opportunity to respond to the Applicant's objection and commented on the merits of the submission. The Applicant objected to the introduction of those comments. The Parties submitted further views on the admissibility of the new evidence by letters of September 15, 2015 (Claimants) and September 17, 2015 (Applicant).\n\n79.\n\nOn September 21, 2015, the first day of the Hearing on Annulment, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 denying admission into the record of the Claimants' new submissions and documents. The Committee found that the new evidence was not directly relevant to the grounds for annulment pleaded by the Applicant.\n\n**8. THE HEARING ON ANNULMENT**\n-------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nA pre-hearing organizational meeting was held by telephone conference on August 21, 2015, to discuss the arrangements for the Hearing on Annulment. The Parties and the Committee agreed on the schedule for the hearing and other logistical matters.\n\n81.\n\nThe Hearing on Annulment was held in Paris on September 21 and 22, 2015. In addition to the Committee and its Secretary, present at the Hearing were (in order of appearance on the List of Participants):\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Applicant Mr. D.

Dr. Boris Kasolowsky and Messrs. Brian King and Ben Juratowich subsequently addressed the Committee on behalf of the Applicant. Prof. Emmanuel Gaillard, Dr. Kaj Hob\u00e9r and Mr. Jakob Ragnwaldh addressed the Committee on behalf of the Claimants. There were no witnesses or experts.\n\n83.\n\nFollowing a request made by the Committee before the hearing, the Parties produced the following documents from the Original Proceeding:\n\n(i) The Claimants' Revised Request for Relief of December 20, 2010;\n\n(ii) The Tribunal's letters and questions of May 6, 2011;\n\n(iii) The Parties' answers to the Procedural Order dated April 6, 2011, and to the letters of May 6, 2011; and\n\n(iv) EGO No. 75/2000 (\"EGO 75\") (Exhibit C-45).\n\n84.\n\nAt the close of the hearing, it was decided that the Parties would submit brief submissions on costs within three weeks of the hearing.\n\n**9. THE POST-HEARING PHASE**\n-----------------------------\n\n85.\n\nOn October 13, 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their submissions on costs.\n\n86.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, the Committee declared the proceedings closed in accordance with Arbitration Rules 38(1) and 53.\n\n**II. THE AWARD AND THE SEPARATE OPINION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nA Tribunal composed of Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy, (President, appointed by the Parties), Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov (appointed by the Claimants) and Prof. Georges Abi-Saab (appointed by Respondent following the resignation of Prof. Dr. Claus-Dieter Ehlermann) rendered the Award. Attached to the Award was the separate opinion of Prof. Abi-Saab (\"Separate Opinion\"). The Tribunal unanimously held that Romania had breached the Agreement Between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (\"BIT\") and awarded damages to the Claimants.\n\n88.\n\nSection I of the Award (paras. 1-9) introduced the Claimants and the dispute. Section II (paras. 10-129) described the procedural history. The Award incorporated the Tribunal's September 25, 2008 Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, which included a description of the procedural steps in the jurisdictional phase. Section III (paras. 130-249) provided a factual overview of the dispute divided into three parts: (i) Romania's efforts to attract investment and the framework for disfavored regions; (ii) the Claimants' investments in Romania; and (iii) Romania's accession process to join the EU. The facts in that section are summarized concisely below:\n\n*Legal Framework for Disfavored Regions (paras. 137-155)*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn the 1990s, Romania enacted several reforms directed at transforming it into a market economy with the goal of obtaining EU accession. On March 14, 1990, it issued Decree Law No. 96/1990, granting certain tax benefits to foreign investors. It was replaced by Law No. 35/1991 (\"Law 35\"), enacted on April 3, 1991, which offered incentives for new foreign investments including: (i) exemption from customs duties for importing certain machinery and equipment; (ii) a two-year exemption from customs duties on raw materials; (iii) a profit-tax exemption ranging from two to five years, investment dependent; and (iv) a profit-tax reduction following the expiration of the exemption. Government Ordinance No. 27/1996 (\"GO 27\") was issued on August 5, 1996, offering benefits to parties from certain regions, including a corporate profit tax incentive for a limited period.\n\n90.\n\nRomania began promoting regional development within the framework of its efforts to accede to the EU. It passed Law No. 151/1998 on Regional Development on July 16, 1998, the objectives of which included reducing regional imbalances. The Law purported to have EU support.\n\n91.\n\nIn the context of these initiatives, the Government issued Emergency Government Ordinance No. 24/1998 (\"EGO 24\") on September 30, 1998, establishing a framework of governmental incentives for investments in \"disfavored\" regions for periods of three to ten years.\n\n92.\n\nThe benefits of EGO 24 were granted to businesses whose investments created new jobs for the unemployed or benefited their families living in the region. EGO 24 required that investors remain in a disadvantaged area for twice as long as they received such incentives, otherwise the investor must compensate the Government for the value of any benefit it received.\n\n93.\n\nGovernment Decision No. 194/1999, dated March 25, 1999, designated the region of Stei-Nucet as a disfavored region for a period of ten years starting on April 1, 1999, and granted all of the incentives listed in EGO 24 to investors in that region. Government Decision No. 525/1999 of June 29, 1999 set out the norms for the application of EGO 24 incentives and provided that businesses must obtain a permanent investment certificate (\"PIC\") showing that they meet the relevant requirements.\n\n*The Claimants' Investment in Romania (paras. 156-177)*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Individual Claimants are majority shareholders of a group of companies, European Food and Drinks Group (\"EFDG\"), of which the Corporate Claimants are members. EFDG engaged in food and beverage production in \u00a7tei-Nucet-Dr\u00e2g\u00e2ne\u00a7ti, Bihor County. The Individual Claimants asserted that their investments in the EFDG were made in reliance on Law 35 and GO 27, the predecessors to EGO 24. After GO 27 was introduced in 1996, the Claimants relocated certain projects to Dr\u00e2g\u00e2nesti (in the Apuseni region of Bihor County, which was covered by GO 27 and made part of the \u00a7tei-Nucet disfavored region by Government decision of November 29, 2000) to take advantage of the regional investment program. The Claimants claimed that, following the adoption of EGO 24, they built a large-scale food production operation as part of a ten-year business plan that relied on the incentives.\n\n95.\n\nThe EFDG companies obtained investment certificates in order to participate in EGO 24. Each Corporate Claimant obtained a PIC.\n\n*Romania's Accession Process (paras. 178-249)*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThroughout this time, Romania pursued EU accession. On February 1, 1993, Romania signed the Europe Agreement with the EC, which entered into force on February 1, 1995.\n\n97.\n\nAfter the Europe Agreement entered into force, Romania presented its application for EU membership. The EC's Opinion on Romania's Application for Membership of the European Union of July 15, 1997 concluded that Romania had not yet satisfied certain criteria and was not ready to initiate accession talks.\n\n98.\n\nOn March 10, 1998, the EC issued guidelines on whether to allow regional aid. On March 22, 1999, the EC Council issued Council Regulation (EC) No. 659/1999, which set out rules for the application of the EC Treaty with respect to State aid measures and recovery of unlawful State aid. The Regulation provided that the Commission could issue a recommendation for incompatible State aid schemes and initiate formal investigations. Shortly thereafter, Romania passed Law No. 142/1999 on State aid, granting its Competition Council power to regulate State aid.\n\n99.\n\nThe EU commenced formal accession negotiations with Romania in February 2000. In May 2000, the Romanian Competition Council held that certain incentives available under EGO 24 distorted competition and recommended their elimination. In June 2000, Romania passed EGO No. 75/2000, which amended the EGO 24 incentives but did not eliminate them. There were further amendments to the incentive regime during the ongoing accession process in late 2000-2002.\n\n100.\n\nIn 2002, the Sweden-Romania BIT was signed and ratified. From 2002-2003, the EU and the accession negotiations placed continued emphasis on the non-conformity of Romania's State aid policy with EU standards, particularly the policy regarding disfavored regions. In January 2004, the Romanian Prime Minister stated that EGO 24 incentives might be terminated due to EC requirements, but that the Government would negotiate with each investor and that it was examining whether certain incentives could remain in place until 2007.\n\n101.\n\nOn August 31, 2004, by means of Government Ordinance No. 94/2004, Romania revoked most of the tax incentives contained in EGO 24, effective February 22, 2005. The Accession Treaty with the EU was signed on April 25, 2005, and Romania became a full Member State on January 1, 2007.\n\n102.\n\nSection IV of the Award (paras. 250-283) provided an overview of the Parties' positions regarding the alleged treaty breaches (these are expressed in detail in Section VI of the Award).\n\n103.\n\nSection V, \"Preliminary Matters\" (paras. 284-341), considered: (i) jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable law; and (iii) the enforcement of the award and EU law.\n\n*Jurisdiction (paras. 284-285)*\n-------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal summarized its rulings rejecting the Respondent's objections on jurisdiction *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis*.\n\n*Applicable Law (paras. 286-329)*\n---------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that, in accordance with Article 42(1) of the Convention, international law should take precedence over Romanian law in case of conflict. It further found that the relevant rules of international law were the Europe Agreement and the BIT, and that EU law was not directly applicable to Romania. It nevertheless held that EU law was part of the \"factual matrix\" of the case and that it may be relevant in the determination of whether Romania had observed the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") obligation contained in the BIT.20\n\nAward, para. 328 (Appl. Exh. RA-3).\n\n*Enforceability of an Award under EU Law (paras. 330-341)*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal indicated that it would not address the Parties' arguments regarding the enforceability of an award of compensation against Romania within the EU. The Tribunal stated that \"it is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters\"21 and that it was inappropriate to base its decisions on hypothetical future EU law.\n\n*Id*., para. 340.\n\n107.\n\nSection VI, \"Analysis of the Claimants' Treaty Claims\" (paras. 342-874), considered the alleged treaty breaches: (i) umbrella clause (Article 2(4) of the BIT); (ii) FET (Article 2(3)); (iii) unreasonable and discriminatory measures (Article 2(3)); and (iv) expropriation (Article 4(1)).\n\n*Umbrella Clause (paras. 343-459)*\n----------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nBy a majority, the Tribunal dismissed the umbrella clause claim (i.e. whether Romania had observed \"any obligation\" entered into with regard to an investment) because, although it found that a commitment and specific entitlement existed under the applicable Romanian law with respect to the Claimants as a result of EGO 24 and the PICs until April 1, 2009, the Claimants had not provided sufficient evidence that they had a \"vested right,\" and \"the existence of an obligation protected by the umbrella clause.\"22\n\n*Id*., para. 459.\n\n*FET (paras. 460-872)*\n----------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal held that Romania had breached the FET obligation in the BIT. First, by majority, it held that the totality of Romania's actions amounted to a promise or assurance of regulatory stability that had given the Claimants a legitimate expectation that the incentives were compatible with EU law from 1998-2003 and would be maintained in substantially the same form for the full ten-year period (or that they would be compensated in the event they were revoked).23 The Tribunal found that these expectations reasonably led the Claimants to invest in the region in the scale and manner in which they did. Second, the majority of the Tribunal (\"the Majority\") held that the Government had not acted with transparency and consistency in its conduct toward the Claimants because it should have informed them reasonably soon after it knew the EGO 24 framework would be abolished. Third, the Tribunal considered that it was not fair and equitable of Romania to have obliged the investors to fulfill their obligations under the incentives but to have revoked the benefits thereof. Although the Tribunal found that the measures were narrowly tailored for a rational public policy and that Romania had not acted in bad faith or unreasonably in light of its aim at EU accession, this did not overcome the breach of the Claimants' legitimate expectations.\n\n*Id.*, para. 677.\n\n*Other Treaty Claims (paras. 873-874)*\n--------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nIn view of its holding on FET, the Tribunal considered it unnecessary to rule on the claims regarding unreasonable and discriminatory treatment or expropriation.\n\n*Damages (paras. 875-1248)*\n---------------------------\n\n111.\n\nSection VII addressed damages. The Tribunal first found that it could make an award for damages incurred by non-disputing parties (the other EFDG companies) as long as the Individual Claimants could prove their ownership of the non-disputing companies in the EFDG for which claims were made and that they had been affected by Romania's breach of the BIT.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal then determined the amount of damages for the FET breach using an expectation damages computation method (which quantifies the increased cost and the Claimants' lost profits) because it was the primary scenario advanced by the Claimants and the most thoroughly scrutinized and examined in the written and oral phases.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal awarded the Claimants RON 376.4 million in damages (excluding interest) representing losses resulting from the increased cost of sugar and other raw materials (RON 120.7 million), as well as lost profits on the sale of finished food products (RON 255.7 million), but not including lost profits on the sale of sugar-containing products or lost profits incurred as a result of the Claimants' inability to complete the planned investments because the Claimants had not proven these losses with sufficient certainty. The Tribunal also rejected the Claimants' request that the damages be awarded net of taxes because it found that the Claimants had possessed sufficient funds available to pay their outstanding debts (taxes) but made a strategic business decision not to.\n\n*Allocation of Damages (paras. 1184-1248)*\n------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nLastly, under the heading \"To Whom Should the Award be Made?\", the Tribunal discussed the allocation of damages. The Tribunal rejected the Claimants' request that the entirety of the damages be divided equally between the Individual Claimants, as that would amount to a loss to the Corporate Claimants in favor of their shareholders. It also found that it could not award the entirety of the damages to the Corporate Claimants because a portion of the damages was associated with other EFDG companies, which were not party to the proceeding. The Tribunal therefore held that it \"shall not allocate the damages but shall award the entirety of the damages to the five Claimants collectively.\"24 Because the Individual Claimants owned 99.96% of the shares in the EFDG, of which the Corporate Claimants form part, the Tribunal was satisfied that the damages were suffered by all Claimants and found that \"the Claimants' failure to specify and prove the exact quantum of damages suffered by each of the five Claimants\"25 was not a sufficient reason to deny damages that had been quantified. The Tribunal noted that this conclusion was appropriate since neither Party had argued for a specific allocation of damages as among the five Claimants.\n\n*Id*., para. 1240.\n\n*Id*., para. 1245.\n\n115.\n\nIn Section VIII, \"Interest\" (paras. 1249-1276), the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay pre- and post- award interest (as it saw no reason to differentiate between the two) at the rate of 3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis, noting that the trend in investment arbitration was to award compound interest.\n\n116.\n\nSection IX (paras. 1277-1322) addressed non-pecuniary requests for relief, particularly a setoff of the amount awarded against tax debts and post-award injunctive relief. The Tribunal dismissed both requests on the basis that the requests were procedurally improper under ICSID Convention Article 46 and Arbitration Rule 40 and, on the merits, as the right to setoff tax debts was primarily a question of Romanian law. The Tribunal further rejected the Claimants' request to enjoin Romania from any further tax collection efforts with respect to the Claimants as untimely, and because the Claimants' claims regarding the tax debts had been dismissed, held that there was no justification to award injunctive relief in relation thereto.\n\n117.\n\nIn Section X, \"Costs\" (paras. 1323-1328), the Tribunal determined that the Parties share the costs of the arbitration and that they bear their own legal expenses.\n\n118.\n\nFinally, Section XI (para. 1329) contained the *dispositif*.\n\n119.\n\nIn his Separate Opinion, Prof. Abi-Saab agreed with the *dispositif*, but did not join the Majority's conclusion that Romania had breached the Claimants' legitimate expectations because an expectation \"must be based on some kind of legal commitment,\" and, in order for behavior or conduct to rise to that level, it must be \"sufficiently concrete and specifically directed to the particular investor to constitute an objective \u2018representation' of a legal commitment.\"26 He felt that the EGO 24 scheme did not amount to such a commitment, but that the PIC issuance did. Furthermore, he disagreed with the Majority's finding that the Government had acted with a lack of transparency amounting to a FET breach. Although he joined the decision on damages, he noted that where a State has acted in \"pursuit of legitimate overriding national interests,\"27 damages should not include lost profits.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 5 (Appl. Exh. RA-3).\n\n*Id*., para. 15.\n\n**III. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS OF ANNULMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe legal framework governing annulment proceedings is set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Chapter VII of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 52(1) of the Convention sets out five grounds for annulment. The Applicant invokes three of those grounds in this case:\n\n(i) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n(ii) that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(iii) that the Award failed to state the reasons upon which it was based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n121.\n\nAlthough the Parties agree that annulment is an extraordinary remedy and cannot amount to an appeal, they differ on how the standards under the grounds for annulment invoked in this case apply to the alleged defects in the Award. Before analyzing each of those grounds in the context of the Application, the Committee wishes to comment generally on the applicable standards under those grounds.\n\n122.\n\nThe Committee notes that ICSID *ad hoc* committees have repeatedly held that the annulment mechanism is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy, and that it is not a remedy against an incorrect decision.28 As a result, committees have stressed the distinction between annulment and appeal, and stated that they cannot review the correctness of an award's findings on facts or law.29 The Committee agrees with *CMS v. Argentina* that a committee \"has only limited jurisdiction under Article 52 of the Convention\" and \"cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal.\"30 The Committee will apply these general standards when considering each of the grounds for annulment pleaded in this case.\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID, 27 ICSID Review - FILJ (2012) 443, 470, August 10, 2012 (Appl.

Argentina*, para. 136.\n\n**1. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS**\n--------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) of the Convention entails a dual requirement: there must be an excess of powers, and that excess must be manifest in terms of being evident, obvious, clear or easily recognizable.31\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1), Decision on Annulment, January 7, 2015 (\"*Daimler v. Argentina*\"), para. 186 (Cl. Exh. CAL-83); *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v.

RAL-41); *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19), Decision on Annulment, June 14, 2010 (\"*Helnan v. Egypt*\"*),* para. 55 (Appl. Exh.

Hungary* \"), para. 31 (Appl. Exh. RAL-75; Cl. Exh. CAL-41).\n\n124.\n\nAn arbitral tribunal derives its power from the parties' agreement. The agreement to arbitrate constitutes both the basis and the outer limit of a tribunal's power.\n\n125.\n\nExcess of powers primarily refers to situations where a tribunal adjudicates disputes not included in the powers granted by the parties. Thus, the most important form of excess of powers occurs when a tribunal exceeds the limits of its jurisdiction.32 In ICSID arbitration, jurisdiction is determined by Article 25 of the Convention and the parties' agreement on consent. Hence, lack of jurisdiction may relate to any of the mandatory requirements listed in Article 25(1) of the Convention and the relevant instrument of consent. This includes a lack of jurisdiction *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae* or *ratione voluntatis*.33 Thus, there is an excess of power if the tribunal: (i) asserts its jurisdiction over a legal or natural person or a State in regard to whom it does not have jurisdiction; (ii) asserts its jurisdiction over a subject-matter which does not fall within the ambit of the jurisdiction of the tribunal; or (iii) asserts its jurisdiction over an issue that is not encompassed in the consent of the parties. A deficiency in meeting any of these requirements would mean that there is no jurisdiction, which may constitute a manifest excess of powers if the excess of jurisdiction is manifest.34\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v.

Paraguay*\"), para. 114 (Cl. Exh. CAL-75).\n\n126.\n\nExcess of powers can be committed both by overreach and by default. Awards can be annulled if tribunals either assume powers to which they are not entitled by way of a decision which is *ultra petita* (e.g. by an excess of jurisdiction), or fail to exercise an existing jurisdiction by way of *infra petita* (e.g. by omitting to decide over a head of a claim raised by the parties). In this context, a manifest shortfall in the exercise of jurisdiction may constitute a manifest excess of power.35 Therefore, it is not within the tribunal's powers to refuse to decide a dispute or part of a dispute that meets all jurisdictional requirements of Article 25.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A*. *and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (\" *Vivendi v. Argentina* \"), para. 115 (Appl. Exh. RAL-45).\n\n*Failure to Apply the Applicable Law*\n-------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nExcess of powers may exist not only in cases where tribunals wrongly assume jurisdiction, but also in the case of tribunals which, having jurisdiction, fail to apply the applicable law.36 Article 42(1) of the Convention deals with the law applicable to the dispute. It provides that the tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules as may be agreed to by the parties. In the absence of such an agreement, it shall apply the law of the host State and applicable rules of international law. Article 52(1) does not expressly provide for annulment in case of a failure to apply the applicable law. Nevertheless, the provisions on applicable law are essential elements of the parties' agreement to arbitrate and constitute part of the parameters for the tribunal's activity. Non-application of the law agreed to by the parties or of the law determined by the residual rule in Article 42(1) goes against the parties' agreement to arbitrate and may constitute an excess of powers.\n\n*MTD v. Chile*, para. 44; *Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 189; *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Annulment, July 30, 2010 (\" *Enron v. Argentina* \"), para. 218 (Appl. Exh. RAL-43).\n\n128.\n\nAs stated by the *Daimler* annulment Committee:\n\nTherefore, when an allegation is made that there was a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the applicable law, it is not the role of an *ad hoc* committee to verify whether the interpretation of the law by the tribunal was correct, or whether it correctly ascertained the facts or whether it correctly appreciated the evidence. These are issues relevant to an appeal, but not for annulment proceedings in view of the limited grounds provided for under the ICSID Convention.37\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 189.\n\n129.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have made it clear that an error in the interpretation of the applicable law does not constitute a manifest excess of powers.38\n\n*Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, para. 81; *Azurix v. Argentina*, para. 137; *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 42; *Enron v. Argentina*, para. 219.\n\n130.\n\nMisinterpretation or misapplication of the applicable law to be applied to the merits, even if serious, does not justify annulment. In exceptional circumstances, however, a gross or egregious error of law could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment.39 However, the threshold for applying this exceptional rule must be set very high.40\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 86; *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, para. 81; *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 43; *AES v. Hungary,* paras. 33-34.\n\n*Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, para. 81; *AES v. Hungary*, para. 33.\n\n**2. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nViolation of a rule of procedure will be a ground for annulment only if two requirements are met:41\n\n(i) The departure from the rule of procedure must be serious; and\n\n(ii) The rule concerned must be fundamental.\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina*, para 262; *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989 (\" *MINE* v. *Guinea* \"), para. 4.06 (Appl. Exh. RAL-49; Cl. Exh. CAL-25); *Wena v. Egypt*, para 56; *CDC v. Seychelles*, para. 48.\n\n132.\n\nIn this respect, this Committee follows the reasoning of *MINE v. Guinea* :\n\n5.05 A first comment on this provision concerns the term \"serious\". In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\n\n5.06 A second comment concerns the term \"fundamental\"; even a serious departure from a rule of procedure will not give rise to annulment, unless that rule is \"fundamental.\" The Committee considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, which provides:\n\n\"The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case.\"\n\nThe term \"fundamental rule of procedure\" is not to be understood as necessarily including all of the Arbitration Rules adopted by the Centre.42\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, paras. 5.05-5.06.\n\n133.\n\nMoreover, the *CDC v. Seychelles* Committee rightly pointed out that only rules of natural justice, which concern the essential fairness of the proceeding, could be considered fundamental:\n\nA departure is serious where it is \"substantial and [is] such as to deprive the party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\" In other words, \"the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.\" As for what rules of procedure are fundamental, the drafters of the Convention refrained from attempting to enumerate them, but the consensus seems to be that only rules of natural justice - rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding - are fundamental. Not all ICSID Arbitration Rules are fundamental in this sense.43\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles*, para. 49.\n\n134.\n\nTherefore, the threshold for finding that a rule of procedure is fundamental is very high.44 As stated in *Alapli v. Turkey*, \"[t]he Applicant bears the burden of proving both that (i) the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a procedural rule; and (ii) that the said rule was fundamental.\"45 In addition, the Committee agrees with annulment decisions that have required that the departure have a material impact on the outcome of the award for the annulment to succeed.46\n\n*Alapli v.

Argentina* \"), para. 142 (Appl. Exh. RAL-76).\n\n**3. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe obligation to state reasons stems from the wording of Article 48(3) of the Convention, which requires tribunals to \"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal\" and to \"state the reasons upon which [the award] is based.\" Unreasoned awards can be annulled, because parties should be able to ascertain to what extent a tribunal's findings are based on a correct interpretation of the law and on a proper evaluation of the facts. However, as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive, the award cannot be annulled on this ground.47 Article 52(1)(e) does not permit any enquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons.48 As it was stated in *MINE* :\n\n[T]he requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.49\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina*, para. 181.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 64; *Impregilo v. Argentina*, para. 181.\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.09.\n\n136.\n\nIn other words, under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a committee is only authorized to verify whether the sequence of arguments within an award evidences a logical chain of reasoning that is apt to lead to the conclusion that was reached by the tribunal. This was also the view of the *Wena v. Egypt* Committee:\n\nThe ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE*, this ground for annulment refers to a \"minimum requirement\" only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal's duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).50\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, paras. 79 and 81.\n\n137.\n\nAlthough the Committee in *MINE* did consider that genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out and amount to no reasons at all, it also noted that annulment committees should not be quick to find a contradiction when in fact what is evident from the award is the compromise reached in an international collegiate adjudicative body.51 In this respect, the *Vivendi* Committee observed:\n\nIn the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.52\n\n*Alapli v. Turkey*, para. 200.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 65.\n\n138.\n\nEven where reasons on a particular point are missing, a committee may, in certain circumstances, reconstruct the reasons. In *Wena v. Egypt,* the Committee stated that \"[t]he Tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.\"53 This has been confirmed by other committees.54\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, para. 81.\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, para. 6,104; *CDC v. Seychelles*, para. 87; *Soufraki v. UAE*, paras. 63-64; *CMS v. Argentina*, paras. 125-127; *Azurix v. Argentina*, para. 360; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, paras. 83 and 138; *Fraport v. Philippines*, paras. 264266; *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011 (\" *Continental Casualty v. Argentina* \"), para. 101 (Cl. Exh. CL-70).\n\n139.\n\nThe standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is, therefore, high. It does not permit an *ad hoc* committee to second-guess the reasoning of the tribunal. It imposes on the applicant the burden of proving that the reasoning of the tribunal on a point that is essential for the outcome of the case was either absent, unintelligible, contradictory or frivolous. In order to succeed, the Applicant must discharge this burden.55\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 79; *Alapli v. Turkey*, para. 202.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Applicant alleges that the Tribunal committed a number of annullable errors which relate to three main defects in the Award: (i) the failure to apply the law that the Tribunal had found was applicable to the dispute, the 1995 Europe Agreement; (ii) the failure to decide whether Romania was prohibited from paying compensation for the repeal of illegal State aid; and (iii) the failure to require each Claimant to prove that it suffered harm and to award compensation to each Claimant only for the harm it proved it had suffered. The Applicant states that these defects can be challenged under more than one of the three grounds raised.\n\n141.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the first two defects would lead to annulment of the Award in its entirety, while the third defect relating to damages, if upheld alone, would lead to partial annulment of the Award pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.56 The Applicant therefore seeks the following relief:\n\n111. [...]\n\n(a) ANNUL in its entirety the Award rendered by the Tribunal, or in the alternative, annul only the portion of the Award dealing with damages, namely paragraphs 875 to 1276 and decisions (c) and (d) in paragraph 1329; and\n\n(b) ORDER the Claimants to pay in their entirety the costs of these annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the *ad hoc* Committee and the Centre, and all other reasonable fees and expenses incurred by Romania in relation to these annulment proceedings, including legal fees and disbursements.57\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 110.\n\n*Id*., para. 111\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimants, on the other hand, argue that Romania's Application is outside the limited scope of annulment and that it is a poorly disguised appeal on the merits that is being used as a delaying tactic in respect of the enforcement of the Award.58 They therefore request that the Committee reject Romania's request for annulment and require it to bear all the costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants and the Centre in connection with the proceeding.59\n\nCl. C-Mem., paras. 12-27.\n\n*Id*., para. 363.\n\n143.\n\nThe Committee will deal with the grounds and the alleged annullable errors in the order presented by the Applicant.\n\n**1. FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n144.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. In paragraph 319 of the Award, the Tribunal found that the relevant rules of international law were the Europe Agreement, which entered into force in February 1995, and the BIT, which entered into force on April 1, 2003. It also found that EU law, with the exception of Romania's international obligations under the Europe Agreement, was not directly applicable to Romania:\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal notes that there is no real conflict of treaties. In the time period relevant to this dispute, the relevant rules of international law applicable to Romania and Sweden were the Europe Agreement (which entered into force on 1 February 1995) and the BIT (which entered into force on 1 April 2003). The Accession Treaty was not signed until 25 April 2005, and entered into force on 1 January 2007 (date on which the EC Treaty also entered into force with respect to Romania) (ER of F. Jacobs, 12). Thus, from 1 February 1995 to 1 January 2007, Romania was in a negotiating phase during which it declared that it accepted the *acquis* but it was not properly subject to EU law, with the exception of its international obligations under the Europe Agreement itself. As a result, EU law was not directly applicable to Romania.60 (Emphasis added by the Applicant)\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 29.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal further stated in paragraph 692 of the Award that the Europe Agreement and EU State aid law were applicable to assess the EGO 24 regime:\n\nThere seems to be no dispute that, throughout the period during which the Claimants received the EGO 24 incentives (that is, from receipt of European Food's TIC in 1999 until the incentives were abolished in February 2005), the EGO 24 scheme was subject to the state aid regime of the Europe Agreement (which was the operative pre-accession treaty; ER of A. Dashwood, 31). As explained by Prof. Dashwood (with no convincing rebuttal by Romania's experts), under the Europe Agreement regime, the substantive rules to assess the compatibility of the EGO 24 incentives with the common market were the substantive rules of the EU state aid regime contained in Article 87 of the EC Treaty (through the operation of Article 64(2) of the Europe Agreement), as amplified by case law and Commission practice, and as subsequently clarified by the Implementing Rules that were annexed to Decision 4/2000 of the Romania-EU Association Committee (Exh. R-65; C-579). (Emphasis added by the Applicant)\n\n146.\n\nThe Europe Agreement thus imposed international obligations that were binding on Romania from its entry into force. Its Article 64, quoted in paragraphs 180 and 693 of the Award, provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Romania: [...] (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.\n\n2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86, and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.\n\n3. The Association Council shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.\n\n4. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public aid granted by Romania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic situation of Romania, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of five years.\n\n147.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Europe Agreement thus specified that the State aid practices were to be assessed under Article 92 of the TFEU (which became Article 87 of the EC Treaty). This provision, quoted in footnote 9 of the Award, provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n1. Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.\n\n2. The following shall be compatible with the common market:\n\n[...]\n\n3. The following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:\n\n(a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n148.\n\nIn accordance with Article 64(3) of the Europe Agreement, in 2001, the Romanian Association Council enacted Implementing Rules in respect of subsections (1) and (2) of Article 64, which form part of EU law as well as Romanian law.61 By virtue of these rules, the whole body of European competition law, including the rules on prohibition of State aid, was applicable to Romania. However, although the Tribunal had identified these rules as the applicable source, it failed to apply them.\n\n*Id*., para. 27.\n\n149.\n\nIn fact, while the Tribunal found that the Europe Agreement was a \"relevant rule\" of international law, it also found in paragraph 319 of the Award that EU law was not \"directly applicable,\" and, therefore, there was \"no real conflict of treaties.\"62 It went on to find that EU law formed part of the \"factual matrix\"63 of the case and consequently did not enter into a legal analysis of Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement, including the EU rules on State aid.\n\n*Id*., para. 30.\n\nAward, para. 328.\n\n150.\n\nThe Applicant contends that it is clear from the Tribunal's analysis of EGO 24 that the Tribunal failed to apply the rules that it had itself identified as the governing law. The Tribunal concluded that EGO 24 was not inconsistent with EU State aid law, and that there was no obligation on the part of Romania vis-\u00e0-vis other EU Member States (including Sweden), to repeal it. However, nowhere did it actually assess EGO 24 in the context of the EU State aid rules. In particular, in paragraph 691 of the Award, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that \"it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the EGO 24 incentives were compatible with EU law,\" but did not analyze whether the incentives actually were compatible with EU State aid law. Further, in paragraph 703 of the Award, after having concluded that it appeared that the EGO 24 incentives met most of the criteria for regional operating aid, the Tribunal stated that \"[...] the EGO 24 incentives could have reasonably been thought (both by the Romanian government and the Claimants) to be valid regional operating aid under EU law *.* \" According to the Applicant:\n\nThe Tribunal does not construe, in arriving at this conclusion, the applicable law; it does not construe what the applicable law actually permitted; and it doesn't even attempt anywhere in these pages to assess the compatibility of EGO 24 incentives by reference to the requirements of EU State aid law.64\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 35, lines 18-24.\n\n151.\n\nThe Applicant submits that it is clear from the above-referenced rules that the repeal of EGO 24 was mandated by the Europe Agreement and EU State aid law, and that the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion that the decision to repeal EGO 24 led to a violation of the FET standard under the BIT in effect meant an outright conflict of international treaties. On the one hand, Romania must repeal EGO 24 under the Europe Agreement and, on the other hand, the regime could be upheld under the BIT.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal should have either found in favor of a harmonious interpretation of the Europe Agreement and the BIT, or concluded that there was a conflict of obligations under the two. In any event, at a minimum, it should have addressed the material legal issues.65 This failure to apply the applicable law constitutes: (i) a manifest excess of powers; and (ii) a failure to state reasons.\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 37.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, it follows from Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention that the application of the proper law is an essential element of the parties' consent to arbitration, and a failure to apply that law may amount to an excess of powers by the tribunal. Numerous *ad* *hoc* committees have confirmed this principle and stated that, where the failure is manifest, it justifies annulment of the award.66*Ad hoc* committees have identified when such excess is manifest in this context. In *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, the Committee stated that an annullable error would occur \"where the Tribunal admitted a legal principle and then willfully decided to disregard it *.* \"67 Similarly, in *Enron v. Argentina*, the Committee stated that the failure to address a number of essential questions under customary international law (as embodied in Article 25 of the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\" or \"ILC Articles on State Responsibility\"), which had been identified as the applicable legal standard in assessing Argentina's defense of necessity, amounted to a manifest excess of powers.68 It follows that it is insufficient to identify the applicable law: a tribunal must also address issues essential to the question of whether the relevant legal requirements were met.69\n\n*Id*., para. 41.\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 51, quoted in Appl. Mem., para. 42.\n\n*Enron v. Argentina*, para. 368; Transcript, Day 1, pp. 38-39.\n\nAppl. Opening Presentation, slide 16.\n\n154.\n\nAs in *Enron,* the Tribunal in this case failed to apply the applicable law - the Europe Agreement - to the essential questions before it. Had it applied Articles 64 and 69 of the Europe Agreement (as well as the Implementing Rules and Article 87 of the TFEU), it would have reached a different result (that EGO 24 had to be repealed) or concluded that there was in effect a conflict between Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement and those under the BIT.\n\n155.\n\nIn the Applicant's submission, the Tribunal's excess of powers is evident on the face of the Award. The Tribunal found that the Europe Agreement was applicable (paragraph 319), cited it at length (paragraph 692 ff) but did not apply it. Instead, the Tribunal relegated the Europe Agreement to \"the factual matrix.\"70 This was a \"textually obvious and substantively serious\" error that materially affected the outcome of the case.71\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 47.\n\n*Id*., quoting *Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 40.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Applicant is of the view that under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has an obligation to \"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\" The failure to comply with this provision can amount to a failure to state the reasons. As explained in *Vivendi I*, the applicable test:\n\n[E]ntails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.72\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, quoted in Appl. Mem., para. 51.\n\n157.\n\nReasons need to be understandable, adequate and sufficient, and must not be contradictory. Among other annulment case law, the Applicant refers to the statement made by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Lucchetti v. Peru* :\n\nThe failure to state reasons according to Article 52(1)(e) [...] aims at ensuring the parties' right to ascertain whether or to what extent a tribunal's findings are *sufficiently* based on the law and on a proper evaluation of relevant facts.73 (Emphasis added by the Applicant)\n\n*Lucchetti v. Peru*, para. 56.\n\n158.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its non-application of the Europe Agreement and its conclusion that there was no conflict of treaties.\n\n159.\n\nThe Applicant complains that the Tribunal provided no reasons for not applying the international obligations that it had identified in the Europe Agreement to the facts of the case. The only explanation provided by the Tribunal in this regard is contained in paragraph 328 of the Award:\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this regard that the Parties appear to agree that EU law forms part of the \"factual matrix\" of the case. In particular, the Parties agree that the question of EU law may be relevant to determining whether Romania acted fairly and equitably with respect to the Claimants' investments in accordance with Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Tribunal concurs. The overall context of EU accession in general and the pertinent provisions of EU law in particular may be relevant to the determination of whether, *inter alia*, Romania's actions were reasonable in light of all the circumstances, or whether Claimants' expectations were legitimate.\n\n160.\n\nThis statement ignores the fact that law is not a \"fact\" but a set of mandatory principles according to which the facts must be assessed.74\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 61.\n\n161.\n\nAs a result, the Award makes it impossible for the reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusions and thus suffers from \"a total failure to state reasons for a particular point, which is material for the solution.\"75 It is not possible to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal from Point A, i.e. that the Europe Agreement is applicable, to Point B, i.e. that EU law (including EU State aid law applicable under the Europe Agreement) is only part of the factual matrix and not applicable as law. As held in *MINE v. Guinea* and confirmed by numerous *ad hoc* committees, a tribunal is required to demonstrate how it proceeds from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion.76\n\n*Id*., para. 62, quoting *Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 126.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 52, lines 14-25.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal also failed to state reasons for its findings in paragraph 319 of the Award that there was no conflict of treaties. The Tribunal did deal with the question whether EU law played a role in the interpretation of the BIT, but the enquiry (paragraphs 320-326 of the Award) did not concern the application of EU State aid law.77 The statement in paragraph 326 of the Award that the Tribunal \"will interpret each of the various applicable treaties having due regard to the other applicable treaties\" is no proof that it actually did so anywhere in the Award.78 The Tribunal thus contradicted itself in paragraph 319, and this contradiction is tantamount to an absence of reasons.\n\n*Id*., pp. 55-56.\n\n*Id*., p. 57, lines 9-20.\n\n***B. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal applied the law that it identified as being applicable and that the Award does state the reasons on which it is based. They note that the Parties agree that there was no prior agreement on the applicable law pursuant to the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that the Tribunal therefore applied the second sentence of that provision, finding that \"Article 42(2) of the ICSID Convention directs the Tribunal to apply the host state's law (here, Romanian law) and \u2018such rules of international law as may be applicable. *'* \"79 The Tribunal noted in this respect that there was no dispute between the Parties that the primary source of law was the BIT itself, but that the Parties disagreed on the role of other rules of international law, \"in particular rules arising from treaties established under EU law to which Romania and Sweden are parties.\"80\n\nAward, para. 287, quoted in Cl. C-Mem., para. 111.\n\nCl. C-Mem., paras. 109-110; Award, para. 318.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore proceeded to identify the sources: the Europe Agreement, the Accession Treaty and the EC Treaty. Next, it distinguished between the entry into force of these sources: on the one hand, the Europe Agreement, which entered into force in 1995, and, on the other hand, the Accession Treaty and the EC Treaty, which entered into force in 2007. The Tribunal concluded that, because of the temporal distinction, the Europe Agreement was the relevant body of law applicable to the dispute.81\n\n*Id*., para. 116, quoting Award, para. 319.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal further clearly identified the specific international obligations under the Europe Agreement in paragraphs 179-185 of the Award, including Romania's obligation to harmonize its existing and future domestic legislation with that of the Community in the area of competition law and State aid.82 However, the Tribunal also found that Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement did not \"properly subject [Romania] to EU law.\"83 It went on to determine that \"the general context of EU accession must be taken into account when interpreting the BIT,\" but found that:\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal cannot conclude in the abstract (as Romania seems to suggest) that the revocation of the incentives is fair and equitable solely because it was undertaken pursuant to Romania's obligation under the Europe Agreement to harmonize its law with EU law. As previously stated, whether the state's conduct is unfair and inequitable must be assessed in view of all the facts and surrounding circumstances.84 (Emphasis added by the Claimants)\n\nThe caveat was that Romania was to be considered an area falling under the exception of Article 92(3)(a) of the EC Treaty for the first five years following signature, which could be extended for further periods of five years. Cl. C-Mem., para. 127, referring to Award, paras. 180-183.\n\nCl. C-Mem., para. 128, quoting Award, para. 319.\n\n*Id*., para. 146, quoting Award, paras. 513-514.\n\n166.\n\nIn the Claimants' submission, it is therefore plain on the face of the Award that the Tribunal did apply the Europe Agreement. This is also evident from the Tribunal's analysis of Romania's conduct in light of the FET standard in the BIT. It took into consideration EU law in its findings that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the EGO 24 incentives would remain available and that it was reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the regime was compatible with EU law (paragraphs 677-707 of the Award).85\n\n*Id*., paras. 150-152.\n\n167.\n\nRomania's argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law to the question of the lawfulness of EGO 24 must fail because it is at odds with the Applicant's arguments before the Tribunal. The Tribunal did not decide the legality of EGO 24 because the question had not been presented to it. Romania had presented the issue as \"whether Romania acted reasonably in amending EGO 24 in August 2004.\"86 Romania had, in that connection, taken the position that the regime was compatible with the Europe Agreement and did not want the Tribunal to opine on its validity.87 The Tribunal thus addressed the issue before it and found that both Romania and the Claimants could reasonably have thought that EGO 24 was lawful.88 In any event, the question of the lawfulness of EGO 24 was irrelevant to the Tribunal's finding of a breach of the FET standard because the Tribunal found that Romania had created legitimate expectations through its actions by the fact that it had, e.g., reinstated EGO 24 in EGO 75.89\n\n*Id*., para. 175, quoting Award, para. 731; Transcript, Day 1, p. 161, lines 9-25, quoting a letter from Romania's Counsel dated November 16, 2009: \"First, Romania wishes to stress that, whatever view one may take as to the ultimate conformity of EGO 24/1998 with European law, the relevant question in this arbitration is whether in 1998 Romania reasonably took the view that EGO 24/1998 was compliant with Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement.\"\n\n*See* Letter from Romania's Counsel dated November 16, 2009: \"Thus EGO 24/1998 was reasonably considered as falling within the exception in Article 87(3)(a) and 87(3)(c) EC Treaty.\" *See also* Expert Opinion of Prof. Dr. Rudolf Streinz, paras. 19 and 21; Award, para. 712.\n\nAward, paras. 703 and 706.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 165-166, quoting Award, paras. 688, 689, 706, 872.\n\n168.\n\nRomania's argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law to Romania's obligation to repeal EGO 24 must also fail because the Tribunal addressed the issue. Among other statements, the Tribunal indicated that \"it is not evident to the Tribunal that the EU was requesting the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives, and the record shows that it was not evident to Romania either.\"90 In addition, the question was irrelevant to the Tribunal's decision.\n\nAward, para. 768.\n\n169.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal found in paragraph 328 of the Award \"that the Parties appear to agree that EU law forms part of the \u2018factual matrix' of the case,\" because both Parties had pleaded that it was to be taken into consideration as a factual circumstance.\n\n170.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal applied the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\" or \"Vienna Convention\") and concluded that there was no conflict of treaties between the Europe Agreement and the BIT. The Tribunal found that the BIT did not refer to EU accession and that it could therefore not be assumed that the \"EU sought to amend, modify or otherwise detract from the application of the BIT.\"91 The Tribunal further applied the Vienna Convention to the interpretation of the BIT (paragraphs 322-325 of the Award), and finally assumed that Sweden and Romania entered into the BIT as well as into the Europe Agreement in full awareness of their legal obligations (paragraph 326 of the Award).\n\n*Id*., para. 321.\n\n171.\n\nIn the Claimants' submission, the Applicant is attempting to reinvent its case to claim that the whole body of EU competition law formed part of the Europe Agreement or should have been taken into account. This argument rests on a confusion between the Europe Agreement and the \"whole of EU law (i.e. including EU State aid law).\"92 The Europe Agreement merely called for a gradual alignment with EU law, which became *per se* applicable as of the date of Romania's EU accession on January 1, 2007.\n\nCl. Opening Presentation, slide 181.\n\n172.\n\nThe Applicant raises arguments now that it did not raise in the Original Proceeding, e.g. that the Implementing Rules to the Europe Agreement also applied. In fact, Romania argued throughout the Original Proceeding that the Europe Agreement was to be treated as part of the \"factual matrix\" of the case.93 In any event, the Tribunal has addressed in the Award why EU law was not applicable as such.\n\nCl. C-Mem., paras. 163-164.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Claimants agree that a failure to apply the applicable law can amount to an excess of powers, but submit that an incorrect or erroneous application of that law cannot form the basis for annulment of an ICSID award. They also stress the distinction between a failure to apply the law and the application of the law to the facts of the case as determined by the tribunal.\n\n174.\n\nIn this case, Romania is not satisfied with the Tribunal's finding that the \"whole body\" of EU law, including EU State aid law, was not directly applicable by virtue of the Europe Agreement.94 This criticism concerns the correctness of the application of the law rather than its application.95 It is not the Committee's role to review whether the Tribunal correctly applied the Europe Agreement, but simply to verify that the Tribunal applied it. As in *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, this \"is not a case where the Tribunal admitted a legal principle and then willfully decided to disregard it *.* \"96\n\n*Id*., para. 129.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 51, quoted in Cl. C-Mem., para. 171.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the legal standard to establish a manifest excess of powers is \"a heavy burden upon the applicant\"97 and modern jurisprudence on ICSID annulment has set a \"very high threshold\" to show a non-application of the law rather than mere misapplication of the applicable law.98 \"Manifest\" means that the excess must be \"self-evident,\" as stated by the Committee in *Wena*.99 It is not enough that a committee disagrees with the tribunal's decision or reasoning. Romania has failed to establish any excess of powers in this case, let alone manifest.\n\nCl. Opening Presentation, slide 129, quoting *Fraport v. Philippines*, para. 45.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 159, lines 1-8, quoting *AES v. Hungary*, para. 33.\n\n*Id.*, quoting *Wena v. Egypt*, para. 25: \"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other.\"\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimants do not take issue with the legal standard of the ground in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention as articulated in *MINE,* referred to by the Applicant. However, they note that, in order to be successful, an applicant on annulment must show that there is a complete lack of reasons or that it is impossible to follow or even infer the tribunal's reasoning on key findings. Committees may only verify the existence of reasons; they may not consider whether these are right or wrong. Disagreement with or misunderstanding of a tribunal's reasons may therefore not justify an annulment. As noted in *Vivendi I*, \"[\u2026] Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state \u2018any' reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons *.* \"100\n\nCl. Opening Presentation, slide 175, quoting *Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 64 (emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\n177.\n\nIn any event, since the Tribunal did in fact apply the applicable law, there can be no failure to provide reasons. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal provided detailed reasons for each of its findings, and that the Award is exhaustive and can be followed without any difficulty.\n\n***C. Committee's Analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Award is not annullable under the grounds claimed by Romania.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nFirst, the Award is not annullable under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. In the Committee's view, there was no failure to apply the law - which could amount to an excess of powers - let alone a manifest failure, justifying annulment of the Award.101\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 41.\n\n180.\n\nThe Parties agreed that there was no prior agreement on the applicable law pursuant to the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that the Tribunal therefore was entitled to apply the second sentence of that provision, finding that: \"Article 42(2) of the ICSID Convention directs the Tribunal to apply the host state's law and \u2018such rules of international law as may be applicable.'\"102\n\nAward, para. 287.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal noted in this respect that there was no dispute between the Parties that the primary source of law was the BIT itself. However, the Parties disagreed on the role of other rules of international law, \"in particular rules arising from treaties established under EU law to which Romania and Sweden are parties.\"103\n\n*Id.*, para. 318.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal identified the sources of international law that would apply and determined that these were: (i) the Europe Agreement; (ii) the Accession Treaty; and (iii) the EC Treaty. The Europe Agreement entered into force in 1995 and therefore was determined to be the relevant body of law applicable to the dispute.104\n\n*Id.*, para. 319.\n\n183.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal applied the law determined by the residual rule in Article 42(1). In doing so, the Tribunal found that the Europe Agreement was applicable,105 cited it106 and applied it to the essential questions before it.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Id*., paras. 692-696.\n\n184.\n\nThe Committee considers that this case is different from the cases referred to by Romania: *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, where the Committee stated that an annullable error would occur \"where the Tribunal admitted a legal principle and then willfully decided to disregard it\"107; and *Enron v. Argentina*, where the Committee stated that the failure to address a number of essential questions under customary international law which had been identified as the applicable legal standard amounted to a failure to apply the applicable law.108 In the present case, the Tribunal identified the applicable law and addressed issues essential to the question of whether the relevant legal requirements were met.109\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 51, quoted in Appl. Mem., para. 42.\n\n*Enron v. Argentina*, para. 368, referred to in Transcript, Day 1, pp. 38-39.\n\nAppl. Opening Presentation, slide 16.\n\n185.\n\nSpecifically, Romania has argued that the Tribunal failed to apply the Europe Agreement (i) to the question of the lawfulness of EGO 24 and (ii) to Romania's obligation to repeal EGO 24.\n\n186.\n\nIn this case, Romania contests the Tribunal's finding that the \"whole body\" of EU law, including EU State aid law, was not directly applicable by virtue of the Europe Agreement.110 In the Committee's view, this criticism concerns the correctness of the application of the law rather than its application. It is not the Committee's role to review whether the Tribunal correctly applied the Europe Agreement, but simply to verify that the Tribunal applied it.111\n\nAppl. Mem., paras. 21, 27, 30.\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, para. 51, quoted in Cl. C-Mem., para. 171.\n\n187.\n\nRelevant to this case is Article 64 of the Europe Agreement, quoted in paragraphs 180 and 693 of the Award, which provides that:\n\n1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Romania: [...] (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.\n\n2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed *on the basis of criteria arising\\_from the application* of the rules of Articles 85, 86, and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.\n\n3. The Association Council shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.\n\n4. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public aid granted by Romania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Romania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic situation of Romania, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of five years. [...]. (Emphasis added)\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal interpreted this provision and applied the Europe Agreement to the questions posed by Romania, as is evidenced from the following reasoning:\n\n(i) First, the Tribunal identified the specific international obligations under the Europe Agreement in paragraphs 179-185 of the Award, including Romania's obligation to harmonize its existing and future domestic legislation with that of the Community in the area of competition law and State aid.112\n\n(ii) The Tribunal also found that Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement did not \"properly subject [Romania] to EU law.\"113\n\n(iii) It went on to determine that \"the general context of EU accession must be taken into account when interpreting the BIT,\" finding that: \"the Tribunal cannot conclude in the abstract (as Romania seems to suggest) that the revocation of the incentives is fair and equitable solely because it was undertaken pursuant to Romania's obligation under the Europe Agreement to harmonize its law with EU law. As previously stated, whether the state's conduct is unfair and inequitable must be assessed in view of all the facts and surrounding circumstances.\"114 (Emphasis added)\n\nThe caveat was that Romania was to be considered an area falling under the exception of Article 92(3)(a) of the EC Treaty for the first five years following signature, which could be extended for further periods of five years. *See* Award, paras. 180-183.\n\n*Id.*, para. 319.\n\n*Id.*, paras. 513-514.\n\n189.\n\nThus, from a reading of the Award, this Committee concludes that the Tribunal did apply the law it had determined as the applicable law - the Europe Agreement - to the questions posed by Romania.\n\n190.\n\nIn applying the Europe Agreement, the Tribunal noted that the Europe Agreement contained certain obligations under EU law, but did not consider as applicable the whole body of EU competition law, which it noted did not form part of the Europe Agreement and, therefore, gave an explanation for not having considered these regulations.\n\n191.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Award clearly distinguished between the Europe Agreement and the \"whole of EU law (i.e. including EU State aid law).\"115 The Tribunal considered that the Europe Agreement called for a gradual alignment with EU law, which in its reasoning became *per se* applicable as of the date of Romania's EU accession on January 1, 2007. Thus, the Tribunal has addressed in the Award why EU law was not considered applicable by virtue of the Europe Agreement.\n\nCl. Opening Presentation, slide 181.\n\n192.\n\nThe Committee is not convinced by the Applicant's arguments that:\n\n(i) The Tribunal concluded in paragraph 692 of the Award that the Europe Agreement and EU State aid law were applicable to assess the EGO 24 regime and that the Europe Agreement imposed international obligations that were binding on Romania from its entry into force.\n\n(ii) In accordance with Article 64(3) of the Europe Agreement, in 2001, the Romanian Association Council enacted Implementing Rules in respect of subsections (1) and (2) of Article 64, which form part of EU law as well as Romanian law,116 or that these rules, the whole body of European competition law, including the rules on prohibition of State aid, were applicable to Romania.\n\n(iii) The Europe Agreement specified that the State aid practices were to be assessed \"under Article 92\" of the TFEU117 (which became Article 87 of the EC Treaty).\n\n(iv) The repeal of EGO 24 was mandated by the Europe Agreement and EU State aid law, and that the Tribunal's conclusion that the decision to repeal EGO 24 led to a violation of the FET standard under the BIT meant a conflict of international treaties. On the one hand, Romania must repeal EGO 24 under the Europe Agreement and, on the other hand, the regime could be upheld under the BIT.\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 27.\n\nArticle 92 reads:  \n 1. Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.  \n 2. The following shall be compatible with the common market:  \n [\u2026]  \n 3. The following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:  \n (a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment; [\u2026]\n\n193.\n\nIn the Committee's view, *Romania's argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law to the question of the lawfulness of EGO 24* fails because such question was not before the Tribunal. The Tribunal did not decide the legality of EGO 24 because the question had not been presented to it. Romania had presented the issue as \"whether Romania acted reasonably in amending EGO 24 in August 2004.\"118 The Tribunal addressed the issue before it and found that both Romania and the Claimants could reasonably have thought that EGO 24 was lawful.119 Moreover, the Committee is of the view that the question of the lawfulness of EGO 24 was not necessary to the Tribunal's finding of a breach of the FET standard because the Tribunal found that Romania had created legitimate expectations through its actions by the fact that it had, e.g., reinstated EGO 24 in EGO 75.120\n\nCl. C-Mem., para. 175, quoting Award, para. 731; Transcript, Day 1, p. 161, lines 9-25, quoting a letter from Romania's Counsel dated November 16, 2009: \"First, Romania wishes to stress that, whatever view one may take as to the ultimate conformity of EGO 24/1998 with European law, the relevant question in this arbitration is whether in 1998 Romania reasonably took the view that EGO 24/1998 was compliant with Romania's obligations under the Europe Agreement.\"\n\nAward, paras. 703 and 706.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 165-166, quoting Award paras. 688, 689, 706, 872.\n\n194.\n\nRomania's argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law to Romania's obligation to repeal EGO 24 must also fail because the Tribunal addressed the issue. Among other statements, the Tribunal indicated that \"it is not evident to the Tribunal that the EU was requesting the revocation of the EGO 24 incentives, and the record shows that it was not evident to Romania either.\"121 Also, the question was irrelevant to the Tribunal's decision. The Tribunal found in paragraph 328 of the Award \"that the Parties appear to agree that EU law forms part of the \u2018factual matrix' of the case,\" because both Parties had pleaded that it was to be taken into consideration as a factual circumstance.\n\nAward, para. 768.\n\n195.\n\nIn addition, in the Committee's view, the Tribunal applied the VCLT and concluded that there was no conflict of treaties between the Europe Agreement and the BIT. The Tribunal found that the BIT did not refer to EU accession and that it could therefore not be assumed that the \"EU sought to amend, modify or otherwise detract from the application of the BIT.\"122 The Tribunal further applied the Vienna Convention to the interpretation of the BIT,123 and assumed that Sweden and Romania entered into the BIT, as well as into the Europe Agreement, in full awareness of their legal obligations.124\n\n*Id*., para. 321.\n\n*Id*., paras. 322-325.\n\n*Id*., para. 326.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nSecond, the Award is not annullable under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, because reasons have been stated, addressing the questions submitted to the Tribunal, irrespective of whether they are incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive; therefore, the Award cannot be annulled on this ground.125\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina*, para. 181.\n\n197.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, as explained in *Vivendi I*, the applicable test: \"[E]ntails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.\"126 In the Committee's opinion, the Award complies with both conditions.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 65, quoted in Appl. Mem., para. 51.\n\n198.\n\nIn the present case, as in *MINE*, the Award enables one to follow how the Tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and to its conclusions. Under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a committee is only authorized to verify whether the sequence of arguments within an award evidences a logical chain of reasoning that is apt to lead to the conclusion that a tribunal reached.\n\n199.\n\nContrary to the Applicant's assertions,127 the Committee considers that in this case, the Tribunal did not fail to apply the Europe Agreement, nor did it fail to provide reasons for not applying the international obligations that it had identified in the Europe Agreement to the facts of the case.\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 61.\n\n200.\n\nParagraph 328 of the Award reads:\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this regard that the Parties appear to agree that EU law forms part of the \"factual matrix\" of the case. In particular, the Parties agree that the question of EU law may be relevant to determining whether Romania acted fairly and equitably with respect to the Claimants' investments in accordance with Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Tribunal concurs. The overall context of EU accession in general and the pertinent provisions of EU law in particular may be relevant to the determination of whether, *inter alia*, Romania's actions were reasonable in light of all the circumstances, or whether the Claimants' expectations were legitimate.128\n\nAward, para. 319.\n\n201.\n\nThus, the Committee does not share the view of the Applicant that the Award makes it impossible for the reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusions and thus suffers from \"a total failure to state reasons for a particular point, which is material for the solution.\"129 According to the Applicant, it is not possible to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal from Point A, i.e. that the Europe Agreement is applicable, to Point B, i.e. that EU law (including EU State aid law applicable under the Europe Agreement) is only part of the factual matrix and not applicable as law. In the Committee's opinion, the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons to explain why EU law was not directly applicable by virtue of the Europe Agreement.\n\n*Id*., para. 62, quoting *Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 126.\n\n202.\n\nMoreover, the Committee does not share the view that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its findings in paragraph 319 of the Award that there was no conflict of treaties. As stated above, it dealt with this issue in paragraphs 318-326 of the Award.\n\n203.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did apply the applicable law, and that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons for its decision.\n\n**2. FAILURE TO DECIDE ON THE ISSUE OF ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AWARD**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal failed to decide whether Romania was prohibited from paying compensation for repeal of State aid granted under EGO 24 because it would violate the treaties on which the European Union was founded (\"EU Treaties\"). According to the Applicant, both Romania and the EC contended that such compensation, whether voluntary or through enforcement of an award, would be prohibited and would itself constitute State aid. In addition, Romania had argued that the question of legality would affect the construction and application of the FET provision in the BIT. If the EGO 24 regime was illegal State aid, the Claimants could not have a legitimate expectation to benefit from it.130 The Claimants, for their part, had argued that the enforceability of the Award was irrelevant and that an award of damages would not constitute illegal State aid.131\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 61, lines 12-22.\n\nClaimants' Post-hearing Brief in the Original Proceeding, paras. 270-278 (Cl. Exh. CA-33).\n\n205.\n\nFor the Applicant, the Tribunal deliberately declined to decide this issue and, as a result of the compensation awarded to the Claimants, created a conflict of Romania's obligations under the ICSID Convention, on the one hand, and Romania's international obligations under the TFEU, on the other hand. The question was \"a crucial or decisive argument,\" and deciding it might, therefore, have led to a materially different outcome.132 Had the enforceability issue been resolved in favor of Romania, would the Tribunal have construed the FET provision in the BIT as requiring Romania to violate EU State aid law? Would the Tribunal have been prepared to award compensation in the form of illegal State aid to the Claimants?133 In the Applicant's submission, the Tribunal would not. However, even if this were not true, the determinative issue is that the outcome of the Award could have been different.\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 71, quoting Ch. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed, 2009), Article 52, para. 426 (Appl. Exh. RAL-57).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 66, lines 8-14.\n\n206.\n\nInstead of dealing with the question, the Tribunal stated:\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters. It is thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been rendered. It will thus not address the Parties' and the Commission's arguments on enforceability of the Award.134\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 72, quoting Award, para. 340.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to suggest that Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention on the recognition and enforcement of ICSID awards \"apply in any event to the Award.\"135 Thus, the Parties put the issue before the Tribunal, and the Tribunal acknowledged the issue but failed to decide it. This is evident from the text of paragraph 340 of the Award. Despite the Claimants' submission that the Tribunal addressed the issue and found that it was irrelevant, there was no determination on that point by the Tribunal, and so it obviously cannot have found that it was irrelevant.136\n\n*Id.*, quoting Award, para. 341.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 68, lines 9-13.\n\n208.\n\nThe Applicant thus contends that the Tribunal's failure to decide the issue provides two bases for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers; and (ii) failure to state reasons.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nWhere a tribunal fails to exercise its jurisdiction, that failure can require annulment under Article 52(1)(b). This includes circumstances where a tribunal violates its duty to deal with one or more questions presented to it by the parties. The Applicant lists three authorities for this proposition: *Amco I v. Indonesia*, *Helnan v. Egypt* and *Duke Energy v. Peru*.137 While *Amco I* relied on Article 48(3) of the Convention as a predicate for its analysis, recent committees, such as *Helnan* and *Duke Energy*, have taken a broader view and relied on the tribunal's duty to \"fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by virtue of the parties' agreement.\"138\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Annulment, May 16, 1986 (\" *Amco I v. Indonesia* \") (Appl. Exh. RAL-51); *Helnan v. Egypt* ; *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28), Decision on Annulment, March 1, 2011 (\" *Duke Energy v. Peru* \") (Cl. Exh. CAL-39).\n\n*Helnan v. Egypt*, para. 41. *See also* *Duke Energy v. Peru*, para. 97.\n\n210.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal expressly acknowledged the question put to it and expressly declined to answer it, thus failing to fulfil the mandate entrusted to the Tribunal and resulting in an excess of powers. The failure is \"self-evident\"139 and \"capable of making a difference to the result,\"140 thus amounting to a \"manifest\" excess of powers.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, para. 25.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 86.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal also failed to state the reasons for its decision not to decide the enforceability issue. It declined to rule on the Claimants' submission that the issue was irrelevant to the merits. Its remark that it did not wish to embark on predictions as to the future conduct of other persons or authorities is not a reasoning that addresses the Parties' arguments.141 According to the Applicant:\n\n[A] mere reproduction by the Tribunal of Articles 53 and 54 - coupled with the self-evident statement that those provisions \"apply\" - was not a reason for failing to decide whether the application of those provisions at the same time as EU law on State aid should have affected the Tribunal's adjudication of Romania's obligations under the [BIT], and/or any remedy to be granted.142\n\nAppl. Rep., para. 110.\n\n*Id.*, para. 111.\n\n212.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal's failure to state reasons on this point also requires annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***B. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, although the Tribunal did not make an affirmative decision on the issue of enforceability of the Award, it is clear that it dealt with it.143 The Tribunal considered the Parties' arguments as well as the EC's position, and ultimately held that it was not relevant to take a substantive decision on the issue for the purposes of this case. The Claimants had argued just that as their primary position: the irrelevance of the enforceability issue to the merits of the case.\n\nCl. Rej., para. 224.\n\n214.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Romania misrepresents that the question before the Tribunal was whether the Tribunal should predict possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award was rendered. They submit that it is evident from paragraph 330 of the Award that the question before the Tribunal was to determine whether it was useful for the Tribunal to decide if the Award would be unenforceable in the EU.144 Paragraph 330 of the Award indicates that the Tribunal clearly envisaged that it was to determine whether the issue in question was relevant to the issues before it. It stated that: \"[p]rior to determining whether it is useful for the Tribunal to decide this question [...] the Tribunal will set out the Parties' positions *.* \" Having set out those positions, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that:\n\n[I]t is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters. It is thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been rendered. It will thus not address the Parties' and the Commission's arguments on enforceability of the Award.145\n\n*Id*., para. 233.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 179-180, quoting Award, para. 340.\n\n215.\n\nReading paragraph 330 together with paragraph 340, it is thus clear that the Tribunal dealt with the issue and found that it was not useful to determine whether the Award would be unenforceable. This is reinforced by paragraph 341 of the Award, in which the Tribunal noted Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, observing that these provisions \"apply in any event to the Award.\" The statement re-emphasizes the Tribunal's determination in paragraph 319 of the Award that EU law was not directly applicable, and that the ICSID Convention was controlling with respect to the enforceability of the Award.146\n\n*Id*., p. 181, lines 1-13.\n\n216.\n\nEven if the Tribunal had not dealt with Romania's unenforceability argument, it would not be a violation of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. Article 48(3) does not require a tribunal to comment on all arguments, in particular arguments that the tribunal has already found to be irrelevant to the merits. As stated in *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* :\n\nIf the arguments of the parties have been correctly summarized and all the claims have been addressed, there is no need explicitly to address each and every one of the arguments raised in support of the particular claims, and it is in the discretion of the tribunal not to do so.147\n\n*Id*., p. 185, lines 19-25, quoting *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, para. 84.\n\n217.\n\nIndeed, *ad hoc* committees have found that the \"question[s]\" that the tribunal must deal with refer to the parties' heads of claims.148 In particular, the *Alapli v. Turkey* Committee stated that:\n\nIt is the *ad hoc* Committee's view that Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention refers to the tribunal's obligation to deal with, either directly or indirectly, the parties' heads of claim within its award.149\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina* ; *Alapli v. Turkey*.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 183-184, quoting *Alapli v. Turkey*, para. 120.\n\n218.\n\nAn omission by a tribunal to decide a question can thus only amount to an annullable ground in limited circumstances where the defect meets the standard of a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. It cannot amount to a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b).\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, even if the Tribunal had violated Article 48(3) of the Convention, this would not have constituted an excess of power, let alone a *manifest* excess of power. Article 48(3) is not intended to be a ground for annulment. If a party is discontent that the tribunal has not addressed a question, the proper remedy is to request a supplementary decision or interpretation of the award.150\n\nCl. Rej., para. 241.\n\n220.\n\nThere is a distinction between an excess arising from the rejection of a jurisdiction that exists and a violation of Article 48(3). The Claimants agree that rejecting an existing jurisdiction may amount to an excess of powers, but contend that the authorities listed by the Applicant do not support the proposition that there is such non-exercise of jurisdiction when the tribunal fails to deal with a question put to it by the parties.151 For example, in *Helnan v. Egypt*, the Committee found that:\n\nThe analysis of Professor W. Michael Reisman [...] to the effect that the requirements of Article 48(3) of the Convention are not to be carried into Article 52(1)(e) is accepted by this Committee as correct.152\n\n*Id*., para. 245.\n\n*Id*., para. 246, quoting *Helnan v. Egypt*, para. 36, fn. 34.\n\n221.\n\nEven if the Tribunal had failed to deal with a question and this somehow constituted an excess of powers, such excess would not be manifest. A manifest excess must be obvious and discernable without elaborate analysis of the award and must be material to the outcome of the case. The hypothetical excess in this case does not meet these criteria. It is plain from the face of the Award that the Tribunal dealt with the issue of unenforceability. Moreover, such finding would have in any event not affected the outcome of the case because the repeal of EGO 24 incentives as such was not the basis for the Tribunal's finding that Romania breached the BIT.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimants agree that a violation of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention could amount to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention if the criteria for that ground are met. In the Claimants' submission, the requirement to state reasons is met as soon as there are reasons that enable the reader to understand what motivated the tribunal. The findings by the Committee in *Vivendi I v. Argentina* are instructive in this case. Among other things, the Committee ruled that an annullable error requires that the issue which has not been addressed as part of the tribunal's reasons must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.153\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 192, lines 15-21, referencing *Vivendi v. Argentina*, paras. 64-65.\n\n223.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal has stated reasons which can be followed and which enable the reader to understand what motivated the Tribunal. It simply decided that the enforcement issue was not necessary to its decision. The Tribunal noted that matters of EU law would only be relevant at the enforcement stage and stated that it did not wish to speculate what would happen in the post-award phase. Therefore, even if the Tribunal had failed to deal with a question and to provide reasons that met the applicable minimum standard, the alleged error has not affected the outcome of the Award.\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimants finally note that Romania may disagree with the Tribunal's conclusions and reasons, but such dissatisfaction cannot amount to a ground for annulment. *Ad hoc* committees cannot inquire into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons, meaning that the correctness of the reasons is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n***C. Committee's Analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Applicant has argued that the Tribunal's failure to decide the issue of unenforceability provides two bases for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers; and (ii) failure to state reasons. The Committee addresses each of these grounds below and explains why they fail.\n\n*(i) Manifest Excess of Powers*\n-------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nIt is plain from the face of the Award that the Tribunal dealt with the issue of unenforceability. Moreover, such finding would have in any event not affected the outcome of the case because the repeal of EGO 24 incentives as such was not the basis for the Tribunal's finding that Romania breached the BIT.\n\n227.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal failed to decide whether Romania was prohibited from paying compensation for repeal of State aid granted under EGO 24 because it would violate the EU treaties. According to the Applicant, both Romania and the EC contended that such compensation, whether voluntary or through enforcement of an award, would be prohibited and would itself constitute State aid. In addition, Romania had argued that the question of legality would affect the construction and application of the FET provision in the BIT. If the EGO 24 regime was illegal State aid, the Claimants could not have legitimate expectations to benefit from it.154\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 61, lines 12-22.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, argued that the enforceability of the Award was irrelevant and that an award of damages would not constitute illegal State aid.155 The Claimants submit that, although the Tribunal did not make an affirmative decision on the issue of enforceability of the Award, it is clear that it dealt with it.156 The Claimants state that the issue that the Tribunal determined is expressly set out in paragraph 330 of the Award.157\n\nClaimants' Post-hearing Brief in the Original Proceeding, paras. 270-278.\n\nCl. Rej., para. 224.\n\n*Id*., para. 233.\n\n229.\n\nThis Committee notes that the Tribunal dealt with the question of enforceability of the Award, as is evident from the following content:\n\n(i) Paragraph 319 of the Award states that EU law was not directly applicable, and that the ICSID Convention was controlling with respect to the enforceability of the Award.\n\n(ii) Paragraph 330 of the Award indicates that the Tribunal clearly envisaged that it was to determine whether the issue in question was relevant to the issues before it. It stated that: \"[p]rior to determining whether it is useful for the Tribunal to decide this question [\u2026] the Tribunal will set out the Parties' positions *.* \"\n\n(iii) In paragraphs 331-339 of the Award, the Tribunal sets forth the position of the Parties and of the EC. It states that the Respondent contends that an award of damages would constitute impermissible State aid. It refers to the Claimants' position that the issues regarding enforcement of an award are irrelevant to the decision on the substance of the claim. Also, it indicates that the Claimants deny that considerations relating to the enforcement of the Award should affect the interpretation of the BIT or the Tribunal's decision as to whether Romania has breached certain provisions of the BIT.\n\n(iv) In paragraph 340 of the Award, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that:\n\n[I]t is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters. It is thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been rendered. It will thus not address the Parties' and the Commission's arguments on enforceability of the Award. (Emphasis added)\n\n(v) In paragraph 341 of the Award, the Tribunal notes Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, observing that these provisions \"apply in any event to the Award.\"\n\n230.\n\nIn the Committee's view, from the reading of the above-referenced paragraphs and from an integral reading of the Award, it is clear that the Tribunal dealt with the issue posed by Romania. The Tribunal gave reasons for its conclusion that it was not useful to determine whether the Award would be unenforceable: it considered that this was not an issue before the Tribunal because it was not its duty to address the potential non-enforceability of the Award after it had been rendered.\n\n231.\n\nThe Applicant's arguments that the question was \"a crucial or decisive argument,\" and that, had the Tribunal decided it, it might have led to a materially different outcome in the Award, do not convince this Committee.158 This Committee is not vested with powers to speculate on the merits, which would be required to address some of the questions posed by Romania:\n\n[L]et me ask you to assume that the Tribunal had addressed the enforceability issue and had resolved it in Romania's favour, deciding that an award of compensation based on the unpaid subsidies would constitute incompatible state aid. In that event, would the Tribunal have construed the FET provision in the investment treaty with another European Union State as requiring Romania to violate its obligations under EU state aid law? Would they have done that? Would the Tribunal have been prepared to award the Claimants compensation in the form of illegal State aid *?*159\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 71, quoting Ch. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed, 2009), Article 52, para. 426 (Appl. Exh. RAL-57).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 66, lines 8-14.\n\n232.\n\nThis speculative reasoning and its impact on the merits of the case is outside the scope of the annulment proceeding.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe findings by the Committee in *Vivendi I v. Argentina* are in this case instructive. Among other things, the Committee ruled that an annullable error requires that the issue which has not been addressed as part of the tribunal's reasons must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.160\n\n*Id*., p. 192, lines 15-21, referencing *Vivendi v. Argentina*, paras. 64-65.\n\n234.\n\nIn this Committee's view, in the case-at-hand, the Tribunal has stated reasons which can be followed and which enable the reader to understand what motivated the Tribunal. The Tribunal simply decided that the enforcement issue was not necessary to the Tribunal's decision and that matters of EU law would only be relevant at the post-award phase.\n\n235.\n\nIn conclusion, this Committee considers that the Tribunal did not fail to exercise its jurisdiction and addressed the question put to it by determining it was not relevant to the merits of the case.\n\n**3. FAILURE TO REQUIRE EACH CLAIMANT TO PROVE THAT IT SUFFERED HARM AND TO AWARD COMPENSATION TO EACH CLAIMANT ONLY FOR THE HARM IT PROVED**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Award must be annulled because the Tribunal \"failed to require any of the five Claimants, or the Claimants collectively, to quantify and prove the amount of damages that it or they had suffered; and instead issued a \u2018collective award' in favor of all five Claimants for harm incurred by the EFDG as a whole.\"161 The EFDG was a group of thirteen companies, only three of which were the Corporate Claimants and five of which were non-Party companies which had allegedly also suffered losses in this case (\"NonParty Companies\").\n\nAppl. Opening Presentation, p. 7.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected the Claimants' request to award all compensation to the Individual Claimants because the Corporate Claimants had sought the same relief and the Tribunal had to, therefore, decide the claims raised by all five Claimants.162 Moreover, the Tribunal noted that awarding compensation to the Individual Claimants would only deprive the Corporate Claimants of the amounts owed to them in favor of their shareholders, and preclude them from paying their debts.163 The Tribunal then concluded that it likewise could not award the entirety of the compensation to the Corporate Claimants because a portion of the damages were owed to the Non-Party Companies within the EFDG, and the Corporate Claimants were not entitled to such damages.164\n\nAward, para. 1236.\n\n*Id*., para. 1237.\n\n*Id*., paras. 1135 and 1321.\n\n238.\n\nHowever, having held that the Individual Claimants could not recover compensation for the Corporate Claimants' losses and that the Corporate Claimants could not recover compensation for the Non-Party Companies' losses, the Tribunal issued \"an Award that has both of these consequences.\"165 As a result, according to the Applicant, the Award:\n\n(i) allows any Claimant to recover the entire amount of the compensation that Romania was ordered to pay, and allows the Claimants to allocate damages among themselves however they agree;\n\n(ii) allows any Claimant, whether Corporate or Individual, to collect compensation arising from harm suffered by the Non-Party Companies despite the absence of evidence showing how such harm to a third party resulted in damage to a Claimant; and\n\n(iii) allows the Claimants to organize distribution of their collective entitlement to the compensation payable under the Award in a manner that allows the Corporate Claimants to avoid paying their debts, including the significant taxation debts that the Tribunal acknowledged.\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 93.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants' enforcement proceedings in respect of the Award show that these consequences pose real concerns, as, among other things, Mr. Viorel Micula seeks to enforce the total amount of the Award in the United States.166\n\n*Id*., para. 95.\n\n240.\n\nAs a result of the Tribunal's holdings on the proof and allocation of damages, the Award must be annulled due to a: (i) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (ii) failure to state the reasons on which the Award was based.167\n\nThe Application also raised the ground of manifest excess of powers in respect of this alleged flaw in the Award; however, that ground was not pleaded in the Applicant's subsequent submissions.\n\n*(i) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, rules on evidence and burden of proof are fundamental rules of procedure, and a serious departure from such rules may warrant an annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention. This has been confirmed by numerous annulment committees - *Impregiio S.p.A. v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina, Klockner v. Cameroon II, Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, *Pey Casado v. Chile*, *Fraport v. Philippines*, and *MINE v. Guinea*168 - as well as by the International Court of Justice.\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 98, citing *Impregilo v. Argentina*, para. 165; Transcript, Day 2, p. 53, lines 1-14, referencing *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 17, 1990 (\" *Klockner v. Cameroon II* \"), para. 6.8 (Cl. Exh. CAL-78) (\"a reversal of the burden of proof could well lead to a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure\") and citing *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, para. 97 (\"a breach of the general principles on burden of proof can also lead to an infringement of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention\"). The Applicant also references *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, para. 73 (Cl. Exh. CAL-76) (\"Fundamental rules of procedure are procedural rules that are essential to the integrity of the arbitral process and must be observed by all ICSID Tribunals. The parties agree that such rules include the right to be heard, the fair and equitable treatment of the parties, proper allocation of the burden of proof and absence of bias\"); *Fraport v. Philippines*, paras. 185 and 187 (\"The Commentary further confirms that \u2018the right to be heard, including due opportunity to present proofs and arguments' is one such fundamental rule of procedure. [\u2026] This context to the formulation in Article 52(1)(d) demonstrates that a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure' is intended to denote procedural rules which may properly be said to constitute \u2018general principles of law,' insofar as such rules concern international arbitral procedure\"); *MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.05 (\"A first comment on this provision concerns the term \u2018serious.' In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure' must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\").\n\n242.\n\nA part of these rules is the principle \"that the burden of proving a fact necessary to support an allegation lies with the party making that allegation.\"169 The Applicant contends that this also applies to proving damages. A party is not required to show with certainty the damage it has suffered, but the assessment \"cannot be based on conjecture or speculation.\"170 An award of damages where a party has clearly not met the burden of proof to show damages, in effect reversing the burden of proof, thus constitutes a serious departure from this fundamental evidentiary rule.\n\nAppl. Mem., paras. 99-100.\n\n*Id*., para. 99, citing *Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v. Republic of Tajikistan* (SCC Case No. V (064/2008)), Final Award, June 8, 2010, para. 39 (Appl. Exh. RAL-68).\n\n243.\n\nIn this case, although it was clear from paragraph 459 of the Award that the burden of proof was on the Claimants, the Tribunal did not require any Claimant to prove any loss suffered by that Claimant.171 The Tribunal stated that:\n\nThus, to the extent that the Individual Claimants can prove their ownership of the [Non-Party Companies] and can prove that they have been affected in this regard by the Respondent's breaches of the BIT, the Tribunal finds that claims for losses suffered by the Individual Claimants through those other companies are within the scope of permissible damages claims.172\n\nAppl. Rep., para. 128.\n\nAward, para. 935.\n\n244.\n\nAlthough the Applicant agrees with this statement, it stresses that there are two cumulative conditions that must be satisfied: (i) the Claimants must prove that the Individual Claimants owned the Non-Party Companies; and (ii) the Individual Claimants must prove that *they* suffered losses as a result of breaches of the BIT.173 The Applicant argues that neither of these conditions was fulfilled. While the non-fulfillment of the first ground does not amount to an annullable ground, the failure to impose a burden of proof concerning the damages due to the Claimants does.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 91-92.\n\n245.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal concluded that \"[t]he Individual Claimants can claim for damages that they have suffered by virtue of the harm to [the Non-Party Companies] as well as the harm to the Corporate Claimants.\"174 According to the Applicant, the crucial words are \"that they have suffered.\"175 However, on that question, whether each of the Claimants had suffered harm, the Tribunal imposed no burden of proof at all.176 It stated that:\n\n[N]either the Claimants nor their experts have provided a figure for the damages suffered by each Claimant, or stated in what proportion these damages should be distributed. Nor does the record contain clear elements that would allow the Tribunal to carry out such an allocation. There is, therefore, no evidentiary basis for allocating the damages.177\n\nAward, para. 943.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 95.\n\n*Id.*, pp. 94-95.\n\nAward, para. 1243, cited in Appl. Rep., para. 138.\n\n246.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal awarded the collective compensation considering that 99.96% of the entire EFDG (including the Corporate Claimants) was completely owned by the Individual Claimants. According to the Applicant, such assertion did not abrogate the need for the Individual Claimants to prove two things: first, that the Non-Party Companies actually suffered harm, and what the amount of that harm was; and second, that harm to the NonParty Companies and Corporate Claimants caused loss to the Individual Claimants as shareholders, through either loss of dividends or loss in value of the shares.178\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 103; Transcript, Day 1, pp. 91-92.\n\n247.\n\nDebts of the Non-Party Companies and the Corporate Claimants, as well as other factors, needed to be considered in order to establish the value of the shares of the Corporate Claimants, and, consequently, the harm suffered by their shareholders, the Individual Claimants. There was undisputed evidence of the Corporate Claimants' (and the Non-Party Companies') substantial debts. Yet, given that the Individual Claimants own \"virtually all\" of the shareholding in the EFDG companies, the Tribunal awarded them (and collectively with them, the Corporate Claimants) substantial compensation arising from the harm suffered by the Non-Party Companies and the Corporate Claimants without being subjected to the burden of proving any of the relevant factors.179\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 102, citing Award, para. 1245.\n\n248.\n\nThe Applicant emphasizes that proof of ownership is not proof of harm.180 On the question relevant to compensation, which is harm rather than ownership, no burden of proof was imposed; and there was no evidence that could satisfy it, because the Claimants did not even seek to show what, if any, harm had been suffered by them. Awarding the Claimants compensation for harm suffered by eight companies in the EFDG was not just a question of the merits of the dispute, nor was it just a question of methods of quantification of compensation. The shareholder losses were not the same as the companies' losses. A shareholder must prove that it has suffered harm and the quantum of such harm.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 96 and 102.\n\n249.\n\nIt was thus an error by the Tribunal that it did not impose on the Claimants any burden of proof as to whether they had suffered any harm. According to Romania, that is a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and the departure is \"serious\" for the purposes of Article 52(1)(d), in the sense that it deprived Romania of the benefit or protection that the rule was intended to provide.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal relied on contradictory reasons for its decision not to allocate compensation between the Claimants and, as a result, failed to state the reasons upon which the Award was based for the purposes of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n251.\n\nAccording to Romania, the contradiction can be summarized as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal refused to issue an award solely to the individual Claimants on the bases that such an award would allow them to circumvent the corporate Claimants' creditors; that's paragraph 1237. It refused to issue an award solely to the Corporate Claimants on the bases that the Corporate Claimants ought not to recover compensation associated with losses sustained by the Non-Party Companies - that's paragraph 1242 - and bearing in mind that it was not possible to determine how much had been suffered by any particular company or individual.\n\nBut then - this is the contradiction - the Tribunal explained that it would issue a collective award which, at the discretion of the Claimants as to how to apportion their common entitlement, permits the Individual Claimants to recover ahead of the Corporate Claimants' creditors, and which permits the Corporate Claimants to recover for losses sustained by Non-Party Companies.181\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 109, lines 3-21.\n\n252.\n\nAlthough Romania acknowledges that Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention does not permit an *ad hoc* committee to scrutinize the substance of a tribunal's reasoning, it argues that the purpose of the ground is to ensure that the tribunal has articulated reasons that are \"reasonably sustainable and capable of providing a basis for the decision.\"182 The reasons set out in an award must give its reader a basis for understanding the tribunal's conclusions.183 Thus, if a tribunal's reasons are contradictory, they may justify annulment under Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, contradictory reasons will not enable a reader to understand the tribunal's motives. In strict logic, they are as useful as no reasons at all.184\n\n*Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985 *(\"Klockner v. Cameroon I\"),* para. 119 (Appl. Exh. RAL-50), cited in Appl. Mem., p. 21.\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.09.\n\nC. Schreuer with L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed. 2009), paras. 388-392 (2009) (Appl. Exh. RAL-54).\n\n253.\n\nFor example, in *Amco I*,185 the Award employed contradictory reasoning that led to its annulment. Indonesia's foreign investment law provided that only equity capital would qualify as a foreign investment. The Tribunal referred to this provision as \"exclud[ing] loans from the foreign capital that the [investor] undertook to invest.\" Yet, when it came to calculating the amount of the investor's investment, the Tribunal referred to the investor's issued share capital as including a $1 million loan. In annulling the Award under Article 53(1)(e), the *ad hoc* Committee stated: \"The *ad hoc* Committee acknowledges that the Tribunal was aware of the rule excluding loan funds from the foreign capital investment [...] and therefore concludes that the Tribunal seems to have contradicted itself.\"186\n\n*Amco I v. Indonesia*, paras. 43 and 110.\n\n*Id*., para. 97.\n\n254.\n\nRomania contends that the Tribunal made a similarly annullable error in this case. It expressly stated that the Corporate Claimants were not entitled to recover compensation arising from loss suffered by the Non-Party Companies. It also expressly stated that the Individual Claimants could not recover all of the losses sustained by the Corporate Claimants. Then, in the space of a couple of pages, the Tribunal declined to allocate compensation between the Claimants and issued a \"collective\" award enabling each Claimant to recover all of the collective losses of the EFDG, or to decide or compete among themselves with respect to allocation of the total amount of compensation.\n\n255.\n\nIn Romania's view, the Tribunal's reasoning is thus contradictory since: (a) the Tribunal's decision to award compensation collectively to all five Claimants has no discernible rationale and contradicts reasons that the Tribunal did give; and (b) if the Tribunal had required each Claimant to prove his or its own loss, then in the admitted absence of such proof, the Tribunal would not have ordered compensation to be paid to that Claimant.\n\n256.\n\nAddressing the Claimants' defense that this ground is time barred, Romania states that the level of \"detail\" required by Rule 50(1) is far exceeded by Romania's Application, which sets out the Tribunal's contradictory reasons coupled with the applicable text of Article 52(1)(e). Section V of the Application, dealing with the Tribunal's failure to require each Claimant to prove the harm it suffered, sets out the reasons employed by the Tribunal that Romania alleges are contradictory. Specifically, Romania points out the contradiction between the Tribunal's twin conclusions that all the compensation could not be awarded to either the Individual or Corporate Claimants, and \"nonetheless\" that it would issue a \"collective\" award entitling any or all of the Individual or Corporate Claimants to recover the compensation.187\n\n*See* Application, para. 20; Appl. Rep., paras.142-152.\n\n257.\n\nThe phrase \"in detail\" in Rule 50(1)(c) has been interpreted by *ad hoc* committees to mean that there is sufficient detail to enable the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) to be identified and understood.\n\n***B. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with Romania's contention that the Tribunal found that it was unnecessary for any Claimant to prove that it had suffered any harm. According to them, it is clear in the Award that the Tribunal expressly \"established that both the Corporate and Individual Claimants were harmed *.* \"188\n\nAward, para. 1245.\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal established the burden and standard of proof in Section VII of the Award, stating: \"Individual Claimants can claim for damages that they have suffered by virtue of the harm to those companies as well as the harm to the Corporate Claimants.\"189 The Tribunal further found that the Claimants had proven two categories of damages - increased costs and lost profits - amounting to RON 376,433,229. It rejected Romania's contention that each Claimant must specify and prove its individual harm.\n\n*Id*., para. 943, quoted in the Claimants' Opening Presentation Handout entitled \"The Collective Damages Issue,\" p. 2.\n\n260.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants purport that the alleged error cannot amount to a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure since there is no fundamental rule of procedure requiring each claimant to specify and prove its individual loss where several claimants appear jointly. In other words, there is no rule that claimants cannot be granted damages based on their combined loss.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Romania appears to be complaining that findings made by the Tribunal are at odds with *potential consequences* of the Award, not that different findings in the Award are irreconcilable.190 The purported contradiction rests on a wholly unfounded assumption that the Individual Claimants would use the Award to \"defraud the creditors\" of the corporate entities.191 Even if that had been possible and plausible, it is irrelevant when assessing whether or not the Award fails to include reasons. The Claimants also assert that Romania is attempting to re-argue a substantive law issue, as rules on allocation of the burden of proof and assessment of evidence are substantive, not procedural, in nature. Therefore, both of the grounds for annulment raised by the Applicant must be rejected. In effect, Romania's grounds for annulment constitute an attempt at a disguised appeal to the Award.\n\nCl. C-Mem., para. 280.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*(i) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in order for Romania to succeed on the ground under Article 52(1)(d), it has to identify a fundamental rule of procedure and prove that there was a serious departure from such rule. Romania has failed on both of these requirements.\n\n263.\n\nFirst, Romania has created and relies on an alleged fundamental rule of procedure that \"the burden of proving a fact necessary to support an allegation lies with the party making that allegation,\" which Romania says \"includes proof of loss.\"192 ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) sets out that the Tribunal is the judge of the probative value of any evidence. As a result, the Claimants purport that \"the Tribunal's assessment of evidence and its conclusions as to whether in a particular case the burden of proof has been met concern the merits and cannot constitute grounds for annulment.\"193\n\n*Id*., para. 312, quoting Appl. Mem., para. 99.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n264.\n\nIn any event, not every rule of procedure is fundamental in nature. Fundamental rules of procedure are principles of natural justice and involve the integrity and essential fairness of the process, or minimal standards of procedure as a matter of international law.194 The Claimants point out that the text of ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(d) is taken without amendment from Article 35(c) of the ILC Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure, and that the official commentary thereto states that this annulment ground concerns errors that affect the fundamental characteristics of the arbitral process. The ILC enunciated the test for whether a procedural rule is fundamental as follows: \"Does the departure constitute a deprivation of a fundamental right so as to cause the arbitration and the resulting award to lose its judicial character.\"195 The commentary mentions as a fundamental rule of procedure \"[t]he right to be heard, including due opportunity to present proof and arguments.\"196\n\n*Id*., paras. 299 and 302, referring to *CDC v. Seychelles*, para. 49, and *Wena v. Egypt*, para. 57.\n\n*Id*., para. 300, quoting ILC, \"Commentary on the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure adopted by the International Law Commission at its Fifth Session, prepared by the Secretariat of the United Nations,\" pp.109-110 (Cl. Exh. CAL-77).\n\n*Id*., para. 110.\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the authorities submitted by Romania do not establish that there is a rule - let alone a fundamental rule - of procedure that joint claimants cannot be awarded damages on the basis of their collective losses. As a tribunal enjoys discretion on matters of evidence and the burden of proof, its assessment can only constitute a deviation from a fundamental rule of procedure if it violates the integrity of the procedure and the basic requirement of equal treatment relating to the right to be heard. In the present case, the Tribunal has not treated the Parties unequally nor reversed any burden of proof. The Parties agreed, and the Tribunal recognized, that the Claimants had the burden of proving their losses.\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimants further explain that Romania's argument concerning the rule it relies on:\n\n[r]ests on five words from *Impregilo* to which Romania attaches a connotation that is not supported by that case. Romania asserts that the *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo v. Argentina* \" *confirmed that rules as to* \u2018 *evidence and burden of proof* ' *are fundamental rules of procedure* \", where only the phrase \" *evidence and burden of proof* \" is cited from the case. Romania seeks to draw from this the conclusion that all rules *\"as to\"* evidence and burden of proof are fundamental rules of procedure. Romania then goes on to identify a rule relating to the burden of proof. However, the *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo v. Argentina* did not state, or even imply, that all rules as to evidence and burden of proof are fundamental *.*197 (Emphasis added by the Claimants)\n\n*Id*., para. 321, quoting Appl. Mem., para 98, referring to *Impregilo v. Argentina*, para. 165.\n\n267.\n\nThe *Impregilo* Committee only listed procedural issues in relation to which other committees - *Amco I v. Indonesia, Klockner v. Cameroon* and *Wena v. Egypt -* identified fundamental rules of procedure and did not define what is included in the phrase. The other cases also did not support that assertion.\n\n268.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, *ad hoc* committees have only found a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in exceptional circumstances when a party was not afforded the opportunity to present its case and do not delve into the nature of an erroneous reversal of a burden of proof.198 While such reversal could, in theory, constitute a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, it must be tied to a violation of the integrity of the procedure and the basic requirement of equal treatment and the right to be heard.199\n\n*Id*., paras. 304-310.\n\n*Id.*, para. 310; Transcript, Day 1, p. 213.\n\n269.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, even if there existed a fundamental rule of procedure of the kind alleged by the Applicant, it bears no relation to the error that Romania alleges the Tribunal has made. Romania argues that the Tribunal should not have been satisfied with the fact that the Claimants had actually proven the quantum of their losses, and should have required each Claimant to prove its *individual* loss.\n\n270.\n\nIf Romania's argument were correct, it would not fall under the supposedly fundamental rule relied on by Romania. The rule relied on by Romania is that a party making an allegation has the burden of proving that allegation. Romania's argument fails to take into account that the Claimants did not allege or claim compensation for individual losses in the arbitration. They did, however, allege - and prove - collective losses.200\n\nCl. C-Mem., para. 314.\n\n271.\n\nIn conclusion, neither the principle relied on by Romania, nor the principle that would need to exist to match the Tribunal's alleged deviation, constitutes a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n272.\n\nHowever, even if the Tribunal had departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, the departure would not have been \"serious.\" For a departure to be \"serious,\" the Applicant would need to show that it: (i) deprived the party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide; and (ii) caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have, had the rule been observed.201 The Applicant has proven neither of these conditions. First, the benefit or protection that a party not be ordered to pay compensation unless the other party proves a loss is a substantive benefit rather than a procedural benefit. In this respect, the Tribunal noted that:\n\nHaving established that both the Corporate and Individual Claimants were harmed, the Tribunal is not comfortable with declining to award damages to one group or the other simply because it lacks the information needed to allocate the damages among them.202\n\nCl. Rej., para. 301.\n\nAward, para. 1245.\n\n273.\n\nSecond, the suggestions that the Tribunal would not have awarded any compensation to the Claimants had it assessed the burden of proof differently also goes to the merits. Moreover, the latter statement is incorrect. Even if each Claimant had been required to prove its individual loss, the Tribunal's findings show that the Individual Claimants would have each been awarded virtually 50% of the total damages.203 In other words, this would hardly have led to a \"substantially different\" outcome.204\n\nCl. Rej., para. 303; Cl. C-Mem., para. 332.\n\nCl. Rej., para. 310.\n\n274.\n\nAs a result, the Applicant has not established that the case-at-hand involved a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Tribunal's reasons are not contradictory and this alleged ground for annulment has in any event been brought too late.\n\n276.\n\nRomania did not assert in its Application that the Tribunal's reasons are contradictory; rather, it raised this ground for the first time in its Memorial. Therefore, the Applicant is barred from bringing this ground after the expiration of the 120-day time limit for annulment. The Application failed to \"state in detail\" the grounds on which it was based, as required by Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c). An applicant cannot merely rely on the legal grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention, \"it should also state which of the award's features exhibits flaws that constitute grounds for annulment.\"205 As a result, the Committee can only consider those grounds that were raised within the 120-day time limit that were stated in detail in the Application.206\n\n*Id*., para. 338, quoting Ch. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed, 2009), p. 927, para. 87 (Cl. Exh. CAL-61).\n\nCl. Rej., para. 337; Transcript, Day 1, p. 219.\n\n277.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal's reasons are not contradictory. Romania has not even asserted that there are contradictory reasons that cancel each other out.207 Rather, the Applicant is asserting that some of the Tribunal's findings cannot be reconciled with what it believes that the Award is \"enabling\" or \"entitles\" the Claimants to do. Thus, Romania is setting *reasons* against *potential consequences*. According to the Claimants, there is no connection between the alleged contradictory reasons and what may happen to the Award at the enforcement stage, as those are two completely different matters.208\n\nCl. Rej., para. 350.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 219.\n\n278.\n\nAs to the first alleged contradiction relating to the Individual Claimants recovering losses suffered by the Corporate Claimants, the Tribunal explained that it denied the Claimants' request to award all damages to the Individual Claimants \"for procedural reasons *.* \"209 Since the Corporate Claimants had not discontinued their claims, the Tribunal found that it could not award damages to the Individual Claimants only. However, it did not hold that the Individual Claimants are not entitled to damages for losses suffered by the Corporate Claimants. On the contrary, the Tribunal held that the Individual Claimants are entitled to damages for losses suffered indirectly through their companies.210 Paragraph 1237 of the Award explains that, had the Corporate Claimants raised no claims, or withdrawn them, there would have been no obstacle to awarding all of the damages to the Individual Claimants.211\n\nCl. Rej., para. 355, quoting Award, para. 1229.\n\n*Id*., para. 356, referring to Award, para. 943.\n\nCl. Opening Presentation Handout entitled \"The Collective Damages Issue,\" p. 5.\n\n279.\n\nAs to the second alleged contradiction relating to the Corporate Claimants recovering losses suffered by Non-Party Companies, the Claimants note that they never requested that the Tribunal award the entirety of the damages to the Corporate Claimants. Therefore, the statement in the Award is *obiter dictum* and does not affect how the Tribunal reached its conclusions. In any event, the Tribunal was fully aware that the Corporate Claimants are not entitled to compensation for all the damages, as discussed in paragraph 1242 of the Award.212 As a result, there can be no contradiction in this respect.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 219.\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, for an award to be annulled on the ground of failure to state reasons because of contradictory reasons, the reasons must cancel each other out so as to amount to no reasons. The threshold is therefore very high.213 This is confirmed by several *ad hoc* committees, including *Daimler*  *v. Argentina* and *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*.214 In this case, the reasons for awarding the damages to all of the Claimants are clearly set out in paragraphs 1244-1248 of the Award. Allocation of the compensation as between the Claimants at the enforcement stage is irrelevant to understand this reasoning. The ground must therefore be rejected.\n\n*Id*., p. 218.\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 77; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, para. 82.\n\n***C. Committee's Analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Award is not annullable under the grounds claimed by Romania.\n\n*(i) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nFirst, the Award is not annullable under Article 52(1)(d) for the reasons below.\n\n283.\n\nThe above-mentioned article states that an award can be annulled when there is a serious deviation from a fundamental rule of procedure. Therefore, two elements must be present in order to make the award annullable. First, there has to be a deviation from a fundamental rule of procedure, and second, that deviation must be serious. In this regard, Romania has failed to prove both elements: it did not demonstrate the existence of such fundamental rule nor that the alleged departure from this hypothetical rule was serious.\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimants made detailed submissions showing that the applicable case law and the historical background on ICSID annulment have uniformly understood that fundamental rules of procedure refer mainly to the parties' rights to be heard and present their case.215 Such rights were fully granted to both Parties in the case-at-hand.\n\nCl. C-Mem., paras. 276-297.\n\n285.\n\nRomania's fundamental argument in this regard is that the \"burden of proving damages\" is a fundamental rule of procedure, and that this, in fact, has been litigated on many occasions.216 Nevertheless, Romania does not give merit to the fact that *ad hoc* committees have never explicitly acknowledged this.217\n\nAppl. Rep., paras. 133-138.\n\nCl. C-Mem., paras. 298-310.\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimants demonstrated that, even if the burden of proving damages were in fact a fundamental rule of procedure, the scope of such rule would only be to prove the existence of the damages and not to require a tribunal to allocate those damages to each claimant.\n\n287.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants argued that they successfully proved their damages collectively and the fact that the damages were \"collective\" does not mean that they were not proven. The Award followed the same reasoning.\n\n288.\n\nIn the Committee's opinion, there was no violation of the \"burden of proving damages\" rule alleged by the Respondent or to any other fundamental rule of procedure. From a reading of Section VII(B) of the Award, it is evident that the Tribunal imposed the burden of proving damages on the Claimants. It is also evident that the Tribunal reached the conclusion that such damages had been proven by the Claimants and therefore considered that the burden of proof had been met. The Tribunal explained in paragraph 1247 of the Award that damages were awarded collectively because that is what the Claimants asked for and that the Tribunal reached this conclusion after having reviewed the evidence presented by the Parties.\n\n*(ii) Failure to State Reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nAs a preliminary consideration, this Committee considers that the Claimants' arguments that the alleged ground for annulment has been brought too late must fail.\n\n290.\n\nThe Committee considers that the level of \"detail\" required by Rule 50(1)(c) has been complied with by Romania's Application, which refers to the Tribunal's contradictory reasons with a reference to the annulment ground in Article 52(1)(e).218 In Romania's Memorial, these defects were explained in detail and accompanied by further arguments, including a description of the applicable law concerning the use by tribunals of contradictory reasons (which could amount to a failure to state reasons in terms of Article 52(1)(e)).219\n\n*See* Application, paras. 19-21.\n\nAppl. Rep., para. 149.\n\n291.\n\nMoving to the next issue, the Award is not annullable under Article 52(1)(e) for the reasons below.\n\n292.\n\nThe above-mentioned article states that an award can be annulled when it \"has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\" In this regard, *ad hoc* committees and doctrine have understood the failure to state reasons as a ground for annulment. Case law has developed the \"failure to state reasons\" standard as well as a variant thereof, the latter which provides that contradictory reasons can cancel each other out so that they represent no reason at all.220\n\n*Klockner v. Cameroon I*, para. 116; Ch. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed, 2009), p. 1011 (Cl. Exh. CAL-61).\n\n293.\n\nRomania contends that the Award should be annulled since it is based on contradictory reasons and therefore it fails to state reasons on which it based its decision to allocate damages collectively.\n\n294.\n\nRomania's arguments on the allegedly contradictory reasons are based on the Tribunal's refusal, on the one hand, to award damages solely to the Corporate Claimants on the basis that \"a portion of the damages are associated with other companies that the Individual Claimants own,\"221 and its refusal to award damages also solely to the Individual Claimants on the ground that such an award would allow them to circumvent the Corporate Claimants' creditors222; while, on the other hand - and this is where Romania finds the contradiction -the Tribunal held that it would issue a collective award, which would leave to the discretion of the Claimants how to apportion their common entitlement. According to Romania, the Award permits the Individual Claimants to recover ahead of the Corporate Claimants' creditors and permits the Corporate Claimants to recover for losses sustained by the NonParty Companies.\n\nAward, para. 1242.\n\n*Id*., para. 1237.\n\n295.\n\nRomania submits that the Tribunal issued an Award which *enables* each Claimant to recover all of the collective losses of the EFDG. This \" entitles the Individual Claimants to defraud the creditors of the Corporate Claimants and Non-Party Companies,\"223 as is evident from paragraph 1245 of the Award, which reads:\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Claimants have quantified the damage suffered by the entire EFDG, of which the Corporate Claimants are a part and of which the Individual Claimants own at least 99.96%. In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal does not find that the Claimants' failure to specify and prove the exact quantum of damages suffered by each one of the five Claimants is sufficient reason to deny the payment of the damages that have been quantified. The Tribunal is satisfied that some or most of the damage was directly suffered by the Corporate Claimants, and that virtually all of the damage was indirectly suffered by the Individual Claimants. There is nothing inconsistent between those two conclusions. Indeed, while the Tribunal will not enter into the discussion of whether shareholder damages are equivalent to the damages suffered by the underlying company the Tribunal is satisfied that, given the size of the Individual Claimants' shareholding in the EFDG companies, the Individual Claimants indirectly suffered at least a large part, if not virtually all, of the damage suffered directly by the Corporate Claimants. Furthermore, the Tribunal has already found that, provided that the Individual Claimants can prove their ownership of the other companies in the EFDG and can prove that they have been affected in this regard by the Respondent's breaches of the BIT, they can claim for losses they have suffered indirectly through those companies.\n\nThe Tribunal has further found that the Individual Claimants have met that burden and are, therefore, entitled to damages suffered by the non-claimant EFDG entities as well. Having established that both the Corporate and Individual Claimants were harmed, the Tribunal is not comfortable with declining to award damages to one group or the other simply because it lacks the information needed to allocate the damages among them. (Emphasis added)\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 108.\n\n296.\n\nRomania concludes that the Tribunal's reasoning on allocation of collective damages is contradictory so as to amount to no reason at all and, therefore, does not sustain the result reached in the Award.224\n\nAppl. Mem., para. 94.\n\n297.\n\nIt is true that, at first glance, it might appear that there is a contradiction in the conclusions of the Tribunal. Nevertheless, in the view of this Committee, this apparent contradiction does not amount to a valid ground for annulment for several reasons.\n\n298.\n\nFirst, the contradiction asserted by Romania does not amount to a \"failure to state reasons.\" Even if the reasoning in the above-referenced paragraphs (1237, 1242, 1244) were to be cancelled and eliminated, the Award would still be based on valid reasons to sustain its result to award collective damages.\n\n299.\n\nCase law has established a very strict scrutiny to annul awards when it comes to contradictory reasons. Several *ad hoc* committees have ruled that an award based on contradictory reasons can be equated to a failure to state reasons, because genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out.225\n\n*Klockner v Cameroon I*, para. 116; Ch. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed, 2009), p. 1011 (Cl. Exh. CAL-61).\n\n300.\n\nIn order for an award to be annullable due to a failure to state reasons - on its contradictory reasons variant - the contradiction between the reasons given must be serious enough so that the reasons will not enable the reader to understand the tribunal's226 motives and reasoning in issues of fact or law.227\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 65; *Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 77; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, para. 82.\n\n*Mitchell v. Congo*, para. 21.\n\n301.\n\nTherefore, a tribunal has a duty to give \"sufficiently pertinent reasons\"228 to its award so that the reader can follow its reasoning. Thus, as long as an award deals in logical order and in some detail with all relevant considerations, contains ample reasons and explanations in support of the conclusions arrived at by the tribunal, and allows the reader to understand how the tribunal arrives to its conclusions,229 it cannot be deemed that the award fails to state reasons.230\n\n*Amco I v. Indonesia*, para. 42.\n\n*Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* para *.* 102.\n\n*Amco I v. Indonesia*, para. 42; *Klockner v. Cameroon I*, para. 118.\n\n302.\n\nIn this regard, it cannot be stated that there is a failure to state reasons when there are enough supporting reasons in the award. Such supporting reasons must be more than a matter of nomenclature and must constitute an appropriate foundation for the conclusion reached through such reasons. As long as the reasons given make it possible to reasonably connect the facts or law of the case to the conclusions reached in the award, annulment is appropriately avoided.231\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE,* para. 128.\n\n303.\n\nIn view of the above, the Committee is of the view that it cannot reasonably be argued that such contradictory reasons exist in an award when: (i) the reasoning of the tribunal as a whole allow the reader to understand and follow the motives of fact and law given by the tribunal; (ii) the award gives ample reasons and explanations in support of its conclusions; and (iii) the award gives sufficient pertinent reasons, and deals in logical order and in some detail, with all relevant considerations.\n\n304.\n\nIn the case-at-hand, the Tribunal fully complied with the above criteria, since the Award allows a reader to follow its reasoning by dealing in logical order and in detail with all the relevant considerations, and gives ample reasons and explanations for its conclusions.\n\n305.\n\nSpecifically, Section III of the Award contains the Tribunal's analysis with respect to the requested allocation of damages and gives ample reasons to support its conclusion. Specifically, the Award provides the following reasoning:\n\n(i) First, the Award rejected, for procedural reasons, the Claimants' request that all damages be awarded solely to the Individual Claimants.232\n\n(ii) Second, the Award acknowledged that all five Claimants commenced and pursued the arbitration and requested monetary relief.233\n\n(iii) The Award explained that, in calculating the total damages, the Tribunal decided to follow the Claimants' primary damages methodology, which quantified expectation damages for the entire EFDG. Under such methodology, the Tribunal found that the Claimants proved two groups of damages: (i) increased costs of raw materials (sugar, other raw materials other than PET, and the sugar stockpile) for a total of RON 120,733,229 (Section VII.C.2); and (ii) lost profits of RON 255,700,000 on the sale of finished goods (Section VII.C.3).234\n\n(iv) The Award explained that in the Claimants' principal expectation damages scenario, the Claimants did not attempt to allocate the damages among the five Claimants. The Award further noted that: (i) the experts quantified losses for the entire EFDG, including damages suffered by the Non-Party Companies; (ii) neither the Claimants nor their experts have provided a figure for the damages suffered by each Claimant, or stated in what proportion these damages should be distributed; and (iii) the record does not contain clear elements that would allow the Tribunal to carry out such an allocation. The Tribunal explained in the Award that there is, therefore, no evidentiary basis for allocating damages.235\n\n(v) The Tribunal found that the Claimants have quantified the damages suffered by the entire EFDG. The Tribunal also explained that it did not find that the Claimants' failure to specify and prove the exact quantum of damages suffered by each one of the five Claimants is a sufficient reason to deny the payment of the damages that have been quantified. The Tribunal was satisfied that some or most of the damage was directly suffered by the Corporate Claimants and that virtually all the damage was indirectly suffered by the Individual Claimants. The Tribunal further noted that it found that the Individual Claimants met the burden of proof and are therefore entitled to damages suffered by the Non-Party Companies as well. Having established that both the Corporate and Individual Claimants were harmed, the Tribunal was not comfortable with declining to award damages to one group or the other simply because it lacked the information needed to allocate the damages among them.236\n\n(vi) The Award further explained that the Claimants only quantified the direct damages suffered by the entire EFDG, and that the Tribunal has no bases to distinguish which part of those damages has been suffered directly by the Corporate Claimants, and which part has been suffered indirectly by the Individual Claimants as a result of their shareholdings in the Non-Party Companies of the EFDG.237\n\n(vii) Given these constraints, the Tribunal concluded that the appropriate way forward was to award any damages, interest and costs to all five Claimants collectively, without allocating the damages among them.238\n\n(viii) The Award further reasoned that the Claimants have not proffered adequate evidence or legal arguments to support particular allocations, and that the Respondent also has not sought any particular allocation, other than to oppose the Claimants' request that damages be awarded to the Individual Claimants. The Award thus imposed the total amount that Romania has to pay fully to discharge its obligations and does not deal with the specific entitlement of each Claimant individually.239\n\n(ix) The Award supported its decision by indicating that:  \n A tribunal should not pass judgment on what has not been claimed. In particular, if two or more claimants fail to request a specific allocation of damages and rather claim for common entitlement, there is no reason for a tribunal to determine which claimant is entitled to what, subject of course to counterclaims or defenses made by the respondent in this regard.240\n\nAward, para. 1129.\n\n*Id.*, para. 1136.\n\n*Id.*, para. 1239.\n\n*Id.*, para. 1243.\n\n*Id.*, para. 1245.\n\n*Id.*, para. 1246.\n\n*Id.*, para. 1247.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Id.*, para. 1248.\n\n306.\n\nIn view of the aforementioned, the Award does not fail to state reasons upon which it is based and, therefore, it is not annullable under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n307.\n\nIn addition to the above, Romania contends that the decision regarding the allocation of damages in the Award results in contradictory consequences in its execution. In this respect, the Committee notes that: *it is within Romania's power to avoid the contradictory consequences it considers the Award enables*. In the first place, the Award places Romania with both the obligation and the right to pay the compensation awarded to the Claimants and to decide how to discharge such obligation. In fact, Romania could exercise such right by paying any of the five Claimants to discharge its obligation and to compensate such payment with the Corporate Claimants' fiscal obligations (those which Romania claims that the Claimants are trying to avoid). Romania has already benefitted from this right and has compensated part of the amount of the Award against the tax obligations of some of the Corporate Claimants. This fact alone disavows Romania's reiterated arguments that the Award is contradictory because it allows a result that runs afoul of the reasoning of the Tribunal. It is, as has been seen, within Romania's power, as well as a right protected by the Award, to avoid contradictory consequences in the application of the Award. This argument, in itself, is not a matter to be dealt with as a ground for annulment.\n\n**V. THE NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, the EC presented its non-disputing party submission (\"EC Submission\"). It contended that the Award must be annulled on the basis of three main defects:\n\ni. The Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law;\n\nii. The Tribunal failed to address the question of enforceability of the Award; and\n\niii. The Tribunal exercised a jurisdiction that it did not have.\n\n309.\n\nThe EC's first two arguments were also raised by the Applicant (see Section IV(1)(A) and IV(2)(A) above). The Parties addressed the EC Submission in the Reply and Rejoinder. The Applicant's arguments and the Parties' observations are set out below.\n\n**1. FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***A. EC's Position***\n----------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe EC argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in its conclusions on the applicable law because: (i) it failed to apply EU State aid law to the dispute; (ii) it manifestly misinterpreted and misapplied EU State aid law provisions, the Europe Agreement and Romania's domestic law in a \"gross and egregious manner as so as to substantially amount to a failure to apply the proper law under the underlying dispute\"241; and (iii) it failed to address the conflict of treaties that was inherent in the underlying dispute. For the same reasons, the EC submits that the Award fails to state the reasons upon which it is based.\n\nEC Submission, para. 6.\n\n*(i) Tribunal's Failure to Apply EU Law*\n----------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe EC states that the Tribunal's reasoning on the applicable law should have led it to conclude:\n\n[...] that E.U. State aid law applied to the underlying dispute even before Romania's accession to the European Union by virtue of (i) Romania's international obligations under the 1995 Europe Agreement, in particular Articles 64, 69 and 70 thereof and Decision No. 4/2000 of the EU-Romania Association Council, (ii) Romania's domestic law, which incorporated E.U. State aid law pursuant to those obligations, and (iii) Romania's international obligations to harmonize its domestic legislation with the *acquis communitaire* in the context of accession negotiations to the European Union [...]. In any event, the Tribunal should have concluded that E.U. State aid law applied to the underlying dispute as a result of Romania's accession to the European Union on 1 January 2007.242\n\n*Id*., para. 10.\n\n312.\n\nThe EC states that its actions and those of Romania show that the Europe Agreement applied to Romania since 1995. In the course of Romania's accession negotiations to the EU, the EC demanded that Romania comply with several EU laws and EU agreements (including the *acquis communitaire*).243 Romania undertook several steps toward this end, including accepting EU accession negotiating documents, enacting domestic laws that mirrored EU law and the Europe Agreement (including Laws 143/1999 and 507/2004), phasing out certain incentives and laws (including the EGO 24 scheme), taking other agencies of the Romanian Government to court to ensure compliance and requesting transitional periods to harmonize its laws with EU law.244 The EU therefore submits that the Tribunal should have applied that law and that its failure to do so was a manifest excess of its powers.\n\n*Id*., paras. 13-14, 17, 19, 21.\n\n*Id*., paras. 14, 16, 18, 22-23.\n\n313.\n\nIn the alternative, the EC argues that EU law on State aid applied to the dispute since Romania's accession to the EU in 2007. The Commission notes that the Award compensated the Claimants for the breach of the BIT's FET clause from February 22, 2005 until April 1, 2009. For the majority of that 49-month-period - 27 months - \"Romania was a full member of the European Union directly subjected to the EU State aid discipline laid down in the EU Treaties.\"245 Romania would have had to seek the EC's approval to continue granting EGO 24 incentives or they would have been unlawful under EU law.\n\n*Id*., paras. 27 and 28.\n\n314.\n\nNext, the EC argues that the Award contained contradictory reasoning in regard to the application of EU State aid law to the underlying dispute. The Tribunal erroneously determined that the Europe Agreement did not apply to the dispute, but then concluded in examining the legitimate expectations of the Claimants under the FET standard that the Claimants reasonably could have believed that the EGO 24 incentives were compatible with EU law. The Tribunal's reasoning was irrelevant to this analysis if EU State aid law was not applicable to the dispute. However, since the Award did not examine whether it was reasonable for the Claimants to consider that the incentives were compatible with the Europe Agreement and/or Romania's State aid law, the Tribunal's conclusion that the incentives were compatible with EU State aid law was necessary for it to conclude that Romania had breached the BIT's FET provision.246 Thus, the EC submits that:\n\n[T]he reasons cited by the Tribunal are not reasonably capable of justifying the result reached, or are not sufficiently relevant or pertinent reasons. In particular, the contradictory reasoning given by the Tribunal on the applicable law is incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the Award, so that the Award must be annulled on the basis of Article 52(e) of the ICSID Convention for failure to state the reasons on which it is based.247\n\n*Id*., paras. 29-31.\n\n*Id*., para. 31.\n\n*(ii) Manifest Misinterpretation and Misapplication of State Aid Law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nIn the alternative, the EC argues that the Tribunal manifestly misinterpreted and misapplied the rules on State aid under EU and Romanian law and the Europe Agreement. In its analysis of FET, the Tribunal examined, among other criteria, whether the Claimants expectations were reasonable in light of Romania's accession to the EU and Romanian law.248 According to the EC, the Tribunal's analysis \"rests on several fundamental misunderstandings and misapplications of State aid law, in particular the State aid control mechanism put into place by, first, the 1995 Europe Agreement [and] the applicable domestic Romanian legislation.\"249 The Tribunal's conclusions in paragraphs 601 to 707 of the Award that EGO 24 incentives were compatible with EU law \"is incorrect and fundamentally disregards the State aid control mechanism\"250 in the EU Treaties under Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty as incorporated in the Europe Agreement, which prohibited Romania from granting State aid as from February 1, 1995.251 Further, the Tribunal misapplied Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty (which allows for the possibility of permitting State aid to promote economic development in certain areas, including Romania), which is an exception that the EC has exclusive competence to approve at its discretion.252 The Tribunal also misapplied the 1998 Regional Aid Guidelines which limit the EC's ability to declare State aid compatible with the internal market under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty.253\n\n*Id*., para. 34.\n\n*Id*., para. 35.\n\n*Id*., para. 36.\n\n*Id*., para. 37.\n\nPrior to accession, the Romanian Competition Council was competent. *Id*., paras. 37-45.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n316.\n\nAccording to the EC, had the Tribunal properly considered the State control mechanism contained in EU and Romanian law, it would not have concluded that the Claimants had reasonable expectations that the EGO 24 incentives would be available until April 1, 2009 in substantially the same form.254\n\n*Id*., paras. 55-67.\n\n*(iii) Tribunal's Failure to Address the Conflict of Romania's International Law Obligations*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe EC argues that the Tribunal failed to address the conflict between Romania's obligations under the BIT and under the State aid provisions of the Europe Agreement. The Tribunal's reading of the Europe Agreement was selective to avoid any conflict and to justify the \"quasiexclusive\" application of the BIT. In doing so, the Tribunal relied on a false interpretation of Article 74 of the Europe Agreement (which provides that a cooperative goal of the EC and Romania is to conclude agreements for the promotion and protection of foreign investment between Romania and EU Member States).255 The Tribunal did not take into account related provisions of the Europe Agreement (Articles 64, 69 and 70), which provide that one of the Agreement's goals is to bring Romania's State aid legislation in line with that of the EU.256 If the Tribunal had done so, it would have concluded that there was a conflict of international obligations, or would have had to interpret the BIT in a manner so as to avoid the conflict. By failing to do either, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons upon which the Award was based.257\n\n*Id*., para. 70.\n\n*Id*., para. 72.\n\n*Id*., para. 74.\n\n***B. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe Applicant accepts and adopts the EC's entire section related to annulment for the Tribunal's failure to apply the applicable law.258\n\nAppl. Rep., para. 9.\n\n***C. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Claimants largely rely on the same arguments as those in reply to the Applicant's arguments concerning this ground for annulment. They submit that the Tribunal applied the law that it identified as being applicable and that the EC's argument attacks \"the *manner* in which\" the law was applied, which is outside the scope of the annulment proceedings.259 Moreover, the EC's argument that the law was not applied at all is \"fundamentally flawed as a matter of law *.* \"260 The EC disagrees with the conclusion the Tribunal came to, which cannot result in the annulment of the Award.261\n\nCl. Rej., para. 339 (emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Id*., para. 362-363.\n\n320.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the EC contradicted itself in its submissions in the Original Proceeding and in its submissions to the Committee; for this reason alone the Committee should dismiss the EC Submission.262 The EC's argument that EU State aid law applied to Romania in 1995, or in the alternative, since 2007, are both fundamentally flawed.263 With respect to the former, the law did not come into force with respect to Romania until 2007; therefore, Romanian law on State aid was applicable at the time of the breach of the BIT, which occurred in 2005.264 The critical date is the date on which the breach occurred.265\n\n*Id*., para. 362.\n\n*Id*., para. 373.\n\n*Id*., paras. 374 and 378.\n\n*Id*., para. 379.\n\n321.\n\nFurther, the EC's alternative argument that the Tribunal did apply the law, but manifestly misinterpreted and misapplied it, must also fail. First, the Tribunal only described the applicable State aid law in detail in the context of its task of assessing Romania's actions in light of its obligations under the BIT. Second, even if the Tribunal had misapplied the law, this could not arise to annulment under Article 52(1) of the Convention.\n\n***D. Committee's Analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Committee, having reviewed the EC's arguments and the Parties positions in response to the EC's arguments described above, hereby confirms its conclusion not to annul the Award.\n\n**2. FAILURE TO CONSIDER THE AWARD'S ENFORCEABILITY**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. EC's Position***\n----------------------\n\n323.\n\nAccording to the EC, the Award contains an annullable flaw because the Tribunal did not consider the arguments of the Parties and the EC regarding enforceability, and thus failed to address a question that was submitted to it and state the reasons upon which the Award was based in violation of ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e).266\n\nEC Submission, para. 76.\n\n324.\n\nThe EC argues that implementation and/or execution of the Award would be illegal under EU law because it would amount to unlawful State aid under Article 107(1) of the TFEU as it would give the Claimants an economic advantage that is otherwise not available on the market.267 Implementation and/or execution of the Award by Romania would require the amounts paid to Claimants to be recovered as a matter of EU law.268 The EC could bring Romania before the ECJ to order it to recover any such payments and Romania may face pecuniary repercussions;269 failure to comply would be a violation of EU law.270\n\n*Id*., paras. 78-79; EC Decision C (2014) 6484 of October 1, 2014 in Case SA.38517 (EC Exh. EC-016).\n\nEC Submission, para. 79.\n\n*Id*., para. 85.\n\n*Id*., para. 86.\n\n325.\n\nAccording to the EC, the Tribunal's failure to consider EU State aid rules renders the Award unenforceable in EU Member State courts \"as a matter of public policy *.* \"271 The EC opines that the appropriate and uniform application of EU State aid rules are a matter of public policy because they entail dealings between economic entities and the State.272 The EC points to ECJ jurisprudence, which has held that an arbitral tribunal's failure to apply EU competition rules renders awards resulting from such proceedings unenforceable in the national courts of an EU Member State. Because the Tribunal did not address the above issue, the EC contends that it failed to deal with a question submitted to it and state the reasons upon which it was based in violation of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.273\n\n*Id*., para. 88.\n\n*Id*., para. 87.\n\n*Id*., para. 89.\n\n***B. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Applicant accepts and adopts the EC's entire submission related to annulment for the Tribunal's failure to consider the enforceability of the Award.274\n\nAppl. Rep., para. 9.\n\n***C. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Claimants submit that whether the Award can be enforced in the EU is \"irrelevant for the Claimants' BIT claims\" and is further \"irrelevant to whether the Tribunal committed any error that could warrant annulment under the ICSID Convention.\"275 The EC's arguments that the Tribunal's handlings of the unenforceability argument constitute an annullable error under the ICSID Convention also fail. First, the EC does not establish what fundamental rule of procedure would have been departed from in regard to not deciding the enforceability issue.276 Further, the EC's argument that the Tribunal failed to argue a point addressed by the Parties is \"factually inaccurate\" because the Parties did not ask the Tribunal to rule on this issue; rather, Romania raised it in its defense and the Claimants contended this point was irrelevant, with which the Tribunal agreed.277\n\nCl. Rej., para. 400.\n\n*Id*., para. 402.\n\n*Id*., para. 403.\n\n***D. Committee's Analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Committee, having reviewed the EC's arguments and the Parties positions in response to the EC's arguments stated above, hereby confirms its conclusion not to annul the Award.\n\n**3. THE TRIBUNAL LACKED JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE DISPUTE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe EC's final argument as to why the Award must be annulled concerns the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The EC argues that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by finding that it had jurisdiction over the dispute. Further, by failing to consult with the EC on the jurisdictional issue, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n***A. EC's Position***\n----------------------\n\n330.\n\nAccording to the EC, the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction as \"the E.U. Treaties superseded the Sweden-Romania BIT as a result of Romania's accession to the European Union, terminating the latter, or, at the very least, rendering Articles 7 and 10 of that BIT inapplicable.\"278\n\nEC Submission, para. 92.\n\n331.\n\nAccording to the EC, the Tribunal should have found that the BIT was terminated under Article 59(1) of the Vienna Convention, which provides that a later treaty terminates an earlier treaty if it covers the same subject matter, and the termination of the earlier treaty was either the intention of the parties or the provisions between the two treaties are incompatible (*lex posterior derogat legi priori*).279 Because Sweden and Romania are EU Member States bound by the rules of EU law, the Tribunal should have considered them to have implicitly terminated the BIT as a result of Romania's accession to the EU, or, in the alternative, because the BIT's provisions are incompatible with the provisions of the EU Treaties that govern the same matter.280\n\n*Id*., para. 94.\n\n*Id*., paras. 95-96.\n\n332.\n\nIn the latter instance, the decisive criterion as determined by the ILC is \"whether the parallel operation of both treaties could lead to incompatible obligations with regard to the same matter.\"281 This criterion is met because: (i) the EU Treaties contain a comprehensive set of rules which govern the protection of investments made by investors of one Member State in the territory of another (Chapters 2 and 4 of the TFEU on the right of establishment and on the free movement of capital and payments between Member States);282 and (ii) under Article 344 of the TFEU, EU Member States have agreed not to submit disputes that involve the interpretation or application of EU law to any other dispute settlement mechanism than that provided for in the EU Treaties, thus rendering the investor-State dispute settlement clause in the BIT incompatible with the TFEU.283 As a result of the incompatibility, Article 10 of the BIT (the grandfathering clause) is also inapplicable in this case.284\n\n*Id*., para. 96, citing ILC, Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, UN Doc. A/Cn.4/L/683, April 13, 2006, paras. 23, 253-254.\n\n*Id*., para. 97.\n\n*Id*., para. 98.\n\n*Id*., para. 101.\n\n333.\n\nIn the alternative, the EC argues that the Tribunal should have found that Articles 7 and 10 of the BIT were inapplicable under Article 30(3) of the VCLT, \"since those provisions could not be applied by the Tribunal to assume jurisdiction over the underlying dispute in a manner compatible with the EU Treaties, particularly Article 344 of the TFEU *.* \"285\n\n*Id*., para. 102.\n\n334.\n\nThus, according to the EC, the Tribunal lost jurisdiction in January 2007 when Romania acceded to the EU, as the BIT was terminated and/or Article 7 of the BIT became ineffective.286 In any event, the Tribunal should have declined jurisdiction because the BIT does not cover disputes involving questions of State aid, as this is a matter under the exclusive competence of the EU.287 Consequently, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Id*., para. 103.\n\n*Id*., paras. 104-107.\n\n335.\n\nIn addition, according to the EC, the Tribunal's failure to solicit the EC's views regarding whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction amounts to an annullable error.288 The EC contends that the Tribunal should have, on its own initiative, under Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, sought the opinion of the EC on the question of jurisdiction in view of Romania's obligations as an EU Member State.289 By failing to do so, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and the Award must be annulled under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.290\n\n*Id*., para. 92.\n\n*Id*., paras. 108-109.\n\n*Id*., para. 111.\n\n***B. Applicant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Applicant did not comment on this ground for annulment.\n\n***C. Claimants' Position***\n----------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimants note that the EC Submission on this ground for annulment has not been endorsed by Romania and therefore argue that it falls outside of the Committee's jurisdiction, as the Committee's task is limited to determining the questions submitted to it by the Parties.291 Third parties have no power to request the annulment of an ICSID award, even if they are affected by it.292\n\nCl. Rej., para. 410.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n338.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the EC's argument is not only entirely novel, but also contradicts arguments that it made during the Original Proceeding, as it never expressed any doubt regarding the validity of the BIT and in fact affirmed it.293 There was no objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction because of Romania's EU accession, and there was no obligation upon the Tribunal to raise that issue *ex officio* under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention. Therefore, the EC's arguments that this constitutes a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure must fail.\n\n*Id*., paras. 412-416, citing EC Submission in the Original Proceeding, para. 112.\n\n***D. Committee's Analysis***\n-----------------------------\n\n339.\n\nThe Committee, having reviewed the EC's arguments and the Parties positions in response to the EC's arguments stated above, hereby confirms its conclusion not to annul the Award.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Parties submitted their respective statements on costs on October 13, 2015, as set out below.\n\n***A. Applicant***\n------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Applicant's legal costs total EUR 2,005,916.11 and its expenses total EUR 34,190.52 (including the ICSID lodging fee of USD 25,000). Additionally, the Applicant claims EUR 1,827.56 of additional costs incurred by the Ministry of Public Finances of Romania in relation to the hearing on annulment held in Paris, France, on September 21-22, 2015. Finally, the Applicant paid USD 600,000 to ICSID in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations (made in payments of USD 200,000 on June 4, 2014, USD 250,000 on January 9, 2015, and USD 150,000 on September 28, 2015), to cover the cost of the annulment proceeding, i.e. the fees and expenses of the Committee and the charges and expenses of ICSID. Accordingly, the Applicant's total costs and expenses in the annulment proceeding amount to EUR 2,041,934.19 and USD 600,000.\n\n342.\n\nThe Applicant requests that it be awarded the entirety of its costs and expenses.\n\n***B. Claimants***\n------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants' legal costs total EUR 1,031,138.81 and their expenses total EUR 140,999.73, amounting to a total of EUR 1,172,138.54 (all amounts excluding VAT).\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Committee order the Applicant to pay the Claimants' legal fees and expenses, with interest as from the date of the decision at a rate the Committee deems appropriate. The Claimants submit that the amounts they request are reasonable based on the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the Applicant's conduct toward the Claimants.\n\n***C. Committee***\n------------------\n\n345.\n\nThe Committee must now deal with the question of the costs of this annulment proceeding and the Parties' legal costs.\n\n346.\n\nThe costs of this annulment proceeding, which includes, *inter alia*, the Committee Members' fees and expenses, the ICSID Secretariat's fees and expenses, and the use of the Centre's facilities, amount to USD 547,845.09.294\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) relating to the dispatch of this Decision. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.\n\n347.\n\nThe Committee has discretion on the allocation of costs pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1), corroborated by Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53.\n\n348.\n\nAs set out above, the Committee has received the Parties' statements of costs and each Party's request that the Committee award each Party's respective costs to the opposing party.295 As to the allocation of costs, the Committee decides as follows:\n\nApplicant's Statement on Annulment Costs, para. 2; Claimants' Statement of Annulment Costs, p. 1.\n\n349.\n\nFirst, as in several ICSID annulment proceedings,296 the Committee decides that the Applicant should bear the costs of the annulment proceeding (these costs have already been paid by the Applicant through the advances it has paid in accordance with Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e)).297\n\n*Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* para *.* 307; *Daimler v. Argentina,* para. 307; *Alapli v. Turkey,* para. 264.\n\nApplicant's Statement on Annulment Costs, para. 6.\n\n350.\n\nSecond, this Committee notes that a large majority of *ad hoc* committees in ICSID annulment proceedings have held that each party should bear its own legal costs. They have done so not only where the application for annulment has succeeded in whole or part, but also where it has failed.298\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 305; *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, para. 307; *Alapli v. Turkey,* para. 263; *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, paras. 282 and 285; *Vivendi v. Argentina*, para. 268; *Azurix v. Argentina*, para. 380.\n\n351.\n\nThis Committee considers that such practice should be followed in the case-at-hand since none of the Applicant's grounds for annulment prevailed and because several of the Claimants' requests to the Committee during the annulment proceeding also failed.299\n\n*See* paras. 20, 47 and 79 of this Decision.\n\n352.\n\nEven though Romania was not successful in its ground for annulment, this is not a case where the annulment application was \"\u2018fundamentally lacking in merit' and that [the] Applicant's case was \u2018to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.'\"300 In addition, the present case involved a \"difficult and novel question of public importance\"301 due to the intervention of the EC representing the EU's interests.\n\n*See* *Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 309, quoting *CDC v. Seychelles*, para. 89.\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina*, para. 309.\n\n353.\n\nMoreover, the Committee acknowledges that the Parties and their Counsel have conducted the proceeding diligently and efficiently, and therefore the Committee found no reason to apply the principle that \"costs follow the event\" to the award of the legal costs and expenses borne by each of the Parties.\n\n354.\n\nThis Committee decides to follow the aforementioned practice and order that each Party bear its own legal costs because of the particular circumstances of the case-at-hand.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n355.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES:\n\n(i) The Applicant's claims regarding the annulment of the Award are rejected based on the reasons set forth in this Decision.\n\n(ii) The Applicant shall bear the costs of the annulment proceeding.\n\n(iii) The Parties shall bear their own legal costs and expenses."}, {"Title": "Decision on Romania\u2019s Application for Interpretation", "Type": "Interpretation", "Date": "2023-12-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of J. Christopher Thomas", "Type": "Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Separate Opinion of J. Christopher Thomas\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI agree in the result in the Decision on Romania's Application for Interpretation (the \"Decision\") reached by my distinguished colleagues, whom I hold in high regard, but I regret to say that I do not agree with certain findings made by them because I believe that they are too exacting. I would therefore dismiss the Application, but for different reasons than those given by the Tribunal.\n\n2.\n\nThe controlling text for the purposes of considering the present Application is Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n(1) If any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award, either party may request interpretation of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General.\n\n3.\n\nLike many provisions of the Convention, it is written in simple terms. It does not stipulate requirements that a request for interpretation must meet, nor does it, in contrast to other post-award procedures, contain a time limit as to when a request may be filed.\n\n4.\n\nHowever, even though Article 50 is not expressly time-delimited, the overall structure and context of the ICSID Convention \u2013 particularly its provisions on the recognition of awards and the enforcement of their pecuniary obligations \u2013 suggests that there can come a point when it is not appropriate for an interpretation to be given. In my view, the present Application is such a case.\n\n**II. The basis for my separate opinion**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nHad Romania timeously objected to the Claimants' Motion to convert the currency of the Award to U.S. dollars as of the date of the Award's making, in my view a dispute over the meaning or scope of the Award would have arisen between the Parties and Romania would have had a clear right to seek an interpretation of the Award. I would add that Romania would have had an arguable case that the relief requested by the Claimants was inconsistent with the precise wording of paragraph 1329(d) of the Award.\n\n6.\n\nHowever, the present Application cannot be accepted because it is untimely. This is so because under the scheme created by the ICSID Convention, the proper time for Romania to seek an interpretation of the Award was when the Claimants made their request for currency conversion and the Court thereafter considered that request. It was at that point that Romania was put on notice that a particular form of relief that would increase the amount payable was being sought by the Claimants. If Romania considered that the requested relief to be inconsistent with what the Tribunal ordered, that is when it should have sought an interpretation.\n\n7.\n\nAs noted above, under Article 50 a tribunal's power to interpret its award is not expressly delimited in temporal terms. But that power must be read having regard to the overall context and structure of the ICSID Convention, specifically the Convention's allocation of responsibilities between tribunals and enforcement courts. In this respect, the unusual combination of international arbitral proceedings with recognition and enforcement proceedings in national courts within a single treaty requires careful consideration of how the former relate to the latter and *vice versa*, particularly where, as here, court proceedings have resulted in a final enforcement order.\n\n8.\n\nThe negotiating history of the Convention sheds some light on why no time limit was stipulated in Article 50. There was discussion during the Convention's drafting that a time limit for when an interpretation could be sought should be stipulated, as is the case for other post-award procedures. However, due to the possibility that \"there could be cases where the award might require a course of conduct which could extend over a long period of time\",1 it was thought that \"in that case a party should not be precluded from seeking an interpretation on the execution of the award.\"2 It was for this reason that what ended up being Article 50 did not prescribe a time limit for seeking an interpretation. It warrants noting that the relief granted in the Award at issue in the present Application was not executory but rather pecuniary.\n\nThe Chairman of the Legal Committee and the principal architect of the Convention, Aron Broches, noted that what he had in mind (in not providing for a time limit) was that \"if the dispute had been on the interpretation of a long-term contract, and if the award had not provided for payment of a sum of money but for a party to provide certain facilities or to abstain from certain action, then at any time while the award was being executed or being complied with a question could arise on interpretation. That was the reason why it was difficult to provide a time limit.\" See the comment of the Chairman of the Legal Committee, Aron Broches, on 9 Dec. 1964, SID/LC/18, Summary Proceedings of the Legal Committee Meeting, 4 Jan. 1965. History of the Convention, Volume II, p. 845.\n\n*Id.*\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants' written and oral submissions repeatedly stressed that the Convention allocates: (i) the conduct of an arbitration and the making of the award to the tribunal; and, (ii) if the award is not complied with, the recognition and enforcement of the award to such court or courts of the Contracting States that may be invoked by the award-creditor. I agree with this as a general proposition.\n\n10.\n\nUnder the ICSID regime, if the award-creditor presents a copy of the award certified by the ICSID Secretary-General to a court of a Contracting State, the court is obliged to \"recognize the award as binding\" and to enforce \"the pecuniary obligations imposed in that award \u2026 as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.\"3 The pecuniary obligations are then transformed into a judgment of the court rendered in accordance with local law, which judgment can then be enforced through the ordinary processes of that local law.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 54(1).\n\n11.\n\nGiven this allocation of functions, enforcement action in the courts of a Contracting State can, in my opinion, result in a situation where it is no longer appropriate to request the interpretation of an award. A tribunal's power to interpret its award can be attenuated, especially when a court enters a final order on the enforcement application without objection by the award-debtor.\n\n12.\n\nI am not to be taken as saying that as soon as a first step is taken in a court of a Contracting State, a tribunal loses its power to interpret its award. This is not so. To the extent that the Claimants seemed to imply that once enforcement proceedings were initiated in the courts of a Contacting State, a tribunal's role in the ICSID process is finished, I do not agree.4 Although the term \"hermetic seal\" was used by Professor Mendelson to describe the Claimants' position (a term not used by the Claimants themselves), to the extent that their submissions implied the existence of such a thing, they would go too far.5\n\nThere was some hint of this in the Claimants' Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 33, where it was asserted: \"Although it had multiple opportunities to do so, Romania *did not* contest Claimants' request to convert the Award into U.S. dollars as of the Award date or any calculations underlying the proposed U.S. Judgment. To the extent that Romania disagreed with claimants' calculations of the value of the U.S. judgement that was a matter for Romania to contest in the U.S. courts, which it failed to do. Romania also conceded that the D.C. District Court had jurisdiction to enforce the Award.\" [Underlining added; footnote references omitted.] That is, in my view only partially true. As I explain in paras. 15-19, there was a role for both bodies, the Tribunal and the District Court, to play had the dispute been identified timeously.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Maurice Mendelson, KC, 2nd Expert Report on Jurisdiction in Relation to Defining the Meaning and Scope of the Award of 11 Dec. 2013, paras. 15-19.\n\n13.\n\nOn my approach, it would have been fully consistent with the Convention for an interpretation to have been sought while proceedings were underway in the United States District Court.\n\n14.\n\nThe proper time for Romania to seek an interpretation was when it had sight of the Claimants' Motion to convert the currency of the Award to U.S. dollars as of the date of the Award's making. The scheme created by the Convention could easily have accommodated such a request. Given a tribunal's power under Article 50(2) to issue a stay of enforcement pending the resolution of the request and the clear wording of Article 53(2) (\"'award' shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52\"), at that point in time, the Tribunal's power to interpret its Award and the U.S. court's power to enforce the pecuniary obligations of the Award could have worked harmoniously within the framework of the Convention.\n\n15.\n\nAn interpretation application could have been considered, even though enforcement proceedings had already been initiated, because under Article 50(2) the Tribunal retained *in personam* jurisdiction over the Parties and could have ordered a stay.\n\n16.\n\nHowever, a stay from the Tribunal might well have been unnecessary because it is reasonable to assume that, properly instructed as to the United States' obligations under the Convention, the United States District Court would have acted consistently with those obligations, *viz*:\n\na. the District Court, informed of the Tribunal's power to interpret its own Award, would have paused the enforcement proceeding, either on application of a Party or on its own motion, pending the outcome of the interpretation proceeding; and\n\nb. hypothetically, had the Tribunal upheld Romania's interpretation of the Award's *dispositif,* the District Court would have given effect to the interpretation, as required by Article 53(2).6\n\nBy operation of Article 53(2), the fact that currency conversion is the \"normal practice\" of the District of Columbia Circuit would be of no effect if, hypothetically, the Tribunal ruled that currency conversion of the RON-denominated Awarded Amount as of the date of the Award was not consistent with the Award's *dispositif*, because the Award would then \"include any decision interpreting\" it. Bearing in mind that currency conversion is a form of relief that a party requests, it is to be expected that the District Court, once informed of the effect of Article 53(2), would hold that the normal practice was not available to the Claimants under the terms of the interpreted Award. Such a finding by the Tribunal of course would not preclude the conversion of the amount awarded brought forward to the date of the Court's enforcement order.\n\n17.\n\nOn this approach, there would be, on the one hand, no \"hermetic seal\", and, on the other, no potentially disjunctive disordering of international and municipal legal proceedings, such as would have occurred had the present Application succeeded.7 By this latter phrase, I mean the embarrassment that could result from the District Court's having made a final order, subsequently upheld on appeal, in part based on Romania's non-opposition to the currency conversion which, had it succeeded in the present Application, Romania would presumably then have used to try to overturn the order.8 This would work an unfairness on the Claimants and indeed on the District Court itself, given that its decision would be challenged on the basis of arguments that were not put to it at the time that it considered the merits of the requested relief.9\n\nIn this regard, counsel for Romania was somewhat vague as to the use to which an interpretation, if issued by the Tribunal, would have been put. The Claimants took issue with this: \"Consider this: Romania in paragraph 5 of its Reply insists, and I quote, 'Romania has not requested the review of any national court decision or order.' And you heard repeatedly this morning, do not concern yourselves with the ramifications of your interpretation. Yet, in an attempt to satisfy the third criterion under Wena Hotels, Romania is compelled to argue later in the same paragraph that the request 'may bear upon subsequent activity related to enforcement.' 'May bear upon' is just a euphemism. There is no question that Romania intends to use the requested interpretations to attempt to nullify the U.S. Judgments with which it is unhappy. This is an example of the sophistry discussed by Professor Paulsson, and it is disingenuous for Romania to attempt to deny the true aim of its request.\" Transcript, pp. 136-137.\n\nI note that at para. 102 of the Decision, the Tribunal approaches this point albeit from a somewhat different path.: \"There is no issue whether the ICSID framework allows for the filing of an application for interpretation of an award at any time. However, as a matter of experience and pure logic, as more time passes after the issuance of the award, the more difficult it becomes for the party seeking interpretation to establish its concrete need for the interpretation sought, i.e. its interest. A request for general interpretation of the award - without any concretely applicable consequences - would become more and more difficult to admit with the passage of time; presumably, any application for general interpretation of the award would have been filed earlier. In other words, if a party seeks interpretation of an award *in abstracto*, without any concrete interest, a long time after the issuance of the award, the real reasons behind such conduct are required to be clear. In the present case, what has essentially been nine years after the Award was issued is a long period. The Respondent does not show any concrete and actual legal interest in clarifying the Tribunal's findings in the Award other than in connection with the US proceedings.\"\n\nAs the Court observed when Romania sought to challenge the currency conversion after the award had already been converted and confirmed, the question of satisfaction of the judgment was, as a matter of local law, different from whether the Award itself has been satisfied: \"once the court entered Judgment in favor of Petitioners, the question became whether Romania has satisfied the Judgment as entered in U.S. dollars.\" Memorandum Opinion & Order, *Ioan Micula, et al. v. Gov't of Romania*, No. 1:17-cv-02332-APM (D.D.C. 20 Nov. 2020) (No. 159), at p. 8 (CI-006).\n\n18.\n\nIt is important to note that this is not a case where Romania was unaware of the relief being requested. Romania had knowledge of the Motion and was represented by counsel. No objection was taken. As the District Court observed in its Memorandum Opinion: \"Petitioners asked the Court to convert the Award to U.S. Dollars as of the date of the Award... . Romania has not objected to that request.\"10 When the judgment was appealed, Romania raised other objections to the District Court's decision, but it did not appeal the currency conversion point, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's judgment.11\n\nMemorandum Opinion, *Ioan Micula, et al. v. Gov't of Romania*, No. 17-cv-02332-APM (D.D.C. 11 Sept. 2019) (No. 86), at 31 n. 12 (CI-005) cited in the Claimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 65, footnote 121.\n\nJudgment, *Ioan Micula, et al. v. Gov't of Romania*, No. 20-7116 (D.C. Cir. 24 June 2022) (*per curiam*) (CI-011).\n\n19.\n\nWhen presented with unopposed motions, courts around the world tend to grant them. There is nothing objectionable about that unless the motion has been granted on an *ex parte* basis with no avenue for the affected party to later oppose the order or where there is some other significant procedural defect. There is no evidence of any defect in procedure in respect of the Motion at issue in this case.\n\n20.\n\nIn sum, on the facts of this case I would hold that the Application is inadmissible due to its untimeliness.12 On my approach it is therefore unnecessary to address Romania's four prayers for relief, but since my colleagues have done so in a manner about which I have reservations, I think it proper to express my concerns.\n\nOn this approach there would be no need to find as the Decision does, at para. 106, that \"it is not within its mandate, and outside the scope of an interpretation proceeding, to opine on whether the decisions of US courts and their consequences are correct.\"\n\n**III. The Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn their submissions, the Parties devoted considerable attention to the findings of two prior ICSID tribunals that considered requests for the interpretation of awards, the *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* and *ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* cases. Neither decision is of course binding upon the present Tribunal, but both are deserving of consideration for the tribunals' approach to applying Article 50.\n\n22.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal's general discussion of the criteria for admissibility of a request for interpretation discussed by the two cases.13 I have doubts about the mild reservations expressed about the approach taken in the *ATA Construction* case.14 Having regard to the fact that international law eschews formalism when it comes to determining the existence of a dispute, the *ATA Construction* tribunal's approach is, in my view, unobjectionable.\n\nDecision, paras. 81-95.\n\nDecision, paras. 88-89, 94.\n\n23.\n\nI also found it helpful to consider the circumstances which gave rise to the requests for interpretation in the two cases. The issue in both cases was that one of the disputing parties was said to have taken steps after the issuance of the award that were alleged to be inconsistent with the tribunal's binding orders.\n\n24.\n\nIn *Wena Hotels*, despite the Award's conclusion that Egypt had expropriated the Nile and Luxor Hotel lease and development agreements from Wena in 1991, legal actions were later commenced by Egypt and its constituent entities against Wena. Wena contended that such actions raised \"important questions about the Award's finding that Egypt expropriated Wena's interests in the Luxor Lease.\"15\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on the Application by Wena Hotels Ltd. for Interpretation of the Arbitral Award dated December 8,* 2000, 31 Oct. 2005, (RIL-001) (\"*Wena Hotels* Decision\"), para. 6. The *dispositif* of that award, at para. 135, stated: \"\u2026Egypt's actions amounted to an expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn particular, Wena asserted that the respondent embarked upon a campaign to further discredit it in the marketplace. The Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels (\"EGOTH\", the successor to the Wena Hotels' lease counterparty, \"EHC\"), filed suit against Wena in the courts to collect over US$ 7.1 million from Wena. EGOTH alleged in these proceedings that Wena owed the sum of US$ 7.1 million as rent under the Luxor Lease for the period from 15 November 1990, through 31 March2003. After this suit was dismissed, EGOTH filed a second, identical action with the same court, which was also dismissed.16 Wena asserted that in seeking rent from November 1990 through March 2003, \"EGOTH overlooked the Original Tribunal's determination that Egypt had expropriated Wena's interests in the Luxor Hotel on April 1, 1991.\"17\n\n*Wena Hotels* Decision, paras. 18-22.\n\n*Wena Hotels* Decision, para. 20.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition, EGOTH served Wena with a request for arbitration under a provision of the Luxor Lease, in which EGOTH claimed a sum of money for rent allegedly due by Wena under the Luxor Lease for the period from 15 November 1990, through 14 August 1997, and an additional sum for costs allegedly due to EGOTH as a result of a domestic arbitration between EHC and Wena conducted in 1990 under the Luxor Lease.\n\n27.\n\nTherefore, Wena requested \"\u2026 an interpretation of the Tribunal's determination that Egypt expropriated Wena's rights in the Luxor Lease and deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\". In particular, Wena requested that the interpretation \"address whether the expropriation constituted a total, permanent deprivation of Wena's rights in the Luxor Lease, such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary.\"18\n\n*Wena Hotels Decision*, para. 33(a).\n\n28.\n\nAs for the *ATA Construction* case, the tribunal's award provided that an arbitration clause that had been wrongly nullified by court action was enforceable and the *dispositif* ordered that the claimant, ATA Construction, \"was entitled to proceed to arbitration in relation to the Dike No. 19 dispute in accordance with the terms of the Arbitration Agreement set forth in the Contract of 2 May 1998.\"\n\n29.\n\nQuestions subsequently arose as to whether that arbitration agreement could be invoked by ATA Construction's counterparty as well as by ATA Construction. ATA Construction argued 'no' and the Jordanian counterparty argued 'yes.' Given their disagreement, the respondent reverted to the tribunal for an interpretation, requesting that \"the Tribunal clarify that in making its Award, it 'intended to restore the Arbitration Agreement as it stood before its extinguishment pursuant to the last sentence of Article 51 of the Jordan Arbitration Law, with full reciprocal rights for both contractual signatories'.\"19\n\n*ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/2, Decision on Interpretation and on the Request for Provisional Measures, 7 Mar. 2011, (RIL-003) (\"*ATA Construction* Decision\"), para. 8.\n\n30.\n\nThe respondent further clarified its request as follows: \"The Government accordingly seeks confirmation that the Tribunal did not intend, in ordering the 'restorative' relief that it contemplated, a one-sided and prejudicial commercial arbitration agreement under which only Claimant has the right to pursue its claims against APC, and APC has no corresponding right to pursue its claims against ATA. The Government submits that the Tribunal instead intended a restoration of the Arbitration Agreement as it stood before extinguishment, with each party thereto having full and equal right and reciprocal obligations thereunder.\"20\n\n*ATA Construction* Decision, para. 25.\n\n31.\n\nBearing in mind the reasons why interpretations were sought in the two cases, a review not only of the two tribunals' statements as to the mandate of an interpretation tribunal, but also of the facts of the two cases, reveals the following points:\n\na. Interpretative disputes, by definition, arise after the award's issuance; it is unsurprising that unanticipated questions might arise as to how an award is to be implemented, even if the award on its face appears to be clear. Thus, both tribunals were untroubled by the fact that they were being asked to \"seek[] pronouncements from the Tribunal on facts subsequent to the Award\", to use my colleagues' phrasing, when they hold that \"interpretation cannot extend beyond the text, for which interpretation is sought.\"21\n\nb. The existence of a dispute can be shown either by conflicting statements as to the meaning of an award (*ATA Construction*) or through the acts of one of the parties to the dispute after the award's issuance (*Wena Hotels* and *ATA Construction*).\n\nc. The *Wena Hotels* tribunal had no difficulty in elaborating upon what it had decided by explicitly holding that the intention of the original tribunal was to find a \"total and permanent\" expropriation. In so doing, the tribunal added words that were not used in the award's discussion of expropriation. In other words, the tribunal elaborated upon its earlier finding.\n\nd. The *ATA Construction* tribunal had no difficulty in interpreting its award even though it considered it to have been clear. The tribunal also had no difficulty in accepting a request to \"*confirm* what the Tribunal intended in regard to the restorative relief it ordered\u2026\"22\n\ne. Both tribunals also had no difficulty in considering the question of *party compliance* with their awards. *ATA Construction* both ordered compliance with sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 of the award's *dispositif*23 and expressly *confirmed* Jordan's \"interpretation of subparagraph 133(4) of the Tribunal's Award\u2026\"24 *Wena Hotels* not only interpreted the meaning of the word \"expropriation\" as used in the award, but went on to specify the date on which the expropriation took effect and further considered the question \"whether Egypt is precluded from taking legal actions that presume the contrary.\"25 This latter finding clearly went to the issue of a party's compliance with the award.\n\nDecision, para. 95.\n\n*ATA Construction* Decision, para. 37.\n\n\"4. To order that the ongoing Jordanian court proceedings in relation to the Dike No. 19 dispute be immediately and unconditionally terminated, with no possibility to engage further judicial proceedings in Jordan or elsewhere on the substance of the dispute.\"\n\n*ATA Construction* Decision, para. 50.\n\n*Wena Hotels* Decision, paras. 70, 96, 98, 109, 111, 125, 132, and 136.\n\n32.\n\nBoth of these cases, in my view, exhibited a less restrictive approach to the process of interpretation than the approach taken by my distinguished colleagues.\n\n33.\n\nFor example, the majority's concern when rejecting Prayer for Relief (A), that Romania is seeking to add a word that was not contained in the Award \u2013 the word \"*only*\"26 \u2013 was not shared by the *Wena Hotels* tribunal, where the tribunal went considerably further in its interpretation decision than it did in its award to explain what it had intended when it found an expropriation.\n\nDecision, paras. 100 (a) and (b): \"\u2026adding 'only' to the Tribunal's findings may result in a tautology, which would *not* assist either in the interpretation of the Award or in establishing the true meaning of its terms\" and \"if introducing the word 'only' had any substantive meaning, i.e., if it added to her explained the text of the Award, then doing so would result in correcting the findings of the Award. However, this correction is not a relief that the Parties are seeking in this proceeding and rightly so.\"\n\n34.\n\nIn my respectful view, Romania's use of the word \"only\" in Prayer for Relief (A) was not intended as a \"correction\" of the *dispositif*, but rather as a part of Romania's attempt to obtain confirmation of the precise nature of the pecuniary obligations that the Tribunal intended to paragraph 1329 of the Award. In this sense, the Application was similar to Wena Hotel's request that the tribunal confirm that when it found an expropriation, it meant to find a \"total and permanent\" expropriation. The tribunal obliged and as already noted, added words that were not used in the award's discussion of expropriation. That does not seem objectionable to me, and it does not amount to correction of the Award.\n\n35.\n\nSimilarly, as noted above in para. 31 above, both tribunals were untroubled by the fact that they were called upon to consider whether what one of the parties had done in post-award activities complied with their awards. In *Wena Hotels*, the actions taken by the respondent could not have been anticipated at the time of the award's making. This was no hurdle to interpreting the award. What is the difference in principle between the Claimants seeking an uplift in the value of the Award when enforcing it \u2013 clearly unanticipated by the Award \u2013 and the Egyptian entities subsequently suing Wena Hotels for rents supposedly due on properties that had been found to have already been expropriated? Or ATA Construction's taking the position that the benefit of a resuscitated arbitration clause accrued only to it and not to its counterparty? In all three cases, acts were later taken that could not or were not anticipated at the time of the Award's making.\n\n36.\n\nOn another point, in the present case, Romania's Prayer for Relief (B) requested the Tribunal to interpret whether in order to \"abide by and comply with the terms of the Award\", Romania was \"only required to pay the Awarded Amount to the Claimants (and the Claimants are entitled to nothing more)\".27 The Tribunal found this to be inadmissible because it is based on Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention \"which the Award did not address.\"28 I respectfully do not find this persuasive. There was no need for the Tribunal to have adverted to Articles 53 and 54 of the Convention in its Award in order for it to consider whether the Claimants complied with the terms of the Award's *dispositif*. Once again, both the *Wena Hotels* and *ATA Construction* tribunals had no difficulty considering questions of party compliance with what had been decided with binding force.\n\nDecision, para. 105.\n\nDecision, paras. 105-106.\n\n37.\n\nFinally, I turn to the Tribunal's determination that there is nothing in the present case capable of giving rise to a dispute of the meaning or scope of the Award because the wording of paragraph 1329 has not been shown to be unclear.29 I repeat that on my approach I would not have reached this question, but I do think that the interpretative question presented for decision now is essentially no different from which could have been presented in 2018.\n\nDecision, para. 100.\n\n38.\n\nTo begin, I agree with the Tribunal that \"the Tribunal's mandate is limited to the findings made in the Award with binding force.\"30 I believe that Romania's request meets that condition because the central argument turns on the meaning of certain subparagraphs of paragraph 1329 of the Award \u2013 the *dispositif* which contains the Tribunal's binding orders.\n\nDecision, para. 99.\n\n39.\n\nSecondly, I do not take issue with the Tribunal's statement in the Decision that \"the Tribunal did not consider whether enforcement would allow or even require the conversion of the awarded RON claim into a different currency, let alone what date such conversion would be performed or what would be the rate of interest on the amount in a different currency (other than RON).\"31 But, with respect, I do not think that is the correct way to conceive of the question.\n\nDecision, para. 103.\n\n40.\n\nWhat is indisputably clear is that the Tribunal, when formulating its relief, awarded damages exclusively in one currency and stipulated post-Award interest in the same currency. It did not turn its mind to any other currency. The real question is whether having selected one and only one currency to denominate the damages awarded, the Tribunal's intention was that that currency, and no other, would be used to bring the principal forward to the date of payment. It is not an answer to say that the Tribunal did not consider currency conversion or enforcement issues for that begs the question why it should have done so when it had already settled on a specific currency for both principal and post-Award interest.\n\n41.\n\nI note in this respect that the precise wording of the *dispositif* went further than simply specifying: (i) the *amount* of damages awarded (in subparagraph 1329 (c)); and (ii) the *means* for making the Claimants whole if, as what in fact transpired, Romania did not pay promptly (in subparagraph 1329 (d)).\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal then tied the payment of the principal and the stipulated post-Award interest to \"full payment\" of the Award. In other words, it addressed the legal situation that would result from payment of principal and post-Award interest, namely, the discharge of the Respondent's obligations under the Award.32\n\nAward, para. 1329(d): \"The Respondent is ordered to pay interest on the amount specified in subparagraph (c) above, at 3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis, calculated from the following dates until full payment of the Award\u2026\"\n\n43.\n\nIn short, according to paragraph 1329, if Romania paid the principal, brought forward to the date of payment by means of the specified interest rate \u2013 all based on Romanian currency \u2013 that constituted full payment of the Award. This was decided with binding force.\n\n44.\n\nThe precise question for interpretation therefore would have been whether the Motion to convert the amount awarded to US dollars as of the date of the Award was consistent with what was ordered with binding force in paragraph 1329(d). The argument would be that from 11 December 2013, the date of the Award, to 28 June 2018, the date of the Motion, the present-day value of the Award was calculable in RON \u2013 because that was the only currency to which the Tribunal turned its mind. As of the date of the Motion, that sum could be determined with certainty.\n\n45.\n\nThe argument, to continue, would be that that sum of post-Award interest would be displaced if the Court were to convert the sum from RON to USD as of the date of the Award, and then bring the USD sum forward to the date of its Order using the Tribunal's stipulated *lei*-based post-Award interest rate. This, it could be argued, was mixing apples (ordered by the *dispositif*) for oranges (a currency not within the Tribunal's contemplation) and the effect, if accepted by the District Court, would be to increase the pecuniary obligations of the Award before or at the time that the Award's pecuniary obligations were being transformed into a judgment of the Court.\n\n46.\n\nObviously, the *dispositif* stated the legal consequence of \"full payment\" of the Award and according to the Claimants, it was because there was no full payment that they moved for enforcement in the U.S. courts. The effect of that fact on the precise wording and operative effect of the *dispostif* no doubt would have generated submissions from both Parties.\n\n47.\n\nIn the end, one need not take a final view as to whether Romania would have been right or wrong in order to see that if the Claimants had persisted in seeking conversion as of the date of the Award, there would have been a clear difference of opinion between the Parties as to the restorative relief ordered by the Tribunal. There would have been conflicting statements and inconsistent positions as to whether the post-Award action taken by the Claimants (similar to the post-award actions taken by the claimant in *ATA Construction* and the respondent in *Wena Hotels*) was consistent with what the Tribunal ordered in paragraph 1329(d). There would also have been, to use the *Wena Hotels* tribunal's words (later embraced by *ATA Construction*) satisfaction of the condition that the requested interpretation \"must have some practical relevance to the Award's implementation.\"33 And finally, in my view, it would have been open to Romania to request the Tribunal to \"confirm what the Tribunal intended in regard to the restorative relief it ordered\u2026\"34 Therefore, there would have been a dispute as to the meaning or scope of what the Tribunal decided with binding force.\n\n*ATA Construction* Decision, para. 27.\n\n*ATA Construction* Decision, para. 37.\n\n48.\n\nAs already found, however, since the dispute was not identified at the proper time and the Tribunal and the Court were not then given the opportunity to interact with each other in a harmonious fashion as described above, whatever may be the merits of the argument against currency conversion as of the date of the Award\u2019s making, to use the words of Judge Mehta, \"that ship has long sailed.\"35 It is now too late to request an interpretation that might have prevented the Motion from being accepted by the District Court.\n\nDate: 7 December 2023\n\nMemorandum Opinion & Order, *loan Micula, et al.* v. *Gov\u2019t of Romania,* No. 1:17-cv-02332-APM (D.D.C. 20 Nov. 2020) (No. 159), at p. 10 (CI-006): \"To the extent that Romania is using its Rule 60(b)(5) motion to challenge the court\u2019s conversion of the ICSID Award to U.S. dollars, that ship has long sailed.

Christopher Thomas**\n\n6.\n\nTwo of the three arbitrators in the present proceedings, Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy (president) and Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, were members of the Tribunal that issued the Award. In view of the decision of the third arbitrator, Prof. Georges Abi-Saab, to decline to serve in this proceeding, Mr. J. Christopher Thomas was appointed in his stead.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal Secretary in this proceeding is:\n\n**Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti**\n\nICSID MSN C3-300  \n1818 H Street, N.W. Washington  \nDC 20433 USA\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal Assistant in this proceeding \u2013 appointed with the Parties' consent \u2013 is:\n\n**Ms. Ksenia Panerai** (formerly Koroteeva)\n\n**III. Procedural History**\n---------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 18 February 2022, ICSID received Romania's Application for Interpretation of 18 February 2022 (\"Application\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 4 March 2022, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application in accordance with Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\") and notified the Parties of the registration. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(1)(a), the Secretary-General transmitted the Application to the members of the Tribunal that served in the original arbitration, Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy (President), Prof. Georges Abi-Saab and Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(1)(b), the Secretary-General asked the members of the Tribunal to inform the Centre whether they were willing to take part in the consideration of the Application.\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 March 2022, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy and Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov expressed their willingness to take part in the consideration of the Application, but that Prof. Georges Abi-Saab had informed the Centre that he is not in a position to act in the interpretation proceeding. The Secretary-General thus informed the Parties that the Tribunal cannot be reconstituted and invited them to proceed to constitute a new Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 11 May 2022, the Respondent appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC, a national of Canada, as co-arbitrator. Mr. Thomas accepted his appointment on 12 May 2022.\n\n13.\n\nOn 27 May 2022, the Claimants appointed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as co-arbitrator. Dr. Alexandrov accepted his appointment on 8 June 2022.\n\n14.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimants proposed the appointment of Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy, a national of Brazil and Switzerland, as President of the Tribunal. The Respondent accepted Dr. L\u00e9vy's appointment on 16 June 2023.\n\n15.\n\nOn 1 July 2022, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed constituted on that date. Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, ICSID Senior Legal Counsel/Team Leader, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 July 2023, the Center sent to the Parties the initial advance payment request inviting each party to make a payment of USD 150,000. The Centre received the Respondent's payment on 17 August 2023. No payment was received from the Claimants.\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 July 2023, the Tribunal proposed to appoint Ms. Ksenia Panerai (formerly Koroteeva) as an assistant to the Tribunal. The Claimants and the Respondent consented to Ms. Panerai's appointment respectively on 18 July 2022 and 28 July 2022.\n\n18.\n\nOn 3 August 2022, the Claimants filed two requests: (i) to re-allocate the advance on costs; and (ii) to order security for costs (the \"Requests\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 2 September 2022, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants' Requests, asking the Tribunal to reject them.\n\n20.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session by video conference with the Parties on 29 September 2022. During the first session, the Parties confirmed that the Claimants' Requests are ripe for the Tribunal's decision.\n\n21.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 3 October 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 1 January 2003, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C.\n\n22.\n\nOn 11 October 2022, the Tribunal rendered a Decision on the Claimants' Request for Re-allocation of Advance on Costs and Security for Costs dismissing both Requests.\n\n23.\n\nOn 2 November 2022, the Centre notified to the Parties the Claimants' default in paying the amount requested in the Centre's letter of 6 July 2022. The Respondent paid the Claimants' share of the advance on 29 November 2022.\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 December 2022, the Respondent filed its Memorial on interpretation (the \"Memorial\") along with an expert report of Prof. Emeritus Maurice Mendelson KC.\n\n25.\n\nOn 9 March 2023, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on interpretation (the \"Counter-Memorial\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 16 March 2023, the Respondent requested leave to submit a Reply Memorial. The Claimants opposed such request on 20 March 2023.\n\n27.\n\nOn 22 March 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would benefit from an additional round of submissions.\n\n28.\n\nOn 13 April 2023, the Respondent filed its Reply on interpretation (the \"Reply\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 21 April 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n30.\n\nOn 3 May 2023, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on interpretation (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n31.\n\nA hearing on interpretation was held in Washington D.C. on 15 April 2023 (the \"Hearing\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Tribunal* :\n\nDr. Laurent L\u00e9vy President\n\nDr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov Arbitrator  \nMr. J. Christopher Thomas KC Arbitrator  \nMs. Ksenia Panerai Assistant to the Tribunal\n\n*ICSID Secretariat*:\n\nMr. Benjamin Garel Acting Secretary of the Tribunal  \nMr. Shay Lakhter Paralegal\n\n*For the Claimants*:\n\nMr. Francis Vasquez F.A.

The Respondent's payment was received on 18 July 2023. On the same date, the Centre notified the Parties of the Claimants' default in making the requested payment. The Respondent paid the Claimants' share of the advance on 2 August 2023.\n\n34.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 8 September 2023.\n\n**IV. Background of Romania's Application for Interpretation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe original arbitration started in 2005. The procedural history of the original arbitration is described in detail in the Award.1\n\nAward, paras. 10-129.\n\n36.\n\nOn 11 December 2013, the Claimants were awarded RON 376,433,229 plus interest (the \"Awarded Amount\") as damages. The operative part of the Award rendered in the original arbitration reads as follows:\n\n\"For the reasons stated in the body of this Award, the Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\na. The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has violated Article 2(4) of the BIT by failing to observe obligations entered into with the Claimants with regard to their investments is dismissed by majority.\n\nb. The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has violated Article 2(3) of the BIT by failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants' investments is upheld by majority. In view of this decision, the Tribunal does not need to determine whether the Respondent has breached the BIT by impairing the Claimants' investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures (Article 2(3) of the BIT, second part) or by expropriating the Claimants' investments without the payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation (Article 4(1) of the BIT).\n\nc. As a result of the Respondent's breach of the BIT, the Claimants are awarded and the Respondent is ordered to pay RON 376,433,229 as damages, broken down as follows:\n\ni. RON 85,100,000 for increased costs of sugar;\n\nii. RON 17,500,000 for increased costs of raw materials other than sugar or PET;\n\niii. RON 18,133,229 for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar; and\n\niv. RON 255,700,000 for lost profits on sales of finished goods.\n\nd. The Respondent is ordered to pay interest on the amount specified in sub-paragraph (c) above, at 3-month ROBOR plus 5%, compounded on a quarterly basis, calculated from the following dates until full payment of the Award:\n\ni. With respect to the claims for increased cost of sugar and other raw materials, interest shall be calculated from 1 March 2007.\n\nii. With respect to the claim for the lost opportunity to stockpile sugar, interest shall be calculated from 1 November 2009.\n\niii. With respect to the claim for lost profits on sales of finished goods, interest shall be calculated from 1 May 2008.\n\ne. The Claimants on one side and the Respondent on the other shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares, and each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs incurred in connection with this case.\n\nf. All provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal will cease to have effect as of the date of dispatch of this Award.\n\ng. All other claims or prayers for relief are dismissed.\"\n\n37.\n\nOn 9 April 2014, Romania filed an annulment application against the Award. That application was dismissed on 26 February 2016.2\n\n*Micula et al., v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Annulment, 26 Feb. 2016, **Exh.

CI-11**.\n\n39.\n\nIn the meantime, in light of Romania's accession to the European Union (the \"EU\"), the Award was subjected to examination by the European Commission (the \"EC\").8 On 30 March 2015, the EC issued a suspension injunction prohibiting Romania from paying the Award until the EC decided whether the Award constituted (unlawful) state aid (\"the 2015 State Aid Decision\").9\n\nApplication, paras. 14-19; Memorial, paras. 21-24\n\nCommission Decision (EU) 2015/1470 on State Aid SA 38517 (2014/C) (ex 2014/NN) implemented by Romania dated 30 Mar. 2015, at 1-2, **Exh.

CI-76**, at 3.\n\n40.\n\nOn 18 June 2019, the General Court annulled the 2015 State Aid Decision. It ruled that satisfying the Award would not constitute impermissible state aid since the Award compensated the Claimants for incentives that were repealed prior to Romania's accession to the EU.10 On 25 January 2022, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") set aside that decision11 and remanded the case back to the General Court. The Tribunal understands that the proceedings in the General Court are ongoing.\n\nJudgment of the General Court dated 18 June 2019, **Exh. RI-5**, paras. 67, 79, 111\n\nJudgment of the CJEU in Case No. C-6831/19 P dated 25 Jan. 2022, **Exh. CI-67**, at 21.\n\n41.\n\nThe Parties agree that the enforcement of the Award and other post-Award activities -briefly mentioned above - have limited relevance to the interpretation of the Award.12 That said, they are relevant to understanding the nature of Romania's Application, *i.e.*, whether it is a real request for interpretation, within the meaning of the ICSID Convention, and whether it is an abuse of process.\n\nReply, para. 12. Specifically, the Respondent says that these facts \"are not relevant to the decision of the Tribunal as to its ultimate interpretation of the Award.\"  \nRejoinder, para. 6. The Claimants state that \"[t]he following facts are essential to the Tribunal's consideration of the Request because, as Romania concedes, its conduct in enforcement activities is relevant to whether this Request is proper, or otherwise, an abuse of process.\"\n\n**V. The Parties' Prayers for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn the Application for Interpretation, the Respondent asked for the following relief:13\n\n\"The Applicants respectfully request that the Tribunal issue its interpretation as to the Award as follows:\n\na) The 'pecuniary obligations' of the Award (as referred to in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention) owed by Romania to the Claimants are RON 376,433,229, plus interest, as set out in paragraphs 1329 of the Award (the 'Awarded Amount'), and there are no other pecuniary obligations under the Award.\n\nb) In order to 'abide by and comply with the terms of the award' as required by Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, Romania is only required under the Award to pay the Awarded Amount to Claimants, and Claimants are entitled to nothing more than the Awarded Amount under the Award.\n\nc) Romania has abided by and complied with the terms of Award by paying Claimants the Awarded Amount, and thus Claimants have no other remedy under the Award.\n\nd) By seeking to continue enforcement of the Award after Romania paid the Awarded Amount, and collect further monies from Romania under the Award, Claimants have failed and continue to fail to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award.\"\n\nApplication, para. 46.\n\n43.\n\nIn the Memorial, the Respondent's prayer for relief was slightly modified:14\n\n\"The Applicants respectfully request that the Tribunal issue its interpretation as to the Award as follows:\n\na) The 'Pecuniary Obligations' of the Award, as Referred to in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, Require that Romania Only Pay to the Claimants the Awarded Amount (i.e., RON 376,433,229, plus interest, as set out in paragraph 1329 of the Award), and There Are No Other Pecuniary Obligations Under the Award.\n\nb) In Order to 'Abide by and Comply with the Terms of the Award' as Required by Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, Romania is Only Required to Pay the Awarded Amount to Claimants.\n\nc) Romania's Payment of the Awarded Amount to Claimant Operates to Satisfy the Terms of Award and Discharge the Pecuniary Obligations Under the Award, and Claimants Have No Other Remedy Under the Award.\n\nd) Claimants' Continued Enforcement of the Award After Romania's Payment of the Awarded Amount to Claimant Amounts to a Failure by Claimants To Abide By and Comply with the Terms of the Award.\"\n\nMemorial, para. 65.\n\n44.\n\nIn the Reply, the Respondent confirmed the prayer for relief as set out in the Memorial:15\n\n\"Applicant respectfully requests that the Tribunal\n\n(a) grant the request and issue its interpretation as requested by Romania, and to the extent the Tribunal disagrees with any of the requested interpretations, that it reformulates such interpretation as it deems just and proper;\n\n(b) award Romania's its costs, including its attorneys fees and the fees of its experts; and\n\n(c) grant such other relief as it may deem just and proper.\"\n\nReply, p. 20 para. 38.\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants ask for the following relief:16\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons, Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n\u2022 DECLARE Romania's Request for Interpretation inadmissible; or alternatively,\n\n\u2022 DENY Romania's Request for Interpretation on the merits; and in any event\n\n\u2022 ORDER Romania to reimburse Claimants' attorney's fees and expenses and to pay all arbitration fees, expenses, and other costs of the present proceeding; and\n\n\u2022 GRANT such other relief as it may deem just.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 96; Rejoinder, para. 42.\n\n**VI. Admissibility of Romania's Application**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Parties' arguments, insofar as they are necessary to decide the Respondent's Application, have been recounted below, although the Tribunal may further develop the Parties' position in the analysis itself. While it has considered all of the Parties' arguments, for reasons of procedural economy, the Tribunal has reproduced only what it views as the most important and relevant arguments for its decision.\n\n**1) The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, a request for interpretation is admissible, if it satisfies the following requirements: (i) there has to be a dispute between the original parties as to the meaning or scope of the award; (ii) the purpose of the application must be to obtain an interpretation of the award; and (iii) the dispute must at least have some practical relevance to the award's implementation.17 For the Claimants, Romania's Application does not meet any of them.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 54, referring to *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on the Application by Wena Hotels Ltd. for Interpretation of the Arbitral Award dated 8 December 2000, 31 Oct. 2005, **Exh. RIL-1** (\"*Wena v. Egypt*\"), para. 24.\n\n**a) Meaning or Scope of the Award**\n------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there is no dispute between the Parties as to the meaning or the scope of the Award.18 The Respondent does not point to any term or phrase in the Award that may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or is objectively ambiguous. In the Claimants' view, there is nothing ambiguous about the Award, including the recitation of damages in paragraph 1329 of the Award.19\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 57-59; Rejoinder, paras. 20-23.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 58, 65; Rejoinder, paras. 20-23.\n\n49.\n\nFor the Claimants, Romania's focus on the Award's \"pecuniary obligations\" is an attempt to manufacture a dispute where none exists. The term \"pecuniary obligations\" is not mentioned by the Award, which the Respondent asks to interpret.20 Rather, the term appears only in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.21 In light of this, for the Claimants, the real dispute between the Parties is whether the damages awarded to the Claimants in the Award may be converted into local currencies in domestic enforcement proceedings and, if so, at what rate and at what time the conversion should be performed.22 However, the Parties' dispute about the enforcement of the Award falls squarely outside the scope of the Tribunal's mandate, as it is subject to the competence of local courts.23\n\nRejoinder, para. 20. The Tribunal observes that the term is in fact mentioned in the Award, but only in the quotation of the text of Article 54 to which the Tribunal referred in passing and again in the discussion of whether a tribunal can award non-pecuniary as well as pecuniary relief. See paras. 1310-1311, where the Tribunal noted that Article 54(1) \"should not be interpreted as limiting ICSID tribunals to awarding pecuniary relief.\" It is, however, correct to say that the Tribunal did not turn its mind to how Article 54 would govern any possible enforcement activities concerning its Award.\n\nArticle 54 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"(1) Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state (2) A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation. (3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.\" (Underlining added)\n\nRejoinder, para. 23. For the sake of convenience, the Tribunal will refer to these issues as \"the Local Currency Issues.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 67, 72, 76; Rejoinder, paras. 25-26.\n\n**b) Purpose to Obtain a True Interpretation**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants argue that Romania's Application does not seek a true interpretation of any term in the Award. The Claimants maintain that the real issue in dispute is what is defined in this Decision as the Local Currency Issues, which are subject to the competence of enforcement courts rather than the Tribunal's.24 In the Claimants' submission, the ICSID Convention assigns the roles to ICSID tribunals and the Contracting States as follows: arbitral tribunals decide disputes, the courts of the Contracting States enforce and execute awards. Specifically, Article 54 of the ICSID Convention25 provides that the Contracting States shall recognize any ICSID award as binding and empowers an award creditor to turn to the Contracting States, whose role is to enforce pecuniary obligations in accordance with the law of the enforcement jurisdiction if the debtor has failed to satisfy it voluntarily.26 Contrary to Romania's contention, the fact that Article 50(2) of the ICSID Convention27 allows a tribunal to stay enforcement of an award pending an interpretation request does not mean that Romania's Application falls within the scope of the Article 50(1) inquiry.28\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 60-66; Rejoinder, paras. 24-27.\n\nSee fn. 21 above.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 62; Rejoinder, para. 25, referring to Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention (see fn. 21 above).\n\nArticle 50 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"(1) If any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award, either party may request interpretation of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General. (2) The request shall, if possible, be submitted to the Tribunal which rendered the award. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter. The Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision.\"\n\nRejoinder, para. 27.\n\n51.\n\nThus, for the Claimants, Romania's Application is not a true request for interpretation of the Award, but a \"thinly veiled attempt to interfere with its enforcement under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention\",29 principally because Romania is \"unhappy with the U.S. courts' determination.\"30\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 65.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 81; Rejoinder, para. 3.\n\n**c) Practical Relevance to the Award's Implementation**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants argue further that Romania's Application is not focused on resolving ambiguity within the Award that would affect its future implementation, but rather, Romania is trying to interfere with the way that the Award has already been enforced in domestic courts, especially in the US.31\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 66-72; Rejoinder, paras. 28-29.\n\n**d) Abuse of process**\n-----------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants add that Romania's Application is so vexatious as to warrant its dismissal under the doctrine of abuse of process. That doctrine is rooted in the principle of good faith and \"prohibits the exercise of a procedural right in contravention of the purpose for which that right was established.\" The Claimants cite decisions where tribunals have found abuse of process when a party's \"motivation for initiating arbitration\" is \"to harass and exert pressure on another party\", or when a party \"initiates more than one proceeding to resolve the same or related dispute in order to maximize its chances of success.\"32\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 74-77, referring to John P.

CIL-30**. *See also* Rejoinder, paras. 30-35.\n\n54.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, Romania's Application is abusive in three specific ways.\n\n55.\n\nFirst, Romania is using the Application to evade its obligations to pay the judgment rendered by US courts enforcing the Award.33\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 79-80; Rejoinder, paras. 32-33.\n\n56.\n\nSecond, Romania initiated this interpretation proceeding in order to resolve the same or related dispute - that has already been resolved in domestic courts - in order to maximize its chances of success,\" which in turn \"is highly prejudicial\" to the Claimants.34\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 81; Rejoinder, para. 34.\n\n57.\n\nThird, Romania's Application is yet \"another attempt to harass and intimidate [the] Claimants into withdrawing their valid enforcement proceedings.\" Romania has threatened the Claimants and their related companies by commencing numerous enforcement actions, revoking licenses, and filing dilatory and meritless claims in multiple fora.35\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 82; Rejoinder, para. 35.\n\n**2) The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs mentioned previously,36 the Claimants proposed the test that this Tribunal should apply to determine the admissibility of a request for interpretation and relied on *Wena Hotels*.37 The Respondent in principle agrees with the test set out by the Claimants. However, for the Respondent, it is \"not necessary to show the existence of a dispute in a specific manner.\"38 Romania emphasises that the *Wena Hotels* and *ATA Construction* cases, taken together, show that objective ambiguity is not required.39 Rather, it is important that the Parties have divergent views on definite points in relation to the Award's meaning or scope.40\n\n*See* para. 47 above.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 54.\n\nReply, para. 39.\n\nReply, para. 38.\n\nMemorial, para. 66.\n\n59.\n\nRomania underlines and confirms that it does not seek an interpretation of how or in what manner enforcement proceedings are conducted.41 Rather, it seeks interpretation of the Award and advances four independent prayers for relief42 that are summarised below.\n\nReply, para. 61.\n\nSee paras. 42-44 above.\n\n**a) Meaning or Scope of the Award**\n------------------------------------\n\n*i. Romania's Prayer for Relief (a)*\n------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (a), Romania seeks an interpretation of what Romania's \"pecuniary obligations\" are under the Award.43 Romania requests that the Tribunal declare that the pecuniary obligations imposed by the Award \"are RON 376,433,229, plus interest, as set out in paragraph 1329 of the Award (the 'Awarded Amount')\", and there are no other pecuniary obligations under the Award.44\n\nApplication, para. 2; Memorial, paras. 65-74; Memorial, p. 24, paras. 38-42; Reply, paras. 36-40.  \nFor convenience purpose, the Tribunal quotes anew Memorial, para. 65: \"a) The 'Pecuniary Obligations' of the Award, as Referred to in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, Require that Romania Only Pay to the Claimants the Awarded Amount (i.e., RON 376,433,229, plus interest, as set out in paragraph 1329 of the Award), and There Are No Other Pecuniary Obligations Under the Award.\"\n\nMemorial, paras. 68-69; Memorial, p. 24, paras. 38-42. The precise wording of Prayer for Relief (a) is reproduced in paras. 42-44 above.\n\n61.\n\nIn Romania's view, the Parties dispute what Romania's \"pecuniary obligations\" are. The Respondent alleges that it paid in full the amounts awarded to the Claimants in the Award, *i.e.,* RON 376,433,229 plus interest, as set out in paragraph 1329 of the Award, but the Claimants have continued their enforcement proceedings, premised upon the Award, and seek to collect amounts beyond the pecuniary obligations of the Award. The Respondent stresses that in the United States proceeding that additional amount comes to nearly an additional USD 100 million.45\n\nMemorial, p. 18, para. 70.\n\n62.\n\nThus, Romania asks this Tribunal to \"declare that the pecuniary obligations imposed by the Award are the Awarded Amount (in RON) only\" such that \"Romania is not obligated by the Award to pay any other amount or value that may be implicated based upon the [conversion] of RON to any other currency.\"46\n\nMemorial, pp. 25-26, paras. 42, 49. The precise wording of Prayer for Relief (b) is reproduced in paras. 42-44 above.\n\n*ii. Romania's Prayer for Relief (b)*\n-------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (b), Romania seeks a declaration that in order to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award, under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention,47 Romania must only \"pay the Awarded Amount as mandated by the Tribunal according to the terms of the Award in RON, and Romania is not required to pay any other amount based upon the conversation (sic) of RON into any other currency.\"48\n\nArticle 53 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.  \n(2) For the purposes of this Section, 'award' shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.\"\n\nMemorial, p. 26, para. 49.\n\n64.\n\nFor the Respondent, there is a dispute between the Parties as to whether Romania has abided by and complied with the terms of the Award, and what Romania must do in order to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award.49 In the Respondent's view, Romania has abided by and complied with the pecuniary obligations stated in the Award, and has satisfied the Award in full based upon the Claimants' expert calculation, which calculated the Awarded Amount in RON.50\n\nMemorial, pp. 25-27, paras. 43-52.\n\nMemorial, p. 25, para. 45.\n\n65.\n\nRomania reiterates that the Award does not state that Romania must pay the required RON under its operative part (\"dispositif\") based upon the exchange rate of USD or any other foreign currency at the time of the Award. For the Respondent, there is nothing in the Award that indicates that the measure or value of USD has any relevance to the pecuniary obligations of the Award.51\n\nMemorial, p. 26, para. 48.\n\n*iii. Romania's Prayer for Relief (c)*\n--------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (c), Romania asks the Tribunal to confirm that payment of the Awarded Amount to the Claimants operates to satisfy the terms of the Award and discharge the pecuniary obligations under the Award, and the Claimants have no other remedy under the Award.52 The Respondent asks the Tribunal what it takes for the Award to be satisfied under the terms of the Award and the ICSID Convention. In the Respondent's view, there is \"no better or more appropriate authority to determine that question than this Tribunal, as that question relates to the meaning of the Award and defining and clarifying the pecuniary obligations of the Award.\" For Romania, the Tribunal may provide clarification and guidance in general as to the enforcement of the Award in light of the Tribunal's orders and the terms of the Award.53\n\nMemorial, pp. 27-28, paras. 53-58.\n\nMemorial, p. 28, para. 56.\n\n*iv. Romania's Prayer for Relief (d)*\n-------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (d), Romania asks the Tribunal to interpret the Claimants' continued enforcement of the Award after Romania's payment of the Awarded Amount to the Claimants amounts to a failure by the Claimants to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award. For Romania, the Claimants are trying to expand and increase the pecuniary obligations of the Award. This is a violation of the terms of the Award.54\n\nMemorial, p. 29, paras. 59-62.\n\n**b) Purpose to Obtain a True Interpretation**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nRomania confirms that it does not seek to change or overturn any aspect of the Award. Neither does it seek the Tribunal's opinion on the judgments rendered in the US or any other national court decision.55 Rather, the purpose of this proceeding is simply to obtain clarification and interpretation from the Tribunal as to the meaning or scope of the Award's operative paragraphs relating to the payments that need to be made by Romania to Claimants, *i.e.,* the pecuniary obligations under the Award.56\n\nReply, paras. 41-43.\n\nMemorial, pp. 19-20, paras. 75-80.\n\n69.\n\nFurther, Romania points out that decisions rendered pursuant to Article 50 of the ICSID Convention57 have a special and direct effect on the interpretation of the Award for purposes of recognition and enforcement under Articles 53-55 of the ICSID Convention.58 Consequently, the jurisdiction and authority of this Tribunal must necessarily extend to the issues raised by Romania in regard to the implementation of the Award.59\n\n*See* fn. 27 above.\n\nMemorial, p. 20, para. 79.  \nThe text of Articles 53 and 54 are reproduced in fn. 21 and 47 above. Article 55 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"[n]othing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.\"\n\nMemorial, pp. 20, para. 78.\n\n**c) Practical Relevance to the Award's Implementation**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nFor Romania, disputes relating to the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award clearly satisfy the third prong of the *Wena Hotels* test for the simple reason that they have a direct impact upon how the award is to be satisfied.60 In light of the dispute between the Parties over enforcement of the Award (\"even impacting the amount to be paid under the Award\"), the present dispute does have practical relevance to the Award's implementation, and the third prong of the *Wena Hotels* test is satisfied.61 In Romania's view, if clarification of the pecuniary obligations of an Award is insufficient to demonstrate \"practical relevance to the implementation of the Award\", it is difficult to imagine what would be sufficient.62\n\nMemorial, pp. 21-24, paras. 81-90, Reply, paras. 44-46.\n\nMemorial, para. 90.\n\nReply, para. 45.\n\n**d) Abuse of Process**\n-----------------------\n\n71.\n\nFinally, Romania rejects any suggestion that its Application is abusive.\n\n72.\n\nFirst, Romania satisfied the Award directly after it was permitted to by the General Court Order. This is not the conduct of a party trying to evade paying the Award.63\n\nReply, para. 51.\n\n73.\n\nSecond, Romania is not asking the Tribunal to judge the decisions of national courts, or weigh in on any issues of national law.64 The fact that this proceeding may be relevant to certain decisions to be made in national courts is not nefarious.65\n\nReply, paras. 47-54.\n\nReply, para. 50.\n\n74.\n\nThird, this proceeding does not represent another proceeding to \"resolve the same or related dispute.\" This proceeding concerns the clarification of the pecuniary obligations of the Award and related issues, while the national litigation concerns the execution of a national judgment.66 No court has or is considering the question of whether, post-payment of the Awarded Amount, the Award has been satisfied under the ICSID Convention, or whether there are further pecuniary obligations in the Award with which Romania must comply.67\n\nReply, para. 52.\n\nReply, para. 53.\n\n75.\n\nFinally, Romania does not harass or intimidate the Claimants into withdrawing their enforcement proceedings. For Romania, the Claimants are harassing Romania, \"seeking to obtain a huge windfall.\"68\n\nReply, para. 54.\n\n**3) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAs a preliminary remark, the Tribunal notes that none of the Parties raised any objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide on Romania's Application. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal refers to and adopts the jurisdictional findings made in (i) the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 24 September 2008; and (ii) the Award.69 Accordingly, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on Romania's Application seeking the interpretation of the Award.\n\n*See* Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 24 September 2008; Award, paras. 284 \u2013 285.\n\n77.\n\nHowever, the Claimants contest the admissibility of the Application, a question to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n78.\n\nThe Parties agree that admissibility is governed by Article 50 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n79.\n\nArticle 50 of the ICSID Convention allows disputing parties to request interpretation of an award if there is a dispute between the parties as to the meaning or scope of the award:\n\n\"(1) If any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award, either party may request interpretation of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General.\n\n(2) The request shall, if possible, be submitted to the Tribunal which rendered the award. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.\"\n\n80.\n\nArticle 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules contains several requirements, which an application for the interpretation shall satisfy:\n\n\"(1) An application for the interpretation [\u2026] shall: (a) identify the award to which it relates; (b) indicate the date of the application; (c) state in detail: (i) in an application for interpretation, the precise points in dispute; [\u2026] (d) be accompanied by the payment of a fee for lodging the application.\"\n\n81.\n\nBoth Parties cite *Wena Hotels*, where the tribunal spelled out two \"main conditions\" for the admissibility of an application for interpretation and to which it added a third consideration:\n\n\"76. Taken together, the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules thus establish two main conditions for the admissibility of an application for interpretation: first, there has to be a dispute between the original parties as to the meaning or scope of the award; second, the purpose of the application must be to obtain an interpretation of the award. [\u2026]\n\n87. It is true that interpretation proceedings are particularly relevant if a dispute about the exact meaning of the award is likely to prevent its execution. However, neither Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules establish such a requirement for the admissibility of an application for interpretation, and it seems possible that there are situations where a party may have a valid interest to obtain an interpretation of an award, even though its enforcement is not (directly) concerned. However, the Tribunal agrees with the view taken by a commentator to the ICSID Convention that the dispute must at least have some practical relevance to the award's implementation; mere theoretical discussions about the award's meaning or scope are not sufficient.\"70\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, paras. 76, 87.\n\n82.\n\nThe findings of the tribunal in *Wena Hotels* were confirmed by the tribunal in *ATA Construction*:\n\n\"35. The parties agree that the requirements for an ICSID Article 50 'post-award interpretation' were concisely summarized by the Wena tribunal (cf. Wena v. Egypt, Decision on the Application for Interpretation of the Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4 (31 October 2005), paragraphs 76 and 106) as follows: (1) there must be a dispute between the parties over 'the meaning or scope' of the award; (2) the purpose of the application must be to obtain a true interpretation of the award, rather than to reopen the matter; and (3) the requested interpretation 'must have some practical relevance to the Award's implementation'.\"71\n\n*ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/2, Decision on Interpretation and on the Request for Provisional Measures, 7 March 2011, **Exh. RIL-3** (\"*ATA v. Jordan*\"), para. 35.\n\n83.\n\nTherefore, the Parties and the Tribunal agree that Romania's Application is admissible if it seeks a declaration of the meaning or scope of the Award on a subject-matter that the Parties dispute with a view to achieve a concrete result rather than to deliver a general opinion of fact and/or law. Thus, the Application should satisfy three requirements: (i) there must be a dispute between the Parties as to the meaning or scope of the Award; (ii) the purpose of the Application must be to obtain an interpretation of the Award; (iii) the dispute must have at least some practical relevance to the Award's implementation. The Tribunal will analyse each requirement in turn.\n\n84.\n\nIn addition, the Parties have raised several issues relating to steps taken by one side or the other in the aftermath of the Award's issuance, such as whether Romania engaged in abusive conduct, especially by failing to perform its obligations under the Award, and whether the Claimants abused the process by seeking compensation that exceeds what the Award granted, thus creating injustice and unfairness. The Tribunal has doubts whether it has the mandate to engage in such issues. In any event, as explained below, the Tribunal considers that it is unnecessary to do so.\n\n**a) \"Meaning or Scope\" of the Award**\n--------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIt is undisputed that interpretation is limited to the scope and meaning of an award, specifically to those points that have been decided with binding force.72 In other words, the interpretative mandate of a tribunal is limited to the findings the tribunal has made in the award. Those findings, in turn, are based on the facts presented by the parties and their respective prayers for relief. Therefore, interpretation cannot concern issues that were not analysed in the award. As observed by the *ATA Construction* tribunal, \"*Conversely, the Award cannot be said to mean something it did not say.*\"73 Interpretation may be available to clarify an award to assist the parties in the resolution of a dispute having arisen post award and including facts that the arbitrators ignored; however, the interpreting tribunal will only be empowered to establish the meaning of the award, not to add to it or amend it.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, paras. 76, 87.\n\n*ATA v. Jordan*, para. 43.\n\n86.\n\nMoreover, interpretation cannot be used for seeking either a reconsideration of the original decision or the correction of clerical errors.74 Further, it is inappropriate to use interpretation proceedings to request a new decision.75\n\n*David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v. Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/10/1, Decision on the Request for Interpretation of the Award dated 22 Oct. 2014, **Exh. CIL-11** (\"*Minnotte and Lewis v. Poland*\"), paras. 7, 12-13; *Archer Daniels Midland Co., et al v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05, Decision on Request for Interpretation of the Award dated 10 July 2008, **Exh. CIL-12** (\"*Midland v. Mexico*\"), para. 23; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Correction and Interpretation of the Award dated 13 June 2003, **Exh. CIL-13** (\"*Feldman v. Mexico*\"), paras.12-13.\n\n*Feldman v. Mexico*, paras. 9-11; *Minnotte and Lewis v. Poland*, paras. 7, 12-13.\n\n87.\n\nThe Parties disagree whether interpretation under the applicable ICSID rules will be admissible only if there is an actual ambiguity in an award and thus a need to clarify an ambiguous term or whether it will suffice that the Parties have different readings of an award. The Claimants rely on *Wena Hotels* to take an objective approach, specifically whether a third-party reader or a tribunal may have trouble in understanding the terms of the award. By contrast, Romania - relying on *Wena Hotels* and, more heavily, on *ATA Construction* - adopts a more subjective approach and considers that it will suffice if the Parties are in disagreement on the meaning of the award, even if the terms of the award are not ambiguous.\n\n88.\n\nThe *ATA Construction* tribunal appeared to suggest that a difference of interpretation between the Parties may be sufficient, whether or not the text of the award is clear.76 The *ATA Construction* tribunal engaged with one of the two requests for interpretation, although it believed that the impugned decision in the award \"is clear and means what it says.\" It appears to have done so, however, because both Parties, as opposed to just one of them, requested such a relief.77 On that basis, the *ATA Construction* tribunal proceeded to decide on that request for interpretation even though it observed that \"[t]*he Tribunal has some difficulty in seeing how its Award could be misunderstood.\"*78 Thus, *ATA Construction* does not support unambiguously the proposition that a disagreement of the parties on the meaning of an award is sufficient to trigger the need for interpretation.\n\n*ATA v. Jordan*, para. 36, specifically \"[f]irstly, there is a dispute between Jordan and ATA over 'the meaning or scope' of the Award.\"\n\n*Ibid*., para. 44.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 40.\n\n89.\n\nThe text of Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention could be interpreted as lending credence to the Respondent's position as it provides: \"if any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award, either party may request interpretation[\u2026].\" This provision seems to imply that interpretation is admissible provided the parties disagree, even if there is no lack of clarity to mend. This subjective approach to the interpretation of Article 50 of the ICSID Convention, however, could lead to an outcome where even frivolous requests for interpretation would be admissible: for example, the parties could be in dispute although an award does not suffer of any ambiguity.\n\n90.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, clarifying an ambiguity is the essence of interpretation proceedings. Indeed, according to the tribunal in *Wena Hotels*,79 a request for interpretation \"must be directed towards clarifying an ambiguity.\" The tribunal in *Wena* cited several commentators, who opine that interpretation of an award is helpful where a ruling is so ambiguous that the parties could *legitimately* disagree as to its meaning. The requirement that the parties must legitimately disagree on the meaning or scope of an award introduces an element of objectivity.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, para. 85.\n\n91.\n\nThe *Wena* tribunal referred to *Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldmann on International Commercial Arbitration*:\n\n\"85. Commentators on international arbitration also share this approach to determine the existence of a dispute as to the meaning or scope of an award. It is stated: 'The interpretation of an arbitral award is only really helpful where the ruling, which is generally presented in the form of an order, is so ambiguous that the parties could legitimately disagree as to its meaning. By contrast, any obscurity or ambiguity in the grounds for the decision does not warrant a request for interpretation of the award'.\"80\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 85, referring to Craig, Park and Paulsson, International Chamber of Commerce Arbitration (3rd ed. 2002), that referred to Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldmann, On International Commercial Arbitration (1999), p. 776\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal finds nothing surprising in this finding of the *Wena Hotels* tribunal, which is an expression and confirmation of the well-known maxim of law \"*In claris non fit interpretatio\"* or \"*In claris non est locus conjecturis*.\"\n\n93.\n\nAt the same time and as already indicated, the Tribunal notes that the tribunal in *ATA Construction* apparently proceeded with interpretation of its award in spite of its view that the terms of that award were clear (although it did so because both parties had raised the issue)*.*81 Consequently, interpretation of an award may be warranted, at least in some cases, even if its terms appear clear.\n\n*ATA v. Jordan*, paras. 39-44.\n\n94.\n\nWhile the Tribunal finds the *Wena Hotels* reasoning persuasive, the Tribunal does not need to make a choice between the two approaches. What matters for the Tribunal in this proceeding is that interpretation \u2013 whether it relates to any ambiguous term or not \u2013 is strictly limited to the scope and meaning of the Award and concerns the issues that were decided with binding force, as established earlier.82 In light of this, the Tribunal will now analyse whether the Parties have a dispute that relates to the scope or meaning of the Award and, in doing so, will address individually each of the Respondent's Prayers for Relief.\n\n*See* para. 19 above.\n\n95.\n\nThere will be some commonality in the sections below in relation to an overarching issue: interpretation cannot extend beyond the text, for which interpretation is sought. While the Respondent states that its request complies with that rule, it actually seeks pronouncements from the Tribunal on facts subsequent to the Award, mostly in connection with its enforcement, particularly in the United States.\n\n*i. Romania's Prayer for Relief (a)*\n------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (a), the Respondent asks the Tribunal to order that the \"pecuniary obligations\" of the Award, as referred to in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, require that Romania only pay to the Claimants the Awarded Amount and that there are no other pecuniary obligations under the Award. The Respondent added and clarified during the Hearing that it seeks an interpretation that the damages should be calculated only in RON and \"there is no other currency that is relevant to that question.\"83\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 58, lines 15-22.  \nMR WELDON: \"So, I thought that was worth pointing to the Tribunal in some respects that is what Romania is asking for in this case, that what was intended was that the damages be calculated in RON and paid in RON, and that was what would provide for compliance with the Award. And we note there are no other obligations, there is no other currency that's relevant to that question.\"\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot grant Romania's Prayer for Relief (a) for several reasons.\n\n98.\n\nFirst, Romania's Prayer for Relief (a) is based on specific provisions of the applicable legal framework that the Award did not consider,84 specifically Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. Article 54 relates to enforcement, a subject matter that the Tribunal did not address. Although the Award briefly mentions this article, the Tribunal did not issue any binding ruling on how Article 54 operates in relation to the findings made in the Award. The Tribunal simply noted that Article 54 \u2013 together with Article 53 - will \"apply in any event to the Award\":85\n\n\"340. The Tribunal finds that it is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered, especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters. It is thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been rendered. It will thus not address the Parties' and the Commission's arguments on enforceability of the Award.\n\n341. That being said, the Tribunal notes that Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, which are reproduced below, apply in any event to the Award: [omitted].\"\n\nThe Tribunal made that statement in the context of Romania's jurisdictional objection that EU authorities might prohibit Romania from enforcing the Award. The Tribunal refused to consider Romania's objection, explicitly declined to address the arguments on the enforceability of the Award, and found that it was \"not desirable to embark on predictions as to [\u2026] enforcement matters.\" Thus, the Tribunal did not make in the Award any binding rulings based on Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nNeither the Respondent's prayers for relief in the original arbitration (*see* paras. 282-283 of the Award) nor the Claimants' prayers for relief (*see* para. 262 of the Award) do refer to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*See* Award, paras. 340-341.\n\n99.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal considers that it cannot make any rulings based on Article 54 in this interpretation proceeding. It is of course correct that the Tribunal operates under the ICSID Convention and may have regard to all its provisions. However, in this interpretation proceeding, the Tribunal's mandate is limited to the findings made in the Award with binding force, *i.e.*, its \"Chapter XI, Decision.\" As the Tribunal did not make any binding pronouncements based on Article 54 in the Award, it cannot do so in this interpretation proceeding either. Proceeding otherwise would result in going beyond what was decided in the Award, *i.e.*, beyond its scope, which is not the purpose of interpretation proceedings.\n\n100.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal considers that Paragraph 1329 of the Award,86 which is the focus of Romania's Request for Relief (a), is clear. The Parties have not shown, and have not even sought to allege, that the wording of that paragraph of the Award is unclear,87 and rightly so. In fact, in its Prayer for Relief (a) Romania restates the finding of the Tribunal made in Paragraph 1329 of the Award, adding however the word \"only.\"88 In the Tribunal's view, such change would possibly create ambiguity where there is none and may lead to two possible results, none of which is warranted in this interpretation proceeding:\n\na. On the one hand, adding \"only\" to the Tribunal's findings may result in a tautology, which would not assist either in the interpretation of the Award or in establishing the true meaning of its terms. In this context, Romania argues that by adding \"only\" it seeks the confirmation of the findings made in the Award.89 The Tribunal finds the Respondent's statement calling for a \"confirmation\" difficult to reconcile with the notion of interpretation: in reality, Romania does not seek a restatement of what the Tribunal stated in the Award. Rather, by referring to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, as described above,90 Romania is asking that the Tribunal interpret the ICSID Convention rather than the Award, whose findings are abundantly clear and do not need a \"confirmation.\"\n\nb. On the other hand, if introducing the word \"only\" had any substantive meaning, *i.e.*, if it added to or explained the text of the Award, then doing so would result in correcting the findings of the Award. However, this correction is not a relief that the Parties are seeking in this proceeding and rightly so. Any request for correction of the Award would be time-barred: the time limit to seek correction \u2013 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered \u2013 has long expired.91\n\nSee para. 36 above.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal takes note that none of the enforcement courts ever had any issues with enforcing the Award during the past seven years, which is an additional reassurance that the Award, and the findings of the Tribunal as reflected in the Award, are clear.\n\nSuch change appears for the first time in the Respondent's Prayer for Relief in the Memorial (not in the Application), which is then confirmed in the Reply.\n\nReply, para. 43.\n\nSee paras. 98-99 above.\n\n*See* Article 49 of the ICSID Convention, which states that \"[t]he Secretary-General shall promptly dispatch certified copies of the award to the parties. The award shall be deemed to have been rendered on the date on which the certified copies were dispatched. (2) The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\"\n\n101.\n\nThus, adding \"only\" to Paragraph 1329 of the Award as requested by Romania is neither possible nor appropriate in this proceeding.\n\n102.\n\nFinally, as follows from the Respondent's written92 and oral93 submissions, Romania's Prayer for Relief (a) in effect seeks to impugn the currency used in the enforcement proceedings in the United States (the US dollar). There is no issue whether the ICSID framework allows for the filing of an application for interpretation of an award at any time. However, as a matter of experience and pure logic, as more time passes after the issuance of the award, the more difficult it becomes for the party seeking interpretation to establish its concrete need for the interpretation sought, i.e. its interest. A request for general interpretation of the award - without any concretely applicable consequences -would become more and more difficult to admit with the passage of time; presumably, any application for general interpretation of the award would have been filed earlier. In other words, if a party seeks interpretation of an award *in abstracto*, without any concrete interest, a long time after the issuance of the award, the real reasons behind such conduct are required to be clear. In the present case, what has essentially been nine years after the Award was issued is a long period. The Respondent does not show any concrete and actual legal interest in clarifying the Tribunal's findings in the Award other than in connection with the US proceedings. However, the Tribunal never considered the issue of the RON's conversion into another currency for enforcement purposes: that issue was not addressed in the Award and arose subsequently during the enforcement proceedings in the US courts. Indeed, the Award made its reasoning and calculations in RON and, thus, retained the currency, in which the Parties denominated their prayers for relief.94 However, the Award does not contain any restrictions on the currency used to discharge the obligations arising from the Award, *e.g.,* in connection with the enforcement of the Award, as none of the Parties ever raised this issue during the original arbitration. Thus, the Award could not and did not consider what the Parties and the enforcing courts would do to enforce the Award, whether in relation to the currency of the payment to discharge the Award's obligations or otherwise.\n\nMemorial, p. 49.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Transcript, p. 24, lines 4-9.  \nMR. WELDON: \"Is the Award Amount pegged to the U.S. dollar or some other currency as to value? That's another question which the Parties appear to dispute. Did the Tribunal intend to peg this amount 8 to U.S. dollar, Great British [sic] pounds, to yen, to any other currency?\"  \n*See* also Transcript, p. 28, lines 4-9.  \nMR. WELDON: Specifically, it is about whether an award expressly 5 denominated in a particular currency can be satisfied 6 in that currency, even if the Rate of Exchange between 7 it and other currencies has changed, and also whether 8 the award-debtor can satisfy the Award if it pays the 9 full amount ordained in that Award.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that at some point the Parties quantified some claims in euros, but, in the end, asked the Tribunal to adjudicate the claims in RON (*see* fn. 165 of the Award).\n\n103.\n\nIn sum, in the original arbitration the Tribunal did not venture outside of its remit; in particular, the Tribunal did not consider whether enforcement would allow or even require the conversion of the awarded RON claim into a different currency, let alone at what date such conversion should be performed or what would be the rate of interest on the amount in a different currency (other than RON).95 The Tribunal notes that, in the US enforcement proceedings and as extensively discussed by the Parties in their submissions, the US court converted the Awarded Amount from RON to USD as of the date of the Award. Whether such decision is correct or not under US law is not for this Tribunal to determine. Making any determination on those issues would result in this Tribunal's interference96 with the enforcement proceeding, in this case, the enforcement proceedings in the US and, in particular, in relation to currency conversion and its consequences, *i.e.*, matters that the Tribunal never considered. In any event, any dispute concerning the enforcement of an award and the scope of the enforcement activity of a court in a Contracting State (in this case, the US courts) is beyond an ICSID tribunal's competence. Thus, as a matter of law, the interpretation that the Respondent is seeking is in fact an interpretation of the ICSID Convention rather than of the Award.97\n\nLikewise, neither did the Tribunal consider other matters that might arise after the rendition of the Award, like whether payment could be made by set-off or into an escrow account and under what conditions, just to take two examples that did materialize since 2013.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Romania's argument that the Tribunal's decision on the Application may be relevant to the enforcement proceedings in the US, as it forms part of the Award pursuant to Article 53(2) of the ICSID Convention. However, this argument is as uncontroverted as unavailing. The difficulty would possibly not have arisen if the request for interpretation had addressed a genuine ambiguity that would have been apparent; to put it mildly, that ambiguity does not exist and made its way in the aftermath of the impugned US enforcement proceeding.\n\n*See* para. 96 ff above.\n\n104.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal considers that Romania's Prayer for Relief (a) does not concern the scope or meaning of the Award and goes beyond the findings made in the Award. Consequently, it is inadmissible.\n\n*ii. Romania's Prayer for Relief (b)*\n-------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (b), Romania asks the Tribunal to interpret whether in order to \"abide by and comply with the terms of the Award\" as required by Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, Romania is only required to pay the Awarded Amount to the Claimants (and the Claimants are entitled to nothing more).\n\n106.\n\nFor the Tribunal, Prayer for Relief (b) is similar to Romania's Prayer for Relief (a) and is inadmissible for the same reasons. Like Romania's Prayer for Relief (a), Prayer for Relief (b) is based on Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, which the Award did not address.98 As mentioned earlier, the Award does not contain any binding rulings based on Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention. Consequently, any interpretation based on those Articles of the ICSID Convention in this proceeding would go beyond what was decided in the Award.99 Moreover, as discussed above, the matter in dispute between the Parties appears to be the decision of the US courts to convert the Awarded Amount from RON to USD as of the date of the Award, or related issues arising in the aftermath of the Award in the context of the US enforcement proceedings. The Tribunal reiterates that it is not within its mandate, and outside the scope of an interpretation proceeding, to opine on whether the decisions of US courts and their consequences are correct.100\n\nSee fn. 47 above.\n\nSee Award, paras. 340-341.\n\nSee para. 101 above.\n\n107.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent's Prayer for Relief (b) does not relate to the scope or meaning of the Award and is thus inadmissible.\n\n*iii. Romania's Prayer for Relief (c)*\n--------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nIn Prayer for Relief (c), Romania asks the Tribunal to interpret whether Romania's payments of the Awarded Amount to the Claimants operate to satisfy the terms of Award and discharge the pecuniary obligations under the Award, and thus the Claimants have no other remedy under the Award.\n\n109.\n\nThis Prayer for Relief is equally inadmissible for several reasons.\n\n110.\n\nFirst, it relates to facts that occurred after the Award was rendered. In essence, Romania asks the Tribunal to consider the effects of Romania's payments allegedly made to the Claimants after 2013. These facts, unknown at the time, are not discussed in the Award and, consequently, cannot be subject to the Tribunal's interpretation. Moreover, the Tribunal is not a court overseeing the enforcement proceedings carried out in the national courts of the Contracting States.\n\n111.\n\nSecond, the Respondent's request relates to issues that were not decided with binding force in the Award. The request is based on events that took place after the Award was rendered, *i.e*., the Respondent's alleged payments pursuant to the Award and its compliance with the Award.101 By definition, those events could not have been addressed in the Award.\n\nThe Respondent admitted during the Hearing that the issue at stake is the compliance with the Award, even though the Respondent's position was contradictory.  \nSee Transcript, p. 181, lines 1-2.  \nMR. WELDON: \"But it's a question of, well, upon payment of that calculation, is that compliance with the Award?\"  \nSee Transcript, p. 178, lines 13-20.  \nARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV: \"Is the question of whether Respondent has satisfied the Award a question that is before us now?\"  \nMR. WELDON: \"No. I think the question before you is what is required under the Award for satisfaction, what does compliance mean.\"\n\n112.\n\nConsequently, Romania's Prayer for Relief (c) is inadmissible, as it is based on facts and raises legal questions that were never considered \u2013 let alone decided with binding force \u2013 in the Award.\n\n*iv. Romania's Prayer for Relief (d)*\n-------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to interpret whether the Claimants' continued enforcement of the Award after Romania's alleged payment of the Awarded Amount to the Claimant amounts to a failure by the Claimants to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award.\n\n114.\n\nThis request is equally inadmissible for the reasons stated earlier. First, it is based on facts that occurred after the Award was rendered. Second, it raises a legal issue, and even a new claim, (*i.e*., whether the Respondent complied with the terms of the Award and paid the Award), that was never raised during the original arbitration. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot interpret issues that are outside the scope of the Award.\n\n**b) Purpose to Obtain a True Interpretation**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe failure to satisfy the first requirement of the applicable test (*i.e*., the existence of a dispute as to the *meaning or scope* of the award) is enough to dismiss the Respondent's Application. However, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will analyse the second prong of the applicable test, *i.e*.*,* whether the purpose of Romania's Application is to obtain a true interpretation of the Award.\n\n116.\n\nBased on the prayers for relief put forward by the Respondent, the Tribunal is doubtful that Romania is seeking a genuine interpretation of the Award. As analysed above, none of Romania's prayers for relief concern the scope or meaning of the Award. Rather, they either raise new legal and factual issues that were never discussed, let alone resolved, in the original arbitration or may cause ambiguity to arise where there is none (as with adding the word \"only\"). This leads the Tribunal to conclude that Romania wishes to tackle issues associated with the enforcement of the Award, rather than the terms of the Award itself.102 Moreover, the record of this proceeding does not show that either the Respondent prior to filing its Application in 2022, or the Claimants, or any of the enforcement courts \u2013 whether in Romania, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Luxembourg or the United States \u2013 during the seven years of the enforcement proceedings have ever expressed any difficulty in understanding the scope and meaning of the Award. Interpretation is a proceeding to ascertain the meaning and scope of a text, here the Award, and nothing more. As instruments establishing methods of interpretation of legal instruments, such as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, show, interpretation will first and foremost look at the text itself. This is not what Romania is asking the Tribunal to do.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Respondent is looking for \"a central authority\" that would \"clarify\" enforcement issues. See Transcript, pp.175-176, lines 3-22, 1-3.  \nMR. WELDON: \"[\u2026] if you're going to project that upon the Award itself under the ICSID Convention, that can't be right because, like I said, well, then, what country do we go to find clarity? Is it the Romanian court system? Is it the U.S. court system? Is it the English court system? Or the Swedish court system? Which one is going to tell us that the Award has, in fact, been satisfied, or is it just the highest number so we just have to keep paying until the highest number is paid? It can't be the latter. They could go file a case in Australia today. So, on what basis would they be able to file it under the Award? The outstanding amount is--there's an outstanding amount on the Judgment in the U.S., but how could they go to Australia and say the Award hasn't been satisfied, please recognize this and enforce it under Article 54. That's a big--that's a big issue. There has to be some sort of central role for you to say oh, no, this is what is required under the Award, otherwise we wouldn't--you could just put his--register this in every country and as long as local law would let you, just keep collecting. And that can't be the intention of--behind this Treaty.\"\n\n117.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal reiterates its conclusion made above that the Respondent's Application is inadmissible.\n\n118.\n\nThus, for the sake of procedural economy and mindful of its decision on costs below, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to analyse whether the Respondent's Application constitutes an abuse of process. The two arbitrators of the Majority (\"the Majority\") have studied the Separate Opinion that their esteemed Colleague, the third Arbitrator (\"the Minority\") prepared. The Majority has no comments on the Separate Opinion. The Majority considers the reasoning in the Decision to be sufficient to reject the Request for Interpretation. The Minority arbitrator would rather reject it on a different ground, i.e., for being untimely. Thus, the three arbitrators unanimously agree that the Application should be rejected although they do so for different reasons. The Tribunal has thus not considered it necessary to address in its Decision Claimants' additional argument that the Request for Interpretation constitutes an abuse of process. Had it done so, the Tribunal, either unanimously or by majority, would have considered whether Respondent's untimely filing of its Application constitutes an abuse of process, which would appear in the circumstances to be an additional ground for rejecting the Application.\n\n**VII. Costs**\n--------------\n\n**1) The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal order Romania to bear all costs incurred by the Claimants in connection with Romania's Application, including the fees of the Claimants' counsel, translation costs, travel expenses, and other costs associated with the Hearing. The Claimants also request that Romania bear all costs of this interpretation proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and ICSID, and the charges for the use of the facilities at the Centre.103\n\nC-Costs, para. 2.\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that their costs are reasonable.104 Moreover, they attempted in good faith to reduce the costs of this proceeding as much as possible.105 Specifically, they maintained since the outset of the proceedings that only one round of written submissions was necessary. Moreover, as regards the Hearing, they advocated that no Hearing was necessary and, in any event, it should be limited to one presentation per Party which should last only 90 minutes.106 Romania's demands forced the Claimants to more than double their fees by preparing additional submissions and participating in a Hearing.107\n\nC-Costs, paras. 10-12.\n\nC-Costs, para. 8.\n\nC-Costs, para. 8.\n\nC-Costs, para. 9.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants' legal fees and costs incurred in the proceeding as of 31 May 2023 are set forth below:108\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Claimants' Costs Through The Counter-Memorial Submission** | **Claimants' Costs After The Counter-Memorial Submission** |\n|  | **Fees** | **Expenses** | **Fees** | **Expenses** |\n| FA Vasquez Consulting | \u20ac 52,571.50 | \u20ac 0 | \u20ac 37,739.50 | \u20ac 0 |\n| Three Crowns | \u20ac 43,00028 | \u20ac 0 | \u20ac 57,000 | \u20ac 0 |\n| While & Case | $ 325,052.45 | $ 571.56 | $ 420,681.10 | $ 9,056.38 |\n| **TOTAL USS** | $ 325,052.45 | $ 571.56 | $ 420,681.10 | $ 9,056.38 |\n| **TOTAL EUR** | \u20ac 95,571.50 | \u20ac 0 | \u20ac 94.739.50 | \u20ac 0 |\n\nC-Costs, para. 12.\n\n122.\n\nThus, the Claimants request the following relief:109\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons, Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n\u2022 Order Romania to pay all costs and legal fees incurred by Claimants in relation to the proceeding; and\n\n\u2022 Order Romania to bear all costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and ICSID, and the charges for the use of the facilities at the Centre.\"\n\nC-Costs, para. 13.\n\n**2) The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent has incurred the following costs in connection with this arbitration:110\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Description** | **Amount (USD)** | **Amount (GBP)** |\n| ICSID / Tribunal Fees and Expenses | 310,000 |  |\n| Counsel Fees and Expenses | 310,400 |  |\n| Expert Fees |  | 55,500 |\n| **TOTAL** | **620,400** | **55,500** |\n\nR-Costs, para. 6.\n\n124.\n\nMoreover, in mid-July \u2013 early August 2023, the Respondent paid further advance on costs in the amount of USD 200 000, on behalf of both Parties. Thus, the Respondent's overall payment of the advance on costs amounts to USD 510,000.111\n\nR-Costs, para. 8.\n\n125.\n\nThe following is a summary of the counsel fees incurred by Romania in connection with these proceedings, namely the fees for attorneys Ms. Ioana Salajanu and Mr. Matthew Weldon:112\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Invoice No.** | **Amount (USD)** |\n| 20 | 23,760 |\n| 22 | 8,400 |\n| 23 | 1,880 |\n| 26 | 11,060 |\n| 27 | 57,980 |\n| 28 | 93,440 |\n| 30 | 66,160 |\n| 32 | 47,720 |\n| **TOTAL** | **310,400** |\n\nR-Costs, para. 9.\n\n126.\n\nThe following is a summary of the expert fees incurred by Romania in connection with these proceedings, namely the fees of Prof. Maurice Mendelson, KC:113\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Invoice No.** | **Amount (GBP)** |\n| 160081 | 22,500 |\n| 161412 | 30,000 |\n| **TOTAL** | **52,500** |\n\nR-Costs, para. 10.\n\n127.\n\nFor Romania, its costs are indisputably reasonable.114 Romania submits that it should be awarded all of its costs, regardless of the outcome of this interpretation proceeding because this dispute arises due to the Claimants' \"opportunistic, unjust, and improper efforts to collect an additional $100 million in excess of what the Tribunal ordered Romania to pay Claimants in the Award.\"115\n\nR-Costs, paras. 28-31.\n\nR-Costs, paras. 15-20.\n\n128.\n\nThus Romania respectfully requests that \"the Tribunal award it all of its costs, comprised of USD 620,400 and GBP 52,500, together with interest at the rate of LIBOR +2% as from the date of the Award until payment.\"116\n\nR-Costs, para. 37.\n\n**3) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nIt is well established that ICSID tribunals have \"broad discretion to decide on the allocation of costs,\" including with respect to \"post-Award applications\" such as Romania's Application.117\n\n*Bosh International, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/11, Award dated 25 Oct. 2012, **Exh. CIL-53**, para. 288; *Midland v. Mexico*, para. 65; *Minnotte and Lewis v. Poland*, paras. 14-17.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal discussed the principles of costs allocation in the Award:118\n\n\"1326. The Parties agree that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including legal fees and expenses, between the Parties as it deems appropriate, pursuant to Article 61 of the ICSID Convention. Both sides argue that a costs award is warranted because they should prevail in the arbitration and because the other party has conducted the arbitration in a manner which has led to delay and increased costs.\n\n1327. The Tribunal has considered all the circumstances of this case: the procedure (including the jurisdictional phase, the Parties' requests for production of documents, the Claimants' requests for provisional measures, the Respondent's request for revocation of provisional measures, the Claimants' request for a site visit, the merits phase of the proceeding, the Claimants' revised request for relief, and multiple hearings) as well as the Parties' substantive arguments on jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits. As evidenced by Section II above, there were numerous procedural issues and difficult legal questions involved in the jurisdictional and merits phases. Many of these issues were far from clear-cut and involved meritorious arguments by both Parties. The Claimants have prevailed on jurisdiction and have established a breach of the fair and equitable standard under the BIT. They have, however, only been partially successful in regard to their claims for damages, which evolved during the proceedings.\n\n1328. In light of these factors, the Tribunal has concluded that it is fair overall that both sides (that is, the five Claimants on one side and the Respondent on the other) bear the costs of the arbitration (the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre) in equal shares, and that each side bears its own legal and other costs incurred in connection with this case.\"\n\nSee paras. 1326-1328 of the Award.\n\n131.\n\nBoth the Claimants and the Respondent seek an award of the entirety of the costs related to this interpretation proceeding, including the legal fees and the costs of the arbitration (the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre). Those amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy | 134,596.94 |\n| Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov | 60,700.00 |\n| Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC | 78,868.90 |\n| Ksenia Panerai 's fees and expenses | 62,737.17 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 84,000 |\n| Direct expenses | 9,555.16 |\n| **Total** | **430,458.17** |\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Respondent.119\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to Romania.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants' legal and other costs exceed the Respondent's by about 20% and there is no excessive disproportion, especially as there is only one Respondent while there are five Claimants, who have retained two different teams of lawyers.\n\n133.\n\nAs described above, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent's Application is inadmissible. In these circumstances, mindful of its wide discretion afforded in cost allocation and with due regard to the Parties' relative success and failure in submitting their claims and defenses, the Tribunal considers that the cost allocation most appropriately reflecting the outcome of the proceedings is for the Respondent to bear the entirety of the interpretation proceeding's costs and the entirety of the Parties' costs. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants' costs in the amount of **USD 755,361.49 plus EUR 190,311**120 are reasonable given the length of submissions, the nature of the dispute and the complexity of the issues involved. Moreover, the Respondent did not raise any objections to the reasonableness of the Claimants' costs. For the sake of avoiding any doubt, the Tribunal has noted the Respondent's argument that the Claimants should bear all costs regardless of the outcome of this interpretation proceeding because this dispute arises due to the Claimants' \"opportunistic, unjust, and improper efforts to collect an additional $100 million in excess of what the Tribunal ordered Romania to pay Claimants in the Award.\" In the view of the Tribunal, first, the record is definitely insufficient to establish that assertion and, second, even if it were so, seeking interpretation would not have been the appropriate remedy and has in fact resulted in a squandering of funds.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the following calculations based on the table presented in the Claimants' Costs Submission: 1) **TOTAL USD**: USD 325,052.45 (fees through the Counter-Memorial Submission) + USD 571.56 (expenses through the Counter-Memorial Submission) + USD 420,681.10 (fees after the Counter-Memorial Submission) + USD 9,056.38 (expenses after the Counter-Memorial Submission) = USD 755,361.49; and 2) **TOTAL EUR**: EUR 95,571.50 (fees through the Counter-Memorial Submission) + EUR 94,739.50 (fees after the Counter-Memorial Submission) = EUR 190,311.\n\n134.\n\nWhile making this decision, the Tribunal is mindful that the Claimants' Request for Security for Costs was dismissed. At the same time, the Tribunal appreciates the Claimants' attempts to reduce the costs of this proceeding as much as possible and, in light of that, will not alter the cost allocation described above.121\n\nSee para. 133 above.\n\n**VIII. Decision**\n------------------\n\n135.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal renders the following decisions:\n\na. The claims made in the Respondent's Application for Interpretation are inadmissible;\n\nb. The Respondent shall bear all costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and ICSID, and the charges for the use of the facilities at the Centre;\n\nc. The Respondent shall pay USD 755,361.49 plus EUR 190,311 to the Claimants, as a contribution to the legal fees and other expenses, which the Claimants incurred in connection with this proceeding;\n\nd. All other requests for relief are dismissed.\n\nDate: 7 December 2023"}]}
