Kohen\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nUnfortunately, the Tribunal was unable to reach unanimity with regard to the request for bifurcation submitted by the Respondent. Unanimously, however, the Tribunal found that:\n\n\"the Respondent\u2019s objections do not appear frivolous. The *ratione personae* objection against Sembi for instance will require the Tribunal to examine the meaning of Article 1(3)(b) of the Serbia-Cyprus BIT and determine whether Sembi lacks a seat in Cyprus because it is *'effectively managed'* from Canada. Similarly, the *ratione temporis* objection under the Canada-Serbia BIT would involve an analysis of the relevant Treaty provisions, as well as a review of the record to determine when the three-year limitation period started running. Other objections also raise genuine questions of treaty interpretation among others. As a consequence, the Respondent\u2019s objections must be deemed serious, and success on a combination of several objections could result in the denial of jurisdiction over the entire case.\"1\n\nThis Order, paragraph 17.\n\n2.\n\nNevertheless, the majority decided to treat the Respondent\u2019s objections together with the merits of the case. The main reason proposed for this decision has been a matter of efficiency. I feel compelled to state my dissent in that regard.\n\n3.\n\nThis dissenting opinion will be divided in two parts. The first part will address general considerations about preliminary objections in international adjudication. This is necessary in order to understand my approach to the specific decision on bifurcation in the instant case, which will be examined in the second part.\n\n**I. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS: BETWEEN BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION AND \"EFFICIENCY\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nI start with some general comments on preliminary objections before international courts and tribunals. The most important one is that objections to jurisdiction are related to the very existence of the judge or arbitrator\u2019s capacity to deal with a case: consent. Consent is not only necessary to decide the merits, but also to merely discuss them.2 There must be serious reasons to impose upon a party asserting its lack of consent to a given case, the obligation to discuss nonetheless the merits of that case without having previously decided on jurisdiction. The best practice in this regard is that of the International Court of Justice (the \"**ICJ**\"). If the jurisdictional and/or inadmissibility objections can be dealt with preliminarily, this should be the rule. If such objections are inextricably linked to the merits, in a manner that they cannot be examined without examining the merits at the same time, then there is no bifurcation. In those instances, the parties will plead the entire case and the court or tribunal will issue a decision at the end of the proceedings, but first ruling on the question of its jurisdiction and/or of the admissibility of the claims.\n\nAs the International Court of Justice (the \"ICJ\") stated: \"Nor should it be overlooked that for the party raising a jurisdictional objection, its significance will also lie in the possibility it may offer of avoiding, not only a decision, but even a hearing, on the merits, -a factor which is of prime importance in many cases. An essential point of legal principle is involved here, namely that a party should not have to give an account of itself on issues of merits before a tribunal which lacks jurisdiction in the matter, or whose jurisdiction has not yet been established.\" *Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council (India v. Pakistan), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1972,* p. 56, paragraph 18 (b).\n\n5.\n\nI am aware, as the Order indicates, that Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Article 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules have not explicitly established any kind of presumption in favour of or against bifurcation. However, if Article 41 of both instruments are read as a whole, their procedural priority character is apparent. These objections must be raised as early as possible, although the tribunal has the capacity to decide on its own jurisdiction at any stage of the proceeding. It is for the tribunal to decide whether an oral phase is needed to deal with preliminary objections and whether the procedure on the merits needs to be suspended or not. The tribunal fixes new time limits if the objections are considered not to have a preliminary character or if they are overruled (contrary to the current established practice of fixing two possible avenues -one with bifurcation and the other without - from the very beginning of the proceeding). Whereas the prior ICSID Arbitration Rules established the suspension of the proceeding on the merits as the applicable rule in case of preliminary objections, the current Rules leave it to the decision of the Tribunal.3\n\nCompare the text of Article 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules of 1968 with the current version of the Rules.\n\n6.\n\nIndeed, it is the very rationale of *Preliminary* Objections (this is the title of Article 41 of the Arbitration Rules) that requires treating them preliminarily, if possible. I will quote the following statement of the ICJ, which in my view summarises the best practice in this matter, and which by no means is an extreme position of always deciding in favour of bifurcation:\n\n\"In principle, a party raising preliminary objections is entitled to have these objections answered at the preliminary stage of the proceedings unless the Court does not have before it all facts necessary to decide the questions raised or if answering the preliminary objection would determine the dispute, or some elements thereof, on the merits.\"4\n\n*Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007,* p. 852, paragraph 51.\n\n7.\n\nEfficiency (I would prefer to use the expression *\"procedural economy\")* is not merely a question of cost and time. It is not an absolute criterion either. Alleged \"efficiency gains\" cannot be imposed, and even less assumed -as is necessarily the case here-, against basic elements of a sound administration of justice. The discussion here is essentially an issue of jurisdiction: the general rule is that it cannot be required from a party to discuss the merits of an issue for which it has not given its consent.5 Procedural economy dictates that a court or tribunal deciding on preliminary objections first must do so *at the earliest opportunity.* Forcing the parties to argue and present their arguments on the merits (and even worse, also on quantum) to then reach the conclusion that the court or tribunal cannot decide on the merits is the very opposite of procedural economy. I do not consider here the argument of the potential psychological impact of having studied the entire merits of the case on a decision regarding jurisdiction.\n\nAs explained by Georges Abi-Saab: \"the fundamental principle and basic rule in international adjudication, is that of the consensual basis of jurisdiction. It also explains the prominent place of questions of jurisdiction both in the jurisprudence and in the writings on international adjudication. It explains as well the widely shared perception that the first task of an international tribunal is to ascertain its jurisdiction; and the great care international tribunals take in establishing from the outset, the existence and limits of the consent of the parties before them, on which their jurisdiction is founded.\" *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Dissenting Opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab, paragraph 8 - iii).\n\n8.\n\nAs for the cost and the time elements of efficiency with regard to preliminary objections, an elementary idea must be taken into account: until it is not known whether the objections are accepted or not, it cannot be determined whether the bifurcation will have saved time and costs. It is obvious that if the objections are upheld and the case stops at that phase, there will be absolute \"efficiency\" in terms of time and costs. If they are rejected or considered that they do not possess a preliminary character, then the proceeding will be, at different possible degrees, more time and cost consuming. This risk is always present in the scenario of a challenge to jurisdiction, all the more so (but not exclusively) at the international level. The question for a tribunal is whether it is better to risk imposing upon a party the burden of discussing the merits without having jurisdiction to deal with the case or to decide on jurisdiction first, with the possibility of rejecting objections that would in turn lead to a longer proceeding. It is my perception that probable efficiency cannot be pursued at the cost of sacrificing a basic principle of international adjudication.\n\n9.\n\nThe decision taken in this Order not to bifurcate considered as \"good practice to deal with jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase to avoid imposing full-fledged proceedings on a party who disputes having consented to arbitration.\"6 However, the Order explains the general criteria adopted by the majority in the following manner: \"if the bifurcation is unlikely to produce efficiency gains, a tribunal should be disinclined to bifurcate.\"7\n\nThis Order, paragraph 15.\n\nThis Order, paragraph 15.\n\n10.\n\nLimiting the scope of the case can be a legitimate purpose of preliminary objections. To consider that \"efficiency\" is not met if the objections do not lead to the disposal of the case is tantamount to accepting that a claimant benefitting from a jurisdictional link can require the respondent to discuss the merits of any matter, even beyond the scope of the jurisdiction, because at any rate the case will reach the merits phase. The same is true if the objections aim at disregarding some claimants but not all of them. Otherwise, a claimant having the capacity to validly invoke jurisdiction may attract any other person or corporation as a claimant even though there is no basis for jurisdiction, and impose on the respondent the burden of addressing the merits in their regard. Not only would the basic principle of consent to jurisdiction be breached in these circumstances, but also that of the equality of the parties.\n\n**II. THE CONDITIONS NOT TO BIFURCATE ARE NOT MET IN THIS CASE**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nI do not consider as irrelevant for the decision the fact that only one of the two BITs invoked by the Claimants could be set aside if some preliminary objections were to be upheld. Whether the factual background would essentially be the same if one or both BITs were applicable is not decisive either.8 It was the Claimants\u2019 choice to submit claims based on two different BITs in a single case. A party to a treaty that considers that such treaty does not provide grounds for jurisdiction has the right to see that issue settled without the need to discuss the merits at the same time. Having chosen to invoke two different BITs in the case, the Claimants must face the risk of having to discuss the applicability of one of them first. This is all the more relevant in the current case, in which both BITs do not coincide in different aspects. This situation has already required the Parties and the Tribunal to spend time (and consequently, costs) on how to deal with the potentially conflicting provisions between the BITs.9\n\nThis Order, paragraph 18(a)(ii).\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n12.\n\nThe conditions for accepting the preliminary character of the objections are in my view met here: they are of a substantial nature and not frivolous, as the Tribunal unanimously found. It appears that they can be examined before the merits, and if they were accepted, they would end the proceeding or they would limit the scope of the merits of the case.\n\n13.\n\nAn important element to scrutinise in order to decide on bifurcation is the question of whether the objections can be examined without prejudging the merits of the case. The crucial point here is indeed whether the objections can be separated and decided before touching the core of the merits. The Order mentions that \"[t]he Respondent itself has merely submitted that 'the issues of jurisdiction raised in the present submission can be resolved without assessing the merits of the dispute' without any further explanation. It has failed to show that its objections would involve reviewing a narrow set of facts that could be dealt with separately.\"10 It is for the Tribunal to determine, on the basis of the elements present in the case file, whether deciding bifurcation would imply deciding the merits at the preliminary objections phase. If this were the case, then the objections would be inextricably linked to the merits and would not have a preliminary character. As submitted by the Claimants, the subject-matter in this case is the alleged expropriation, alleged breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, alleged impairment of Sembi's investment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures, and the disregard of the so-called \"umbrella clause.\"11 Consequently, deciding the objections at a preliminary stage would not imply taking a stance on the alleged expropriation or on the other claims.\n\nThis Order, paragraph 18(b).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration, Section V; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Section VI.\n\n14.\n\nThe argument related to the age of Mr. Rand is of course of no impact.12 Whether objections possess a preliminary character cannot be decided on the basis of a claimant\u2019s age. If Mr. Rand\u2019s witness statement is crucial for the merits and quantum phases, there are means to solve this alleged problem.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply to the Request for Bifurcation, paragraph 6.\n\n15.\n\nThe majority went on to examine alleged practical negative consequences of bifurcation, such as the need to call some witnesses twice.13 My question is: can a party claiming that a tribunal lacks jurisdiction be compelled to plead the merits of the case before the tribunal decides if it has such jurisdiction just because there is a possibility that some witnesses could be called twice if the objections are rejected?\n\nThis Order, paragraph 18(c).\n\n16.\n\nThe majority affirms that \"if the proceedings are bifurcated and continue on the merits, they will last significantly longer and experience shows that longer proceedings also cost more. It is true that the costs of litigating the merits may be expended for no purpose if in a nonbifurcated proceedings jurisdiction were eventually denied. That consequence could, however, be remedied when allocating the burden of the costs of the proceedings.\"14 However, the opposite is also true: if there is bifurcation and the preliminary objections are rejected, this can also be remedied when allocating the burden of the costs of the proceedings.\n\nThis Order, paragraph 18(d).\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants have accepted that the objection to jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Sembi and the objection to jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* over Mr. Rand\u2019s claim relating to his shareholding in BD Agro held through MDH Serbia can be separated from the merits.15 For Claimants, all the other objections are intertwined with the merits. In any case, assuming that there is a link between the objections and the merits is not enough to disregard the preliminary character of the objections. As the Permanent Court of International Justice stated: \"The determination by the Court of its jurisdiction may touch upon certain aspects of the merits of the case.\"16 Indeed, the opposite situation would be extraordinary. What is crucial is whether deciding the preliminary objections would be tantamount to deciding on the subject-matter of the case. As discussed, above, it seems to me that this would not the case here.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply to Request for Bifurcation, paragraph 9.\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland), Jurisdiction, Judgment No. 6, 1925, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6,* p. 15.\n\n18.\n\nClaimants have also accepted that the scope of the case could be reduced if some objections were upheld. However, for the Claimants, this reduction of scope would not be \"significant.\"17 The majority endorsed this view. As explained above, I strongly disagree with the idea that in order to accept bifurcation, the objections must exclusively lead to the end of the proceeding or reduce it \"significantly.\" As mentioned above, an objection to jurisdiction can rightly have the purpose of limiting the scope of the case. Whether this limitation is \"substantial\" or not is not a decisive factor to treat the objections in a preliminary manner or together with the merits of the case. Nevertheless, I'm not convinced that the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent would not be able to reduce the scope of this case \"significantly.\"\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply to Request for Bifurcation, paragraph 35.\n\n19.\n\nIndeed, efficiency plays in favour of accepting bifurcation. If the objections were to be rejected, then the merits of the case would be circumscribed to the alleged expropriation and the other alleged breaches, and if necessary, to quantum. There would be no need to repeat the factual and legal ascertainments made at the jurisdictional phase. If the case continues to the merits, the parties and the tribunal would already have made significant progress in their respective work and the factual and legal assessments necessary for the merits analysis would substantially be reduced. There is no need to come back to issues already decided upon. Time for preparation of written pleadings and for hearing the case would necessarily be reduced. The Tribunal has the capacity, in view of the outcome of the preliminary objections phase, to modify the procedural calendar and shorten it if necessary. This way of proceeding would not only be more efficient, without any extravagant increase of cost and time, but would also be the most orderly manner to address the issues at stake. Additionally, if the case were to continue to the merits but only one BIT was applicable, this would also solve the problem for the Tribunal arising from the difference of treatment of some issues in both BITs, such as transparency.\n\n20.\n\nIt is for all these reasons, and as a matter of principle, that I felt obliged not to add my vote to those of my colleagues."}], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn accordance with the Revised Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 of 19 December 2018 (the \"**Procedural Calendar**\"):\n\na. On 19 April 2019, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial with Request for Bifurcation in which it requested bifurcation (the \"**Request**\" and the \"**Counter-Memorial**\"); and\n\nb. On 17 May 2019, the Claimants filed their Reply to Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 23 April 2019, the Tribunal and the Parties were advised that Ms. Anna Toubiana, ICSID Legal Counsel, would be replacing Ms. Planells-Valero as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nOn 31 May 2019, the ICSID Secretariat advised the Parties that, by majority, the Tribunal had decided to deny the Request. The Parties were directed to follow the non-bifurcated scenario set out under 1(b) in the Procedural Calendar. They were also advised that the reasons for the decision as well as a dissenting opinion would be conveyed separately.\n\n4.\n\nThis Order sets out the reasons for the denial of the Request. The dissenting opinion of Prof. Kohen is appended.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has the discretion to decide whether to bifurcate the present proceeding into jurisdictional and merits phases. Here, bifurcation would be the most efficient way to proceed as it would not only lead to a substantial reduction of time and costs, but could also potentially lead to the dismissal of the entire case.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent notes that arbitral tribunals have relied on the three-prong test formulated in *Glamis Gold v. US* when deciding whether to bifurcate proceedings. Applying such test to this arbitration, \"all considerations\" speak in favor of bifurcation:1\n\na. The Respondent\u2019s objections are substantial and raise serious issues with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction;2\n\nb. If any of the Respondent\u2019s objections were granted, it would not only result in a substantial reduction of the scope and complexity of the case, but could also potentially result in a dismissal of the entire case. Indeed, if the Respondent\u2019s objections \"going to the *ratione materiae* jurisdiction and Claimants\u2019 lack of standing\"3 were accepted, it would dispose of the entire case. Further, if the jurisdictional objections in respect of Claimant 6 (Sembi) were accepted, the Tribunal would not have to apply the Cyprus-Serbia BIT at all. This would also mean that two claims brought under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT (the non-impairment and umbrella clause claims) would \"automatically become moot,\" leading to a substantial reduction of time and cost;4\n\nc. The Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections need to be addressed only once, in the jurisdictional phase or, if there is no bifurcation, together with the merits phase. Thus, even if the Tribunal were to bifurcate and eventually deny the objections, there would be no increase in cost or delay. Bifurcation would simply result in re-allocating the time and cost required to address the objections to an earlier phase of the proceedings, the advantage being the \"realistic possibility\" that the Parties would save the costs of litigating the merits if the jurisdictional objections were accepted;5\n\nd. The jurisdictional objections can be resolved without assessing the merits of the dispute.6\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6528.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6529.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6531.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6532.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6533.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6534.\n\n7.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to \"resolve Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections as a preliminary matter.\"7\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6536.\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants oppose the Request, contending that it hinders rather than promotes procedural economy in these proceedings. The Claimants disagree with the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the three-prong *Glamis Gold* test and submit that the real test for granting bifurcation is procedural efficiency, which is not met in this case.8 Even if the Tribunal were to apply the *Glamis Gold* test, the Request would still have to be denied:\n\na. The jurisdictional objections are frivolous. For instance, the Respondent disputes the Tribunal\u2019s *ratione personae* jurisdiction over Claimant 6 (Sembi) on the basis that it does not have a \"seat\" in Cyprus as required by Article 1(3)(b) of the Serbia-Cyprus BIT.9 However, the Claimants have already supplied evidence of Sembi\u2019s registration with the Cyprus Registry of Companies, which is all that is required under the relevant provisions of the Serbia-Cyprus BIT. Further, the Respondent\u2019s *ratione temporis* objection in respect of the commencement of the three-year limitation period under Article 22(2)(e)(i) of the Canada-Serbia BIT is equally frivolous, being based on an erroneous understanding of the relevant provisions of the Canada-Serbia BIT. The same is true of the *ratione voluntatis* objection regarding Mr. William A. Rand\u2019s (\"**Mr. Rand**\") 3.9% indirect shareholding in BD Agro held through MDH Serbia;10\n\nb. The Respondent refers to two obj ections only in support of its argument that bifurcation would result in a substantial reduction in the scope and complexity of the case. This argument is, however, ill-founded:\n\n(i) To succeed on its *ratione materiae* objection in respect of the Claimants\u2019 investments, the Respondent would have to establish that the Claimants did not beneficially own and that Mr. Rand did not control the Beneficially Owned Shares.11 Even if it succeeded on both aspects, Mr. Rand would still have standing to bring claims based on his 3.9% shareholding in BD Agro. The factual and legal complexity of the case would thus remain unaltered;\n\n(ii) Similarly, even if the Respondent were to succeed with its *ratione personae* objection against Sembi with the result that the Tribunal would not have to review the non-impairment and umbrella clause claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT, these claims \"partially overlap\" with the claims for the breach of other substantive standards pursued by Claimants 1 to 5 under the Canada-Serbia BIT.12 Thus, bifurcation will not achieve any significant reduction of the scope of the proceedings.\n\nc. The hearing in this arbitration will take place at the end of March 2020 whether or not the arbitration is bifurcated.13 Thus, the duration of the arbitration would remain unaffected if the Tribunal joined the jurisdictional objections to the merits and eventually denied jurisdiction over all claims; the award would be issued at the same time under both the bifurcated and the non-bifurcated scenarios. By contrast, the duration of the arbitration would \"dramatically increase\" if the Tribunal were to bifurcate the proceedings and uphold jurisdiction.14 In this scenario, the Tribunal would likely issue its final award by the end of 2024, effectively doubling the length of non-bifurcated proceedings. Bifurcation \"would only create a significant downside risk,\"15 all the more so as Mr. Rand, one of the Claimants and the Claimants\u2019 key witness, would be almost 80 years old at the time of the hearing on liability and quantum if that hearing were delayed by three years because of bifurcation;16\n\nd. The costs of the arbitration would also dramatically increase if the Tribunal were to bifurcate and then assert jurisdiction over any of the claims. The factual basis for most of the Respondent\u2019s objections is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the merits of the case, as is clear from even a cursory review of the objections.17 Only two objections could potentially be separated from the merits; the remaining six objections would require the Parties to \"plead virtually all of the facts of the case at the jurisdictional stage,\"18 and do so again on the merits if the Tribunal accepts jurisdiction. Further, the Respondent itself relies on documentary and witness evidence relevant to the merits. It is, therefore, evident that the Tribunal would need to hear most of the witnesses and experts at both the jurisdictional and the merits hearings, causing unnecessary expenses. Moreover, the six Claimants advance similar claims based on the same facts. Hence, the scope of evidence and arguments in the merits phase would thus be \"almost identical\" to those pleaded at the jurisdictional stage, even if some Claimants might be excluded from the proceedings through a jurisdictional decision.19\n\nReply, \u00b620.\n\nReply, \u00b639.\n\nReply, \u00b652.\n\nDefined in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial of 16 January 2019.\n\nReply, \u00b635.\n\nReply, \u00b64.\n\nReply, \u00b63.\n\nReply, \u00b65.\n\nReply, \u00b66.\n\nReply, \u00b67.\n\nReply, \u00b611.\n\nReply, \u00b612.\n\n**III. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n**1. Preliminary matters**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal emphasizes that this decision is made on the basis of its understanding of the record as it presently stands. Nothing contained herein shall pre-empt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n10.\n\nAs a further preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the purpose of this Order is to decide whether to bifurcate the present proceedings between jurisdiction and merits. It is not to decide the jurisdictional objections themselves.\n\n**2. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to rule on the Request arises from the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, more specifically from Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules:\n\n**Article 41**\n\n*\"(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute'\"*\n\n**Rule 41**\n\n**Preliminary Objections**\n\n*\"(4)* [The Tribunal] *may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures*.\"\n\n12.\n\nIt is clear from the wording of these provisions that it is up to the Tribunal to assess whether to bifurcate preliminary objections or not, without it being bound by a presumption either in favor of or against bifurcation.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the factors to be considered to decide on bifurcation. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should take into consideration the three factors identified in *Glamis Gold v. US20* paraphrased below:\n\n(1) whether the objection to jurisdiction is substantial inasmuch as the preliminary consideration of a frivolous objection is very unlikely to reduce the costs of, or time required to resolve the dispute;\n\n(2) whether the objection if granted would result in a material reduction of the next phase, i.e. whether the costs and time required for preliminary proceedings would be justified, even if the objecting party were successful; and\n\n(3) whether bifurcation would be impractical because the jurisdictional issues are so intertwined with the merits that it would be unlikely to produce any savings in time or cost.\n\nExh. RLA-99, *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, \u00b612(c).\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants object to this test and submit that \"the factors identified by the *Glamis Gold* tribunal are far from being universally accepted, let alone accepted as exhaustive considerations for the assessment of a request for bifurcation.\"21 They insist that the Tribunal \"should follow the principle of procedural economy as applied to the case at hand.\"22\n\nReply, \u00b617.\n\nReply, \u00b620.\n\n15.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the approaches suggested by the Parties essentially aim at one and the same overarching goal, i.e. efficiency in the conduct of the arbitration. As a general matter, the Tribunal considers that it is good practice to deal with jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase to avoid imposing full-fledged proceedings on a party who disputes having consented to arbitration, whenever bifurcation may result in increased efficiency in terms of time and costs. By contrast, if the bifurcation is unlikely to produce efficiency gains, a tribunal should be disinclined to bifurcate.\n\n16.\n\nIn this context, *Glamis Gold* usefully lists some of the main factors to be taken into account when seeking to assess efficiency. This being so, as other tribunals have observed, the factors identified in *Glamis Gold* are not \"stand-alone\" criteria,23 and arbitral tribunals may well refuse to bifurcate jurisdictional objections even if all three factors are satisfied.24\n\n*See,* for instance, *Philip Morris Asia Ltd v. Australia,* where the tribunal considered an additional factor namely whether the jurisdictional objection could be examined \"without prejudging or entering into the merits.\" *Philip Morris Asia Ltd v. Australia* (Procedural Order No. 8 of 14 April 2014), \u00b6109.\n\nExh. RLA-101, *Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) v. The Republic of India,* PCA Case No. 2016-7, Decision on the Respondent Application for Bifurcation (Procedural Order No. 4), 19 April 2017, \u00b677.\n\n17.\n\nReviewing the Request from the perspective of procedural efficiency, the Tribunal first notes that the Respondent\u2019s objections do not appear frivolous. The *ratione personae* objection against Sembi for instance will require the Tribunal to examine the meaning of Article 1(3)(b) of the Serbia-Cyprus BIT and determine whether Sembi lacks a seat in Cyprus because it is *\"effectively managed\"* from Canada.25 Similarly, the *ratione temporis* objection under the Canada-Serbia BIT would involve an analysis of the relevant Treaty provisions, as well as a review of the record to determine when the three-year limitation period started running. Other objections also raise genuine questions of treaty interpretation among others. As a consequence, the Respondent\u2019s objections must be deemed serious, and success on a combination of several objections could result in the denial of jurisdiction over the entire case.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6481 (emphasis added).\n\n18.\n\nIn spite of these observations, a closer look at efficiency speaks against bifurcation for the following reasons:\n\na. The Respondent has raised several jurisdictional objections. If several objections are upheld, it is clear that this may put an end to the proceedings. However, if the objections fail, it is not clear that the scope of the issues to be briefed at the merits stage would be narrowed. This is particularly so here where Claimants 1-5 have initiated this arbitration under the Canada-Serbia BIT, while Claimant 6 has done so under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. The legal basis of the claims of Claimants 1-5 and of those of Claimant 6 is thus different. However, the factual basis appears to be largely the same for all the claims. If the objections lead to the denial of jurisdiction over the claims brought under one of the Treaties, the Tribunal would nevertheless have to engage in a merits phase and examine the (largely identical) facts underlying the claims brought under the other Treaty, and only marginal efficiencies would be gained through bifurcation. To show a substantial reduction through bifurcation, the Respondent specifically relies on two objections:\n\n(i) It first relies on its *ratione materiae* objection \"concerning Claimants\u2019 inability to prove ownership over property rights allegedly conforming \u2018investment.\u2019\"26 This obj ection is advanced under both Treaties. However, even if the Respondent were to succeed on this objection, arguably Mr. Rand would still be able to bring claims based on his 3.9% shareholding in BD Agro through MDH Serbia. Thus, the factual (and legal) complexity of the case would remain unaltered, as the Tribunal would in any event have to determine whether the Canada-Serbia BIT has been violated (provided, of course, that the Respondent does not succeed on its separate jurisdictional objection in respect of MDH Serbia, where it alleges that the latter did not waive its right to pursue domestic remedies as required by the Canada-Serbia BIT);\n\n(ii) The second objection is the Claimants \"lack of standing.\"27 This *ratione personae* argument appears to be brought only in respect of Claimant 6. Here the\n\nRespondent submits that \"should the Tribunal find that it does not have jurisdiction only with regard to the Cypriot claimant (Sembi), this would not only absolve the Tribunal from applying the Cyprus-Serbia BIT altogether, but it would also mean that two claims raised by Claimants exclusively based on that instrument would automatically become moot.\"28 The Claimants themselves admit as much. Yet, it appears that these two claims (non-impairment and umbrella clause) factually overlap with the claims for breach of other substantive standards under the Canada-Serbia BIT. Thus, even if the Respondent were to succeed on this *ratione personae* objection under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT, the scope of the matters before the Tribunal would not be significantly reduced.\n\nb. On the basis of the record as it presently stands, the facts likely to be involved in determining the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections appear wide ranging and intertwined with the merits. Indeed, to address the jurisdictional objections going to the Claimants\u2019 ownership and control of its alleged investments in Serbia,29 will probably imply a review of Mr. Rand\u2019s alleged investments from inception in 2005 to the alleged expropriation in 2015. The Tribunal may also have to establish whether Mr. Rand had control over BD Agro\u2019s and Mr. Obradovic\u2019s decisions, and the conduct of these individuals with the Privatization Agency. The facts relevant to assess the jurisdictional objections thus do not appear separate and discrete or unrelated to the merits. The Respondent itself has merely submitted that \"the issues of jurisdiction raised in the present submission can be resolved without assessing the merits of the dispute\"30 without any further explanation. It has failed to show that its objections would involve reviewing a narrow set of facts that could be dealt with separately.\n\nc. In support of the preliminary objections, the Respondent invokes factual exhibits as well as witness testimonies.31 As some of these testimonies are also relevant to the merits, some of these witnesses may have to be called twice if the proceedings are bifurcated and the case proceeds to the merits. Examining the same witnesses twice would not be time and cost efficient.\n\nd. Finally, the dates for a possible hearing on jurisdiction coincide with the dates of the potential hearing on the merits. Hence, the decision on jurisdiction would be issued at the same time whether the proceedings are bifurcated or not. By contrast, if the proceedings are bifurcated and continue on the merits, they will last significantly longer and experience shows that longer proceedings also cost more. It is true that the costs of litigating the merits may be expended for no purpose if in a non-bifurcated proceedings jurisdiction were eventually denied. That consequence could, however, be remedied when allocating the burden of the costs of the proceedings.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6531.\n\n*Id.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6532.\n\nThe Respondent raises *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis* objections on this ground, and also submits that the Claimants have failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention. Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7III(A), III(B) and III(E).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6534.\n\nIn the context of its objection that the Tribunal does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction under the Treaties, the Respondent cites the testimonies of Messrs. Obradovic, Rand, Markicevic and Broshko. *See* Counter-Memorial, \u00a7III(A).\n\n19.\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it is procedurally more efficient not to bifurcate these proceedings. In reaching this result, it has in particular taken into consideration that the Respondent would suffer no prejudice in light of the content of the objections and of their interaction with the merits, not to speak of the fact that any extra costs possibly incurred in vain could be compensated by way of an award of costs.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n20.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal, by majority, confirms the decision communicated to the Parties on 31 May 2019, namely that it:\n\n(1) Denies the Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceeding between the jurisdictional objections advanced and the merits of the dispute;\n\n(2) Directs the Parties to follow scenario 1(b) in the Procedural Calendar; and\n\n(3) Reserves the costs of this decision for a later stage of these proceedings.\n\n21.\n\nProf. Kohen's dissent is appended."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Transparency)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2019-08-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Marcelo G. Kohen", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Marcelo G. Kohen\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI deeply regret needing to append this statement of dissent for a rather narrow question, which nevertheless raises a fundamental issue for international arbitration.\n\n2.\n\nThe case, as initiated by the Claimants, involves the application of the Canada-Serbia BIT to five of six Claimants, while for the remaining one (Claimant 6, Sembi Investment Limited, hereinafter \"**Sembi**\") it is the Cyprus-Serbia BIT that is applicable. The two BITs do not coincide in matters of publicity. I agreed to propose to the Parties a uniform system of transparency with the understanding that everything that would not be agreed upon should be governed by the applicable rules of each BIT and those of the ICSID Convention and Rules. The Parties agreed on a substantive number of issues.1 The applicability of the transparency rules of the Canada-Serbia BIT to the first five Claimants has been out of discussion. The Respondent accepted, with respect to Sembi, the publication of the award and the public nature of the hearings. This acceptance constitutes the basis for its implementation. The Parties' disagreement was limited to the question of the disclosure of the record of the entire proceeding with regard to Sembi.\n\nPO No. 5, paragraph 25.\n\n3.\n\nI do believe that the Tribunal has to apply the transparency rules of the Canada-Serbia BIT to the Canadian Claimants in full. But I do not believe that we can extend this treatment to Sembi.\n\n4.\n\nThe majority contends that, since the Serbia-Cyprus BIT does not contain any provision on transparency, \"it neither mandates nor prohibits transparency\".2 This is a curious reasoning. It supposes the existence of a legal gap. This is a reversal of a basic foundation of international law, particularly in the field of international arbitration. State consent is required when there is no other source of obligation. In this field, a State is not obliged to do anything if it has not consented thereto. The so-called principle of freedom (the \"**Lotus principle**\" as it is known in public international law)3 by virtue of which what is not prohibited is permitted, certainly applies to the conduct of States. It does not apply to arbitral tribunals. To impose on States to explicitly reject a given pattern of conduct so as not to be obliged to conform to it is the exact opposite of the principle of freedom and has no ground in the existing international legal system. Furthermore, it has not been invoked that the publicity of the record of arbitral proceedings is an existing rule of general customary law. One of the elements that distinguish arbitration from the permanent international judiciary is the essentially private character of the former, unless otherwise decided by the parties. With respect to permanent international judiciary bodies, the matter is explicitly addressed in the relevant instruments. While for some human rights courts, States have accepted in the relevant convention the publicity of the documentation submitted during the procedure,4 for other international courts and tribunals, the possibility to render the written procedure public is explicitly mentioned in the Rules, after having heard the views of the parties and not before the opening of the oral phase.5 Within the WTO dispute settlement system, confidentiality is the rule.6 It is clear that the ICSID Convention and Rules do not contain a documentation publicity regime.\n\nPO No. 5, paragraph 24.\n\nThe Case of the S.S: \"Lotus\", P.C.I.J. Series A No. 10, pp. 20-21.\n\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Article 40(2): \"Documents deposited with the Registrar shall be accessible to the public unless the President of the Court decides otherwise.\" In the Inter-American system, the matter is covered in the Rules of the Court: Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Rules of Procedure, Article 32(1)(b): \"The Court shall make public: [...] documents from the case file, except those considered unsuitable for publication\". No rule relating to the publicity of the records of the cases is found in the relevant instruments of the African Court of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. In the African Court\u2019s practice, the records are not public.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, Rules of Court, Article 53(2): \"The Court may, after ascertaining the views of the parties, decide that copies of the pleadings and documents annexed shall be made accessible to the public on or after the opening of the oral proceedings\". International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, Rules, Article 67(2): \"Copies of the pleadings and documents annexed thereto shall be made accessible to the public on the opening of the oral proceedings, or earlier if the Tribunal or the President if the Tribunal is not sitting so decides after ascertaining the views of the parties\".\n\nWorld Trade Organization, Dispute Settlement Understanding, Article 18(2): \"Written submissions to the panel or the Appellate Body shall be treated as confidential, but shall be made available to the parties to the dispute. Nothing in this Understanding shall preclude a party to a dispute from disclosing statements of its own positions to the public. Members shall treat as confidential information submitted by another Member to the panel or the Appellate Body which that Member has designated as confidential. A party to a dispute shall also, upon request of a Member, provide a non-confidential summary of the information contained in its written submissions that could be disclosed to the public.\"\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have the power to impose on a State something to which it has not consented. In other words, what States have not consented to cannot be imposed on them under the pretence that they have not excluded it. Limitations to sovereignty cannot be interpreted extensively. In order to have the transparency regime agreed between Serbia and Canada applied to the Cypriot investor in the absence of a transparency rule in the Cyprus-Serbia BIT, the Tribunal needs the agreement of Serbia.\n\n6.\n\nMy distinguished colleagues tried to solve this crucial problem by considering that \"there is no doubt that issues of transparency and confidentiality are matters of procedure,\"7 and that consequently, the Tribunal has the power to decide upon them on the basis of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention. I strongly disagree. Confidentiality and transparency are not \"matters of procedure\" for which Article 44 of the ICSID Convention would be applicable, thus leaving the Tribunal with entire freedom to decide in case nothing is mentioned in the Convention, in the Rules, in the applicable BIT or in case there is no agreement between the parties. In my view, matters of procedure concern pleadings, evidence, time limits, form of decisions, but not the confidentiality and transparency of the procedure itself.\n\nPO No. 5, paragraph 27.\n\n7.\n\nThe fact that the manner in which the record of the hearings shall be kept is a matter discussed in the preliminary procedural consultation with the parties does not transform it into a matter of procedure on which the tribunal has the freedom to decide. This is the moment in which, beyond what is provided in the relevant instruments, an agreement of the parties can be reached (or not).\n\n8.\n\nThe path followed by the majority is a dangerous precedent of enlargement of the powers of ICSID arbitral tribunals beyond what has been agreed by the authors of the Convention. Even assuming that publicity would be a procedural issue and that there would be a lacuna, the Tribunal could not fill the gap by going beyond the basic framework of the applicable treaties and one of the foundations of its very existence: consent. If the relevant applicable BIT is silent, the rules of the ICSID Convention apply. And the ICSID Convention neither provides for the publicity of the records of the proceedings without the consent of the parties, nor authorises the tribunals to decide so.\n\n9.\n\nIf the position of the majority were true, then the ICSID Convention and Rules would have adopted the strange policy that, in order to have the award published and conduct public oral hearings, the consent of the parties is explicitly required,8 while for the publicity of the record of the case, it would be up to tribunals to decide.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 48 (5); ICSID Arbitral Rules, Article 32 (2).\n\n10.\n\nThe majority insists upon efficiency in order to justify its choice. I am aware that it will be complicated to make a distinction and apply some publicity rules to Claimants 1-5 and others to Sembi. But it has been the Claimants\u2019 choice to initiate a single proceeding under two different BITs. The Parties made their choice. It is for the Parties to undergo the actual or potential consequences of this choice. The Tribunal cannot impose the burden of a regime to which the Respondent has not consented simply because of the Claimants\u2019 choice. As I indicated in my statement of dissent to Procedural Order No. 3, efficiency cannot be achieved at the price of disregarding consent. I also have to recall that the Respondent raised a preliminary objection to jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Sembi and my colleagues decided not to bifurcate.9 In other words, the Respondent is compelled to discuss the merits of Sembi\u2019s claim and to render public the documentation concerning its claim while it is possible that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with it.\n\nCf. PO No. 3 and Dissenting Opinion of Professor Marcelo G. Kohen.\n\n11.\n\nI have my own views about the need for transparency in international arbitration in general and in international investment arbitration in particular. I am aware of some current trends in this regard, in particular some proposals aiming at modifying the existing ICSID Arbitration Rules in order to include the publicity of the record of the cases under certain conditions.10 Obviously, the Tribunal cannot decide *sub specie legis ferendae.* Parties may have good or bad reasons not to wish to render the record public. In the context of this arbitration, the question is not for me to analyse whether or not the Respondent should have accepted to extend the transparency regime adopted in the Canada-Serbia BIT to the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. The task of the arbitrator is to exercise his/her jurisdiction within the strict limits of the consent given by the Parties.\n\n*See* ICSID, Proposal for Amendment of the ICSID Rules, Working Paper 3, August 2019, Rule 63, p. 350.\n\n12.\n\nIn deciding to apply to the arbitral relationship between Serbia and Sembi a publicity rule to which neither Serbia nor Cyprus have consented in their BIT or in the ICSID Convention-the only basis of jurisdiction for that relationship-the Tribunal has exceeded its powers."}], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Transparency)\n-------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 12 February 2019, the ICSID Secretariat, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, sent the Parties Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**PO 2**\") containing a draft Transparency Order and draft Transparency Rules, and invited the Parties' comments by 22 February 2019. In PO 2, the Tribunal had proposed to apply transparency rules to this arbitration in conformity with the provisions of the Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 2015 (the \"**Canada-Serbia BIT**\"), the Agreement between Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Cyprus on Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, 2005 (the \"**Cyprus-Serbia BIT**\") as well as the applicable rules in the ICSID framework and seeking guidance from the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency (the \"**UNCITRAL Transparency Rules**\") where the three previous sets of rules provide no directions.\n\n2.\n\nIn response, the Claimants advised the Tribunal on 12 February 2019 that they had no comments on the Transparency Order. By contrast, the Respondent reiterated its earlier position on the transparency regime applicable in this proceeding and proposed a few modifications to the draft Transparency Order.\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 March 2019, the Tribunal advised the Parties that, on the basis of the record at the time, it was unable to determine whether claims arising under the Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**Canada-Serbia BIT**\") and the Agreement between Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Cyprus on Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**Cyprus-Serbia BIT**\") were distinct such that claims under one Treaty could be separated from claims under the other. Accordingly, the Tribunal reserved its decision on the applicable transparency regime(s) until after the filing of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial.\n\n4.\n\nOn 19 April 2019, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial. It advanced several preliminary objections under the Canada-Serbia BIT and the Cyprus-Serbia BIT, requesting the Tribunal to bifurcate the proceedings to address those objections.\n\n5.\n\nOn 26 April 2019, the Tribunal gave the Parties the opportunity to submit any further comments on the transparency regime(s) applicable in this proceeding by 3 May 2019.\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 April 2019, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that it \"[would] not be making any further comments in addition to those previously made.\"\n\n7.\n\nOn 3 May 2019, the Claimants reiterated their earlier position, insisting that the Transparency Order should apply to all claims raised in this arbitration, including the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\n\n8.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal must now determine the transparency rules that govern these proceedings.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants made submissions on the transparency regime applicable in this proceeding (i) in its comments of 20 November 2018 on draft Procedural Order No. 1; (ii) at the first procedural session of 23 November 2018; (iii) in its comments on the draft Transparency Order of 22 February 2019; and (iv) in its communication of 3 May 2019.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants note that this arbitration has been initiated under the Canada-Serbia BIT and Cyprus-Serbia BIT. While the former imposes certain transparency requirements, the latter is silent on the issue. In the circumstances, so say the Claimants, the arbitration must be conducted in compliance with the transparency requirements of the Canada-Serbia BIT, the silence of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT not ruling out transparency. Other ICSID tribunals faced with similar circumstances had adopted the same approach.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the facts and legal arguments supporting the claims brought under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT are \"largely the same\"1 as those supporting the claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT. In the circumstances, it would be \"very difficult\"2 if not \"outright impossible\"3 and \"uneconomical\"4 to separate the few parts of the Parties' submissions on jurisdiction and the merits relating exclusively to the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT from the transparency regime proposed by the Tribunal in the draft Transparency Order. In fact, the Respondent has itself recognized that it would not be \"practically possible\"5 to apply different transparency regimes depending on the applicable Treaty. Moreover, the Counter-Memorial \"confirms that an overwhelming majority of the Parties' submissions relate to factual and legal arguments relevant for the claims and defenses under both BITs.\"6\n\nClaimants' communication of 22 February 2019, page 2.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\nClaimants' communication of 3 May 2019, page 2.\n\nClaimants' communication of 22 February 2019, page 2.\n\nClaimants' communication of 3 May 2019, page 2.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants submit further that having agreed to a transparency regime under one treaty, there is no reason for the Respondent to object to the application of the same regime to another treaty, especially when the latter is silent on the issue. The only Party that could have a legitimate objection to the application of the transparency provisions of the Canada-Serbia BIT to the Cyprus-Serbia BIT is the Cypriot claimant, *i.e.* Claimant 6, which does not object.\n\n13.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that important policy reasons underlie transparency in investment arbitration, which policies the Tribunal should promote.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent made submissions on the transparency regime applicable in this proceeding (i) in its comments of 20 November 2018 on draft Procedural Order No. 1; (ii) at the first procedural session of 23 November 2018; (iii) in its comments on the draft Transparency Order of 22 February 2019; and (iv) in a communication of 30 April 2019.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the application of the transparency provisions of the Canada-Serbia BIT to the entire proceeding. It argues that, as the Cyprus-Serbia BIT contains no transparency rules, the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules must govern. Those instruments do not provide for a presumption of transparency and require, for instance, the consent of all disputing parties for the publication of the award. It was the Claimants\u2019 choice to initiate this arbitration under two different treaties and they cannot now insist that one treaty trumps the other. On this basis, the Respondent proposes certain modifications to the draft Transparency Order.7\n\nRespondent\u2019s communication of 22 February 2019, paragraph 3 (\"paragraph 4 is amended to read as follows: \u2018As a result of the foregoing, Article 48(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 32(2) and 48(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not apply in this proceeding, unless it deals solely with the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. In the latter case, the provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules shall apply to the exclusion of the transparency rules outlined in this Transparency Order and Annex thereto.\u2019\") (emphasis in original).\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that it is possible that the Tribunal sustains the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections in respect of the Canada-Serbia BIT. If so, this proceeding would proceed solely on the basis of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT, in which case there would be no need for a Transparency Order as the transparency provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules would apply.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that Article 31(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT allows the disputing parties in an arbitration under that treaty to agree not to make the documents in the arbitration publicly available. The Respondent therefore agrees to the publication of the award in this arbitration, provided that the Claimants agree that the \"\u2018case file\u2019 (Tribunal\u2019s orders, written pleadings, transcripts, exhibits and other documents, letters, emails etc.)\" will not be published.\n\n18.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent observes that the Claimants have provided no real reason for making the record of this arbitration public. It also asserts that applying the transparency requirements of the Canada-Serbia BIT to the entire arbitration would impose a significant burden on the Parties in terms of time and cost.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n19.\n\nAs recounted above, the Tribunal sent the Parties a draft Transparency Order appending draft Transparency Rules on 12 February 2019. The Respondent proposed certain modifications to the Order, insisting that the transparency provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules \"be reflected in the Transparency Order and transparency rules, which should strive to achieve a fair balance between two BITs governing the present arbitration.\"8 In effect, the Respondent suggests the application of two different transparency regimes in this arbitration, one dealing with claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT and the other with claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. The Claimants oppose this position and submit that the draft Transparency Order \"should apply to all claims raised in this arbitration, including the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\"9\n\n*Id.,* paragraph 2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 communication of 22 February 2019, page 2.\n\n**A. Canada-Serbia BIT**\n------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Canada-Serbia BIT that applies to Claimants 1 to 5 contains transparency provisions on the publication of the award (Article 31(1)), the access to the arbitration record (Article 31(1)), and the publicity of the hearings (Article 31(2)). These provisions are mandatory and bind the Tribunal; they read as follows:\n\n\"**ARTICLE 31**\n\n**Public Access to Hearings and Documents**\n\n1. A Tribunal award under this Section shall be publicly available, subject to the redaction of confidential information. All other documents submitted to, or issued by, the Tribunal shall be publicly available unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, subject to the redaction of confidential information.\n\n2. Hearings held under this Section shall be open to the public. The Tribunal may hold portions of hearings *in camera* to the extent necessary to ensure the protection of confidential information.\n\n3. A disputing party may disclose to other persons in connection with the arbitral proceedings such unredacted documents as it considers necessary for the preparation of its case, but it shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in those documents.\n\n4. The Parties may share with officials of their respective national and sub-national governments all relevant unredacted documents in the course of dispute settlement under this Section, but they shall ensure that those persons protect the confidential information in those documents.\n\n5. If a Tribunal\u2019s order designates information as confidential and a Party\u2019s law on access to information requires public access to that information, the Party\u2019s law on access to information prevails. However, the Party should try to apply its law on access to information so as to protect information that the Tribunal\u2019s order has designated as confidential.\"\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the draft Transparency Rules are in conformity with these treaty rules, and that none of the Parties raises an objection in this respect.\n\n22.\n\nMore specifically, in connection with the arbitration case record, Article 31(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT provides that it will be made public, unless all disputing parties agree otherwise. Here, Claimants 1-5 insist on the publication of the case record of the arbitration. The Tribunal understands that the Respondent does not dispute this position in relation to the claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT. Indeed, the Respondent does not object to the draft Transparency Rules in this connection.\n\n**B. Canada-Cyprus BIT**\n------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe situation is different in relation to the Serbia-Cyprus BIT, which governs in relation to Claimant 6. Here, as mentioned, the Respondent contends that the transparency regime of the Canada-Serbia BIT cannot be applied to proceedings under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. Therefore, it proposes to modify the draft Transparency Rules.\n\n24.\n\nIn terms of legal framework, the Tribunal starts by noting that the Cyprus-Serbia BIT contains no rules on transparency. In other words, it neither mandates nor prohibits transparency. As for the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, they contain only limited rules on transparency/publicity. These rules deal with the publication of the award,10 which essentially requires the Parties' consent; the publicity of the hearings,11 which also are subordinated to consent; and the non-disputing party submissions,12 which are admissible provided they meet certain requirements.\n\nArticle 48(5), ICSID Convention; Rule 48(4), ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nRule 32(2), ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nRule 37(2), ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n25.\n\nHere, albeit conditionally, the Respondent has agreed to the publication of the award.13 It has also agreed to a public hearing.14 As for non-disputing party submissions, they are foreseen in the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the draft Transparency Rules do not modify the ICSID regulations, which continue to apply. Thus, on these matters, there is no dispute and the provisions of the draft Transparency Rules can apply in respect of claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\n\nRespondent's comments of 20 November 2018 on draft Procedural Order No. 1, paragraph 26.1 (\"Respondent agrees that the award be published subject to Claimants' agreement that the case file (documents, pleadings etc.) shall not be published.\").\n\nAudio recording of the first procedural session of 23 November 2018 [56:30-57:05] (\"[Respondent:] Respondent would be prepared to accept what it accepted in the treaty that is that the hearing be public. But again, we think that the case file should not be public, and we think that paragraph 1 second sentence would also allow us to keep the transcripts of the hearing from being public. So, we accept that the hearing is open, but the documents, transcripts and other parts of the case file shall remain not in public [*sic*].\").\n\n26.\n\nAccordingly, there only remains a disagreement on the disclosure of the record of the proceedings. As just mentioned, there are no rules governing this issue in the relevant treaties and arbitration rules, namely the Cyprus-Serbia BIT and ICSID Convention and Rules, nor have the Parties to the arbitration reached an *ad hoc* procedural agreement on this issue.\n\n27.\n\nAbsent an agreement between the disputing parties, matters of procedure are within the powers of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, and there is no doubt that issues of transparency and confidentiality are matters of procedure. The Tribunal therefore has the power to determine whether to allow the disclosure of the record in respect of the claims brought under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\n\n28.\n\nHaving pondered the pros and cons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it is appropriate to do so for the following main reasons (in no specific order):\n\n(i) The first reason refers to procedural economy and the Tribunal's duty to conduct this arbitration in an efficient manner, both in terms of time and costs. While it is true that the Claimants initiated this arbitration through a single request for arbitration under two different Treaties, the Tribunal, having now seen the first round of pleadings, particularly those of the Respondent, finds that it would be highly inefficient, causing increased costs and likely delays, to seek to separate the submissions dealing with the claims of Claimants 1 to 5 from those of Claimant 6. Indeed, it appears that the same factual matrix and the same legal arguments are at issue in respect of the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT as of those under the Canada-Serbia BIT;\n\n(a) While the Respondent has naturally raised different jurisdictional objections under each Treaty, it also objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the basis of the ICSID Convention.15 These objections would affect claims arising under both BITs and the Respondent has not made separate submissions under each Treaty;\n\n(b) The Parties' submissions on attribution would equally affect claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT as well as claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT. Here again, the Respondent has not made separate submissions on attribution;16\n\n(c) Neither Party has distinguished facts relevant to the merits of the dispute under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT from facts pertinent under the other Treaty. The Respondent provides one general statement for the claims under both Treaties17 and then expounds its submissions on liability18 and on quantum19 without segregating the facts supporting the claims made under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT from those under the Canada-Serbia BIT;\n\n(d) As a result, it appears highly uneconomical and inefficient to separate the parts of the record that fall under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT from the rest. In fact, the Respondent agrees that it would not be \"practically possible\".20 But even if it were, it would serve no meaningful purpose, as the information and documents in the record would be published under the Canada-Serbia BIT and little would be gained by maintaining the same facts as confidential in respect of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\n\n(ii) As a further reason, the Tribunal must give meaning to both Treaties in accordance with the principle of *effet utile.* Since the Cyprus-Serbia BIT is silent about transparency and the Tribunal has the power to rule on this issue, and since there is no conflict between the two BITs, it makes sense to apply a transparency rule to the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT that is identical to the one expressly set forth in the Canada-Serbia BIT;21\n\n(iii) To avoid any misunderstanding, the Tribunal does not propose to apply the transparency regime of one treaty to claims arising under another treaty. Transparency in respect of the claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT is governed by the express provisions of that treaty. Transparency in respect of the claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT is governed, in the silence of the Treaty, in part by the agreement of the disputing parties and in part by the decision of the Tribunal taken in the exercise of its procedural powers;\n\n(iv) The conclusion reached by the Tribunal is in line with the approach which another ICSID tribunal adopted when faced with two treaties one of which imposed transparency requirements and the other was silent on the issue;22\n\n(v) The Tribunal's conclusion is further corroborated by the strong trend in favor of transparency in investor-state dispute settlement, which trend is for instance manifest in the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules (the use of which is not limited to UNCITRAL arbitrations) and the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the UN recommending the use of such rules.23\n\n*See,* for instance, Counter-Memorial, Section III(E) (\"Claimants do not meet jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section IV (\"Attribution\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section II (\"Statement of Facts\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section V (\"No Violation of Serbia's Obligations under the Treaties\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section VI (\"The Issue of Compensation\").\n\nAudio recording of the first procedural session of 23 November 2018 [57:33-58:39] (\"[President:] Would it be possible that the information relating more specifically to the Serbia-Cyprus BIT be considered confidential [...] provided of course it can be separated and would only deal with the Serbia-Cyprus BIT and not with both BITs? [...] [Respondent:] From a practical side and having read the Claimants' request for arbitration, and having been acquainted with the file, I don't really think that is practically possible.\").\n\nAnother ICSID tribunal adopted the same approach when faced with two treaties one of which imposed transparency requirements and the other was silent on the issue. See Exh. CLA-58, *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14), Procedural Order No. 2 of 16 April 2015.\n\n*Id.*\n\nResolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 December 2013.\n\n**C. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n29.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, while derived from different legal bases, the rules that will govern transparency in this arbitration end up being identical for claims under both BITs. These rules are provided in the Transparency Rules, which are attached hereto as Annex A and form an integral part of this Order.\n\n30.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the Tribunal has merged the essential content of the draft Transparency Order which was circulated as Annex A to PO 2 on 12 February 2019. In the final version of the Transparency Rules, it has also made some adjustments compared to that draft to facilitate the understanding and practical operation.\n\n31.\n\nFinally, for the submissions that have already been filed, the time limit provided in paragraph 16 of the Transparency Rules shall run from the issuance of the present Order.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n32.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Directs that this arbitration be conducted under the Transparency Rules attached hereto as Annex A;\n\n(ii) Directs that, for submissions already filed, the time limit set in paragraph 16 of the Transparency Rules shall run from the date of issuance of the present Order.\n\n33.\n\nProf. Kohen's dissent is appended."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Transparency)", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2020-01-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Declaration of Professor Marcelo G.

In my view, these matters could have been decided at the end of the proceeding, with the entire picture of the case at hand. Up until now, the only consequences I see is that the costs of the proceedings are higher and that the Respondent is put in the uncomfortable stance of deciding to render public documents that it does not consider to be public or to withdraw them. At the end of the day, this only produces inequality of arms and a more expensive procedure. Quite the opposite of the alleged efficiency that was meant to result from deciding not to bifurcate or from applying the transparency rules of a BIT to another that does not contain them.\n\nPO N\u00b0 5, statement of dissent."}], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Transparency)\n-------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 29 August 2019, the ICSID Secretariat, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, sent the Parties Procedural Order No. 5 (\"PO 5\") containing the Transparency Rules applicable in this arbitration. The Parties were advised that they could propose redactions to the submissions already in the record within 15 days of the date of the Order.\n\n2.\n\nOn 12 September 2019, the Parties were advised that, subject to their objections, the Tribunal would request the Repository mentioned in the Transparency Rules to publish Procedural Order Nos. 1 to 5.\n\n3.\n\nOn 13 September 2019, the Respondent proposed certain redactions to the submissions already in the record (the \"First Proposed Redactions\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 September 2019, the Claimants were advised that they could object to the First Proposed Redactions by 30 September 2019. A Transparency Schedule for future use in the arbitration was conveyed to the Parties on the same date.\n\n5.\n\nOn 27 September 2019, the Respondent proposed certain redactions to Annex A of Procedural Order No. 4 (the \"Second Proposed Redactions\") in the form of the Transparency Schedule.\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 September 2019, the Claimants objected to the First Proposed Redactions.\n\n7.\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Claimants were invited to comment on the Second Proposed Redactions by 14 October 2019 in the Respondent's Transparency Schedule. The Parties were advised that, in the future, they should comply with the time limits set in PO 5 without expecting a confirmation from the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 October 2019, the Claimants filed their Reply accompanied by five witness statements and seven expert reports, exhibits CE-380 to CE-769 and legal authorities CLA-069 to CLA-152.\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 October 2019, the Claimants submitted their objections to the Second Proposed Redactions.\n\n10.\n\nOn 19 October 2019, the Respondent proposed certain redactions to the Claimant's Reply and accompanying documentation (the \"Third Proposed Redactions\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 October 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants' objections to redaction by 28 October 2019 in the form of the Transparency Schedule. The Respondent was asked to identify specifically the information that was not in the public domain. The Claimants were to respond by 4 November 2019, after which the Tribunal would decide.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 October 2019, the Respondent commented on the Claimants' Objections to the First and Second Proposed Redactions in the form of the Transparency Schedule.\n\n13.\n\nOn 3 November 2019, the Claimants submitted further comments on the Respondent's communication of 28 October 2019, and their objections to the Third Proposed Redactions.\n\n14.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal must now determine whether to sustain the redactions proposed by the Respondent.\n\n**II. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n15.\n\nAs mentioned above, the First Proposed Redactions were contained in the Respondent's communication of 13 September 2019. Its Second Proposed Redactions were contained in a Transparency Schedule annexed to its communication of 27 September 2019. Their Third Proposed Redactions were contained in a Transparency Schedule annexed to its communication of 19 October 2019. Further clarifications and a revised Transparency Schedule containing the First and Second Proposed Redactions were submitted on 28 October 2019.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent wishes to redact information \"concerning various valuations of BD Agro's assets\" as it is \"confidential business information\" under PO 5 and Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT. It points out that, as BD Agro was recently sold at an auction, \"publishing information on the value of its assets may hinder the property rights and business interests of its buyer\".1 Further, \"protecting this information will in no way impact the public interest in transparency in treatybased investor-State arbitration nor the Parties' interest in a fair and efficient resolution of disputes\",2 and may in fact have the opposite effect as \"Claimants' intention is to attract the public attention to the case and argue their case not only before this Tribunal but also before the general public, which could burden the proceedings with unnecessary publicity\".3\n\nRespondent's letter of 13 September 2019, \u00b6 3.\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 39.\n\n17.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent requests redactions of certain portions of the following:\n\n\u2022 Request for Arbitration of 9 February 2019;\n\n\u2022 Memorial of 16 January 2019;\n\n\u2022 Consolidated List of Claimant's Documents of 16 January 2019;\n\n\u2022 Second Witness Statement of Mr. Igor Marki\u0107evi\u0107 of 16 January 2019;\n\n\u2022 Counter-Memorial of 19 April 2019.\n\n\u2022 Reply Memorial of 4 October 2019.\n\n\u2022 Third Witness Statement of Mr. Igor Marki\u0107evi\u0107 of 3 October 2019;\n\n\u2022 Consolidated List of Claimant's Documents of 4 October 2019;\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent also wishes to exclude from publication in their entirety the expert reports of Dr. Richard Hern of 16 January 2019 and 3 October 2019, of Mr. Sandy Cowan of 19 April 2019, and of Mr. Krzystof Grzesik of 3 October 2019 stating, *inter alia,* that \"specific redaction of all business information contained in [the reports] would effectively render such documents meaningless, as their only purpose and predominant content is exactly the determination of BD Agro's value.\"4 Moreover, the Hern and Cowan's reports explicitly state that they are confidential.5 If the Tribunal were to find that these documents should nevertheless be published, the Respondent proposes the redaction of certain sections of the reports.6\n\nRespondent's letter of 13 September 2019, \u00b6 4, and Respondent's Transparency Schedule of 19 October 2019.\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 33.\n\nRespondent's letter of 13 September 2019, \u00b6 5, and Respondent's Transparency Schedule of 19 October 2019.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent explains that after BD Agro was sold at a public auction, it was \"on the market\" like any other company. It is, therefore, entitled to protect information about the valuation of its assets, disclosing such information only to those whom it chooses and even then under a condition of confidentiality.7 The valuations to be disclosed now are of particular identifiable assets of BD Agro, unlike the information available on the website of the Serbian Business Register Agency which contains information about the aggregate value of BD Agro's assets. Disclosing this information would make BD Agro's negotiating position with other commercial entities more difficult, as the company would never be able to sell the assets in question for a higher price.8\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the scope and purpose of the valuations which are now to be disclosed should also be taken into account. None of the valuations were prepared for the purpose of being made publicly available years after they were submitted; they were made for the sale of BD Agro's individual assets. None of the authors of the valuations consented to their publication.9\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 27.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent contests that the valuations were available to the public because they were disclosed during the bankruptcy proceedings. In fact, the \"majority\" of the valuations were part of the Serbian bankruptcy court case file, which only persons with \"legal standing\" in the BD Agro bankruptcy proceedings could access.10\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 14.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent equally opposes the Claimants' position on Article 15 of Annex A to PO 5, contending that sub-articles (a) and (b) thereof operate in different circumstances. Confidential business information under Article 15(a) need not meet the criteria of the Serbian Law on Protection of Trade Secrecy as, unlike in Article 15(b), there is no such requirement in Article 15(a). This provision merely requires that information \"should reasonably be considered confidential, taking into account how such information is usually treated in practice by businesses.\"11 In respect of Article 15(b), the Claimant incorrectly concludes that such provision can only be satisfied if the criteria for confidentiality prescribed by the Serbian Law on Protection of Trade Secrecy are met. However, there is no such suggestion in Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT; the notion of confidential information under the Canada-Serbia BIT to which Article 15(b) refers is \"much wider\". For instance, \"Article 10(2) of the Serbian Bankruptcy Law, by specifying that only creditors are allowed to access the whole bankruptcy court case file of a debtor, in fact prevents disclosure of the Valuations to any third party within the meaning of Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\"12\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 23 -24.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that even if one were to accept the Claimants' reliance on Article 4 of the Serbian Law on Protection of Trade Secrecy, that law does not impose strict conditions which if not cumulatively met would deprive the information from being considered confidential. For the Respondent, \"[s]uch an interpretation would be contrary to the underlying purpose of the law which was to enable the holder of information to decide whether it is confidential or not, even if the four criteria quoted by Claimants are not fulfilled.\"13 Indeed, paragraph 2(2) of Article 4 of the Serbian Law on Protection of Trade Secrecy \"stipulates that confidential information is also 'any other information which is under a separate law, other regulation or a decision of a legal entity considered as confidential.'\"14.\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 25.\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 26.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent further disputes that the fact that the valuations are prepared from publicly available financial statements means that they should not be redacted. The financial statements do not contain valuation of specific assets of BD Agro, they instead provide aggregate data about the value of BD Agro's assets. This information is different from information about the value of the company's individual assets.15\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 29.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges that a majority of the information is also available in the public domain, contending that \"only information that are available on the web site of the Serbian Business Registers Agency and on the web site of the Bankruptcy Supervision Agency should be considered as being already in public domain, as they are easily accessible to the general public through simple online search. Information which are not available on these two websites should be presumed not to be in public domain.\"16\n\nRespondent's letter of 28 October 2019, \u00b6 30.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants object to the Respondent's proposed redactions on the basis that the information sought to be redacted is not confidential under the transparency framework applicable in this arbitration being the Transparency Rules, the Canada-Serbia BIT and the Serbian Law on Protection of Trade Secrets.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the information sought to be redacted is already in the public domain and available to any \"interested person\" \"in published legal acts and regulations, [...] in the cadaster, [...] in the financial statements published by BD Agro and information available in the court files related to BD Agro's reorganization and bankruptcy proceedings\".17 In addition, both the Respondent and BD Agro have been aware that the information regarding the value of BD Agro's assets is not confidential. Indeed, BD Agro has not protected or restricted access to information about the value of its assets disclosed in the bankruptcy proceedings.18\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 November 2019, p.5.\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 November 2019, p.9.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the Respondent has failed to explain why the business interests of BD Agro's new owner would be jeopardized by publishing information regarding the valuation of BD Agro as of 21 October 2015 and earlier. They contend that there were certain discrepancies in the sale of BD Agro's assets, arguing that \"[t]he desire of the Serbian government to avoid embarrassment from this sale is not a relevant reason for making the valuations of BD Agro's assets confidential in this arbitration.\"19\n\nClaimants' letter of 30 September 2019, p. 6-7.\n\n29.\n\nFurther, according to the Claimants, the criteria mentioned in Article 4 of the Trade Secrets Law to designate information as confidential are not fulfilled in this case. The Respondent is wrong to suggest that the criteria are not cumulative, the Explanatory Note to the Law states to the contrary. Further, the reference in Article 4 to information designated as confidential under different circumstances is unavailing as \"Serbia does not refer to any other Serbian laws\u2014or any other authority for that matter\u2014that would define confidential business information in a manner that would encompass the information that Serbia proposes to redact.\"20\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 November 2019, p.4.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the information to be redacted does not merit protection under Article 15(a) or 15(b) of the Transparency Rules either. That provision does not define \"confidential business information\", for which one must turn to the Trade Secrets Law, examined above. The Respondent's proposed definition is unsupported by any legal authority. Besides, it is \"unworkable\" as \"it does not explain the specific business practice that would ultimately distinguish confidential from non-confidential information\" and would lead one back to the definition of confidential information in the Trade Secrets Law. Article 15(b) explicitly refers to the Canada-Serbia BIT, which, in turn, refers to Serbian law. The Respondent has not indicated which other statute or regulation would provide guidance on the meaning of confidential business information other than the Trade Secret Law.21\n\n*Id.*\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's submission that only a few persons have access to BD Agro's bankruptcy proceedings. They point out that, pursuant to Articles 10(1), (4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy proceedings \"shall be open to the public\" and that all submissions of the bankruptcy trustee and other participants in the proceedings, including their attachments, are to be made available online. Further, Article 159(3) of the Bankruptcy Law provides that all pre-pack reorganization plans are to be published online as well. In any event, even if the Respondent were right, there were over 300 registered creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings and over 450 creditors in the reorganization proceedings, all of whom had full access to the relevant information and could use it as they saw fit. In the circumstances, \"Serbia cannot seriously claim that information available to 300-450 creditors, who are not subject to any obligations of non-disclosure and, hence, not limited in the use or dissemination of that information, is confidential and must be protected by the Tribunal.\"22\n\nClaimants' letter of 3 November 2019, p. 7-8.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants deem it irrelevant that the valuations to be disclosed were not \"prepared for the purposes of being available to the public\" or that Dr. Hern and Mr. Cowan state that their reports are confidential. The owners of the information waived any potential confidentiality when they submitted their reports in the reorganization and bankruptcy proceedings, which were available to the public. Similarly, Dr. Hern and Mr. Cowan's reports were prepared for the purposes of the present arbitration, and their confidentiality is subject to the Transparency Rules governing this arbitration. In any event, the Claimants waive confidentiality of any information contained in the expert reports.23\n\nClaimants' letter of 4 November 2019, p. 11-12.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants also challenge the Respondent's submission that information which is not on the websites of the Serbian Business Register Agency or the Bankruptcy Supervision Agency should not be considered as in the public domain. For them, \"where the law prescribes the publication on-line of certain information, such as the publication of the submissions in the bankruptcy proceedings under Article 10(5), then such information cannot be considered as confidential regardless of whether it has been published yet or will be published only in the future.\"24\n\nClaimants' letter of 4 November 2019, p. 8.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent seeks to redact information concerning various valuations of BD Agro's assets, on the basis that this information is confidential business information under paragraph 15 of the Transparency Rules and Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n35.\n\nParagraph 15 of the Transparency Rules defines \"confidential information\" for the purposes of this arbitration as follows:\n\n\"15. Confidential information consists of:\n\na. Confidential business information;\n\nb. Information that is deemed confidential under the Canada-Serbia BIT;\n\nc. Information that is protected against being made available to the public, in the case of the information of the respondent State, under the law of the respondent State, and in the case of other information, under any law or rules determined by the arbitral tribunal to be applicable to the disclosure of such information; or\n\nd. Information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement.\"\n\n36.\n\nThus, confidential information includes \"confidential business information\", as well as \"information that is deemed confidential under the Canada-Serbia BIT\".\n\n37.\n\nIn this latter respect, Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT defines \"confidential information\" in the following manner:\n\n\"confidential information\" means confidential business information or information that is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under the law of a Party\".\n\n38.\n\nThe \"law of a Party\" relevant for present purposes is Article 4 of the Serbian Law on Protection of Trade Secrets, which contains the following definition of a \"trade secret\" :\n\n\"trade secret, within the meaning of this law, is any information which has commercial value because it is not generally known or available to third persons who could gain economic advantage by using or communicating said information, and which is protected by the holder by appropriate measures in accordance with the law, business policy, contractual obligations or appropriate standards with the aim of preserving its secrecy, which information could cause damages to the holder of the trade secret if communicated to a third person.\"\n\n39.\n\nConfidential information under Serbian law is thus information that has a commercial value, that is not generally known and/or known to persons who could gain from its use or disclosure and that is protected by its holder. The definition also provides that communication of such information could result in harm to its holder. The Explanatory Report to the Law provides that these conditions are cumulative:\n\n\"The essential elements required for protection are secrecy, commercial value and relevant measures undertaken by the holder of trade secret in order to protect its secrecy. The stated conditions must be cumulatively fulfilled and essentially the trade secret is a secret, commercially valuable data, for which relevant measures for protection of its secrecy have been undertaken by the person legally controlling that data (holder).\"25\n\nExh. CE-797.\n\n40.\n\nAccordingly, to qualify as confidential information under the Transparency Rules, the information must not be available to the public. Here, however, much of the information that the Respondent seeks to protect is in the public domain through published legal acts and regulations,26 BD Agro's financial statements,27 court files relating to BD Agro's reorganization and bankruptcy proceedings, and cadaster records. For instance, BD Agro's pre-pack reorganization plan,28 contemporaneous valuations of BD Agro and its assets,29 and the valuations prepared for the sale of BD Agro in bankruptcy proceedings30 are all available to the public pursuant to Article 10 of the Serbian Bankruptcy Law,31 which also requires the immediate publication of all submissions in the bankruptcy proceedings.32 Even if the Respondent were correct that only limited categories of persons had access to information in the bankruptcy proceedings, which position appears contrary to Article 10 of the Bankruptcy Law,33 it remains that over 300 creditors had access to that information. Further, much of the information that the Respondent proposes to redact was available on the website of the Serbian Business Register Agency as of September 2019.34\n\nExh. CE-143, General Regulation Plan for BD Agro Complex Zones A, B and C in the Suburb of Dobanovci, Municipality of Sur\u010din of 2008, which includes information about the classification of BD Agro's land as commercial, industrial and agricultural. See also, Claimants' letter of 3 November 2011, p.5.\n\nExh. CE-171, Notes to the 2015 Financial Statements, note 7 and note 19, p.11 and p.16, which includes information about the categories of assets owned by BD Agro and their recorded value. See also, Claimants' letter of 3 November 2011, p.5.\n\nExh. CE-101.\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. CE-172, 175, 176.\n\nExh. RE-191.\n\nArticle 10 of the Serbian Bankruptcy Law: \"[b]ankruptcy proceedings shall be open to the public and all participants in the proceedings shall be entitled to a timely access to data relating to the conduct of the proceedings, except the data constituting a business or official secret. All creditors have the right to ask and timely receive from the bankruptcy [trustee] all information related to the bankruptcy debtor, the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, and property and management of the assets of the bankruptcy debtor\".\n\nArticle 10 of the Serbian Bankruptcy Law: \"[a]ll submissions of the bankruptcy administrator and the participants in the proceedings with all attachments shall be published, immediately after reception, on the public website of the competent commercial court or in some other manner that allows the public to be informed about the progress of the bankruptcy proceedings, but complying with regulations governing the protection of personal data\".\n\nExh. RE-197. See, for instance, paragraph 1: \"Bankruptcy proceedings shall be open to the public and all participants in the proceedings shall be entitled to a timely access to data relating to the conduct of the proceedings, except the data constituting a business or official secret.\"\n\nExh. CE-379.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent has not sufficiently established why publicly available information should be protected from disclosure in this arbitration.35 Neither has it established why information that can be compiled from such publicly available information should be protected.36 It has also failed to establish that the publication of this information - some of which pre-dates the auction of BD Agro to a third party buyer by several years - would \"hinder the property rights and business interests of [BD Agro's] buyer.\" Finally, the Respondent has not explained how the absence of consent of some authors of information, or the invocation of confidentiality by some authors would prevent the disclosure of information. All documents in this arbitration are subject to the Transparency Rules set out by the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties. Those Rules provide that all information in this arbitration shall be made available to the public subject to certain exceptions. The consent of each author and unilateral claims of transparency are thus irrelevant in this context.\n\nParagraphs 16 and 17 of the Transparency Rules provide that a proposal for redaction of confidential information shall identify the part of the document sought to be redacted and explain the reasons for redaction.\n\nSee, for instance, Request 7, Transparency Schedule.\n\n42.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot consider that the information which the Respondent seeks to protect is confidential. As a result, it must refuse the Respondent's proposed redactions. According to paragraph 20 of the Transparency Order, the Respondent thus has 15 days to withdraw the information it introduced into the record, if it so wishes.\n\n43.\n\nFurthermore, at the present stage, the Tribunal does not grant the Respondent's request to redact the entirety of the expert reports of Messrs. Hern, Cowan and Grzesik. Indeed, Article 9 of the Transparency Rules requires expert reports to be made available to the public only \"upon request by any person made to the ICSID Secretariat.\" Since no third party has requested access to the expert reports, the latter shall not to be published as matters presently stands. If a request for consultation of the expert reports were presented in the future, the Respondent would be free to renew its request for protection and the Tribunal would then revisit the issue.\n\n44.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal has entered its decision on each redaction requested by the Respondent in its Transparency Schedules of 19 and 28 October 2019 and has attached the completed Schedules as Annexes A and B to this Order. Those decisions reflect the Tribunal's conclusions above.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n45.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Denies the redactions proposed by the Respondent in its communications of 13 September 2019, 27 September 2019, 19 October 2019, and 28 October 2019 as reflected in its Transparency Schedules of 19 and 28 October 2019. Completed versions of those Schedules are at Annex A and B hereto and form an integral part of this Order.\n\n(ii) Directs that, in accordance with Article 20 of the Transparency Rules, the Respondent may withdraw from the record all or part of the information that it sought to protect from publication 15 days from the date of this Order. If it chooses to do so, the Respondent shall then submit these documents without the respective information 10 days thereafter.\n\n(iii) Will direct the Repository to publish, the documents mentioned in Article 8 of the Transparency Rules once the process set out in subparagraph (ii) above is completed.\n\n46.\n\nProf. Kohen's declaration is appended."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9 (New Evidence, Assistance and Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2021-03-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9 (New Evidence, Assistance and Provisional Measures)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 15 January 2021, the Claimants submitted a request to file new documents into the record (the \"Request to File New Evidence\") and a request for assistance to acquire certain documents (the \"Request for Assistance\").\n\n2.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimants made a request for provisional measures with respect to a criminal investigation allegedly initiated by the Respondent against Mr. Djura (George) Obradovi\u0107, the former nominal owner of BD Agro and a witness in this arbitration (the \"Request for Provisional Measures\"). They also sought an order from the Tribunal directing the Respondent not to use documents from the criminal investigation in the arbitration, including in the Respondent\u2019s submissions on the Request for Provisional Measures, until the Tribunal decided on the Request.\n\n3.\n\nOn 19 January 2021, the ICSID Secretariat, at the Tribunal\u2019s behest, invited the Respondent to comment on the three Requests. In light of the Claimants\u2019 request that the Respondent not use the documents from the criminal investigation in its response to the Request for Provisional Measures, the Respondent was instructed to label the documents obtained through the criminal proceedings appended to its response, if any. The Parties were advised that the Tribunal reserved its decision on the admissibility of such documents for a later stage. Finally, the Parties were requested to reserve a date for a hearing by videoconference on the Request for Provisional Measures in the event the Tribunal found that such a hearing would be useful after reviewing the Parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n4.\n\nOn 5 February 2021, the Respondent submitted its Response to the three Requests (the \"Response\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 9 February 2021, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal preferred to hear the Parties orally on the Request for Provisional Measures. A hearing was thus scheduled on 16 February 2021 from 16:15 to 19:15 (CET) via Zoom (the \"Hearing\").\n\n6.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimants complained that nine documents submitted by the Respondent along with its Response (Exhs. RE-657, 658, 660-662, 667-670) had not been labelled in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s ruling of 19 January 2021. The Claimants also requested leave to file one more document into the record being a public announcement published by BD Agro\u2019s bankruptcy trustee in respect of the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land.\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 February 2021, the Respondent was invited to comment on the Claimants\u2019 communications of 9 February 2021. The Parties were advised that the Tribunal would decide on the admissibility of the nine documents submitted by the Respondent with its Response, along with Exhs. RE-671-673, at a later stage. Further, if the Parties intended to refer to the content of these documents at the forthcoming Hearing, they were requested to advise the Tribunal by 15 February 2021 at 11:00 (CET) to allow the Tribunal to give directions in this respect prior to the Hearing.\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 February 2021, the Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 communications of 9 February 2021. The Respondent advised the Tribunal that it intended to rely on the exhibits mentioned above in the course of its oral argument at the Hearing and objected to the Claimants\u2019 request for leave to file the public announcement concerning the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land.\n\n9.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal ruled that the Respondent had not mislabeled the nine exhibits as alleged by the Claimants. It also determined that the exhibits mentioned above were admissible and that the Parties could refer to them at the Hearing if they wished to do so.\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 February 2021, at the Hearing the Parties made further submissions and the Tribunal asked questions from counsel.\n\n11.\n\nThe Parties having thus completed their submissions, the Tribunal now issues its decision on the Request to File New Evidence, the Request for Assistance, and the Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n**II. REQUEST TO FILE NEW EVIDENCE**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants seek leave to file the following documents into the record:\n\ni. \"Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s Reports\"1, which the Claimants contend are \"directly relevant and material\" with respect to the bankruptcy costs estimated in one of Mr. Cowan\u2019s valuations of BD Agro. These Reports are also relevant - so say the Claimants - to their claim that the expropriation and subsequent sale of BD Agro and its land was conducted to benefit Agrounija and its ultimate owner, Mr. Miodrag Kosti\u0107. Finally, the Reports also contain information on whether certain land plots owned by BD Agro should be excluded from BD Agro\u2019s valuation because of court disputes;\n\nii. \"[D]ocuments related to the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land announced in December 2020\", which the Claimants contend are directly relevant and material to assess the Respondent\u2019s position that this land should be excluded from BD Agro\u2019s valuation;\n\niii. \"List of land plots owned by Serbia in the cadastral area of Dobanovci\", which, for the Claimants, is relevant and material with respect to Ms. Ilic\u2019s argument that 28 land plots constituting part of the construction land in Zones A, B and C are not owned by BD Agro, as the Claimants insist, but rather by Serbia and other entities;\n\niv. \"Map of certain land plots identified in Ms. Ilic\u2019s Second Expert Report\", which are relevant and material for the reasons just mentioned; and,\n\nv. \"Information about Location' for individual land plots within the Construction land in Zones A, B, and C in Dobanovci\", which, the Claimants contend \"are directly relevant and material to assess the veracity of Ms. Ilic\u2019s argument that the Construction land in Zones A, B and C cannot be developed without adoption of a detailed regulation plan.\"\n\nThe report for third quarter of 2019 dated 4 February 2020; the report for fourth quarter of 2019 dated 11 March 2020; the report for first quarter of 2020 dated 3 June 2020; and the report for second quarter of 2020 dated 21 August 2020.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the exceptional circumstances threshold set in Procedural Order No.1 (\"PO 1\") justifies the admission of these documents into the record at this stage of the arbitration. Indeed, these documents did not exist or were not publicly available at the time of the Claimants\u2019 last written submission. Further, some documents had been requested from the Serbian authorities before the Claimants\u2019 last submission, but those authorities failed to provide them in time for inclusion in the submission. Finally, some documents respond to new arguments made by the Respondent in its last submission on quantum of 16 March 2020 (the \"Submission on Quantum\").\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this Request should be denied as it is \"yet another\" attempt by the Claimants to reargue their quantum case, something which the Tribunal should also take into account in its decision on costs.\n\n15.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants have not met the \"exceptional circumstances\" threshold set in PO 1 for the admission of new documents into the record. For instance, the Claimants have not explained how the New Evidence is important to the case and \"would have a significant impact on the resolution of the case and the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations.\"\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants erroneously equate the \"exceptional circumstances\" standard with the question of the unavailability of the evidence to the Parties. This goes against the existing arbitral practice. Other arbitral tribunals have held that a party must not only show unavailability but must further establish the presence of exceptional circumstances.\n\n17.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants equally erroneously contend that the New Evidence sought to be introduced is responsive to new arguments which the Respondent introduced in its Submission on Quantum. The Claimants already complained about the Respondent\u2019s so-called new arguments in April 2020. That complaint was rejected by the Tribunal on 1 June 2020 on the basis that the Respondent\u2019s submission contained no new arguments. The Claimants have waited for over 200 days to raise this issue again, asking for leave to submit of evidence which was available to them at the time of their original application on this matter in April 2020, and which they did not seek to file then.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent advances the following specific objections against the admission of the New Evidence:\n\ni. None of the Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s Reports are relevant to the dispute or material to its outcome. Indeed, the Claimants' allegation that the sale was conducted to benefit Agrounija is irrelevant to their claims in this arbitration. Besides, at least one Report pre-dates the Claimants' last submission. Further and in any event, \"the reports are either not a reliable source of information on the issues Claimants invoke as justification for their submission, or they contain information that is already established or self-evident\";\n\nii. Equally, the documents related to the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land announced in December 2020, are neither relevant nor material. In fact, the sale in question was announced on 25 December 2020, over five years after the Claimants\u2019 valuation date of 21 October 2015. As of that latter date, there were existing and ongoing disputes concerning certain land registered in the name of BD Agro that would affect the value of that land and Claimants\u2019 ability to sell it. The documents sought to be produced now would not change the position that as of that latter date, there were existing and ongoing disputes concerning certain land registered in the name of BD Agro that would affect the value of that land and the Claimants\u2019 ability to sell it;\n\niii. Similarly, the list of land plots owned by Serbia in the cadastral municipality Dobanovci and the map of land plots identified in Ms. Ilic\u2019s Second Expert Report do not respond to new arguments made in the Respondent\u2019s Submission on Quantum and the Claimants have not identified the documents with enough specificity to determine their relevance;\n\niv. Finally, the \"information about location\" for individual land plots in Zones A, B and C could have been obtained and filed with earlier submissions, which the Claimants did not do, and neither did they reserve the possibility of future filing.\n\n**C. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants seek to introduce new evidence into the record after their last written submission. Paragraph 17.4 of PO 1 contains the following rule in this respect:\n\n\"Neither party shall be permitted to submit additional or responsive documents after the filing of its respective last written submission, unless the Tribunal determines that exceptional circumstances exist based on a reasoned written request followed by observations from the other party.\"\n\n20.\n\nExceptional circumstances thus must exist for new evidence to be admitted at this stage of the proceedings. The Party seeking to introduce new evidence into the record bears the burden of establishing the existence of such circumstances. It must do so separately for each piece of evidence sought to be admitted.\n\n21.\n\nPO 1 does not elaborate on the exceptional circumstances required for a late admission of evidence. It is clear, however, that the circumstances must be \"exceptional\", i.e. out of the ordinary. Thus, if a Party chose not to submit evidence that was available to it at the time of filing its written submissions, that situation would, in and of itself, not be exceptional. By contrast, if the evidence sought to be admitted responds to a new argument made by the opposing party in its last submission then that situation may well qualify as an exceptional circumstance requiring the admission of that evidence into the record. Further, it goes without saying that the evidence to be introduced should be relevant to the dispute and material to its outcome.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal now proceeds to determine whether the evidence to be admitted satisfies these requirements.\n\ni. Bankruptcy Trustee's Reports\n-------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the requirements set out above (\u00a7\u00a720-21) have been met for these documents. Indeed, the Claimants have not shown that exceptional circumstances exist that would justify the admission of these documents into the record at this stage of the arbitration. Neither have they established that the requested documents sought to be introduced are relevant or material. For instance, it is not obvious that the Reports will, as the Claimants contend, show \"the actual bankruptcy costs incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings\", as those proceedings are still ongoing. Further, while the Reports might show that the bankruptcy sale of BD Agro was conducted in a manner benefiting Agrounija, it remains that the Claimants have not shown how their allegation that the entire bankruptcy sale was conducted for Agrounija's benefit is related to their claimed violations of the BITs. Indeed, the Claimants mention this issue only in their recital of the factual background of this case, and their present request only points to the recitals.2 Finally, some of the Reports merely seem to confirm facts that are already on record.3\n\nThe Claimants refer to \u00a7\u00a7467-476 of their Reply of 4 October 2019. These paragraphs address the factual background of the dispute.\n\nSee, for instance, Response, \u00a722.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that on 5 February 2021 the Respondent opposed the admission of these documents into the record on the basis that the Claimants' allegations in respect of Agrounija were irrelevant to their claimed violations of the BITs. On 9 February 2021, the Claimants sought to introduce the public announcement concerning the sale of BD Agro's land into the record, alleging that it was \"directly relevant and material for the Claimants' claim that the expropriation and subsequent sale of BD Agro and its land were purposefully conducted in a manner to benefit Agrounija and its ultimate owner, Mr. Miodrag Kosti\u0107.\" Thus, despite being aware of the Respondent's position that documents allegedly showing that the sale of BD Agro and its land were conducted to benefit Agrounija were irrelevant, the Claimants chose not to address it.\n\nii. Documents related to the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land announced in December 2020\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nHere again, the Tribunal considers that the applicable requirements (\u00a7\u00a720-21) have not been fulfilled. The Claimants have not shown that the documents to be introduced would be relevant or material to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the Respondent\u2019s position that this land should be excluded from BD Agro\u2019s valuation. More particularly, they have not convincingly explained how these documents, all dated after 25 December 2020, would be of relevance when the valuation date in question is 21 October 2015.\n\n26.\n\nThis ruling equally applies in respect of the public announcement concerning the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land sought to be filed by the Claimants. Here too, the Claimants have not explained the relevance or materiality of this document. Further, while this document might support the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the entire bankruptcy sale was conducted for Agrounija\u2019s benefit, as mentioned above, it remains that the Claimants have not explained how this issue is related to the claimed violations of the BITs at issue in this case.\n\niii. List of land plots owned by Serbia in the cadastral area of Dobanovci, and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\niv. Map of certain land plots identified in Ms. Ilic\u2019s Second Expert Report\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nHere, the Claimants seek the Tribunal\u2019s leave to file an \"excel spreadsheet, which was prepared by the City of Belgrade, Secretariat for the Economy, Sector for Agriculture and lists all land plots owned by Serbia in the Surcin municipality, which includes the cadastral area of Dobanovci where the Construction land in Zones A, B and C is located.\" This document will purportedly demonstrate that Serbia owns the land plots identified by Ms. Ilic and not BD Agro. The Claimants also seek to introduce \"a map showing the location of four land plots, with respect to which Ms. Ilic argues that they are not owned by BD Agro [showing] the position of these land plots, as well as the position of the Construction Land in Zones A, B and C.\"\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the requirements set out above (\u00a7\u00a720-21) are satisfied in this case either. It recalls that, on 1 June 2020, it ruled on the Claimants\u2019 request to strike certain submissions made by the Respondent in its Additional Submission on Quantum, finding that \"the Contested Issues [including the issue of the land parcels identified by Ms. Ilic] arise out of submissions made in the Rejoinder. It cannot, therefore, exclude the Issues as the Claimants request\", and that \"the [Application to Strike] is belated and no cogent reason has been advanced to explain the delay.\" The Claimants have not cogently explained what exceptional circumstances would now warrant the admission of new evidence supposedly responsive to issues that the Tribunal had refused to strike from the record over nine months ago. Further and in any event, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not identified the documents they intend to produce with sufficient specificity. For instance, they have not identified the date of the excel spreadsheet or the author of the map. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to determine if the documents to be introduced would contain relevant and material information.\n\nv. \"Information about Location\" for individual land plots within the Construction land in Zones A, B and C\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nContrary to its rulings above, in this case the Tribunal is of the opinion that the applicable requirements (\u00a7\u00a720-21) are met. Although the Claimants could have made an effort to obtain these documents at an earlier date, the Tribunal would be assisted by having access to these documents, which might contain relevant information. The Respondent does not appear to contest as much.\n\n**III. REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they requested certain documents related to the expropriation of land plots owned by BD Agro used for the construction of the \"Sremska gazela\" road (the \"Expropriation Documents\") from the relevant Serbian authorities. These requests were rejected on factually and legally incorrect bases. For instance, the Serbian Tax Authority rejected the Claimants\u2019 requests without furnishing explanations as required by the Serbian Freedom of Public Interest Information Act. Further, the Claimants\u2019 endeavors to obtain the documents directly from the Respondent were \"immediately rebuffed.\"\n\n31.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal is \"fully entitled\" to order the Respondent to produce documents that are subject to the Claimants\u2019 requests before the Serbian authorities, or to order the Respondent to assist the Claimants in obtaining these documents.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal should deny this Request as the Expropriation Documents are neither relevant nor material. They would not have a significant impact on the case. The Claimants\u2019 allegation that the entire bankruptcy sale was conducted to benefit Agrounija is irrelevant to their claims in this arbitration. Further, a bankruptcy sale and an expropriation are two entirely different processes. The Claimants have not explained how any relevant inferences can be drawn from the former in this arbitration. Moreover, it is not clear that any of the land plots referred to in the Claimants\u2019 requests have actually been expropriated as the Claimants contend. In addition, the Claimants could have pursued their requests to obtain the Expropriation Documents before the relevant Serbian authorities but chose not to do so. Instead, they waited six months before bringing this Request. Finally, so says the Respondent, the requested documents are confidential.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent also explains that it did not \"immediately rebuff\u2019 the Claimants\u2019 attempt to seek assistance from the Respondent in procuring the Expropriation Documents. It merely objected to the Claimants\u2019 expectation that it would review the request and accompanying documentation and make its decision within a day. In any event, after due consideration, the Respondent opposed the Claimants\u2019 request for assistance.\n\n**C. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants seek the Tribunal\u2019s assistance in obtaining the Expropriation Documents. The Tribunal has broad powers in evidentiary matters allowing it to order the production of evidence from a Party. Paragraph 17.5 of PO 1 provides in this respect:\n\n\"The Tribunal may call upon the Parties to produce documents or other evidence in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2).\"\n\n35.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2) in turn provides:\n\n\"(2) The Tribunal may, if it deems it necessary at any stage of the proceeding:\n\n(a) call upon the parties to produce documents, witnesses and experts.\"\n\n36.\n\nIn addition, the IBA Rules for the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, to which the Tribunal may turn for guidance, provides:\n\n\"[The Tribunal] may (i) request any Party to produce Documents, (ii) request any Party to use its best efforts to take or (iii) itself take, any step that it considers appropriate to obtain Documents from any person or organisation.\"4\n\nArticle 3(10) of the IBA Rules for the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal can thus direct a Party to produce evidence if it deems it necessary. It can also direct a Party to use its best efforts and provide assistance in acquiring evidence.\n\n38.\n\nOn reviewing the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to grant the Claimants\u2019 request. While the Expropriation Documents might show the difference between the price for which Agrounija acquired BD Agro and the amount it received for the expropriated land (potentially supporting the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the entire bankruptcy sale was conducted for Agrounij a\u2019s benefit), it remains that the Claimants have not substantiated the link between this aspect and the alleged violations of the BITs. Further, the Claimants have not clearly established that the land plots referred to in their requests to the competent Serbian authorities have actually been expropriated.5 Finally, it appears that the Claimants could have pursued the remedies mentioned in the Law on Freedom of Information to procure the documents in question. Rather than doing so, they chose to wait for several months before raising this request with the Tribunal.\n\nResponse, \u00a738.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants also request the Tribunal to order Serbia to provide \"assistance necessary\" to allow the Claimants to obtain the Expropriation Documents. The Tribunal denies this request for the reasons just mentioned.\n\n**IV. REQUEST FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants submit that on 22 October 2020, a new criminal investigation was initiated by the Serbian authorities against Mr. Djura Obradovi\u0107, the former nominal owner of BD Agro and a witness in this arbitration (the \"New Investigation\"). This Investigation \"directly threatens the integrity of this arbitration and aggravates the dispute\" because the Respondent is using it for questioning Mr. Obradovi\u0107 on issues that are relevant for the Respondent\u2019s defenses in this arbitration and irrelevant to the stated purpose of the Investigation. In the circumstances, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to:\n\n\"a. Take all appropriate measures to end or, alternatively, suspend until the end of this arbitration the New Investigation.\n\nb. Refrain from using, in the arbitration proceedings, any information, material or documents obtained in the framework of the New Investigation and/or other criminal proceedings against the Claimants and/or their witnesses, which have not been admitted into the record prior to 15 January 2021, other than for the purposes of its argument on the Claimants\u2019 request for preliminary measures.\n\nc. Refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration, or engaging in any other course of action which may jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\n\nd. Refrain from taking any further measures of intimidation against the Claimants and their witnesses and to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may aggravate the dispute between the Parties, including any steps which might threaten the procedural integrity of the arbitral process, or aggravate or exacerbate the dispute between the Parties.\"6\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening Presentation, Slide 3.\n\n41.\n\nFor the Claimants, the timing of the New Investigation \"could not be more telling.\" Indeed, the New Investigation relates to certain transactions between BD Agro, Crveni Signal ad Beograd (\"Crveni Signal\") and Inex Nova Varos AD (\"Inex\") involving a RSD 221 million loan (approximately USD 2 million) that took place in 2010, over ten years ago. Neither the Privatization Agency, nor any other Serbian authority has ever claimed that these transactions were criminal in any way, until the Respondent chose to allege their illegality in this arbitration. In addition, the New Investigation started only a few months after the trial court acquitted Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and all other defendants of all charges raised against them in a frivolous criminal case related to a land swap agreement concluded between BD Agro and Serbia in January 2010 (the \"Land Swap Case\"), on which the Respondent heavily relies in this arbitration.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the subject matter of the New Investigation is suspicious as well. In the course of the New Investigation, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was questioned on issues including the privatization of BD Agro, investments into BD Agro, their financing, and his agreements with the investors. These topics have no relevance for the alleged illegality of BD Agro\u2019s transactions with Crveni Signal and Inex, but they do form the content of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional defenses in this arbitration.\n\n43.\n\nThese factors, so say the Claimants, are indicative of the fact that the New Investigation is \"yet another attempt by Serbia to intimidate the Claimants and their witnesses.\" After all, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 is one of the Claimants\u2019 key witnesses in this arbitration. Also relevant is that the Order commencing the New Investigation (the \"Order Commencing the New Investigation\") expressly mentions the need to interview Mr. Igor Marki\u0107evi\u0107, the former General Manager of BD Agro, who is another witness in this arbitration. This is surprising as Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 had no role in any of the transactions at issue in the New Investigation. He began to work in Mr. William Rand\u2019s Serbian companies only in 2012, two years after the impugned transactions. For the Claimants, \"[i]t is difficult to see any valid reason for the prosecution\u2019s decision\u2014other than its continuing effort to intimidate Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107.\"\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the New Investigation threatens the integrity of this arbitration \"because it intimidates the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and serves as an excuse for Serbia to question any person and gather any documents located in Serbia that may be relevant for this arbitration.\" For them, the Respondent is using the New Investigation as a mean to gather information and documents related to this arbitration that it would not be able to get in any other manner. Moreover, the New Investigation threatens the participation of Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107, and potentially other witnesses and Serbian experts put forward by the Claimants. They point out that \"persons investigated by Serbia, or persons afraid of a possibility of such investigation, will hardly feel free to participate in this arbitration and freely testify before the Tribunal knowing that their testimonies might be used by Serbia for their prosecution.\"\n\n45.\n\nIn particular, they contend that \"(i) the New Investigation relates to events directly relevant for this arbitration that have been extensively pleaded by the Parties; (ii) Serbia initiated the New Investigation to support its arguments in this arbitration and to further intimidate the Claimants and their witnesses; and (iii) Serbia\u2019s previous conduct confirms that it is willing to misuse its sovereign powers to gather material for its submissions in this arbitration.\"\n\n46.\n\nOn item (i), the Claimants point out that the New Investigation is based on the claim that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 \"abused his position and authorizations, with the intent of obtaining the unlawful material benefit for himself and for others\" by participating in or instructing others regarding transactions on which the Respondent \"heavily relies\" in its submissions. The Serbian authorities in charge of the New Investigation also rely on several documents that have been submitted in this proceeding to question Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107, who are key witnesses in this arbitration. In fact, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 has been questioned not only about the allegedly illegal transactions, but also about specific agreements between him and people who provided him with funds invested in Serbia. This issue, namely the relationship between Mr. Rand and Mr. Obradovi\u0107, is one of the principal topics in these proceedings. Similarly, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was questioned about his ownership of BD Agro and about the date when BD Agro concluded a guarantee agreement securing a loan taken by Crveni Signal, issues which are also pertinent to the present dispute. It is thus clear that the New Investigation mirrors key elements of Serbia\u2019s defense in the arbitration.\n\n47.\n\nOn item (ii), the Claimants stress that, despite being aware of the impugned transactions for over ten years, the Respondent initiated an official investigation only on 22 October 2020, four months after the trial court acquitted Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and all other defendants in the Land Swap Case, a case on which Serbia relied heavily on its previous submissions in this arbitration Realizing that this \"key argument\" of its case had fallen apart, \"Serbia rushed to initiate the New Investigation in an attempt to find any support at all for its baseless allegations against Mr. Obradovi\u0107.\" Indeed, even though the New Investigation was only launched at the end of October 2020, the Respondent has already managed to interview Mr. Obradovi\u0107 twice, with \"remarkable speed.\" The prosecutor also organized an interview with Mr. Milan Majstorovic, another suspect in the New Investigation and a current director of Crveni Signal. The Order Commencing the New Investigation announced that the prosecutor would question Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, despite the fact that he was not a director of Crveni Signal or any other company involved in the New Investigation during the time period on which the New Investigation focuses. The Order does not include the names of any other potential witness other than Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, who is also a witness in this arbitration. The only conclusion that can be drawn for the Claimants is that Serbia commenced the New Investigation to support its arguments in this arbitration and to intimidate the Claimants and their witnesses.\n\n48.\n\nOn item (iii), the Claimants argue that \"Serbia has repeatedly demonstrated that it is willing to misuse its sovereign powers to intimidate the Claimants and their witnesses, as well as to gather material for its submissions in this arbitration.\" This is evident, so say the Claimants, from the following facts:\n\ni. On 8 July 2019, the Serbian Police interviewed Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 about the matters related to this arbitration. For the Claimants, the interview \"was conducted in a manner carefully designed to intimidate Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107.\" The police asked Mr. Markicevic several irrelevant questions including the relationship between Mr. Rand and Mr. Obradovi\u0107. They also asked him inappropriate questions about his hometown and family home. They refused to document the interview as required under Serbian law. They alluded to the fact that Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 would be meeting with the Claimants\u2019 counsel right after the interview, which was true and not disclosed by Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 to the police.\n\nii. This harassment continued when on 9 August 2019, the police called Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 demanding that he produce the documents mentioned during their initial interview of 8 July 2019, despite the fact that no official demand had been made for these documents. Further, the police ignored the fact that Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 engaged an attorney to represent him in his communications with the Police, as well as the fact that Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107\u2019s attorney had already informed the Police that no documents would be provided without an official request.\n\niii. On Sunday 11 August 2019, at 4:15 pm, a uniformed Police officer visited Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 in his private apartment in Belgrade, where he lived with his wife and young son. The officer delivered a summons for an interview scheduled less than 24 hours later, on Monday 12 August 2019 at 9:00 am. The Police officer made sure that Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107\u2019s neighbors could hear that he was being summoned for an investigation of a serious economic crime. The Claimants allege that \"[t]his was yet another clear example of Serbia\u2019s campaign to intimidate and harass Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107. There was certainly no justifiable need for the Police to deliver the summons in person and on a Sunday afternoon rather than simply mail it to Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 or his lawyer sufficiently in advance of the interview.\"\n\niv. On 12 August 2019, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 arrived at the interview together with Mr. Cveji\u0107 and Mr. Nenad Stankovi\u0107, the Claimants\u2019 lead Serbian counsel in this arbitration. The Police officers yet again asked Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 why he had not delivered the requested documents, even though there still was no official request. They threatened Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 with criminal charges for not doing so. After he signed the official minutes of the interview, the conversation once again turned to matters related to the present arbitration. For example, the inspectors noted that the prosecutor\u2019s office asked them to perform an investigation of several cases in which the names of Mr. Obradovi\u0107, Crveni Signal, BD Agro, PIK Pester, Maple Leaf Investments and MDH Serbia were mentioned. Most of these entities are relevant to the present arbitration. The officers also again questioned Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 about the relationship between Mr. Rand, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and BD Agro. Finally, the officers asked whether they could receive information about all the investments that Mr. Rand had made in Serbia, as well as information about Mr. Rand\u2019s personal presence in Serbia. At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that the inspectors would come to the premises of Crveni Signal to collect the requested documents on 14 August 2019.\n\nv. On that date, when the inspectors arrived at the offices of Crveni Signal, they again asked questions related to the present arbitration. For example, they inquired whether Messrs. Rand and Broshko, as the owners of MDH Serbia and Maple Leaf Investments, were coming to Serbia.\n\nvi. On 3 September 2019, Serbian Police contacted Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and asked him to attend an interview in order to discuss \"certain questions related to BD Agro and provide documents related to BD Agro.\" The interview took place on the next day, and revolved around issues related to BD Agro and Mr. Rand, i.e. issues directly relevant for this arbitration. The Police asked Mr. Obradovi\u0107 how he met Mr. Rand, about his agreement with Mr. Rand that he would become a nominal owner of BD Agro and how he financed the purchase of BD Agro. All these issues have been discussed in detail in these proceedings.\n\nvii. In February 2018, six months after the submission of the Notice of Dispute, the Respondent indicted Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in relation to an assignment and sale of land of BD Agro that took place between 2006 and 2007 (the \"Land Sale Case\"). In January 2020, the scope of that investigation was extended to cover issues relevant to the present arbitration. The Claimants are unaware of whether and how the investigation has proceeded in 2020.\n\nviii. On 22 October 2020, the Serbian authorities initiated the New Investigation, a few months after Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s acquittal in the Land Swap case. The Serbian authorities also announced their intention to interview Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, despite the fact that he was not a director of Crveni Signal or any other company involved in the New Investigation during the time period on which the New Investigation focuses.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants are of the view that all the usual criteria for granting provisional measures are satisfied for the following reasons.\n\ni. *Prima facie* jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n50.\n\nFor the Claimants, this requirement is clearly met. Canada, Cyprus and Serbia are signatories of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants are nationals of either Canada or Cyprus. The Tribunal therefore has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione personae.* Further, the dispute concerns breaches of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Canada-Serbia BIT and Cyprus-Serbia BIT. The Tribunal therefore has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. Further still, it is undisputed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. As far as the Canada-Serbia BIT is concerned, the direct expropriation of BD Agro\u2019s shares occurred on 21 October 2015, several months after the entry into force of that BIT. Furthermore, the Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration on 14 February 2018, within the three-year time limit provided in this Treaty for initiating arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal therefore has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione temporis* as well. Finally, under the facts alleged by the Claimants, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* over the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\nii. *Prima facie* case on the merits\n------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants consider that this requirement too is clearly satisfied: \"the Claimants have, at minimum, made serious claims that *prima facie* fall within the competence of the Tribunal. Indeed, the Parties have submitted more than 1,600 pages of written briefs, 20 witness statements, 25 expert reports, 1,555 exhibits and 373 legal authorities.\"\n\niii. Necessity\n--------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants submit that investment tribunals have repeatedly confirmed that provisional measures may be ordered to preserve the Parties\u2019 rights, including the general right to the preservation of the status quo and to the non-aggravation of the dispute. Provisional measures have also been granted to preserve the procedural integrity of ICSID proceedings, in particular the access to and integrity of evidence. The only requirement imposed is that the rights sought to be protected by provisional measures must be related to the dispute. For the reasons already mentioned, this criterion is clearly fulfilled in this case.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants further assert that the measures which they seek are necessary because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 is being investigated and Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 will almost surely be questioned by Serbian prosecutors with respect to the very same issues about which they are supposed to testify in this arbitration. Their testimonies in this arbitration will be affected by the knowledge that the Serbian authorities may use their statements before the Tribunal in other proceedings. In the absence of the requested measures, Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107 would not \"feel free\" to openly testify in this arbitration. Other witnesses and experts in this arbitration, especially those who live in Serbia, may feel the same way.\n\n54.\n\nYet another reason why the measures sought are necessary, so say the Claimants, is that the Respondent may restrict Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from traveling abroad for the hearing. The Respondent has already done so on a previous occasion when it withheld Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s passport in connection with the Land Swap Case thus preventing him from international travel.\n\n55.\n\nStill another reason showing the necessity of the requested measures, according to the Claimants, is that Serbia will use the New Investigation to gather information and documents that it could then use in this arbitration. The Serbian Police and prosecutors and the team representing Serbia here have \"an open communication channel.\" There is a significant overlap between the documents on which the prosecutor relies in the New Investigation and the documents which are on the record of this arbitration. Additionally, if the measures are not granted, the Claimants will have to divert their resources from the preparation of the forthcoming hearing on the merits to deal with issues arising out of the interviews of Mr. Obradovi\u0107, future interviews of Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, as well as potential seizure of documents related to this arbitration and derivative evidence arising therefrom.\n\niv. Urgency\n-----------\n\n56.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, this requirement is established. Indeed, the measures requested are necessary to prevent the aggravation of the dispute and to safeguard the procedural integrity of this arbitration. As such, they are urgent \"by definition\" and cannot await the rendering of an award on the merits.\n\nv. Proportionality\n------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this condition is also fulfilled. The preliminary relief which they seek will not interfere with the Respondent\u2019s right to conduct criminal investigations and prosecution. Rather, they are intended to ensure that no such investigation or prosecution is conducted in a manner that would interfere with this arbitration. The Respondent will be able to continue its investigation without limitations after the conclusion of this arbitration if it still so wishes at that time. Having waited over ten years to commence the New Investigation, it is difficult to see how the Respondent would be harmed by postponing it until the arbitration is completed.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 application is \"illogical\" as they are complaining about actions undertaken three years after the present arbitration was initiated, almost a year after the last submissions and evidence were filed and after two hearing postponements. Further, all the criminal proceedings mentioned in the Request had been ongoing for years before this arbitration was initiated. According to the Respondent, \"[i]f anyone intended to intimidate Claimants\u2019 witnesses and misuse the Police to gather additional information and documents, he/she would not wait until now when it is obviously too late - witnesses already gave their multiple written witness statements and were about to give their oral testimonies twice (in March and in October), while any further submission of documents is restricted by the requirement of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\" Serbia further emphasizes that the Claimants were the ones who sought to introduce new evidence into the record, not the Respondent. The Respondent could have filed materials gathered through the New Investigation along with its earlier written submissions but did not do so. It does not intend to submit any new evidence now either. In fact, it was only after the Request for Provisional Measures that Respondent\u2019s counsel found out about the developments in the New Investigation.\n\n59.\n\nFor Serbia, \"the Request is an obvious abuse of rights and an attempt to aggravate the dispute and smear Respondent on the eve of the Hearing.\" The Respondent highlights that provisional measures are exceptional measures which should only be granted in the most necessary and urgent situations. Provisional measures interfering with a State\u2019s sovereign right to prosecute criminal acts within its territory are even more extraordinary. The Respondent thus requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\"(i) Dismiss Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures dated 15 January 2021 in its entirety; and\n\n(ii) Order Claimants to reimburse Respondent for all its costs associated with the Application, including interest, as well as the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.\"\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there is nothing new about the New Investigation. In fact, in this arbitration, Serbia has just repeated the arguments that the Privatization Agency had initially made in 2011. In October 2014, the Privatization Agency informed the Serbian police about the breach of the Privatization Agreement due to BD Agro\u2019s loans to Crveni Signal and Inex. The New Investigation was thus not triggered by this arbitration, but by the facts disclosed by the Privatization Agency.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 position that it has waited over ten years to commence the New Investigation. It points out that the Privatization Agreement was terminated in October 2015, after several extensions were given to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to cure the breach of Article 5.3.4 of that agreement and to return the RSD 221 million loan forming the subject matter of the New Investigation. The criminal aspect of the loan was thus more likely to be prosecuted only after late 2015, and not since 2010. In fact, as the Order Commencing the New Investigation shows, the criminal acts of which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 is suspected occurred in the period from June 2010 to October 2015.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent equally disputes the Claimants\u2019 assertion that Serbia initiated the New Investigation to support its case in this arbitration. Soon after the termination of the Privatization Agreement on 1 October 2015, Mr. Radoje Gomilanovic was registered as the president of the Board of Directors of BD Agro. Mr. Gomilanovic had reason to believe that the previous CEO of BD Agro, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, along with the management of Crveni Signal had committed serious criminal acts during their tenure. Therefore, on 2 June 2016, Mr. Gomilanovic filed a criminal complaint with the First Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and asked the authorities to investigate, *inter alia,* the use of the RSD 221 million loan for the benefit of Crveni Signal. Thus, the criminal prosecution of this matter was at the behest of a private individual, not a state official. Moreover, it was suggested three years before this arbitration started. Based on Mr. Gomilanovic\u2019s criminal complaint, the First Public Prosecutor submitted a request for collection of information to the Police Authority on 24 June 2016. According to the Serbian Code of Criminal Procedure, this marked the initiation of criminal prosecution, *i.e.* the pre-investigation of the alleged criminal acts. All of these acts took place almost two years before the notice of dispute in this arbitration. The New Investigation is thus merely a continuation of the earlier proceedings.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent further remarks that the fact that the New Investigation is a continuation of earlier proceedings is also evident from the fact that when submitting the specific criminal complaint with respect to the RSD 221 million loan in August 2020, the Serbian Police explicitly referred to the First Public Prosecutor\u2019s case from 2016, initiated by the criminal complaint of Mr. Gomilanovic. Moreover, when interviewing Mr. Obradovi\u0107 on 4 September 2019, the police referred to that same case from 2016 and there is evidence that the police was investigating this same transaction through interviews in other cases that were ongoing since 2014.\n\n64.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 assertion that the New Investigation is aimed directly at issues and individuals at the heart of this arbitration is incorrect. Most of the individuals mentioned in the New Investigation are not involved in this arbitration in any capacity. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 is only one out of four suspects and Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 is only named as a witness. Further, while Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 was named as the prime suspect in the criminal complaint that lead to the opening of the New Investigation, the pre-investigation ultimately excluded him as an accused, with Messrs. Obradovi\u0107, Jovanovic and Obucina being included as suspects. According to the Respondent, \"[t]his again demonstrates that the prosecutorial authorities acted in good faith, and that they ultimately accused only the persons for which they objectively found sufficient ground for doing so.\"\n\n65.\n\nSerbia contends that the Claimants\u2019 insinuation that the prosecutor harassed Mr. Obradovi\u0107 by conducting two interviews in the span of a month is misplaced. The first interview was interrupted at the request of Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s attorney, who had to leave because of another commitment. The second interview was merely the continuation of the first one and made to finish it relatively soon.\n\n66.\n\nAll other allegations of harassment or intimidation are equally denied by the Respondent. In this context, the Respondent recalls that:\n\ni. In his interview on 10 November 2014, which occurred much before this arbitration commenced, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 did not mention that he was acting as a proxy for Mr. Rand or anyone else. He stated that he was the owner of BD Agro, that he personally made the investments in question, that he personally gave the shareholder loans at issue, and that he personally made relevant business decisions for BD Agro. He made other statements that were aligned with the position the Respondent later took in this arbitration, including that he was the majority owner who made investments and gave out shareholder loans to BD Agro, and that he attempted to transfer the ownership over the company to Coropi in 2013.\n\nii. In his next interview of 4 September 2019, a year and a half after this arbitration had commenced, Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s testimony changed. For the first time, he mentioned the alleged beneficial ownership arrangement between him and Mr. Rand to the investigative authorities. His statements were aligned with the Claimants\u2019 case in the arbitration, not the Respondent\u2019s.\n\niii. In his two interviews in 2020, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was questioned about his relationship with Mr. Rand because in his previous interview of September 2019, he himself raised the issue of financing from abroad and the beneficial ownership arrangement with Mr. Rand. This issue was not previously discussed, as Mr. Obradovi\u0107 always represented that he was the majority owner and investor in BD Agro. For the Respondent, \"even if there was actually a question from the public prosecutor in this regard, such question would be completely expected. If a person accused of serious financial crimes suddenly starts speaking about having an undisclosed and unclear financial arrangement that provided him with multimillion dollar financing from abroad with respect to the companies that are being investigated, that person will likely be asked to further explain these facts.\" Serbia further points out that the record of the interview shows that the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding the source of financing followed up on Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s bringing up the subject.\n\niv. It is also notable \u2013 so says the Respondent \u2013 that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 has not alleged any misconduct by the Serbian authorities during his interviews. He has only stated that he felt \"uncomfortable\", \"which is an expected reaction of any person being questioned about a criminal act in the capacity of a suspect.\" In fact, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 has testified that the police officer that conducted the interview seemed quite courteous.\n\nv. As far as Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 is concerned, the Respondent stresses that the Order Commencing the New Investigation states that the period of the criminal acts in question is from 1 June 2010 until 1 October 2015. As Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 was the CEO of both BD Agro and Crveni Signal from 2012 to 2015, \"his statements seem quite relevant for determining the full factual state of the case.\" Further, while it is true that the funds from the RSD 221 million loan were misused between 2010-2011, the outstanding obligations towards BD Agro were not settled for the following four years, which includes the period when Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 was the CEO of both companies. According to Serbia, \"as Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 managed both of these companies at the time when the pertinent intercompany loans were unsettled, it would be very strange not to have at least an interview with him in order to find out whether he possesses any knowledge of these events.\" Finally, the lack of any bad faith on the part of the Serbian authorities is evident from the fact that the Order starting the New Investigation excluded Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 as a suspect, although the initial criminal complaint submitted in 2016 was directed against him as the prime suspect.\n\nvi. Further, for the Respondent, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107\u2019s allegations of intimidation are unsustainable. On an earlier occasion in this arbitration, he intentionally misrepresented the police\u2019s request for relevant documentation of Crveni Signal as an \"intimidating interview\", although no such interview took place. What he called an interview was merely his visit to the police station on his own initiative and his refusal to deliver relevant documents. Further, when the police asked him to schedule an appropriate time for the inspection of documents of Crveni Signal, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 stated that he was busy as he had scheduled meetings with Mr. Rand\u2019s lawyers. Therefore, the Claimants\u2019 accusation that the police was listening to the communications between Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 and Claimants\u2019 counsel is absurd. Finally, so the Respondent, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 never filed any complaint or other proceedings against the police officers when allegedly harassed or eavesdropped on him. In reality, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 has not behaved like someone who is intimidated or fearful when investigated in other cases, and even avoided summonses from the authorities.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent denies that any events aggravating the dispute have occurred that would warrant the measures sought by the Claimant. The only events that occurred are Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s acquittal in the Land Swap Case and the criminal pre-investigation initiated in 2016 proceeding to an investigation. The first event confirms that there is no organized campaign against Mr. Obradovi\u0107. There is nothing extraordinary in the second event either as it is a continuation of proceedings commenced before Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s acquittal and before the arbitration. Advancing from a pre-investigation to an investigation often takes several years, as is evident from the timeline of the Land Swap Case.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent equally challenged the Claimants\u2019 assertion that the scope of the Land Sale Case was wrongly expanded to include the question of whether the disposal of the land exceeded the permissible limits under Article 5.3.3 of the Privatization Agreement. First, that provision is not the subject matter of the present arbitration. Second, there is nothing strange in how this \"addition\" to the investigation occurred. It was a judicial authority in Serbia that, having reviewed the indictment and the response to the indictment, ordered the public prosecutor to supplement the investigation in order to clarify the factual situation. In any event, there is nothing new about the Land Sale Case either; criminal complaints against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in that respect were filed in 2009.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimants\u2019 view that all the criteria for granting provisional measures are met in this case. It points out that an \"exceptionally high\" threshold is to be met to order the measures requested, and that the Claimants have failed to fulfil their burden of proof in this respect.\n\ni. *Prima facie* jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 position that this requirement is met. It contends that the Claimants never owned nor controlled the investments on which they base their claim. The Request for Provisional Measures confirms this \"as it shows Claimants\u2019 desperation because none of them has been identified as a person making decisions in BD Agro (instead, it was Mr. Obradovi\u0107), although the prosecutorial authorities have been investigating BD Agro for years.\" Even if the Claimants\u2019 position that they were the beneficial owners of BD Agro were true, \"it would obviously be a deceptive arrangement which was not disclosed to the Privatization Agency due to bad faith motives.\" In the circumstances, the Claimants have not made out their case that this Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction.\n\nii. *Prima facie* case on the merits\n------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 case has \"no chance\" to succeed on the merits. The Claimants have \"failed utterly\" to establish that the Privatization Agreement was terminated unlawfully. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was a \"negligent buyer\" who was eventually unable to cure the breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement for more than four years.\n\niii. Necessity\n--------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 submission that the measures sought are necessary to prevent intimidation or harassment of the Claimants or their witnesses or to prevent the collection of evidence for use in this arbitration. It also disputes that the measures are required to prevent the aggravation of the dispute.\n\n73.\n\nFor the reasons already mentioned, no case of intimidation of witnesses has been made out and none could be made: Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107 have already given multiple statements in this arbitration none of which have been used by the police or prosecutors in proceedings against these individuals. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 is only being investigated, and it is uncertain whether he will be indicted at all. Further, had he feared being prosecuted by the Serbian authorities for acting as a witness, he would have withheld his testimony much earlier instead of giving three statements supporting the Claimants\u2019 case. In fact, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was arrested for a high-profile crime in 2015 and criminal proceedings were initiated against him before the arbitration started. In one of those cases, he was acquitted in the court of first instance after he had filed his last witness statement in this arbitration. Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s involvement in the arbitration did not harm him in that criminal proceeding. The same applies to Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107. He was allegedly \"harassed\" by the police in 2019, but still gave a witness statement in favor of the Claimants in March 2020. Finally, there is no evidence that the testimony of these individuals will be affected by the New Investigation. Nor is there reason to believe that they would be prevented from giving their oral testimony at the Hearing.\n\n74.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is similarly evident that the Claimants\u2019 theory of intimidation is baseless from the fact that Mr. Rand is not involved in any of the numerous criminal proceedings concerning the RSD 221 million loan. This demonstrates that \"(i) the authorities found no evidence that BD Agro was owned and controlled by anyone other than Mr. Obradovi\u0107 himself; and (ii) assertions of Claimants and their witnesses from this arbitration have not been used to initiate or aggravate any criminal proceedings whatsoever, even though they could legitimately give sufficient cause for serious suspicions.\"\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 assertion that the Respondent is using the criminal proceedings to collect evidence for the present arbitration \"is equally meritless.\" At the present time, the Respondent sees no need to file new evidence. If that changes (which is highly unlikely), the Respondent will seek the Tribunal\u2019s permission. The Claimants would then have an opportunity to comment and the Tribunal would decide on a case-by-case basis.\n\n76.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that it is highly improbable that the Claimants\u2019 witnesses would not attend the hearing and that their absence would actually affect the position of the Respondent, who would not be able to cross-examine the witnesses.\n\niv. Urgency\n-----------\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent challenges that this requirement is met. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was already questioned in 2014 about the acts forming the subject matter of the New Investigation. Both he and Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 were questioned again in 2019 on the same matters in the pre-investigation proceedings. A year and a half has passed since and the Claimants and their witnesses suffered no damage. Further, the New Investigation mentions Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 only as a witness. There is no indication that his testimony will cause him any harm.\n\n78.\n\nFinally, Serbia does not intend to submit new evidence from any criminal proceedings in this arbitration, which means that there is neither a need nor any urgency for directions in that regard.\n\nv. Proportionality\n------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the requested measures would affect it disproportionately. Indeed, if the measures were granted, the Tribunal would be interfering with Serbia\u2019s sovereign right to exercise criminal jurisdiction in its own territory. In addition, the measures would be unworkable according to the Serbian Constitution and relevant laws, as the State Attorney\u2019s Office, which represents the Respondent in this arbitration, cannot interfere in criminal cases. The statute of limitations would also run. On the other hand, the Claimants would incur no harm if the measures were not granted. After all, the Claimants have no connection with the New Investigation or any other investigation known to the Respondent. Moreover, the Claimants\u2019 witnesses have already testified and there is no indication that their future oral testimony would result in negative consequences in the criminal proceedings, especially when their existing written witness testimonies did not have such effect.\n\n80.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the requested measures are overly broad. Indeed, the direction that the Respondent refrain from using any material or documents obtained in the framework of the New Investigation or other criminal proceedings is premature as the Respondent has not made such an attempt. Neither does it intend to do so. Further, it is unclear why the Respondent should be prevented from using materials from \"other criminal proceedings\" as the Request focuses solely on the New Investigation. Similarly, the Claimants request the Tribunal to \"refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration\", which is overly broad, especially in circumstances where the Claimants have no information about any other relevant pending proceedings.\n\n**C. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**1. Framework**\n----------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s powers in matter of provisional measures arise out of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n82.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n83.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads as follows, in relevant part:\n\n\"(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\" [...]\n\n84.\n\nThese provisions thus grant a level of discretion to the Tribunal when it comes to the issuance of provisional measures. Unless the disputing parties \"otherwise agree\", the Tribunal may recommend provisional measures \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\" in order \"to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n85.\n\nThe Canada-Serbia BIT also provides that the Tribunal has the power to order interim measures. Article 35(1) provides in this respect:\n\n\"A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party or to ensure that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 21. For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.\"\n\n86.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that provisional measures can only be granted if the following conditions are fulfilled:7\n\ni. *Prima facie* jurisdiction;\n\nii. Likelihood of success on the merits;\n\niii. Necessity;\n\niv. Urgency; and\n\nv. Proportionality.\n\nRequest, \u00a7108; Response \u00a781.\n\n87.\n\nFinally, it is undisputed that the Party seeking provisional measures bears the burden of establishing these conditions, which are cumulative, *i.e.* the Claimants must establish that all of them are met.\n\n**2. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n88.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal emphasizes that this decision is made on the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of the record as it presently stands. Nothing contained herein shall pre-empt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law. Further, the Tribunal\u2019s decision could be revisited if relevant circumstances were to change.\n\n89.\n\nAs a further preliminary comment, the Tribunal recalls that the Claimants have mentioned the subject-matter of the present Request for Provisional Measures at earlier stages of this arbitration:\n\ni. On 11 July 2019, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to remind the Respondent of its obligations not to exacerbate the dispute and not to jeopardize the integrity of the present proceedings, including by using the Serbian investigative authorities to (i) intimidate the Claimants and their witnesses; (ii) question the Claimants\u2019 representatives and their witnesses about factual issues relevant to the arbitration; and/or (iii) keep track of the meetings of the Claimants\u2019 representatives and witnesses with counsel. The Claimants did not request any other relief, but reserved their right to do so;\n\nii. On 22 July 2019, the Respondent objected to the Claimants\u2019 request and set out its position on the underlying facts;\n\niii. On 25 July 2019, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it \"trust[ed] that they [would] refrain from taking actions contrary to their ongoing duty of good faith not to aggravate the dispute and not to affect the integrity of the arbitration\";\n\niv. In October 2019, in their Reply, the Claimants summarized the Respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct and \"continued efforts to threaten the Claimants and their witnesses.\" They also invited the Respondent to explain why the Serbian authorities had suddenly started to investigate matters that were over ten years old, but without seeking provisional measures.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants now request provisional measures directing Serbia to (i) terminate or suspend the New Investigation; (ii) refrain from using in this arbitration any material obtained through the New Investigation and/or other criminal proceedings against the Claimants and/or their witnesses; (iii) refrain from initiating any other criminal proceeding directly related to the present arbitration or engaging in \"any other course of action\" that would jeopardize the integrity of this arbitration; and (iv) refrain from taking measures that would intimidate the Claimants or their witnesses.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a State has a sovereign right to investigate allegedly criminal conduct occurring within its territory. The pendency of an international arbitration does not shield a claimant from State investigation into alleged breaches of that State\u2019s criminal law. At the same time, however, a State\u2019s power to conduct criminal investigations must be exercised in good faith. As observed by the tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia* :\n\n\"Bolivia has the sovereign power to prosecute conduct that may constitute a crime on its own territory, if it has sufficient elements justifying prosecution. Bolivia also has the power to investigate whether Claimants have made their investments in Bolivia in accordance with Bolivian law and to present evidence in that respect. But such powers must be exercised in good faith and respecting Claimants\u2019 rights, including their *prima facie* right to pursue this arbitration.\"8\n\nExh. CLA-174, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00a7123.\n\n92.\n\nOther tribunals have held that an order that restricts the investigation or prosecution of suspected criminal conduct should only be ordered if it is \"absolutely\" necessary.9 Still others have found that only specific circumstances warrant provisional measures aiming at preventing or discontinuing criminal proceedings initiated by the State, such as where the criminal proceedings impair a claimant\u2019s right to present its case10 or where the State\u2019s conduct amounts to \"abusive behavior [to be] able to exert such a chilling effect on the Claimants\u2019 witnesses [...] so as to prevent them from testifying against the Respondent.\"11\n\nSee, for instance, *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures of 3 March 2016, \u00a73.16.\n\nExh. CLA-174, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, \u00a7142.\n\nExh. RLA-131, *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, \u00a787.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants insist that the facts and circumstances of this case justify the provisional measures which they seek. They argue that if the requested measures are not granted (i) their witnesses will be intimidated at the hearing or altogether prevented from testifying; and (ii) the Respondent may seek to introduce material obtained through the New Investigation and/or other criminal proceedings into this arbitration. In support of their Request for Provisional Measures, they point principally to three acts of the Serbian authorities since their Reply: (i) the Order Commencing the New Investigation of October 2020; (ii) Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s interviews with the Serbian authorities in November and December 2020; and (iii) potential future interview(s) of Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 and possibly Mr. Obradovi\u0107.12\n\nThe Claimants stated at the hearing that they were not basing their Request on the order expanding the scope of the Land Sale Case. See Tr. 43:25-44:3 (\"[W]e do not claim to justify the requested preliminary measures by the fact that in January 2020 the land investigation was expanded.\").\n\n94.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s assessment, the Claimants have not sufficiently established the facts on which they rely:\n\ni. They have not cogently established that the Respondent commenced the New Investigation to intimidate or harass the Claimants or their witnesses:\n\na. The Serbian authorities began examining the issues mentioned in the New Investigation in 2016 prompted by Mr. Gomilanovic\u2019s criminal complaint filed in June of that year.13 This was well before the Claimants commenced this arbitration in 2019. As a consequence of their enquiries, including interviews with Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107 in 2019, the Serbian police submitted a criminal complaint against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in August 2020,14 after which the prosecutor directed the commencement of the New Investigation in October 2020. In other words, the criminal investigation initiated through Mr. Gomilanovic\u2019s complaint evolved in such a manner that it resulted in the New Investigation. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot follow the Claimants\u2019 argument that Serbia commenced the New Investigation as a result of Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s acquittal in the Land Swap Case. The Serbian authorities were already investigating the facts underlying the New Investigation prior to that acquittal. While one may question why it took the Serbian authorities four years after Mr. Gomilanovic\u2019s complaint to formally commence an investigation in October 2020, the Claimants do not dispute the Respondent\u2019s representation that this is the normal time taken for such investigations in Serbia. The time frame of the Land Swap Case seems to confirm this duration: the prosecution commenced in 2009 but the police submitted a criminal complaint only five years later in 2014;\n\nb. The New Investigation is not centered on Mr. Obradovi\u0107, who is only one out of four suspects, and Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 is not named as a suspect, only as a witness. This seems in line with the fact that the New Investigation covers acts from June 2010 until October 2015 when Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 was the CEO of both BD Agro and Crveni Signal from 2012 to 2015. In fact, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 was initially named as a suspect in the New Investigation but was later summoned as a witness. This change too speaks against the New Investigation being used to harass the Claimants\u2019 witnesses as it is alleged;\n\nc. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 has not complained of any misconduct by the Serbian police during his interviews in November and December 2020. He only stated that he felt \"uncomfortable\" during his interview in 2019, which is not surprising for someone who is being subject to a criminal investigation. While Mr. Markicevic has stated that he did feel intimidated when interrogated in 2019, there is no evidence besides his own statement to support this conclusion. Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 has filed no complaint or other proceedings against the police officers who allegedly harassed him, which one could expect knowing that he had retained a criminal lawyer to assist him before the Serbian police and had past experiences with Serbian investigative authorities. Further, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107\u2019s last witness statement was filed in March 2020, *i.e.,* after he was allegedly intimidated by the police in 2019, meaning that the alleged intimidation did not prevent him from giving evidence in this arbitration. It is also noteworthy that he raised no such concern in his last witness statement. Considering these facts, there appears to be no reason to fear that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 or Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 would be prevented from testifying at the hearing;\n\nii. Similarly, there is no indication in the record that the Claimants\u2019 witnesses would feel pressured when testifying at the hearing and that their oral evidence may thus be unduly influenced, unless the requested measures are granted. Neither Mr. Obradovi\u0107 nor Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 have stated that they are fearful of giving testimony at the forthcoming hearing in this arbitration. No other witness has done so either. Further, none of the witnesses have indicated that they wish to modify or withdraw their testimonies in this arbitration;\n\niii. Even if the Claimants\u2019 allegations of witness intimidation or interference were proven correct, *quod non,* the applicable procedural rules would adequately safeguard the Claimants\u2019 rights:\n\na. As provided in PO 1, a written witness statement stands as direct testimony (\u00a719.2). Direct examination at the hearing is thus to be limited to introductory questions and addressing matters that have arisen after a witness\u2019 last statement. The primary purpose of a witness\u2019 presence at the hearing is to provide an opportunity for the opposing party to cross-examine him/her. If the Claimants\u2019 witnesses were prevented from appearing at the hearing, this would primarily be detrimental to Serbia as it would be deprived from testing the veracity of these witnesses\u2019 fact statements;\n\nb. Assuming that the Respondent was nevertheless impeding the appearance of Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107, under the applicable procedural rules, the Tribunal would be authorized to consider their witness statements as they would have a valid reason for not appearing (\u00a719.13 of PO 1). In this instance too, the Tribunal could give due weight to these witnesses\u2019 evidence;\n\niv. The Respondent has not sought to introduce into the record any materials obtained through the New Investigation and/or other criminal proceedings. To the contrary, it has indicated that it does not need or intend to do so as it \"has all the evidence that it needs.\"15 Moreover, should the Respondent nevertheless wish to file new documents, it would have to make an application to that effect, following the requirements of paragraph 17.4 of PO 1. The Claimants could then draw the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the fact that the new documents were obtained through the New Investigation and/or other criminal proceedings. If this were so, the Tribunal could then refuse the new documents. At this stage, this is a hypothetical scenario that could never arise.\n\nExh. RE-669. In June 2016, the prosecutor submitted a request for collection of information to the Serbian police (Exh. RE-671).\n\nExh. RE-671.\n\nResponse, \u00a7\u00a774, 115.\n\n95.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the requested measures are neither necessary nor urgent. This conclusion suffices to deny the Request as the conditions for provisional remedies are cumulative. As a consequence, the Tribunal can dispense with reviewing the other requirements.\n\n96.\n\nWhile the conditions to grant interim relief are not satisfied, it is true that the Tribunal remains concerned about the overlap between the matters presently being investigated in Serbia and those before the Tribunal. This concern is compounded by the pace of the investigation. While it took four years between Mr. Gomilanovic\u2019s criminal complaint and the police\u2019s complaint in August 2020, from the time of the formal commencement of the New Investigation in October 2020, the Serbian authorities moved swiftly, interviewing Mr. Obradovi\u0107 twice: once on 17 November 2020, only 26 days after the commencement of the New Investigation, and again on 22 December 2020.16 Against this background, the Tribunal restates that it expects the Parties to refrain from taking actions that, contrary to their ongoing duty of good faith, could aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration.\n\nEven if the second interview was a continuation of the first as was stated (Response, \u00a736), it remains that it was scheduled rather promptly.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n97.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, considering the present state of the record, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Denies the Claimants\u2019 request to admit the \"Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s Reports\", \"[d]ocuments related to the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land announced in December 2020\", \"[l]ist of land plots owned by Serbia in the cadastral area of Dobanovci\" and \"[m]ap of certain land plots identified in Ms. Ilic\u2019s Second Expert Report\";\n\n(ii) Grants the Claimants\u2019 request to admit the documents containing \"\"Information about Location\" for individual land plots within the Construction land in Zones A, B, and C in Dobanovci.\" The Claimants should file these documents with appropriate exhibit numbers by **19 March 2021**. By **2 April 2021**, the Respondent may comment on the documents if it so wishes;\n\n(iii) Denies the Claimants\u2019 request to order the Respondent to produce the Expropriation Documents or to provide assistance necessary to allow the Claimants to obtain these documents;\n\n(iv) Denies the Claimants\u2019 request for the provisional measures reproduced at paragraph 40 above;\n\n(v) Reserves costs for a later decision."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2023-06-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Marcelo G. Kohen", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Marcelo G. Kohen\n--------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nWhile agreeing with some parts of the analysis in the Award, I disagree with others that I consider of fundamental importance. Hence my need to append this dissenting opinion. My major disagreement concerns some legal issues, and also the manner to approach some factual elements of the case.\n\n**A. Everything that is not explicitly prohibited in a treaty is not necessarily permitted**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, *i.e.* looking at the means to interpret the applicable law (the BIT Canada/Serbia, the ICSID Convention and relevant general international law, as well as Serbian Law, no matter whether it is considered a normative \"fact\" or applicable law on its own), the principal points of divergence with the majority are the questions of how to address conduct by investors not in accordance with the law, the identification of the \"real\" investor, and the origin of the capital invested. As to these three issues, the Award considers that, since there are no specific requirements contained in the ICSID Convention and in the BIT, then the issues of the legality of the investment in accordance with domestic law, and of the origin of the investment to determine who the investor is, are irrelevant. I strongly disagree.\n\n3.\n\nIt is not possible to justify a given conduct just because it is not expressly regulated in the relevant instrument. In the case at issue, one could also invoke the opposite: that the ICSID Convention and the BIT do not offer protection to illegal investments. The question indeed is one of treaty interpretation. If their text does not explicitly address the issue either way, but the treaties clearly relate to the question at issue, a good faith interpretation requires considering the object and purpose of the instruments concerned. I can hardly imagine the parties to a BIT or to the ICSID Convention having accepted the protection of investments made in disregard of their domestic legislations. *Ex injuria jus non oritur*. If there is a presumption, it is rather in favour of the requirement of legality, not of the acceptance of illegality. Whether the domestic legislation is in accordance with international law is another question. Nothing precludes the Tribunal from taking the domestic requirements into account at the time of its decision if they do not contradict international law. The promotion of foreign investment cannot be pursued at any cost.\n\n4.\n\nThe fact that other BITs expressly include the requirement that the investment be made in accordance with domestic law and that the Canada/Serbia BIT does not, is not an argument to admit *a contrario* transactions disregarding the domestic law, as the Award does. The reason for the explicit inclusion of this requirement in some treaties is rather simple. Due to some unfortunate decisions by arbitral tribunals, the parties to investment treaties have been increasingly obliged to explicitly include rules or conditions going against those wrong arbitral decisions, or incorporating such rules *ex abundante cautela*, to prevent arbitrators from taking the liberty to make original and extensive interpretations, often against the will of the contracting parties.\n\n**B. An investment made in disregard of legal requirements is not protected**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Award, referring to prior decisions, considers that only the violation of \"fundamental rules of law\" can be taken into consideration. Apparently, foreign investors have the privilege of having to respect only \"fundamental rules of law\" whereas other investors are required to abide by the entire legal system. This creates an undue advantage against other investors. Again, the promotion of foreign investment cannot be pursued at any cost. Fortunately, up till now, no one has used the same argument claiming the same treatment to be applicable to State parties to investment treaties, *i.e.* only \"fundamental\" breaches of their international obligations could be taken into account.\n\n**C. Is the investment made by a foreign or a national investor?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nI also disagree with another *a contrario* reasoning followed in the Award. It consists of considering that, since the BIT does not require that the host State know the foreign nature of the investment, whether Serbia knew that Mr. Rand owned or controlled BD Agro was irrelevant.1 However, a basic legal reasoning imposes that, in order to protect a foreign investment on the basis of the obligations accepted by a State in a BIT, the State must know with whom it is dealing. Furthermore, in the instant case, if everything would be legal (the \"MDH Agreement\", the \"Lundin Agreement\", the \"Sembi Agreement\", the money transfers, etc), and if Mr. Rand wanted to be protected by the Canada/Serbia BIT, nothing would have prevented him from informing the Privatization Agency that he was the real owner of the shares in BD Agro. He chose not to do it.\n\nAward, paragraph 248.\n\n7.\n\nThis case concerns the privatization of BD Agro. According to the applicable law, only Serbian nationals could bid a proposal to pay in instalments.2 The bidder was Mr. Obradovi\u0107, a Serbian national. Mr. Rand claims to be the real person participating and winning the bid through Mr. Obradovi\u0107's instalments' bid. Or rather, to be the winner through a complicated combination of different companies and friends which, behind them, was Mr. Rand himself.\n\nArticle 39(1) of the Decree on the Sale of Capital and Assets by Public Auction (52/2005), **RE-218**\n\n8.\n\nThe Award considers that this kind of conduct is not a problem. In other words, one of the purposes of the privatization legislation, which is to facilitate nationals participating in the privatization policy through the advantage of paying in installments, can simply be bypassed by foreigners just by making a citizen appear as the owner even if he is not so. This manner to perceive things deprives national legislation of any relevance. Nevertheless, assuming that only \"fundamental\" breaches of domestic law should be taken into account, for me, concealing the real owner in order to obtain and advantage in a public auction or encumbering 20% of the value of the privatized company, can be considered as such. The \"MDH Agreement\", the \"Sembi Agreement\", the \"Lundin Agreement\" and the \"Coropi Agreement\" aimed at circumventing the legal conditions. Their aim was contrary to the legal requirement for the privatization of BD Agro and, as a result, they are not opposable to the Respondent.\n\n**D. Mr. Rand did not prove his alleged ownership or control of BD Agro**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nFurthermore, the different agreements on the basis of which Mr. Rand intends to prove that he is the real majority owner of BD Agro are, in my view, not enough to meet the required standard of proof. The \"MDH Agreement\" is a declaration of intention in case Mr. Obradovi\u0107 won the auction. It does not prove that after Mr. Obradovi\u0107 won the auction, the MDH Agreement was implemented. The \"Lundin Agreement\" of 2008 rather proves the opposite: it mentions that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 acquired the 70% of BD Agro through a loan from the Lundin Family (not from Mr. Rand) and that Sembi was willing \"to acquire all the interest in BD Agro from Mr. Obradovi\u0107\". It adds that \"Mr Rand (\u2026) guarantee[s] the obligations of the Purchaser (Sembi) to the Lundin Family\".3\n\n**CE-28**\n\n10.\n\nThe Award mentions other facts that would allegedly prove that Mr. Rand \"was the one bearing the financial burden of the investment\". Leaving aside the question whether bearing the financial burden of an investment automatically transforms the person concerned into an \"investor\", I consider that those facts are not conclusive.4 For instance:\n\n\u25cf The e-mail from Mr. Ljubisa Jovanovi\u0107 (Assistant Minister of Economy) to Mr. Rand congratulating him the same day the public auction occurred cannot be considered an official act of the State since it clearly was an irregular manner to notify the outcome of the auction. This is a personal message (\"Dear Bill\") and not the legal manner one can expect a process of privatization to be conducted. It just proves that Mr. Rand had important political contacts in Serbia. Furthermore, the process of privatization was conducted by an organ that was not part of or was not subordinated to the Ministry of Economy and was not considered by the Award as being even an organ of the State.5 It can be mentioned that Mr. Jovanovi\u0107 later became CEO of BD Agro.6\n\n\u25cf The email of 18 December 2013 mentioning that Mr. Rand \"is a majority owner of PD BD Agro\" is an email *from the President of the Council for Economy of the Serbian Progressive Party* to the Minister of Economy, requesting a meeting between a representative of Mr. Rand and the Minister.7 This email and the fact that a meeting occurred cannot in and of themselves prove Mr. Rand's ownership or control of BD Agro.\n\n\u25cf The fact that Mr. Rand was a member of the Board of BD Agro during a given period of time does not in and of itself prove ownership or control either. Mr. Lundin was also a member of BD Agro's Management Board. If one follows the Award, he could also be considered the owner or controller of BD Agro.\n\n\u25cf Payment by Mr. Rand of EUR 2.2 million to Willjill Farms Inc8: the evidence does not prove that these transfers were for the benefit of BD Agro, and even if they were, in what capacity the payments were made.\n\n\u25cf Contacts between Mr. Rand and BD Agro's Management Board: they undoubtedly prove a relationship between Mr. Rand and those in charge of the management of the company, but this does not say a word about the nature of the relationship.\n\nCf. in particular paragraph 238 of the Award\n\nAward, paragraph 484\n\n**CE-429**\n\n**CE-769**\n\n**CE-21**\n\n11.\n\nThe relationship between Mr. Rand and Mr. Obradovi\u0107, the owner of the majority of the shares in BD Agro, is of particular importance. It is full of unclear situations. There is no evidence of any direct transfer of money made by Mr. Rand to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 or to BD Agro, there is no evidence of any payment made by Mr. Rand to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for his services, let alone the payment of salaries by BD Agro to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in his quality of President and General Manager. The only \"evidence\" advanced to prove Mr. Rand's ownership via the payments to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for his services, was that Mr. Rand paid Mr. Obradovi\u0107's daughter's tuition or helped him buy a house.9 One can expect that, in the 21st century, remuneration for services is not made in such a manner.\n\nAward, paragraph 379\n\n12.\n\nThe majority easily comes to the conclusion that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 \"worked for Mr. Rand based on a success fee payable if and when Mr. Rand's investments became profitable\".10 Leaving aside the fact that this is a rather strange arrangement for someone to work on a daily basis in the management of a company and to expect to receive money at unpredictable times, there is no concrete evidence of this arrangement, except for the testimony of the interested individuals.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n13.\n\nEqually, the Award easily explains transactions made by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 on behalf of BD Agro, *i.e*. the land assignment transaction or the loans to Inex and Crveni Signal, unbeknownst to Mr. Rand.11 These were very important transactions that could not have been performed without the approval of an owner.\n\nAward, paragraph 244\n\n14.\n\nIn order to prove ownership or control, the question of the instructions given by Mr, Rand regarding the management of the company was discussed. The majority contents itself with the explanation by Mr. Rand that he gave \"oral instructions\" to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and that, for this reason, there is no written evidence of such instructions.12 This is not a credible manner to manage an industrial enterprise. However, it is accepted, as an example of a written instruction, an alleged e-mail of 10 April 2013 \"confirm[ing] our discussions of this morning that a BD Agro board meeting will be held at the offices of Crveni Signal\"13. Even if this could demonstrate that Mr. Rand gave some instructions to Mr. Obradovi\u0107, this e-mail, in itself, would not be enough to prove that the owner or controller of BD Agro was Mr. Rand.\n\nAward, paragraph 246\n\n**CE-428**\n\n15.\n\nThe Award also takes into account informal data while disregarding the regular communications from BD Agro to the Ministry of Economy and the Privatization Agency. For instance, the letters from BD Agro of 6 October 2014 and 6 November 2014 and from Mr. Rand himself to the Ministry of 18 September 2014 clearly mention that Mr. Rand \"expressed serious interest in taking over the majority shareholding in BD Agro\". The letters further mention that \"Mr. Rand has, with no security, financially supported BD Agro a.d. Dobanovci with the amount of around 500,000 euros\".14 This evidence rather shows that Mr. Rand is not presented as the owner or controller.\n\n**CE-320**\n\n16.\n\nThe contrast with the formal evidence is blatant. The latter tends to prove the opposite of what the Award accepts. In particular, the letter sent by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to the Privatization Agency on 10 September 2015 proves that Mr. Rand is not the owner or controller of the majority shares of BD Agro. On the contrary, it mentions:\n\n\"Precondition for successful implementation of the PRPP is financial support to the business operations of BD Agro from an interested investor, without which the adopted PRPP simply cannot be implemented. As you know, reputable Canadian investor, Mr. William Rand, expressed on several occasions his willingness and interest in providing necessary financial support for the recovery of BD Agro through one of its companies (Corob Holdings Ltd). Representatives of Mr. Rand and BD Agro had several meetings on this topic with the representatives of the Agency and, in August 2013, a request was submitted for assignation of the Agreement to the company, but the Agency, to this date, has not made a decision regarding that request.\n\nHowever, a precondition for Mr. Rand (as well as for any other serious investor) to invest money in BD Agro is 1) completion of the BD Agro privatization procedure and 2) deletion of pledge on shares. These are minimal security conditions that every serious investor will need in order to invest money in BD Agro.\"15\n\n**CE-48**\n\n17.\n\nCertainly, the evidence above shows Mr. Rand's involvement, but not as the owner or controller of BD Agro. While it is clear that Mr. Rand was not the official owner of BD Agro, the notion of \"beneficial ownership\" was introduced. I am not convinced that this term of art, coined in the field of international tax treaties to avoid fiscal evasion, can be so easily transposed to the field of foreign investment law. Much of the evidence which the Award relies upon is found in Mr. Rand's and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's own testimonies. This is particularly the case with regard to the origin of the funds involved. The fact is that there is no direct and conclusive evidence that the investment was performed with Mr. Rand's funds.\n\n**E. The origin of the funds is relevant**\n------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nI also disagree with the idea that the origin of the capital is irrelevant or that the only thing that counts is \"the economic reality of the contribution\" and not \"the formal arrangements\".16 In times in which States and the international community are making all efforts to avoid money laundering and fiscal fraud, when even for minor transactions the explanation of the origin of the money is required at all levels, to affirm that that requirement does not exist in investment arbitration, is not only regrettable, but also legally contrary to the object and purpose of the investment treaties concerned. The promotion of foreign investment to favour economic development requires clarity and normality of transactions. Investment arbitration cannot be the last area in economic relations in which the origin of the funds invested are of no relevance.\n\nAward, paragraph 237\n\n**F. The \"Sembi Agreement\" could not have created interest in BD Agro in favour of Mr. Rand and opposable to Serbia**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Award attributes to the \"Sembi Agreement\" the capacity of creating an \"interest\" in the Privatization Agreement in favour of Mr. Rand.17 This interest would be protected by the Canada/Serbia BIT. While the Privatization Agreement was a contract concluded between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and the Privatization Agency in Serbia to deal with the privatization of a Serbian company in Serbian territory, the \"Sembi Agreement\" was a private contract between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi, who chose Cypriot Law to govern their relations. This is simply not opposable to Serbia. The question is not, as Serbia claimed, a matter of invalidity of that Agreement, but one of non-opposability. In other words, a Cypriot contract cannot produce effect in Serbia if it was concluded in Cyprus to circumvent the impossibility of being subject to Serbian law (Art. 41 (\u017e) of the Privatization Law). At the most, if Mr. Rand has a claim based on the Cypriot transaction of the Sembi Agreement, this claim must be addressed to Mr. Obradovi\u0107, not to Serbia.\n\nAward, paragraph 314 and ff.\n\n20.\n\nThe Award plays with the difference between the \"transfer of the shares\" and the transfer of \"interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares\".18 This is a cavalier manner to circumvent the legal obligation in the 2006 Securities Law, which prohibits the sale of shares in a public joint stock company outside the organized share market.19 The argument is that there was not a transfer of ownership, only a transfer of the \"interests\". Article 1 (h) of the Canada/Serbia BIT requires that the \"interest\" must be acquired through the commitment of capital in Serbia. It is deeply troublesome that Mr. Rand was unable to prove with concrete evidence the manner in which his money ended up in BD Agro. All the evidence furnished is indirect: personal testimonies and contracts (the \"Agreements\") mentioning that this was done. Not a single bank transfer including the specific and appropriate indication of the sender and the beneficiary and the reason for it - which is the normal manner in which these important amounts of money must be transferred-, was filed as evidence to prove that Mr. Rand transferred money to BD Agro.\n\nAward, paragraph 315\n\n**RE-111**, 2006 Law on Market in Securities and Other Financial Instruments, Art. 52(2).\n\n**G. Mr. Rand's concealment does not allow BIT protection**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nI have great difficulty accepting the rationale of the Claimant's recital. For the majority, the fact that Mr. Rand acted behind Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and obtained an advantage that he, as a Canadian national, could not have benefited from, \"do[es] not meet the high threshold set for an abuse, especially in circumstances where Mr. Rand advanced good reasons for involving M. Obradovi\u0107\".20 According to Mr. Rand,\n\n\"the reasons for the split of nominal and beneficial ownership of BD Agro was flexibility and convenience. As a nominal owner, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was able to handle matters generated by ownership of my Serbian companies, such as attending and voting at the general meetings and communication with the Serbian Government and third parties, more efficiently than if he had been a mere representative acting on the basis of formal powers of attorney.\"21\n\nAward, paragraph 396\n\n**CWS-3**, Rand, paragraph 38\n\n22.\n\nIt is very difficult to accept these \"good reasons\". It is not clear at all why doing things correctly (with Mr. Obradovi\u0107 acting as Mr. Rand's representative) would constitute a problem for the attendance of meetings and to vote, or to have contacts with the Government or other parties. Even assuming that the alleged manner of proceeding would be \"more efficient\", *quod non*, efficiency cannot be achieved by concealing reality or bypassing duties.\n\n23.\n\nFinally, I would add that the non-disclosure of Mr. Rand's allegedly complicated combinations in relation to the privatization of BD Agro goes against the letter and the spirit of the Privatization Law. Its Article 2 mentions the *principle of transparency* as one of the basis for the process of privatization. The disclosure of the alleged \"reality\" of ownership would have been a required and elementary part of the transparency of such process. Transparency is not only required from the State. It plays both ways. This is particularly true in a public bid process . Accepting the conduct that the Award considers acceptable is tantamount to accepting that other actual or potential tenders who respected the conditions for the bid were placed in an unfair and unequal situation.\n\n**H. The Termination of the Privatization Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nGiven the entire context of the transactions and actions relating to BD Agro, I consider that the decision to terminate the Privatization Agreement was legal. The Award focuses on the fact that the Privatization Agreement allowed such termination, on the basis of a breach of its Article 5.3.4, only during the duration of the agreement.22 The Termination Decision mentioned other alleged breaches than that of Article 5.3.4 and also indicated that when rendering the stated Decision, the Commission also took into consideration actions of the Buyer in regards to the alienation of the fixed assets of the Subject, collection of payment for sold fixed assets of the Subject and spending of collected funds for the needs of the Subject, alienation and encumbering of fixed assets which are the subject of performance of the investment obligation of the Buyer and investment \"in the value of sold fixed assets which are the subject of performance of investment obligation of the Buyer (202,245 EUR)\".23\n\nThere is a question whether the Privatization Agreement really ended on 8 April 2011. The Buyer had not complied with his obligations before and after, the parties to it were exchanging communications about this situation thereafter and I have not seen any argument by the Buyer during these protracted negotiations, in which he requested and obtained many new deadlines for compliance with his obligations, according to which the Privatization Agreement has come to an end. Furthermore, if there was a breach of Art. 5.3.4, it was of a *continuous* character, whether the Agreement ended or not.\n\n**CE-50**\n\n25.\n\nAnother important element that deserves mentioning is the fact that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 did not challenge the termination of the Agreement. The first challenge to it was made in this arbitration and by the Claimants.\n\n26.\n\nWhether the Privatization Agency breached the Privatization Agreement by not removing the pledge is irrelevant, it would be a matter between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and the Privatization Agency. Even if it were contrary to the Privatization Agreement, the Privatization Agency could have invoked either *inadimpleti non est adimplendum* and/or the Privatization Law.\n\n**I. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n27.\n\nn the whole, I consider that Mr. Rand has not proven that he was the owner or the beneficial owner of the 70% shares of BD Agro that were purchased by Mr. Obradovi\u0107. The correspondence *between Mr. Rand and BD Agro* rather shows that he was acting as though he was not the owner or \"beneficial owner\". Besides what was mentioned above, I can also refer, as an example, to the letter of 7 May 2015: *\"Expression of interest to continue providing financial support to BD Agro a.d. Dobanovci*\".24 The correspondence between BD Agro and the Privatization Agency concerning the assignment of the Agreement to Coropi mentioned above rather shows that Mr. Rand was not the owner or \"beneficial owner\" of the shares purchased by Mr. Obradovi\u0107. It shows the interest of Mr. Rand to invest in BD Agro thereafter. The first time that BD Agro mentioned the name of Mr. Rand to the Privatization Agency was a letter of 2 July 2015, which mentions that Coropi is \"owned by the Canadian investor William Rand\".25 The letter mentions \"the interest and readiness of the Canadian investor to invest in the consolidation and further development of BD AGRO AD, if the issue of ownership was resolved within reasonable time and the conditions were created to complete the privatization of the company\".26\n\n**CE-350**\n\n**CE-46**\n\nIbid.\n\n28.\n\nThe record shows that the Ombudsman, the Privatization Agency, and the Ministry acted in a manner that can be considered as the normal way of proceeding by each of these organs. Nothing proves that there was a State's concerted collusion in order to deprive Mr. Obradovi\u0107, or the allegedly concealed owner Mr. Rand, of his property. On the contrary, it shows the Ombudsman performing his independent role with regard to the Privatization Agency and the Ministry of Finance and Economy, at the request of BO Agra's employees. It must be recalled that one third of the shares were owned by the employees of BO Agro. The record shows the Ministry disagreeing with the Privatization Agency, and the Ombudsman criticizing both in relation to the privatization of BO Agro.27 The record also shows that the Privatization Agency warned Mr. Obradovi\u0107 about noncompliance with the Privatization Agreement many times and that the owner did not challenge this alleged noncompliance. It also shows that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was granted many deadlines to overcome his noncompliance.\n\n**CE-42, CE-45, CE-88, CE-115**\n\n29.\n\nFor all these reasons, I cannot subscribe to the decision rendered in the Award to which this dissenting opinion is appended.\n\n26 June 2023"}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations**\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [2006] |\n| Azrac WS I | Witness Statement of Aksel Azrac dated 16 January 2019 |\n| BD Agro | BD Agro AD |\n| Brku\u0161anin ER I | Expert Report of Bojana Tomi\u0107 Brku\u0161anin dated 3 October 2019 |\n| Broshko WS I | Witness Statement of Erinn Broshko dated 5 February 2018 |\n| Broshko WS II | Second Witness Statement of Erinn Broshko dated 16 January 2019 |\n| Broshko WS III | Third Witness Statement of Erinn Broshko date 3 October 2019 |\n| Broshko WS IV | Fourth Witness Statement of Erinn Broshko date 5 March 2020 |\n| Canada-Serbia BIT | Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 27 April 2015 |\n| Claimants | Rand Investments Ltd., William Archibald Rand, Kathleen Elizabeth Rand, Allison Ruth Rand, Robert Harry Leander Rand, and Sembi Investment Limited |\n| C-Mem. | Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial with Request for Bifurcation dated 19 April 2019 |\n| Coropi | Coropi Holdings Limited |\n| Cowan ER I | Expert Report of Sandy Cowan dated 19 April 2019 |\n| Cowan ER II | Second Expert Report of Mr. Sandy Cowan dated 24 January 2020 |\n| Cowan ER III | Third Expert Report of Mr. Sandy Cowan dated 16 March 2020 |\n| C-PHB 1 | Claimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief dated 27 September 2021 |\n| C-PHB 2 | Claimants\u2019 Second Post Hearing Brief dated 22 October 2021 |\n| Cvetkovic WS I | Witness Statement of Vladislav Cvetkovic dated 4 April 2019 |\n| Exh.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe following summary is meant to give a general overview of the factual background of the dispute as alleged by the Parties. The facts referred to are not necessarily regarded as established; where they are disputed and relevant, they are discussed in the analysis. The summary is limited to the milestones that the Tribunal considers most useful to understand the merits of this dispute. Other facts may be referred to as part of the analysis if and when appropriate.\n\n**A. BD Agro**\n--------------\n\n6.\n\nBD Agro AD (\"BD Agro\") is a dairy farm located on the outskirts of Belgrade, Serbia, close to the Belgrade International Airport.1\n\nReply, \u00a730.\n\n7.\n\nIn 1989, it was transformed from a state-owned producers\u2019 cooperative into a \"socially-owned\" company under State control.2\n\nMem., \u00a7\u00a759-60.\n\n**B. The Privatization of BD Agro**\n-----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nIn 2005, BD Agro was sought to be privatized with 70% of its shares (the \"Privatized Shares\") put up for auction by the Privatization Agency (the \"Privatization Agency\" or the \"Agency\"). The remaining 30% of BD Agro shares were owned by a large number of small shareholders, mainly BD Agro\u2019s employees.\n\n**C. The MDH Agreement**\n------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 19 September 2005, in view of the impending public auction of BD Agro\u2019s shares, Marine Drive Holdings Inc., a company held in majority by Mr. Rand and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (\"MDH\") and Mr. Obradovi\u0107 entered into a written agreement concerning BD Agro (the \"MDH Agreement\").3 Under the terms of that agreement, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 would take part in BD Agro\u2019s public auction, and, if successful, he would become the owner of the Privatized Shares.4 The Agreement further specified that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 would hold the shares at the risk of MDH and that MDH would have a call option to purchase the Privatized Shares, as well as any shares in BD Agro subsequently acquired by Mr. Obradovi\u0107, for a nominal price of EUR 1,000.5\n\nExh. CE-15, Share Purchase Agreement, 19 September 2005.\n\nIbid., Art. 3\n\nIbid., Art. 1.\n\n**D. The Privatization Agreement**\n----------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 4 October 2005, following a public auction, Mr. Obradovi\u0107, as Buyer*\"*, and the Privatization Agency entered into a Privatization Agreement (the \"Privatization Agreement\").6 Under the terms of that agreement, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 purchased 70% of the socially owned capital of BD Agro for EUR 5,548,996.46 to be paid in six annual instalments.7 Mr. Obradovi\u0107 also committed to invest in BD Agro an additional amount of approximately EUR 2 million within the following year.8\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005.\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005, Arts. 1.2 and 1.3.\n\nExh. CE-50, Notice on Termination of the Privatization Agreement, Art. 5.2.1 as amended on 9 January 2006, Exh. CE-110, Amendment I to the Privatization Agreement, 9 January 2006. It is not disputed that the Agency, on 10 October 2006, confirmed that such additional investment had been made, see Exh. CE-18, Confirmation of the Privatization Agency of the Completion of Investment, 10 October 2006; Mem., \u00a778 and Rej., \u00a7\u00a7389-390. However, the Respondent argues in this arbitration that Mr. Obradovi\u0107, at the time, \"misrepresented\" financial information and that, in reality, \"there have been no 'investments' paid by any of the other affiliated companies of Mr. Obradovi\u0107, nor any such payments from Mr. Rand and his affiliated companies\", Rej., \u00a7\u00a7388-389.\n\n11.\n\nThe Privatization Agreement was coupled with a Share Pledge Agreement concluded on the same day between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and the Agency.9 Under the terms of the Share Pledge Agreement, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 pledged the Privatized Shares to the Privatization Agency for a five-year period within which he agreed to pay the full purchase price.10\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005, p. 10.\n\nIbid., Art. 2.\n\n12.\n\nOn 9 January 2006, the Privatization Agreement was amended with the amount of additional investment in BD Agro required under Article 5.2.1 being increased to EUR 1,998,554. Deadlines for making the investments were extended.11\n\nExh. CE-110, Amendment I to the Privatization Agreement, 9 January 2006, Art. 2.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 March 2006, the Privatization Agreement was amended again, requiring the submission to the Privatization Agency of four consecutive bank guarantees: two for EUR 501,153 and another two for EUR 493,123.12\n\nExh. CE-76, Amendment II to the Privatization Agreement, 15 March 2006, Art. 2.\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, BD Agro's General Assembly resolved to increase its capital by issuing an additional 171,974 shares at a nominal value of 1,000 RSD per share, all of which were issued to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 (the \"New Shares\").13 On 25 October 2006, the Serbian Business Register Agency registered this capital increase.14 Accordingly, Mr. Obradovi\u0107's shareholding in BD Agro increased from 70% to 75.87%.\n\nMem., \u00a777.\n\nIbid.\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 January 2012, the Privatization Agency confirmed that \"the buyer, as of April 8, 2011, has settled his obligations in respect of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th installment and thus paid the entire sale and purchase price.\"15\n\nExh. CE-19, Confirmation of the Privatization Agency on the Buyer's full payment of the Purchase Price, 6 January 2012.\n\n**E. The Claimants\u2019 Beneficial Ownership of BD Agro**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the combined effect of the MDH Agreement and the Privatization Agreement was that Mr. Rand became the beneficial owner of 75.87% of BD Agro's shares (the \"Beneficially Owned Shares\", consisting of the \"Privatized Shares\" and the \"New Shares\").\n\n**F. The Claimants\u2019 Indirect Shareholding of BD Agro**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nMr. Rand is the indirect owner of an additional 3.9% shareholding in BD Agro (the \"Indirect Shareholding\") that he holds through his 100% owned Serbian company, Marine Drive Holding d.o.o. (\"MDH Serbia\").16\n\nMDH Serbia is different from MDH. As mentioned above (\u00a79), the latter is a company held in majority by Mr. Rand and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.\n\n**G. The Sembi Agreement**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nMr. Rand allegedly arranged funds for the purchase and subsequent investments in BD Agro from Mr. Rand's long-time business partners, the Lundin family from Geneva, Switzerland (the \"Lundin Family\" or the \"Lundins\") and their investment bank, 1875 Finance S.A.17 At the end of 2007, the Lundin family decided to exit the project and requested repayment of the funds lent to Mr. Obradovi\u0107.18 Mr. Rand decided to replace the Lundins' funds with his own.19\n\nRand WS II, \u00a727, Azrac WS, \u00a712.\n\nAzrac WS, \u00a715.\n\nRand WS I, \u00a730; Rand WS II, \u00a752; Rand WS III, \u00a753.\n\n19.\n\nMr. Rand also decided to change the holding structure of the Beneficially Owned Shares, to include his three children, Ms. Kathleen Rand, Ms. Allison Rand and Mr. Robert Rand.20\n\nRand WS I, \u00a731; Rand WS III, \u00a754.\n\n20.\n\nMr. Rand thus purchased a Cypriot shelf company called Sembi Investment (\"Sembi\") to serve as the new holding company of the Beneficially Owned Shares.21 Sembi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Cyprus. All of the preferred shares issued by Sembi were owned by Rand Investments.22 All of the ordinary shares issued by Sembi were owned by The Ahola Family Trust, a trust domiciled in Guernsey whose beneficiaries are, and have always been, Mr. Rand's three children.23 The Claimants allege that Sembi is, and was at all relevant times, controlled by Mr. Rand.\n\nRand WS III, \u00a754.\n\nExh. CE-6, Certificate of Shareholders of Sembi, 8 June 2017.\n\nIbid.\n\n21.\n\nThe investment structure on the alleged expropriation date of 21 October 2015 was thus:\n\n22.\n\nOn 22 February 2008, Mr. Obradovi\u0107, the Lundin Family, Mr. Rand and Sembi entered into an agreement on the repayment of the Lundins' funds by Sembi, whereby Sembi agreed to repay EUR 9 million to the Lundin Family (the \"Lundin Agreement\").24 The Lundin Family in turn extinguished any claims it had in respect of the Privatization Agreement and BD Agro.25 Mr. Rand personally guaranteed all of Sembi's and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations to the Lundins.26 By October 2010, Sembi had repaid EUR 5.6 million to the Lundins.27 The Lundins waived the outstanding debt.28\n\nExh.

Under the Sembi Agreement, Sembi assumed all of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations, including any payments owing to the Privatization Agency and the repayment of loans provided by the Lundins.29 In consideration, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 agreed to transfer to Sembi \"all of his right, title and interest in and to [the Privatization Agreement]\" and to \"sign any such documents and do all such things as may be necessary to effect the transfer to [Sembi] of the [Privatization Agreement] together with any other assets whatsoever held by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 which are related to BD Agro.\"30 The Sembi Agreement contains a choice of Cypriot law.31\n\nExh.

The Claimants requested that the Tribunal order Serbia to use its best efforts to release Mr. Obradovi\u0107's passport to make his appearance at the hearing in Geneva possible and reserved the right to ask the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against Serbia if Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was prevented from attending the hearing.\n\n112.\n\nOn 11 March 2020, in view of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak, the Respondent requested a postponement of the hearing. On the next day, the Claimants agreed with this request.\n\n113.\n\nOn 12 March 2020, the Tribunal confirmed the postponement of the hearing and invited the Parties to discuss the rescheduling of the hearing and the remaining procedural steps at the PHTC.\n\n114.\n\nAt the PHTC of 16 March 2020 and in subsequent correspondence, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed possible new dates for the hearing.\n\n115.\n\nAlso on 16 March 2020, the Respondent filed its additional submission on quantum (\"Respondent\u2019s Additional Submission on Quantum\"), with exhibits RE-567 to RE-655.81 The pleading was accompanied by the Second Expert Report of Ms. Danijela Ilic of 16 March 2020 (\"Second Ilic Report\") and the Third Expert Report of Mr. Sandy Cowan of 16 March 2020 (\"Third Cowan Report\").\n\nA corrected version of exhibit RE-652 was submitted on 31 March 2020.\n\n116.\n\nFurther communications regarding the potential new hearing dates were received from the Claimants on 18 and 24 March and on 7 April 2020, and from the Respondent on 19, and 24 March and 8 April 2020.\n\n117.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would take place from 28 October to 1 November 2020, with 2 November 2020 held in reserve.\n\n118.\n\nOn 20 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 containing a revised procedural calendar.\n\n119.\n\nOn 29 April 2020, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to strike from the record certain new arguments and new valuations set out in the Respondent\u2019s Additional Submission on Quantum, as well as certain parts of the Second Ilic Report and the Third Cowan Report (the \"Contested Issues and New Valuations\").\n\n120.\n\nOn 4 May 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Meeting Center at the Graduate Institute in Geneva was unavailable during the new hearing dates, that it had contacted other arbitral institutions in Europe to find an alternative venue, and that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague had confirmed availability during the hearing dates. The Tribunal invited the Parties' views regarding this hearing venue as well as on the possibility of holding the hearing virtually.\n\n121.\n\nOn 8 May 2020, the Respondent commented on the Claimants' application of 29 April 2020 regarding the Contested Issues and New Valuations.\n\n122.\n\nBy communications of the same date, the Parties reiterated their strong preference for an in-person hearing, indicating that they had no objection with respect to the PCA as a potential choice. The Parties also expressed concerns regarding the possibility of holding the hearing virtually.\n\n123.\n\nOn 1 June 2020, the Tribunal denied the Claimants' application of 29 April 2020 as it considered, *inter alia,* that both the Contested Issues and New Valuations responded to argument made in the Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n124.\n\nOn 2 June 2020, the President of the Tribunal disclosed, for the sake of transparency, that Dr. Silja Schaffstein, a counsel at L\u00e9vy Kaufmann-Kohler, had been asked to act as legal expert for a party in a commercial arbitration represented by Squire Patton Boggs.\n\n125.\n\nOn 3 June 2020, the Tribunal noted the Parties' reservations regarding the possibility of holding a virtual hearing, informed the Parties of the costs of a potential in-person hearing and the safety measures put in place by the PCA, and indicated its intention to monitor the situation closely and revisit the matter closer to the hearing dates taking into account the prevailing travel restrictions at the time.\n\n126.\n\nAlso on 3 June 2020, the Respondent requested further information regarding the disclosure made on 2 June 2021 by the President of the Tribunal which she provided by the next day. On 5 June 2020, the Respondent objected to the appointment of Dr. Silja Schaffstein by Squire Patton Boggs. On 8 June 2020, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in view of the Respondent's objection, Dr. Schaffstein had refused the proposed assignment as legal expert.\n\n127.\n\nOn 21 August 2020, given the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic and the perspectives for the fall, the Tribunal proposed to the Parties a contingency plan for conducting the hearing virtually, if need be. It also proposed to conduct the hearing in two parts to allow for sufficient time and hold the second part in January 2021.\n\n128.\n\nOn 28 August 2020, the Parties provided their comments regarding the contingency plan proposed by the Tribunal. The Parties emphasized their strong preference for an in-person hearing and their willingness to revisit the matter closer to the hearing dates in light of the then prevailing travel restrictions.\n\n129.\n\nOn 14 September 2020, in accordance with the procedural calendar in Procedural Order No. 7, the Parties proposed a draft Joint Hearing Schedule contemplating an in-person hearing.\n\n130.\n\nOn 24 September 2020, the Government of Canada advised the Tribunal of its intention to exercise its right to attend the hearing in accordance with Article 29.2 of the Serbia-Canada BIT.\n\n131.\n\nOn 27 September 2020, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties noting that the COVID-19 pandemic was worse in some States than it was when it first wrote to the Parties about it. As a result, it remained concerned about the health and safety of the hearing participants, who would be gathered in the same room for long days and would need to travel to the hearing venue, some of them on long haul flights. Further, it could not be ruled out that one or more of the participants would eventually be unable to attend the hearing due to travel restrictions or health reasons, which could jeopardize the hearing and cause a last-minute postponement or require an additional hearing, neither of which would be time or cost efficient. The Tribunal also noted that the draft Joint Hearing Schedule proposed by the Parties would be difficult to put into practice, because the time actually available for the Parties each day (after deducting procedural issues, breaks, and Tribunal questions) was insufficient to complete the examinations as planned.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal proposed to review these matters during the forthcoming PHTC, including discussing the two alternative proposals earlier prepared by the Tribunal to address the uncertainty and risks caused by the pandemic and to accommodate the Parties' proposed draft Joint Hearing Schedule.\n\n133.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, the Tribunal held a PHTC with the Parties.\n\n134.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that, on the basis of the Claimants' request and the Respondent's consent at the PHTC, the hearing was postponed to 12 to 20 July 2021, with Sunday, 18 July 2021 being a day off and Tuesday, 20 July 2021 being a reserve day. On that same date, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Government of Canada of the revised hearing dates.\n\n135.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the potential new in-person hearing was to be held on the premises of the PCA in The Hague. On 22 October 2020, the Claimants inquired about the schedule for the steps preceding the hearing, namely the dates for submission of the hearing schedule and pre-hearing conference call.\n\n136.\n\nOn 3 November 2020, following the Parties' confirmation of their availability for a PHTC on 7 June 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 containing the revised procedural calendar.\n\n137.\n\nOn 15 January 2021, the Claimants submitted a request to file new documents into the record (the \"Request to File New Evidence\") and a request for assistance to obtain certain documents (the \"Request for Assistance\").\n\n138.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimants made a request for provisional measures with respect to a criminal investigation allegedly initiated by the Respondent against Mr. Obradovi\u0107, the former nominal owner of BD Agro and a witness in this arbitration (the \"Request for Provisional Measures\") with factual exhibits CE-901 to CE-902 and legal authorities CLA-174 to CLA-182. They also sought an order from the Tribunal directing the Respondent not to use documents from the criminal investigation in the arbitration, including in the Respondent's submissions on the Request for Provisional Measures, until the Tribunal decided on that request.\n\n139.\n\nOn 19 January 2021, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on these requests. It also instructed the Respondent to label the documents obtained through the criminal proceedings appended to its response, if any, and indicated that its decision regarding the admissibility of such documents would be reserved for a later determination. Finally, the Tribunal invited the Parties to reserve a date for a hearing by videoconference on the Request for Provisional Measures in the event the Tribunal found such a hearing useful after reviewing the Parties' submissions.\n\n140.\n\nOn 26 January 2021, following receipt of the Claimants' communications of 20 and 26 January 2021 and the Respondent's communication of 25 January 2021 regarding their availability for a hearing on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to reserve 16 February 2021 for a hearing by videoconference on the Request for Provisional Measures, for the event that it deemed it helpful after having reviewed the Parties' submissions. The Tribunal also indicated that it would advise after 5 February 2021 whether the hearing on Provisional Measures would take place.\n\n141.\n\nOn 5 February 2021, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimants' Request to File New Evidence and the Request for Assistance, together with Annexes 1 to 15. On that same date, the Respondent also filed its response to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures with factual exhibits RE-656 to RE-673 and legal authorities RLA-201 to RLA-208.\n\n142.\n\nOn 9 February 2021, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal preferred to hear the Parties orally on the Request for Provisional Measures and confirmed that the hearing on Provisional Measures was to take place on 16 February 2021 via Zoom.\n\n143.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that nine documents submitted by the Respondent along with its Response (Exhibits RE-657, RE-658, RE-660-662, RE-667-670) had not been labelled in accordance with the Tribunal's ruling of 19 January 2021. The Claimants also requested leave to file one more document, namely an announcement published by BD Agro's bankruptcy trustee in respect of the sale of BD Agro's land.\n\n144.\n\nOn 9 February 2021, the Tribunal circulated the agenda for the hearing on Provisional Measures. A modified agenda was circulated on 11 February 2021.\n\n145.\n\nAlso on 9 February 2021, the Claimants submitted additional communications regarding the Respondent's responses of 5 February 2021 to the Claimants' Request to File New Evidence and Request for Assistance.\n\n146.\n\nOn 11 February 2021, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants' communications of 9 February 2021 and advised the Parties that it would decide at a later stage on the admissibility of the nine documents submitted by the Respondent with its Response, along with Exhibits RE-671-673. Further, if the Parties intended to refer to the content of these documents at the forthcoming hearing on Provisional Measures, they were requested to advise the Tribunal by 15 February 2021 to allow the Tribunal to give directions in this respect prior to the hearing.\n\n147.\n\nOn 14 February 2021, the Tribunal noted that, in accordance with Section IV of the Transparency Rules of 29 August 2019, the hearing on Provisional Measures was to be made public. It further indicated that the hearing would be video recorded, and the video recording would be streamed on the ICSID website as soon as possible after the conclusion of the hearing.\n\n148.\n\nOn 15 February 2021, the Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 communications of 9 February 2021. The Respondent advised the Tribunal that it intended to rely on the exhibits submitted with its Response in the course of its oral argument at the Hearing and objected to the Claimants\u2019 request for leave to file the public announcement concerning the sale of BD Agro\u2019s land. On the same day, the Tribunal ruled that the Respondent had not mislabelled the nine exhibits as alleged by the Claimants. The Tribunal also confirmed that Exhibits RE-657-658, 660-662, 667-673 were to be part of the record of the arbitration, and that the Parties could rely on those exhibits at the hearing on provisional measures. A further communication on this matter was received from the Claimants on 16 February 2021 stating, *inter alia,* that they did not wish to rely on exhibits CE-901 and CE-902 during the hearing on provisional measures.\n\n149.\n\nOn 16 February 2021, at the Tribunal and the Parties held a hearing on the Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n150.\n\nOn 18 February 2021, the Tribunal provided further instructions to the Parties regarding the corrections to the hearing transcripts and confirmed the publication of the video recordings of the hearing on the ICSID Website. On 25 and 26 February 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreed corrections to the transcripts.\n\n151.\n\nOn 12 March 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 denying the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures. By this same order, the Tribunal granted in part the Request to File New Evidence and denied the request for Assistance to acquire certain documents. On 19 March 2021, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, the Claimants submitted Exhibit CE-903 to the record.\n\n152.\n\nOn 9 April 2021, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to direct the Respondent to produce a valuation report of 28 May 2020 prepared or commissioned by the Serbian Tax Authority relating to certain land plots located in Dobanovci (the \"Request to Produce\"). They also requested the Tribunal to reconsider a part of its rulings in Procedural Order No. 9 (the \"Request for Reconsideration\"). On 12 April 2021, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Request to Produce and the Request for Reconsideration, which Serbia did on 22 April together with Annexes 1 to 8. The Claimants commented on the Respondent\u2019s submission on 24 April 2021, and the Respondent replied on 28 April 2021.\n\n153.\n\nOn 26 April 2021, considering the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer on the way they wished to proceed in relation to the hearing scheduled to take place from 12 to 20 July 2021 (the \"Hearing\").\n\n154.\n\nOn 5 May 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their continued strong preference for an in-person hearing. The Parties also indicated that they were discussing several alternative venues for the hearing in Europe. The Parties proposed to report to the Tribunal about their efforts to find a suitable venue for the Hearing by the end of May 2021.\n\n155.\n\nOn 10 May 2021, the Parties proposed two alternative hearing schedules for an in-person hearing. The Parties further indicated that given the number of witnesses and experts to be cross-examined during the Hearing, the Parties had a strong preference to adopt the first scenario, where Tuesday 20 July 2021 was used for examination of the witnesses rather than kept in reserve.\n\n156.\n\nOn 12 May 2021, the Tribunal noted, *inter alia,* that it remained open to consider the possibility on an in-person hearing if less restrictive rules for travel and gathering were to be implemented in Europe before the hearing and invited the Parties to advise of their efforts to find a suitable venue for the Hearing by 28 May 2021.\n\n157.\n\nOn 21 May 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 denying the Claimants\u2019 Request to Produce and the Request for Reconsideration of 9 April 2021.\n\n158.\n\nOn 29 May 2021, the Parties reaffirmed their strong preference for an in-person hearing in Europe and asked the Tribunal to postpone the decision on the place and format of the hearing until 11 June 2021. The Parties also informed the Tribunal about the witnesses and experts that would need to attend a potential in-person hearing remotely. On 3 June 2021, the Tribunal granted the Parties\u2019 request.\n\n159.\n\nOn 11 June 2021, the Parties indicated that, given the continuously improving situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic all over Europe, it should be possible to hold the July hearing in-person. The Parties also noted, *inter alia,* that The Hague, in The Netherlands, appeared to be a convenient location for the hearing because all hearing participants could be exempt from travel restrictions and quarantine requirements.\n\n160.\n\nOn 17 June 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that in view of their strong preference for an in-person hearing, the improved health situation in Continental Europe, the absence of health risks for all those who were vaccinated, it had decided that the hearing would take place in person on the premises of the PCA in The Hague. On that same day, the Tribunal circulated the draft of a procedural order addressing the organization of the forthcoming hearing for the Parties' comments.\n\n161.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Tribunal invited the Government of Canada to indicate whether it wished to attend the hearing in-person or remotely via Zoom.\n\n162.\n\nOn 22 June 2021, the Tribunal and the Parties held a PHC to discuss the organization of the hearing.\n\n163.\n\nAlso on 22 June 2021, the Government of Canada responded to the Tribunal's invitation of 18 June 2021 indicating that its representatives would attend the hearing via Zoom.\n\n164.\n\nOn 1 July 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 on the organization of the hearing.\n\n**C.

Emilianides\n\n**D. Post-Hearing Phase**\n-------------------------\n\n167.\n\nOn 30 July 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 addressing the post-hearing matters discussed at the hearing including the Parties post-hearing submissions, transcript corrections and cost submissions.\n\n168.\n\nOn 27 August 2021, the Respondent requested leave to submit new documents into the record. On 6 September 2021, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request and offered to produce additional evidence responsive to the Respondent\u2019s request. On 17 September 2021, the Tribunal granted in part the Respondent\u2019s request and invited the Claimants to produce the additional evidence offered in their letter of 6 September 2021. Accordingly, on 20 September 2021, the Respondent filed Exhibits RE-674 to RE-675 and the Claimants filed Exhibits CE-904 to CE-906.\n\n169.\n\nOn 21 September 2021, the Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to introduced five new documents into the record. On 23 September 2021, the Respondent objected to the Claimants\u2019 request.\n\n170.\n\nOn 23 September 2021, the Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to file two further documents into the record stating that the Respondent did not oppose their request. On 24 September 2021, in view of the absence of objection against the Claimants' request of 23 September 2021, the Tribunal admitted the two new documents.\n\n171.\n\nOn 24 September 2021, the Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce a new document into the record and withdrew their request to submit one of the documents identified in their request of 21 September 2021. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide comments on the Claimants\u2019 request of 24 September 2021 and denied the Claimants\u2019 request of 21 September 2021, as amended on 24 September 2021.\n\n172.\n\nStill on the same day, the Respondent confirmed that it did not object to the Claimants\u2019 request of 24 September 2021. It also indicated that, together with its post-hearing brief, it would file additional translations of Exhibits RE-13, RE-18, RE-19 and RE-223.\n\n173.\n\nOn 26 September 2021, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of 24 September 2022, the Claimants filed Exhibits CE-907 and CE-908. They also confirmed that they did not oppose the Respondent\u2019s request to introduce additional translations of certain exhibits as long as those translations were not used to raise new arguments in the post-hearing briefs.\n\n174.\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Parties filed their respective post-hearing briefs. The Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief (\"C-PHB 1\") was accompanied by Exhibit CE-909, and the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief (\"R-PHB 1\") was accompanied by additional translations of Exhibits RE-13, RE-18, RE-19 and RE-223.\n\n175.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the Claimants sought the Tribunal\u2019s leave to admit still further documents into the record, which the Respondent opposed on 14 October 2021. On 18 October 2021, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 request following which the latter filed Exhibits CE-910 and CE-911 on 19 October 2021.\n\n176.\n\nOn 22 October 2021, the Parties filed their second post-hearing briefs (\"C-PHB 2\" and \"R-PHB 2\").\n\n177.\n\nOn 12 November 2021, each Party filed a statement on costs.\n\n178.\n\nOn 27 November 2021 and 29 November 2021, the Parties submitted their respective requests for redaction of certain parts of their statement of costs. In view of the Parties\u2019 agreement, the Tribunal instructed the Secretariat to publish the documents as redacted by the Parties on 1 December 2021.\n\n179.\n\nOn 23 March 2023, the Claimants amended their request for relief regarding Mr. Rand\u2019s receivables against BD Agro. On 27 March 2023, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit comments, if any, regarding the Claimants\u2019 communication by 31 March 2023. No comments were received from the Respondent.\n\n180.\n\nOn 2 June 2023, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.\n\n**IV. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nIn their first post-hearing submission, the Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n\"The Claimants request that the Tribunal issues an award:\n\na. declaring that Serbia has breached the Serbia-Cyprus BIT;\n\nb. ordering Serbia to pay compensation to Sembi of no less than EUR 87.5 million;\n\nc. declaring that Serbia has breached the Canada-Serbia BIT;\n\nd. in the alternative to request b. above, ordering Serbia to pay compensation to:\n\n(i) Rand Investments of no less than EUR 16.5 million;\n\n(ii) Ms. Kathleen Elizabeth Rand of no less than EUR 23.7 million, plus a gross-up of 33.2% on that amount;\n\n(iii) Ms. Allison Ruth Rand of no less than EUR 23.7 million, plus a gross-up of 33.2% on that amount; and\n\n(iv) Mr. Robert Harry Leander Rand of no less than EUR 23.7 million, plus a gross-up of 33.2% on that amount;\n\ne. in the alternative to request d.(i) above, ordering Serbia to pay compensation to Mr. William Rand of no less than EUR 16.5 million.\n\nf. in the alternative to requests d.(i) and e., and/or d(ii), d(iii) and d(iv) above, ordering Serbia to pay compensation to Mr. William Rand of no less than EUR 87.5 million.\n\ng. ordering Serbia to pay compensation to Mr. William Rand:\n\n(i) no less than EUR 3.9 million for loss of value of Mr. Rand's Indirect Shareholding; and\n\n(ii) no less than EUR 3.31 million for loss of value of Mr. Rand's receivables against BD Agro;88\n\nh. ordering Serbia to pay interest on any amounts awarded at the rate of Serbian statutory default interest rate (currently 8%) from 27 September 2021 until payment in full;\n\ni. ordering Serbia to pay the costs of this proceeding, including costs of legal representation; and\n\nj. ordering such other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances.\"89\n\nAs modified by the Claimants\u2019 communication of 23 March 2023. See \u00a7179 above.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00a7353.\n\n182.\n\nThese requests remained unchanged thereafter.\n\n**B, Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nIn its reply post-hearing submission, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\n\"Respondent requests the Arbitral Tribunal to\n\n(1) *dismiss* all Claimants' claims for the lack of jurisdiction, *in eventu,* dismiss all Claimants' claims for the lack of merit,\n\n(2) *order* Claimants to reimburse Respondent all its costs of the proceedings, with interest.\"90\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00a7125.\n\n184.\n\nThese requests remained unchanged.\n\n**V. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n185.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal wishes to note that, for the reasons set out in his dissenting opinion, Professor Kohen disagrees with the decisions, as well with the supporting fact findings and legal analysis dealing with the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Mr. Rand (\u00a7715 (a), first part), the admissibility of Mr. Rand\u2019s claims (\u00a7715(a), second part), the breach of Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT (\u00a7715 (c)) and, by way of consequence, the award of damages (\u00a7715 (d)). These decisions are thus made by majority.\n\n186.\n\nPrior to considering the merits of the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal will address the scope of this Award (A); the maxim *iura novit curia* (B); the relevance of previous decisions or awards (C); and transparency (D).\n\n**A. Scope of this Award**\n--------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThis Award deals with jurisdiction and with the merits of the claims over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction.\n\n**B,** ***Iura Novit*** **Arbiter**\n-----------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nWhen applying the governing law, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments or sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim *iura novit curia* - or, better, *iura novit arbiter* - the Tribunal is required to apply the law on its own motion, provided always that it gives the Parties an opportunity to comment if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.91\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, \u00a7 295 (\"[...] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte,* rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL Case *(\"'Oostergetel),* Award, 23 April 2012, \u00a7 141; Exh. RLA-161, *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00a7 287.\n\n**C. Relevance of Previous Decisions and Awards**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nIn support of their positions, the Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same or similar approaches or solutions should be adopted in the present case, or to explain why this Tribunal should depart from an approach or a solution reached by another tribunal.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it should pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it should be respectful of the reasoning and solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the circumstances of an actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.\n\n**D. Transparency**\n-------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Canada-Serbia BIT that applies to Claimants 1 to 5 requires the publication of the award.92 By contrast, the Cyprus-Serbia BIT that applies to Claimant 6 contains no rules on transparency. In Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal recalled that Serbia had conditionally agreed to the publication of the award under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT as well.93 It went on to determine that the rules governing transparency in this arbitration would be identical for claims under both BITs.94 Those rules were provided in the Transparency Rules annexed to Procedural Order No. 5.\n\nExh. CLA-1, Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 31(1) (\"A Tribunal award under this Section shall be publicly available, subject to the redaction of confidential information. All other documents submitted to, or issued by, the Tribunal shall be publicly available unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, subject to the redaction of confidential information.\").\n\nPO 5, \u00a725.\n\nPO 5, \u00a729. Prof. Kohen's dissent to PO 5 was appended to that Order.\n\n192.\n\nAccordingly, this award shall be made available to the public. Pursuant to the Transparency Rules, the Parties can notify the Tribunal within 15 days from the issuance of the award if they seek protection of any confidential information in the award.95 The other Party may then reply within 15 days, after which the Tribunal will rule.\n\nPO 5, Transparency Rules, \u00a716.\n\n193.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will remain in office until it has resolved any transparency objections that the Parties may raise.\n\n194.\n\nFinally, the video recordings of the hearings and all documents referred to in Section III of the Transparency Rules shall, upon completion of the case, continue to be made available to the public on the ICSID website.\n\n**VI. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants have initiated this ICSID arbitration under two Treaties, the Canada-Serbia BIT for the Canadian Claimants and the Cyprus-Serbia BIT for the Cypriot Claimant. It is not disputed that all Claimants must meet the requirements of the ICSID Convention. Further, the Canadian Claimants must meet the requirements of the Canada-Serbia BIT and the Cypriot Claimant must meet the requirements of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal first determines its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention (A) after which it reviews its jurisdiction under the BITs (B).\n\n**A. Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides for the jurisdiction of the Centre, reads as follows:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.[...].\n\n198.\n\nArticle 25 (1) prescribes four requirements for a tribunal to have jurisdiction under the Convention: (i) the arbitration must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) there must be a legal dispute (iii) arising directly out of an investment, and (iv) the Contracting State and the investor must have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration. In addition, of course, the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time.\n\n199.\n\nSerbia does not dispute that the first requirement related to nationality is satisfied, and rightly so. This dispute opposes nationals of Canada and of Cyprus, on the one hand, and Serbia, on the other hand. Serbia, Canada and Cyprus are all Contracting States to the ICSID Convention.96\n\nExh. CE-104, List of Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, 2018.\n\n200.\n\nNeither does Serbia challenge the second requirement of a legal dispute, again rightly so, as the dispute concerns Serbia's alleged breaches of its obligations under the Treaties owed to the Claimants, which is a legal dispute.\n\n201.\n\nBy contrast, Serbia does contest the fulfilment of the third and fourth requirements, i.e. that the Claimants have an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention (1); and that Serbia has consented to ICSID arbitration (2). Serbia also challenges the Claimants' standing under the ICSID Convention (3).These objections are considered in turn below, before the Tribunal reaches its conclusion (4).\n\n**1. Investment under the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their investments in Serbia consist of:\n\na. For the Canadian Claimants:\n\na. their beneficial ownership over the Beneficially Owned Shares;\n\nb. their control over BD Agro;\n\nc. their indirect interest in Sembi's rights under the Sembi Agreement;\n\nd. Mr. Rand's Indirect Shareholding; and\n\ne. Mr. Rand's direct payments to BD Agro's Canadian suppliers for the purchase and transport of heifers and other payments and loans for the benefit of BD Agro.97\n\nb. For the Cypriot Claimant:\n\na. \"Sembi\u2019s rights stemming from the Sembi Agreement.\"98\n\nRej. J., \u00a7III.A; C-PHB 1, \u00a714.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7454.\n\n203.\n\nIn its review, the Tribunal will group the first three items together (items (a)-(c) above), as they all relate to the Canadian Claimants\u2019 interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. With this clarification, it will examine each of the alleged investments below.\n\n***a. Interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is based on four elements contained in the *Salini* test: the existence of a substantial contribution by the investor; a certain duration; the assumption of risk, and a contribution to the host State\u2019s development. It submits that the Claimants\u2019 investments do not satisfy these requirements.99\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7492 relying on Exh. CLA-20, *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco [I],* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 31 July 2001, \u00a752.\n\n***(i) Contribution***\n----------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants\u2019 contributions for the interest they allegedly acquired in BD Agro through the Beneficially Owned Shares would include (a) the payment of the EUR 5,549,000 purchase price for the Privatized Shares and (b) the EUR 2 million additional investment in BD Agro.\n\n206.\n\nOn (a), *i.e.* the payment of the purchase price of EUR 5,549,000 for the Privatized Shares, the Respondent asserts that there is no evidence that such funds were committed by the Claimants. The money used by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to pay the purchase price and to invest in BD Agro was not provided by any of the Claimants. There are no documents such as wire transfer records or bank account statements that would suggest that the funds used to purchase BD Agro originated from Mr. Rand, MDH or Sembi. It was Mr. Obradovi\u0107 who obtained the necessary funds through loans taken from the Lundin Family and paid all of the instalments of the purchase price.\n\n207.\n\nSerbia points out that Mr. Rand cannot be considered as an investor simply because he allegedly \"arranged\" the loans which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 received from the Lundins. The Claimants have not explained precisely what Mr. Rand did in this context. Neither have they furnished any documents despite Serbia's request. The funds that the Lundins extended to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 were not Mr. Rand's funds. Mr. Rand did not even guarantee the repayment of the loans granted by the Lundins - it was only the 2008 Lundin Agreement that made Mr. Rand and Mr. Obradovi\u0107 jointly liable for borrowed funds.\n\n208.\n\nSerbia further points out that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 paid for the initial instalment of the purchase price for BD Agro's acquisition, just as he did for all the other instalments. The first instalment was paid in October 2005, before Mr. Obradovi\u0107 started receiving funds from the Lundins. While the Claimants insist that the initial payment was made from funds transferred by the Lundins to MDH's bank account in Serbia in September 2005, they have offered no proof of this allegation. Neither have they tendered any evidence to support their contention that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had access to MDH's account or that he was authorized to use it, let alone evidence establishing that he actually withdrew funds from that account. The only \"reasonable explanation\" says Serbia is that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 used his own money to make the payment.\n\n209.\n\nFor Serbia, the repayment of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's debts under the 2008 Lundin Agreement cannot be treated as payment of the purchase price for BD Agro either. It explains its position as follows: \"[t]ransfers that Mr. Rand effectuated through Sembi were the result of his assumption of Mr. Obradovi\u0107 's debt under Article 1 of the 2008 Lundin Agreement. The purchase price was paid by Mr. Obradovi\u0107, using funds apparently originating from the Lundins. Repayment of funds previously borrowed by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 also did not lead to the injection of new capital in BD Agro or serve to further its business in any way.\"100\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7157.\n\n210.\n\nOn (b), *i.e.* the EUR 2 million additional investment in BD Agro, the Respondent stresses the absence of evidence in support of the Claimants' assertion that this contribution was made by them. The Claimants have not proven that this payment was actually made nor that it was made by them.\n\n211.\n\nSerbia also argues that the Claimants have failed to explain the Lundins' role in securing the financing for the Claimants' investments. The precise role of Mr. Rand is not established either. For instance, in the absence of the terms of the financial arrangement between Mr. Rand, the Lundin Family and Mr. Obradovi\u0107, it is unclear whether Mr. Rand's repayment of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's debt to the Lundin Family in 2008 and 2010 should be treated as the Claimants' payment of the purchase price for BD Agro on behalf of Mr. Obradovi\u0107 or not. In any event, funds which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 obtained through the loan from the Lundin Family were not used to pay the acquisition of BD Agro, and Mr. Rand's settlement of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's debt cannot be treated as payment of the purchase price. Additionally, the transfer of money from Mr. Rand to the Lundin Family and their companies is irrelevant since it did not lead to the acquisition of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's shares in BD Agro by Sembi and the funds were not used for the purpose of furthering BD Agro's business.\n\n212.\n\nSerbia further challenges the Claimants' view that the monetary contribution of one of them should count as contribution of each and every Claimant. For instance, they admit that Sembi's bank account was used to transfer funds that were \"ultimately committed\" by Mr. Rand to the Lundins. The Claimants then claim that the same contribution gives investor status to Mr. Rand under the Canada-Serbia BIT and to Sembi under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. To be investors, both Mr. Rand and Sembi must prove that each of them made a separate contribution, which is not the case.\n\n213.\n\nSerbia adds that Sembi has made no contribution of capital to BD Agro. The repayment of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's loan was effected with funds committed by Mr. Rand. There is no evidence that Sembi ever paid the remaining instalments of the purchase price under the Sembi Agreement. Even if it was accepted that Sembi owned the shares in BD Agro, mere ownership cannot constitute a contribution.\n\n***(ii) Duration***\n-------------------\n\n214.\n\nSerbia submits that the Claimants have not obtained any asset that could be deemed an \"investment\" under the two BITs or the ICSID Convention, with the result that there can be no question of a duration.\n\n***(iii) Risk***\n----------------\n\n215.\n\nSerbia contends that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 acquired and managed BD Agro, not any of the Claimants. The funds required for BD Agro's acquisition were obtained by Mr. Obradovi\u0107. It is clear that Mr. Rand's three children made no commitment of capital or other resources to BD Agro. In the circumstances, in absence of a contribution, the risk that would follow from the investment does not exist.\n\n***(iv) Contribution to development***\n--------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nSerbia contends that BD Agro was de facto bankrupt since March 2013 when the company's bank account was blocked by its creditors. This was not a result of any actions or omissions of Respondent, but a consequence of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's management. BD Agro generated losses in almost every year it was managed by Mr. Obradovi\u0107. In the circumstances, the Claimants' \"investment\" did not contribute to the development of the Republic of Serbia. This is all the more so as Mr. Obradovi\u0107's activities related to BD Agro were illegal and resulted in criminal prosecution.\n\n217.\n\nIn addition to the requirements just mentioned, in reliance on *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic,* Serbia adds that \"it is generally established that access to protection under the ICSID Convention itself is also restricted by an implicit legality requirement.\"*101* It says that this requirement is not met either in this case.\n\nRej., \u00a7775 relying on Exh. RLA-5, *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants insist that this Tribunal should follow the approach of numerous ICSID Tribunals and conclude, from the absence of a definition of \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention, that the ICSID Convention does not impose any jurisdictional requirements *ratione materiae* additional to those set forth in the Treaties. However, should the Tribunal choose not to follow this approach, the Claimants contend that their investments satisfy even the \"broadest of tests\" for an investment put forth by any tribunal.\n\n***(i) Contribution***\n----------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they have made \"long-term substantial contributions\" to BD Agro and the Serbian economy including (a) the EUR 5,549,000 purchase price for the Beneficially Owned Shares, and (b) the EUR 2 million additional investment in BD Agro.\n\n220.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Serbia's argument that the purchase price cannot be regarded as a contribution because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 made payments with loans proceeds from the Lundins is ill-conceived. The Lundins started to provide funding on 15 September 2005 when they wired EUR 3.3 million to MDH's account in Serbia. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had access to that account and used part of these funds to pay the first instalment of the purchase price. Mr. Rand's assumption, through Sembi, of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's EUR 13.8 million debt to the Lundins and its subsequent repayment (up to EUR 5.6 million) constitutes Mr. Rand's contribution. Further, the Privatization Agency expressly confirmed the making of the additional EUR 2 million investment, and the Claimants have shown that this additional investment was also financed from the money loaned by the Lundins.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that, in any event, as Sembi's direct and indirect co-owners, all of the Canadian Claimants can benefit from Sembi's contributions, including those made prior to Mr. Rand's children becoming the indirect co-owners of Sembi. An indirect owner of an investment cannot be excluded from investment protection simply because the investment in the host country had been made by the holding company before the indirect owner acquired an interest in the holding company.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants oppose Serbia's theory that the transfer of money from Mr. Rand to the Lundin Family and their companies is irrelevant since it did not lead to the acquisition of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's shares in BD Agro by Sembi and the funds were not used for the purpose of furthering the BD Agro's business. They point out that if that theory were to be accepted, an investor buying an existing investment would never be able to satisfy the \"contribution\" criterion of the *Salini* test.\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimants equally rebut Serbia's submission that the same contribution cannot count for both Mr. Rand and Sembi. The channelling of investments through holding companies, such as Sembi, is commonplace. The contribution made by the holding company is also a contribution by its shareholder.\n\n***(ii) Duration***\n-------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the duration of the Claimants' investment was ten years with respect to Mr. Rand and seven years for the remaining Claimants. This amply satisfies the duration requirement.\n\n***(iii) Risk***\n----------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants submit that their investment in BD Agro involved not only risks inherent to the volatile agricultural business, but also significant risks connected with the unpredictable legal and business environment in Serbia. This suffices to fulfil the \"risk\" condition.\n\n***(iv) Contribution to development***\n--------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants submit that BD Agro substantially contributed to Serbia's development. It was praised by politicians in Serbia and Canada, business partners, and the media, for such achievement.\n\n**(3) Analysis**\n----------------\n\n227.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not define the term \"investment.\" For Serbia, the Tribunal should ascribe an \"objective\" definition to that term, while the Claimants consider that the Tribunal should limit itself to applying the definition of investment contained in the Treaties.\n\n228.\n\nTo resolve this disagreement, the Tribunal turns to the rules of interpretation of treaties contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\"). Applying those rules, the Tribunal must interpret the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) by giving the term its ordinary meaning, in its context and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. As held by many investment awards, in the ordinary meaning of the term, an investment is (i) a contribution or allocation of resources, (ii) made for a duration; and (iii) involving risk, which includes the expectation of a profit (albeit not necessarily fulfilled). As noted by the tribunal in *Saba Fakes,* these components \"are both necessary and sufficient to define an investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention.\"102 The development of the host State's economy is a consequence of a successful investment, not a self-standing condition of the latter's existence. As such, it is not a component of an investment, an opinion shared by a number of prior investment awards.103\n\nExh. CLA-90, *Mr. Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, \u00a7\u00a7108-110.\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. CLA-90, *Mr. Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, \u00a7111; Exh. RLA-024, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, \u00a7187.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share the view expressed for instance by the *Phoenix* tribunal pursuant to which compliance with the laws of the host State and respect of good faith are elements of the objective definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Contracting Parties to an investment treaty are free to include these requirements in their investment treaties, and many do so. This does not mean, however, that requirements of lawfulness and compliance with good faith are part of the definition of investment and should thus be implied into Article 25(1) of the Convention, as several tribunals have observed.\n\n230.\n\nIn *Saba Fakes,* for example, the tribunal explained:\n\n\"As far as the legality of investments is concerned, this question does not relate to the definition of 'investment\u2019 provided in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in Article 1(b) of the BIT. In the Tribunal's opinion, while the ICSID Convention remains neutral on this issue, bilateral investment treaties are at liberty to condition their application and the whole protection they afford, including consent to arbitration, to a legality requirement of one form or another.\"104\n\nExh. CLA-90, *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, \u00a7114.\n\n231.\n\nSimilarly, the *Metal-Tech* tribunal held:\n\n\"[...] the Contracting Parties to an investment treaty may limit the protections of the treaty to investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State. Depending on the wording of the investment treaty, this limitation may be a bar to jurisdiction, i.e. to the procedural protections under the BIT, or a defense on the merits, i.e. to the application of the substantive treaty guarantees. Similarly, a breach of the general prohibition of abuse of right, which is a manifestation of the principle of good faith, may give rise to an objection to jurisdiction or to a defense on the merits.\"105\n\nExh. RLA-161, *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00a7127.\n\n232.\n\nIn conclusion, Article 25(1) of the Convention contains no such requirements, and the Tribunal sees no legal justification for reading them into the Convention. As a consequence, the Tribunal therefore turns to determine whether the three elements of the objective definition of investment identified above (\u00a7228) are met in this case.\n\n***(i) Contribution***\n----------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants insist that their contribution towards their investment in Serbia being the interest they acquired in BD Agro through the Beneficially Owned Shares is the payment of the EUR 5.5 million purchase price for the Beneficially Owned Shares as well as the EUR 2 million additional investment in BD Agro. Serbia argues to the contrary that these payments cannot be considered as the Claimants\u2019 contribution because they were made by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from loans he had obtained from the Lundins.\n\n234.\n\nIn the context of the assessment of the existence of a contribution as a prerequisite for an investment, investment tribunals have long held that contributions to the host State can take several forms,106 that the origin of capital is irrelevant,107 and that the reality of the contribution is to be assessed taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the elements of the economic goal pursued.108\n\nExh.

Kazakhstan,109* for instance, the tribunal observed:\n\n\"The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that, subject to express provisions to the contrary, the origin of capital used to make an investment is immaterial for jurisdiction purposes. However, there still needs to be some economic link between that capital and the purported investor that enables the Tribunal to find that a given investment is an investment of that particular investor.\"\n\nExh. CLA-28, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Award, 5 June 2012, \u00a7355.\n\n236.\n\nThat tribunal further explained:\n\n\"The capital can come from the investor\u2019s own funds located in any country, from its subsidiaries or affiliates located in any country, from loan, credit or other arrangements.\"\n\n237.\n\nThere must thus be an economic link between the funds and the investor which is such that the contribution made with the funds is that of the investor. What matters is the economic reality of the contribution in consideration of all the relevant circumstances, not the formal arrangements used. An investor could very well borrow money from third parties to make an investment. What matters is that the investor is the one ultimately bearing the financial burden of the contribution.\n\n238.\n\nHere, the facts ranging from the commencement of the privatization process until the termination of the Privatization Agreement show that Mr. Rand was the one bearing the financial burden of the investment:\n\n\u2022 The MDH Agreement, which was concluded between MDH, Mr. Rand\u2019s company, and Mr. Obradovi\u0107 on 19 September 2005, gave the former the right to cause Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares of BD Agro as instructed by Mr. Rand through MDH:\n\n\"The Seller [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] agrees to execute any documents from time to time in order to acknowledge the claims of the Purchaser herein and agrees to vote any Shares held by him from time to time at any Shareholders Meeting of the Company in accordance with instructions received from the Purchaser [MDH].\"110\n\n\u2022 The Board of Directors of BD Agro was to be composed of Mr. Rand\u2019s nominees:\n\n\"The Seller further agrees to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to consist of those parties nominated or agreed to by the Purchaser [MDH].\"111\n\n\u2022 BD Agro was to be managed in accordance with MDH\u2019s, *i.e.* Mr. Rand\u2019s, instructions:\n\n\"The Seller shall follow the instructions of the Purchaser with regard to the management of the Company and shall use his best efforts at all times to enhance the value and income of the Property.\"112\n\n\u2022 On the day on which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 acquired the shares of BD Agro through the privatization process, the Assistant Minister of Economy, Mr. Jovanovi\u0107, congratulated Mr. Rand for the \"farm acquisition\":\n\n\"Dear Bill,\n\nI presume that George has already informed that you all succeeded in farm acquisition! [...] I will coordinate with George our presence at the farm!\"113\n\n\u2022 After the privatization, Mr. Rand was appointed to BD Agro\u2019s Board and exercised control over its operations. This included receiving financial reports and discussing BD Agro\u2019s financing needs with senior management,114 receiving reports on a number of other issues affecting BD Agro,115 visiting BD Agro himself to control its operations116 and communicating with external consultants and business partners117 towards whom he presented himself as the owner or operator of BD Agro.118 This evidence also shows that Mr. Rand often controlled BD Agro's operations directly without any involvement from Mr. Obradovi\u0107.\n\n\u2022 On 22 February 2008, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi concluded the Sembi Agreement in the circumstances described above (\u00a723), Mr. Rand signing the Agreement on Sembi's behalf. The Agreement provided that, as of that date, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 assigned all of his rights, title and interest in the Privatization Agreement to Sembi.119 Mr. Rand was always in full control of Sembi120 and continued to control BD Agro through Sembi. For instance, over the course of 2008-2010, the Board of Directors of Sembi repeatedly discussed BD Agro matters,121 including issues such as progress on farm construction work and the status of BD Agro's herd and crops.122 It approved strategic decisions, including the sale of BD Agro's land, the acquisition and reconstruction of the Sokolac farm, and the reconstruction of BD Agro's premises.123\n\n\u2022 Later in 2008, Mr. Rand paid EUR 2.2 million directly to Canadian suppliers and vendors for the purchase and transport of heifers from Canada to BD Agro.124\n\n\u2022 Over the course of 2008 to 2010, Mr. Rand forwarded funds to Sembi that were then used for partial repayment of Sembi's debts under the Lundin Agreement.125 That Agreement recognizes that, if any payment under that Agreement was delayed for more than three months, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi (controlled by Mr. Rand) would immediately list BD Agro for sale.126\n\n\u2022 In March 2013, Mr. Rand advised BD Agro's management, including Messrs. Obradovi\u0107, Jovanovi\u0107, Marki\u0107evi\u0107 and Broshko, that Mr. Wood would arrive to Belgrade in the upcoming week \"to take over supervision of cattle and farm operations and assist [Mr. Jovanovi\u0107] with all other farm issues\" and instructed them to make appropriate logistical arrangements.127\n\n\u2022 In April 2013, Mr. Rand sent BD Agro\u2019s management including Messrs. Obradovi\u0107, Jovanovi\u0107, Marki\u0107evi\u0107 and Wood, the agenda for an upcoming meeting of BD Agro\u2019s Management Board, which included important matters such as the appointment of Mr. Wood as a member and of Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 as Chairman of BD Agro\u2019s Management Board.128\n\n\u2022 In 2013, Mr. Rand, who was not sitting on BD Agro\u2019s Board at the time,129 instructed Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to step away from the management of BD Agro. Further, he caused Mr. Igor Marki\u0107evi\u0107 to be appointed as Chairman130 and Mr. David Wood as member of the Board of Directors.131\n\n\u2022 In 2013, Mr. Rand directed Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to assign the Privatization Agreement to Coropi Holdings Limited,132 a Cypriot company nominally owned by Mr. Jennings as trustee of the Ahola Family Trust.133 There was no link between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Coropi, except through Mr. Rand, who was in control of the Ahola Family Trust.\n\n\u2022 In 2014, in the course of BD Agro\u2019s bankruptcy, Serbian state agencies were informed that BD Agro\u2019s owner was Canadian and that his representative would like to discuss the pre-pack reorganization plan which was then being considered.134\n\nExh.

Serbia too was aware of Mr. Rand's involvement:\n\n\u2022 Prior to the privatization of BD Agro, Mr. Rand corresponded with senior Serbian government officials135 *inter alia* indicating his interest in purchasing BD Agro.136\n\n\u2022 As already mentioned, on the day when Mr. Obradovi\u0107 succeeded in acquiring the shares of BD Agro through the privatization process, the Deputy Minister of Economy, Mr. Jovanovi\u0107,137 wrote to Mr. Rand to congratulate him on the acquisition of the farm.\n\n\u2022 In 2013, the then Minister of Economy was asked to arrange a meeting with Mr. Broshko \"the representative of the owner of the company BD Agro Dobanovci from Canada\", for furthering the development plan of BD Agro and informing Mr. Rand, \"who is a majority owner of PD BD Agro.\"138\n\n\u2022 At a meeting held on 15 December 2014 with representatives of the Ministry of Economy139 and the Privatization Agency140 to discuss BD Agro's breaches of the Privatization Agreement, Messrs. Broshko and Marki\u0107evi\u0107 were recognized as \"representatives\" of BD Agro not as representatives of Coropi or of Mr. Obradovi\u0107.141 At the time, Mr. Broshko was Executive Director of Rand Investments. More significantly, before the meeting even began, Ministry officials asked Mr. Obradovi\u0107 - not Rand Investments\u2019 representative, Mr. Broshko - to leave the room and the meeting was then held without his presence with Messrs. Broshko and Marki\u0107evi\u0107.\n\n\u2022 As was previously noted, in the course of BD Agro\u2019s bankruptcy, competent Serbian state agencies were informed that BD Agro\u2019s owner was Canadian and that his representatives intended to address the pre-pack reorganization plan then in discussion.142\n\nExh.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that some exhibits in the record might be understood as showing that certain state officials did not know that Mr. Rand controlled BD Agro (Exhs. CE-320, Letter from BD Agro to the Ministry of Economy and Privatization Agency, 5 November 2014, CE-48, Letter from Mr. Djura Obradovi\u0107 to Privatization Agency, 8 September 2015, and CE-907, Decision of the Court of Appeal in Belgrade, 26 May 2021). Having reviewed them, it finds that they are insufficient to displace the evidence just referred to, not to speak of the fact that there is no requirement of knowledge on the part of the Host State under the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n240.\n\nIt is equally clear to the Tribunal that the funds for the acquisition of the Beneficially Owned Shares came from Mr. Rand. Indeed, it is not disputed that the purchase price of EUR 5.5 million was fully paid.143 Mr. Obradovi\u0107 did not have funds to finance the acquisition of the Beneficially Owned Shares himself,144 and took loans from the Lundin family for the same.145 Mr. Rand arranged these loans,146 Mr. Obradovi\u0107 receiving approximately EUR 13.8 million from the Lundins.147 Mr. Rand,148 Mr. Azrac149 and Mr. Obradovi\u0107150 all testify that these loans were used to fund BD Agro\u2019s privatization. This is also clear from the fact that Mr. Lundin, a second-generation billionaire, was on BD Agro\u2019s Management Board and the Lundins\u2019 had an option to convert their receivables into equity.151 Mr. Rand was liable to repay the loans152 and did so by October 2010,153 after which the sixth instalment of the purchase price was paid in April 2011.154 Interest that had accrued because of the delay in payments of the purchase price was paid even later on 30 December 2011,155 long after the Lundins indicated their interest to exit from the project in 2008.156 Further, under the Sembi Agreement, Sembi was to make the additional EUR 2 million investment required by the Privatization Agreement.157 While Serbia does question whether this payment was made, the record shows that it was.158 Monies paid by Sembi were \"ultimately committed\" by Mr. Rand, who also personally guaranteed all of Sembi's and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations to the Lundins.159 Thus, while Mr. Obradovi\u0107 formally paid the purchase price, he did so with money originating from a loan that Mr. Rand arranged and was liable to repay. There is thus a clear economic link between the funds and Mr. Rand, the circumstances showing that the payment of the purchase price was his contribution, not that of Mr. Obradovi\u0107 or the Lundins.160\n\nExh.

See also documentary evidence mentioned at Reply, fn.748.\n\n241.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal rejects Serbia's argument that the \"Claimants have not adduced contemporaneous evidence that the Lundins', the Claimants' and/or Mr. Obradovi\u0107's money was in fact used to finance the Privatization of BD Agro.\"161 The evidence just reviewed shows that the Lundins' and then Mr. Rand's funds were used to fund BD Agro's privatization, in exchange for which Mr. Rand acquired an interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares and exercised control over BD Agro's operation and management.\n\nRej. \u00a7327.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejects Serbia's argument that the first instalment of the purchase price of EUR 2.1 million, made on 15 October 2005, must have been paid with Mr. Obradovi\u0107's own funds because he allegedly received the first payment from the Lundins only on 2 January 2006. The record shown that the Lundins started providing funding on 15 September 2005 when they wired EUR 3.3 million to MDH's account in Serbia.162 Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had access to that account and used a part of these funds to pay the first instalment of the purchase price.163 As already explained, Mr. Rand arranged for this loan and later assumed Mr. Obradovi\u0107's entire debt to the Lundins.\n\nExh. CE-384, Confirmation of transfer of EUR 3,312,740 from Mr. Lundin to Marine Drive Holding, 15 September 2005.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7476.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal equally rejects Serbia's challenges to the payment of four of the remaining five instalments of the purchase price. To the extent Serbia contests whether these payments came from the Lundins/Mr. Rand's monies, this has just been addressed. To the extent that Serbia also contests that these instalments were paid out of money siphoned out of BD Agro, this argument is addressed below in the context of Serbia's legality objections (\u00a7\u00a7348 et seq.) to the extent necessary.\n\n244.\n\nThe Respondent appears to question Mr. Rand's involvement in BD Agro on the basis that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 concluded certain transactions without the former's knowledge, pointing specifically to the land assignment transaction or the loans to Inex and Crveni Signal. At its height, BD Agro was one of the largest dairy farms in the region, with numerous operations. It would be unreasonable to expect Mr. Rand, the ultimate controller of the farm to be aware of each of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's dealings. That Mr. Rand was unaware of some BD Agro's operations does not overcome the wealth of evidence of Mr. Rand's involvement or his financial contribution set out above. Mr. Obradovi\u0107's testimony that Mr. Rand gave him \"a lot of leeway\" in the operations of BD Agro only confirms Mr. Rand's involvement.164\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, 102:16-19 (Obradovi\u0107)\n\n245.\n\nNeither does the Tribunal see the relevance of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's motivation to operate BD Agro at Mr. Rand's behest165 or Mr. Jovanovic's statement holding Mr. Obradovi\u0107 out as owner of BD Agro.166 What matters for the present purposes is that contemporaneous evidence shows that Mr. Rand was involved in BD Agro, either directly or through Mr. Obradovi\u0107, for which he contributed.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal recalls that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 testified that he worked for Mr. Rand based on a success fee which would be paid if Mr. Rand's investments became profitable. Mr. Rand also advanced funds to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's personal expenses (Obradovi\u0107 WS I, \u00a77; Obradovi\u0107 WS II, \u00a77; Obradovi\u0107 WS III, \u00a78; Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, 85:21-86:21).\n\nRej., \u00a730.\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent also emphasizes that there is no evidence of any written instructions from Mr. Rand to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 concerning BD Agro. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls Mr. Rand's testimony at the hearing that he gave oral instructions to Mr. Obradovi\u0107.167 In any event, there is evidence of written instructions as well.168 Anyhow, the absence of written instructions would not alter the evidence examined above, all of which points to Mr. Rand's involvement.\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, 6:10-7:13.\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, 6:10-7:13. Mr. Rand confirmed that he sent instructions by email to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's address president@bdagro.com. See also Exh. CE- 428, E-mail from Mr. Rand to Messrs. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, Jovanovi\u0107, Broshko, and Obradovi\u0107, 10 April 2013; Exh. CE-429, E-mail from Mr. Rand to BD Agro, 29 March 2013; Exh. CE-649, Email communication between W. Rand and R. Kova\u0107evi\u0107, 19 November 2006 (\"have asked my agent in Serbia, Mr. George Obradovi\u0107, to give you a call to discuss the business proposals in your letter.\").\n\n247.\n\nFurthermore, Serbia objects that it had no knowledge of Mr. Rand's control of BD Agro, which was not disclosed by Mr. Rand, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 or other BD Agro representatives. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the BIT does not require that the host State have knowledge of the foreign nature of an investment and of the identity of the investor at the time of a breach. In any event, as was seen above, the evidence on record shows that Serbia was aware of Mr. Rand's control over BD Agro.\n\n248.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal is unconvinced by Serbia's submission that Mr. Rand's involvement in BD Agro's affairs can be explained away because he was a director and indirectly held a minority stake in BD Agro. The fact that Mr. Rand was appointed to BD Agro's board on 9 December 2005 itself suggests that he exercised an element of control over BD Agro.169 It is true that Mr. Rand stepped down from the board on 9 July 2012. However, the evidence examined above demonstrates that he continued to exercise control over BD Agro well after that date and that his control exceeded the powers of a minority shareholder. For the same reasons, the Respondent's speculation that \"it is perfectly conceivable that the ultimate de facto owner or controller of BD Agro was not Mr. Rand but some member of the Lundin family\"170 does not appear plausible.\n\nHe only commenced to acquire the 3.9% stake held through MDH in October 2008.\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 1, 171:23-25.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, Serbia also questions the Lundins' motives in funding the acquisition of BD Agro,171 as well as the fact that they decided to abandon the project in 2008.172 Neither of these arguments are pertinent to assess the existence of a contribution.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a724.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7\u00a724, 35.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that Mr. Rand did indeed contribute towards the acquisition of an interest in BD Agro through investments in Serbia.\n\n251.\n\nThe contributions of the remaining Claimants are less clear.\n\n252.\n\nAs far as Claimant 1 is concerned, the Claimants do not allege that Rand Investments contributed towards the acquisition of an interest in BD Agro through the Beneficially Owned Shares separately from Mr. Rand's contributions.173 For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal regards this contribution as Mr. Rand's contribution, not as a separate contribution of Rand Investment Ltd.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7481 et seq.\n\n253.\n\nFor Claimants 3, 4 and 5, i.e. Mr. Rand's children, the Claimants admit that their contributions depend entirely on the contributions of (i) Mr. Rand and (ii) Sembi.174\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7677-679 (\"The remaining Canadian Claimants\u2014Ms. Kathleen Elizabeth Rand, Ms. Allison Ruth Rand and Mr. Robert Harry Leander Rand\u2014were not required to make any independent contribution. First, as the beneficiaries of the Ahola Trust (which owned shares in Sembi), Mr. Rand's children can rely on the contribution made by Sembi. [...] Second, as his children, they can rely on contributions made by Mr. Rand.\").\n\n254.\n\nFor (i), relying on the decision in *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v. Peru,* the Claimants contend that Mr. Rand's children can rely on contributions made by Mr. Rand.175 However, the facts of that case significantly differ from those of the present dispute. The initial investment in that case was made by the claimant's relatives and was later transferred to Ms. Levy de Levi. Neither her father nor any other relative brought claims in the arbitration. By contrast, here, the Claimants argue that both Mr. Rand and his children made an investment based on the same contribution. However, the analysis above makes clear that the contribution was not made by his children or out of the children's money, which, as mentioned, the Claimants also accept. Therefore, that contribution cannot be credited to the children. This may have been different if Mr. Rand and his children had made the contribution jointly. However, there is no indication on record to this effect. Here, Mr. Rand's contribution cannot be used to open access to arbitration to the other claimants who made no contribution.\n\nReply, \u00a7679.\n\n255.\n\nAs for (ii), i.e. whether the children can rely on Sembi's contribution, the preliminary question that arises is whether Sembi has at all contributed.\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants insist that Claimant 6, i.e. Sembi, \"made a substantial contribution because it repaid Mr. Obradovi\u0107's loans to the Lundins.\"176 They admit, however, that Mr. Rand controlled Sembi since February 2008177 and that it was Mr. Rand, not Sembi, who repaid these loans.178 All funds paid by Sembi towards the BD Agro project were \"ultimately committed\" by Mr. Rand,179 with Sembi's bank accounts merely acting as a conduit for such payments. While Sembi agreed to repay the Lundins in exchange for the latter extinguishing any claims they may have towards the Privatization Agreement and BD Agro, it was Mr. Rand who personally guaranteed all of Sembi's and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations to the Lundins180 and committed funds for repaying the loans.181 It was Mr. Rand who was involved in BD Agro's acquisition and operation. Sembi has not made any expenditure for the benefit of BD Agro's activities nor did it direct or manage BD Agro in any way. It was not involved in the acquisition of the Beneficially Owned Shares other than through Mr. Rand's involvement. In effect, Mr. Rand and Sembi seek protection under two investment treaties based on one and the same allocation of resources. They both claim that allocation as their contribution,182 without proving that it is a joint contribution nor apportioning one part of the contribution to one and another part to the other or otherwise sharing the allocation. In the Tribunal's view, the contribution was either made by one Claimant or by another.183\n\nReply, \u00a7676.\n\nSee, for e.g., C-PHB 2, \u00a730 (\"Mr. Rand has controlled Sembi at all times since February 2008.\"). Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 testified that he would follow Mr. Rand's directions when acting as a director of Sembi. See Marki\u0107evi\u0107 WS II, \u00a712 (\"I agreed with Mr. Rand to always follow his directions when acting as a director of Sembi.\") and Jennings WS I, \u00a714 (\"I have left the management of and control over both Sembi and Coropi to Mr. Rand\"). Mr. Obradovi\u0107 said the same. See Obradovi\u0107 WS II, \u00a739 (\"[I] agreed that, as the director of Sembi, I would always follow Mr. Rand's orders.\"). See also Mr. Rand's contemporaneous communications at Exh.

See also Rej. J., \u00a7676.\n\nWhile the Claimants insist \"the contribution made by the holding company also counts as a contribution by all of its shareholders\" it has advanced no authority in support of its position. C-PHB 2, \u00a775. See also Rej. J., fn.566 (\"This is completely different from a shareholder making a contribution through the holding company. In such a vertical structure, both the shareholder and the holding company make a contribution.\").\n\n257.\n\nA similar situation arose in *KT Asia v Kazakhstan.* There Mr. Ablyazov, a Kazakh national, acted via a number of foreign intermediaries, unofficially owning and controlling a majority interest in the Kazakh BTA Bank. In its analysis, the tribunal first noted that to establish jurisdiction, KT Asia was attempting to rely on the contribution made by its ultimate beneficial owner Mr. Ablyazov:\n\n\"[T]he real issue is whether KT Asia can at all rely on Mr. Ablyazov\u2019s original contribution in support of the argument that it itself made an investment. In other words, the question is whether the Claimant must itself have made a contribution or whether it can benefit from a contribution made by someone else, here its ultimate beneficial owner. On this point, the Respondent insists that the contribution behind the BTA shares was made long ago by entities other than and unrelated to the Claimant, which did not contribute anything upon acquiring or while holding these shares.\"184\n\nExh. RLA-95, *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, \u00a7192.\n\n258.\n\nIt then went on:\n\n\"There may be nothing unlawful in Mr. Ablyazov treating the assets of companies formally owned by other persons as his personal property. However, he cannot do so and at the same time argue that the companies should be treated as a conventional commercial group when it comes to claiming treaty protection. In a sense, by seeking credit for Mr. Ablyazov's initial contribution, the Claimant [KT Asia] disavows the separate personality which it invoked previously for purposes of nationality.\"185\n\nExh. RLA-95, *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, \u00a7205.\n\n259.\n\nLike in *KT Asia,* here too, Sembi is seeking credit for Mr. Rand\u2019s contribution, thereby disavowing the separate personality which it invokes for seeking protection under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. This cannot be allowed.\n\n260.\n\nA parallel can also be drawn with *Doutremepuich v. Mauritius.* There, the tribunal found that the payment of EUR 300,000 into the account of a holding company owned jointly by two claimants were made solely by the first claimant, Christian Doutremepuich. As the second claimant, Antoine Doutremepuich, had not made a separate contribution, the tribunal determined that he had not made an investment under the France-Mauritius BIT.186\n\nExh. RLA-171, *Christian Doutremepuich and Antoine Doutremepuich v. Republic of Mauritius,* PCA Case No. 2018-37, Award on Jurisdiction, 23 August 2019, \u00a7\u00a713, 128-130. Although this determination was made under the France-Mauritius BIT, there too, the tribunal gave the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the France-Mauritius BIT the same objective meaning as this Tribunal has given the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention i.e. (i) a contribution to the host State; (ii) of a certain duration; (iii) that entails participating in the risks of the operation (\u00a7\u00a7117-118).\n\n261.\n\nYet another parallel can be drawn with *Orascom v. Algeria.187* There the tribunal observed that an investor who controls several entities in a vertical chain could commit an abuse of right if he impugned the same measures for the same harm relying on different investment treaties concluded by the same state, as that was contrary to the purpose of investment treaties.188 It is true that, unlike in this dispute, in *Orascom v. Algeria* the entities had brought separate arbitrations and that the objection turned on abuse of right and admissibility, as opposed to contribution and jurisdiction. However, there are also multiple similarities and the ratio underlying *Orascom* is equally applicable in the present circumstances.\n\nExh. CLA-111, *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Final Award, 31 May 2017.\n\nExh. CLA-111, *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Final Award, 31 May 2017, \u00a7\u00a7542-543.\n\n262.\n\nLike in *Orascom,* here too, (i) the group of entities of which the Claimants form part are organized as a vertical chain; (ii) the entities in the chain were under the control of Mr. Rand, the ultimate beneficial owner; (iii) the measures complained of by the various entities, particularly by Mr. Rand and Sembi, are the same; and (iv) the damage claimed by the various entities is, in its economic essence, the same. While there is no question of an abuse, it remains that investment tribunals have long guarded against entities in a vertical chain like the one in the present dispute filing claims under different investment treaties and counting (or double-counting) the contribution of one entity as that of another in the chain, in an attempt to confer jurisdiction on several claimants.\n\n263.\n\nHere, Mr. Rand's contribution towards the investment being an interest in BD Agro through the Beneficially Owned Shares is clear. His contribution confers *ratione materiae* jurisdiction on this ICSID tribunal to determine his claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT, provided the other jurisdictional requirements are met.\n\n264.\n\nBy contrast, Sembi has made no separate contribution towards this investment and, hence, cannot claim to have an investment of its own. It follows that, in respect of Sembi, one of the elements of the definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not satisfied. Therefore, Sembi has no investment and, therefore, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Sembi's claims under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. It does not have jurisdiction over the claims of Claimants 1, 3, 4 and 5 either. Indeed, as mentioned, these Claimants only contributed through Sembi or through Mr. Rand. However, Mr. Rand's contribution cannot count as the contribution of every other Claimant.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is not affected by the Claimants' later submission that Sembi made \"another contribution\" because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 paid most of the remaining instalments of the purchase price using funds obtained from BD Agro's repayment of the shareholder loans to BD Agro, which loans he had assigned to Sembi under the Sembi Agreement.189 The Tribunal does not understand this to be a contribution different from the one already reviewed above concerning the payments of the purchase price. As already explained, while payments were formally made by Mr. Obradovi\u0107, he did so with money originating from a loan that Mr. Rand arranged and was liable to repay. There is a clear economic link between the funds and Mr. Rand, the circumstances showing that the payment of the purchase price was his contribution, not that of Mr. Obradovi\u0107, the Lundins or Sembi.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7482.\n\n***(ii) Duration***\n-------------------\n\n266.\n\nAs described above, Mr. Rand acquired an interest in BD Agro through the Beneficially Owned Shares in 2005 when he arranged loans from the Lundin family for Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to pay the initial instalment of the purchase price. Later, through the Lundin Agreement of 2008, Mr. Rand personally guaranteed all of Sembi's and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations to the Lundins190 and subsequently repaid them.191 The sixth instalment of the Purchase Price was paid thereafter, as was the interest payable because of late payment of the instalments of the Purchase Price. Mr. Rand's involvement continued until 2015 when the Privatization Agreement was terminated, and the Beneficially Owned Shares were seized. This clearly meets the duration required under Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\nExh. CE-28, Agreement between Mr. Djura Obradovi\u0107, the Lundin Family, *W.* Rand and Sembi, 22 February 2008.\n\nRand WS I, \u00a733; Azrac WS I, \u00a716.\n\n267.\n\nSerbia argues that the Claimants' investment lacked a duration because they had not acquired any assets in Serbia. The argument that the Claimants had no assets in Serbia has already been rejected above and has thus no bearing in the present context.\n\n***(iii) Risk***\n----------------\n\n268.\n\nMr. Rand's investment faced the usual business risks involved in investing in a foreign country. The Tribunal is satisfied that by acquiring an interest in BD Agro through the Beneficially Owned Shares, Mr. Rand bore the risk inherent in such an investment, namely the risk that the value of BD Agro might decline. This suffices to fulfil the risk requirement included in the objective definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n269.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants bore no risk because they had made no contribution. Of course, if an investor makes no contribution, it incurs no risk of losing such (inexistent) contribution.192 Here, however, the Tribunal has found that Mr. Rand did make a contribution (\u00a7250). He bore the risks associated with that contribution, which, as just mentioned, meets the requirements of the objective definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\nExh. RLA-95, *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, \u00a7219.\n\n***b. Mr. Rand\u2019s Indirect Shareholding in BD Agro through MDH Serbia***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they paid EUR 0.2 million to buy Mr. Rand's Indirect Shareholding in BD Agro through MDH Serbia between October 2008 and October 2012.193 Serbia does not dispute that Mr. Rand indirectly owns 3.9% of BD Agro through MDH Serbia. It does, however, challenge that Mr. Rand paid EUR 0.2 million for this indirect ownership.194\n\nReply, \u00a7673(c).\n\nSee, for instance, R-PHB 1, \u00a715. (\"[S]ome of Claimants\u2019 alleged expenditures still remain undocumented and unproven. This is, for example, the case [...] with the price of EUR 200,000 allegedly paid for MDH Serbia\u2019s 3.9 % stock in BD Agro.\"). See also Rej., \u00a71028 (\"is unclear exactly how did Claimants come up with the price of 200,000 EUR allegedly paid for the shares. No evidence of such payment has ever been submitted. Since the owner of shares was Mr. Rand\u2019s Serbian company (MDH Serbia), it can be inferred that it was MDH Serbia that paid for the acquisition of those shares.\").\n\n271.\n\nIt is well-accepted that the Claimants bear the burden of proving their contribution.195 It is also well-accepted that the mere ownership of an asset is no proof of an allocation of resources. For instance, the tribunal in *Quiborax* stressed that \"mere ownership of a share is, in and of itself, insufficient to prove a contribution of money or assets.\"196\n\nSee, for instance, *Raymond Charles Eyre and Montrose Developments Limited v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/16/25, Award, 5 March 2020, \u00a7\u00a7298-300.\n\nExh. RLA-24, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Pliurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2012, \u00a7233.\n\n272.\n\nSimilarly, the *Caratube* tribunal observed that even if it were assumed that the claimant Hourani owned the asset in question, the tribunal would still lack jurisdiction as no evidence of a contribution of any kind was presented:\n\n\"[E]ven if Devincci Hourani acquired formal ownership and nominal control over CIOC, no plausible economic motive was given to explain the negligible purchase price he paid for the shares and any other kind of interest and to explain his investment in CIOC. No evidence was presented of a contribution of any kind or any risk undertaken by Devincci Hourani. There was no capital flow between him and CIOC that contributed anything to the business venture operated by CIOC.\n\n[...]\n\nClaimant [...] insisted that the origin of capital used in investments is immaterial. This is correct, however, the capital must still be linked to the person purporting to have made an investment. In this case there is not even evidence of such a link.\"197\n\nExh. CLA-28, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Award, 27 September 2017, \u00a7\u00a7 675, 678.\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimants have proffered no evidence whatsoever of Mr. Rand's alleged contribution of EUR 0.2 million to acquire MDH Serbia's 3.9% stake in BD Agro. Therefore, the Tribunal must conclude that Mr. Rand's contribution towards the indirect shareholding in BD Agro is not established, with the consequence that an element of the definition of the term investment in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not met. The Tribunal thus lacks *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over this alleged investment.\n\n***c. Payments for the benefit of BD Agro***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Mr. Rand made payments of approximately EUR 2.2 million for the replacement of BD Agro's herd. In addition, through Rand Investments, Mr. Rand also paid approximately EUR 160,000 to remunerate the services provided to BD Agro by herd management experts Messrs. Wood and Calin. The Tribunal is not convinced that these payments satisfy the duration criteria of the objective definition of investment in Article 25(1) of the Convention. For instance, the payment of consulting fees by Rand Investments does not have a significant duration, and the Claimants have not established the contrary.\n\n275.\n\nAs one of the elements of the objective definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not met, the Tribunal does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to entertain claims arising out of these payments. In addition, as seen below, these payments do not qualify as investments under the Canada-Serbia BIT (\u00a7333 et seq.).\n\n***d. Sembi\u2019s rights stemming from the Sembi Agreement***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nMr. Rand and Sembi claim to have made one and the same investment being Sembi's acquisition of an interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. For this investment, they allocated the same resources as their contribution.198 As explained above, this contribution is to be considered as Mr. Rand's contribution. Sembi, in fact, has made no contribution of its own. It follows that one of the elements of the definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not met. The Tribunal thus does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction to determine Sembi's claims.\n\nSee, for instance, C-PHB 2, \u00a7\u00a774-75 (\"Serbia also cannot seriously claim that this contribution [being \"Sembi's assumption of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's EUR 13.8 million debt to the Lundins and its subsequent partial repayment (up to EUR 5.6 million)\"], made by Sembi with funds provided by Mr. Rand, cannot count for both Sembi and its owners.\"). See also Rej. J., \u00a7676.\n\n***e. Conclusion on the existence of an investment under the ICSID Convention***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing discussion that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the ICSID Convention over the claims brought by Mr. Rand under the Canada-Serbia BIT in respect of his interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares but lacks jurisdiction over his claims in respect of his payments for the benefit of BD Agro and his indirect shareholding in BD Agro. It also lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention over the claims of Claimants 1, 3, 4 and 5 brought under the Canada-Serbia BIT. Finally, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention over the claims brought by Sembi under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT.\n\n**2. Consent**\n--------------\n\n278.\n\nIt is undisputed that Serbia has agreed to arbitrate disputes arising under the Canada-Serbia BIT. However, Serbia contests having given its consent to arbitrate this specific dispute pursuant to that Treaty, which the Tribunal examines below (\u00a7\u00a7348 et seq.).\n\n**3. Standing under the ICSID Convention**\n------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nSerbia contends that \"[i]n order to have *ius standi* under the ICSID Convention, Claimants must own an investment which would be a basis of jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal.\"199 Additionally, it points out that all claims raised in this arbitration are based on the incorrect assumption that the Privatization Agency illegally terminated the Privatization Agreement. That Agreement was concluded with Mr. Obradovi\u0107, not with Mr. Rand. Therefore, relying on *LESI-Dipenta,* Serbia argues that the \"Claimants do not have *jus standi* to advance those claims before the Tribunal, since the Tribunal 'cannot go into the substance of a claim if that claim is submitted to the Tribunal by a legal entity that is not bound by the Contract on which the claim is based.'\"200\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7482.\n\nRej., \u00a71039 quoting Exh. RLA-98, *Consortium Groupement L.E.S.I.- DIPENTA v. R\u00e9publique alg\u00e9rienne d\u00e9mocratique et populaire,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08, Sentence, 10 January 2005, part II, \u00a741 (English Translation from ICSID website), part II, \u00a737(iv).\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal has trouble following this argument. The ICSID Convention does not require an investor to be a party to all contracts relevant to the dispute. Mr. Rand invokes breaches of the Privatization Agreement only to the extent they constitute or evidence a breach of the Canada-Serbia BIT. It is a different question whether Mr. Rand holds substantive rights which Serbia has infringed. That is a question for the merits.\n\n**4. Conclusion on jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing that this Tribunal only has jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention over the claims brought by Mr. Rand pursuant to the Canada-Serbia BIT in respect of his interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. Accordingly, in the following sections, the Tribunal only discusses Serbia's jurisdictional arguments relevant to these claims.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction under the Canada-Serbia BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal first sets out the legal framework relevant to its jurisdiction under the Canada-Serbia BIT (1) after which it examines Serbia's jurisdictional objections ((2)-(5)).\n\n**1. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n283.\n\nArticle 2 of the Canada-Serbia BIT addresses the scope of application of the Treaty in the following terms:\n\n\"1. This Agreement shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) an investor of the other Party; and\n\n(b) a covered investment.\n\n2. The obligations in Section B apply to a person of a Party when it exercises a regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority delegated to it by that Party.\"\n\n284.\n\nSerbia's consent to arbitrate disputes with Canadian nationals is included in Article 24(1)(a) of the Canada-Serbia BIT:\n\n\"1. An investor that meets the conditions precedent in Article 22 may submit a claim to arbitration under: (a) the ICSID Convention, provided that both Parties are parties to the ICSID Convention [...].\"\n\n285.\n\nArticle 22 of the Canada-Serbia BIT, to which the dispute resolution clause just quoted refers contains several \"conditions precedent\" to arbitration and reads as follows:\n\n\"Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1. The disputing parties shall hold consultations and attempt to settle a claim amicably before an investor may submit a claim to arbitration. Unless the disputing parties agree to a longer period, consultations shall be held within 60 days of the submission of the notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration under subparagraph 2(c). The place of consultation shall be the capital of the respondent Party, unless the disputing parties otherwise agree.\n\n2. An investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Article 21 only if:\n\n(a) the investor and, where a claim is made under Article 21(2), the enterprise, consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement;\n\n(b) at least six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim;\n\n(c) the investor has delivered to the respondent Party a written notice of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration at least 90 days prior to submitting the claim, which notice shall specify:\n\n(i) the name and address of the investor and, where a claim is made under Article 21(2), the name and address of the enterprise,\n\n(ii) the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions,\n\n(iii) the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue, and\n\n(iv) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed;\n\n(d) the investor has delivered evidence establishing that it is an investor of the other Party with its notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration under subparagraph 2(c);\n\n(e) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 21(1):\n\n(i) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage thereby,\n\n(ii) the investor waives its right to initiate or continue before an administrative tribunal or court under the domestic law of a Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, proceedings with respect to the measure of the respondent Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 21, and\n\n(iii) if the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of the respondent Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise waives the right referred to under subparagraph (ii);\n\n[...]\n\n4. The disputing investor or the enterprise shall deliver the consent and waiver required under paragraph 2 to the respondent Party and the investor shall include them in the submission of a claim to arbitration. A waiver from the enterprise under subparagraphs 2(e)(iii) or 2(f)(ii) is not required if the respondent Party has deprived the investor of control of the enterprise.\"\n\n286.\n\nAccordingly, as a first condition, Article 22(2)(a) requires that the investor \"consent to arbitration in accordance with procedures set out in this agreement.\" Serbia does not contest that by filing their Request for Arbitration, the Canadian Claimants consented to arbitration in accordance with the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n287.\n\nSecond, Article 22(2)(b) requires that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim. In addition, Article 22(2)(e) stipulates that not more than three years must have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage thereby. Serbia challenges the Tribunal\u2019s *\"ratione temporis\"* jurisdiction on this basis.201\n\nSee, for instance, C-Mem., \u00a7377 (\"Respondent respectfully submits two separate *ratione temporis* objections. The first *ratione temporis* objection is based on Article 22 of the Canada - Serbia BIT. The second is based on the general principle of non-retroactivity envisaged by general international law and Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) in relation to Article 42 of the BIT.\").\n\n288.\n\nThird, Article 22(2)(c) of the Canada-Serbia BIT provides that the investor must deliver a notice of intent to resort to arbitration at least 90 days prior to submitting the claim. Pursuant to Article 22(2)(d), such notice must include evidence that the investor is an \"investor of the other Party.\" Serbia does not put into question that the Notice of Dispute served on Serbia on 8 August 2017 met this condition.\n\n289.\n\nBefore examining the *\"ratione temporis\"*objection just identified ((4) below), the Tribunal first examines Serbia\u2019s challenges the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *\"ratione materiae\"* ((2) below) and *\"ratione voluntatis\"* ((3) below). In reviewing these objections, the Tribunal has borne in mind the Claimants\u2019 investment structure reproduced above (\u00a721).\n\n**2. Investment**\n-----------------\n\n290.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, only Mr. Rand\u2019s investments related to the Beneficially Owned Shares ((a) below) and his payments for the benefit of BD Agro ((b) below) remain to be considered. Serbia\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s *ratione materiae* jurisdiction in respect of these alleged investments are considered below.\n\n***a. Interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n291.\n\nRelying on Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT, Serbia contends that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction depends on the Claimants\u2019 ability to prove that it held an investment as defined in Article 1 of the Treaty. In addition, the Claimants must show that they owned or controlled that investment. Here, says Serbia, the Claimants have failed on both counts.\n\n292.\n\nSerbia opposes the Claimants\u2019 view that their investment falls under multiple categories of investments listed in the Treaty\u2019s definition of \"investment\" under (a) to (j), in particular (a) (enterprise), (b) (share or other equity participation), (f) (interest in an enterprise), and (h) (interest arising from a commitment of resources). In respect of the Claimants\u2019 submission that their investment falls within Article 1(h), Serbia contends that the Canadian Claimants did not acquire any \"indirect interest\" in Sembi's rights under the Sembi Agreement, and that it is not clear how these Claimants could have acquired such rights without having any title on BD Agro's shares. Further, the Claimants have not explained to which precise interests they refer. Contractual rights and obligations obviously belong to the contract parties. The Canadian Claimants were not parties to the Sembi Agreement and acquired no contract rights thereunder which could be regarded as an investment under Article 1. In any event, even if the Canadian Claimants acquired \"indirect\" contract interests in the Sembi Agreement, such acquisition would naturally depend on the validity of the Agreement. As explained below, the Sembi Agreement was null and void and therefore, could not be the basis of a transfer of interest from Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to Sembi.\n\n293.\n\nSerbia further submits that even if the Sembi Agreement were considered lawful and could give rise to rights for Sembi *(quod non),* it remains that the Canadian Claimants would still not be entitled to make a direct claim based on Sembi's contract rights. Investment tribunals have repeatedly held that investors do not have standing to assert claims based on the host State's treatment of the contracts and assets of the company in which the investor holds shares.202\n\nRej., \u00a7738, citing Exh. RLA-79, *ST-AD GmbH v. Republic of Bulgaria* (UNCITRAL), PCA Case No. 2011-06, Award on Jurisdiction, \u00a7278.\n\n294.\n\nMoreover, Serbia argues that the Sembi Agreement, which purported to transfer Mr. Obradovi\u0107's shares in BD Agro to Sembi is invalid as it contravenes the Privatization Agreement. Indeed, Article 5.3.1 of the Privatization Agreement precludes Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from selling, assigning or otherwise alienating his shares in BD Agro for two years from the date of the Agreement. The provision prohibits all kinds of disposition of shares. It does not allow Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to alienate the attributes of ownership, merely keep nominal title to the shares.\n\n295.\n\nSerbia also contends that the Sembi Agreement breaches the Law on Privatization, specifically Article 41(\u017e), which prohibits any assignment without the prior authorization of the Privatization Agency. It denies the Claimants' argument that Article 41(\u017e) is inapplicable because the Sembi Agreement does not include the Agency as a contracting party. In Serbia's submission, this argument is \"plainly absurd\" as it would mean that no assignment would be covered by Article 41(\u017e), as long as the assignment contract did not mention the Agency or the requirement for prior authorization from the Agency. The Claimants also assert that the purpose of the Sembi Agreement was to transfer Mr. Obradovi\u0107's rights and obligations under the Privatization Agreement without assigning the Privatization Agreement itself. For the Respondent, this interpretation according to which any contract right and obligation is freely assignable as long as the nominal position of a contract party remains unchanged is \"downright preposterous.\" Article 41(\u017e) would be meaningless if it were read to prohibit only an assignment of nominal title.\n\n296.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 argument that Sembi Agreement is both a contract for the sale of shares and an assignment cannot be accepted. The Sembi Agreement \"creatively\" evolves from an assignment to a sale and back, in order to produce the intended effects under Cypriot law and, at the same time, avoid any prohibition of Serbian law. In any event, even if correct, this argument would not assist the Claimants. In Serbian law, ownership in shares is acquired and transferred through the registration of the new owner in the Central Securities Registry. Separate transfer of beneficial title is impossible. The Sembi Agreement thus could not result in an ownership change. If the Sembi Agreement were considered a sale of shares, it would still contradict mandatory Serbian law that prohibits trade of shares of public joint stock companies outside the stock exchange. In addition, the Agreement is invalid because of Article 359 of the 2011 Law on Companies, pursuant to which the agreement of a shareholder to vote according to instructions of a member of the board of directors is void.\n\n297.\n\nSerbia also rejects the Claimants\u2019 position that under Cypriot law a prohibited or restricted assignment can still produce valid effects between the assignee and the assignor, if the assignment is not void for reasons of illegality or public policy. It notes that, under Section 23 of Cypriot Contract Law, a contract with an object that is, it forbidden by law or would defeat the law, is null and void and produces no effects. Since the Sembi Agreement violates Article 41(z) of the Privatization Law, and, if allowed, would defeat the purpose of that norm, is null and void. In any event, rights under a contract are assignable in equity under Cypriot law only if the change in the identity of the obligor makes no difference to the obligee. This is not the case here. For Serbia, \"[t]he fact that the contract could have been concluded only with Mr. Obradovi\u0107 as the winner of the public auction and that Mr. Obradovi\u0107, based on his Serbian citizenship, was given the option unavailable to the assignee (Sembi) - to pay the purchase price in annual instalments - demonstrate [....] that personal characteristics of the Agency's counterparty were so important to the Agency as to prevent the assignment without its consent.\"203\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a780.\n\n298.\n\nMoreover, Serbia disputes the Claimants' interpretation that the Sembi Agreement transferred legal title in rights and assets that could be transferred on the date of the agreement and beneficial title to those rights and assets whose transfer required additional steps or third-party consent. The word \"together\" used in Article 4 of the Sembi Agreement connecting the transfer of the Privatization Agreement and that of other assets related to BD Agro's business held by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 shows that the transfer of such other assets was meant to follow as a result of the transfer of the Privatization Agreement, and not separately and independently.\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimants are wrong, so says Serbia, in relying on the subsequent conduct of Sembi and Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to allege that they intended for the beneficial interest in the shares to pass to Sembi immediately after the conclusion of the Agreement. First, Cypriot law does not confirm that interpretation. Second and in any event, the documents on which the Claimants rely, particularly its 2008 financial statements and 2008 income declaration are questionable as evidence. Third, the Claimants and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's conduct indicates that they considered the Sembi Agreement \"nonexistent.\" The Coropi Agreement of 2013 stipulates that Mr. Obradovi\u0107's shares in BD Agro would be transferred to Coropi, including his \"right of management, participation in profit, [...] right to a part of the liquidation mass, proportionately to the amount of purchased capital\", as well as \"[t]he right to free disposal of purchased capital [...]\", entirely omitting to mention that Sembi (and not Mr. Obradovi\u0107) was the purported owner or beneficial owner of those shares. Fourth, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 continued to act as BD Agro's owner even after the Sembi Agreement. For instance, funds obtained by Crveni Signal from the 2010 Loan were eventually transferred to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's personal bank accounts in the period starting from December 2010, nearly three years after the conclusion of the Sembi Agreement. Finally, there is no proof that Sembi ever fulfilled its obligations under the Sembi Agreement, including taking over the EUR 4.8 million debt of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's mentioned there.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants insist that their investment falls within multiple categories of investment listed in sub-articles (a) to (j), including sub-articles (a)(b)(f) and (h) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.204 In the Claimants\u2019 submission, they only need to establish that their alleged investments fall within the ambit of any one asset listed in Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT.205 Further, as the Canada-Serbia BIT expressly applies to investments \"directly or indirectly owned or controlled\" by Canadian nationals, even those investments indirectly controlled by the Canadian Claimants would fall within the scope of the Treaty.\n\nSee, for instance, Reply, \u00a7\u00a7625, 630, Rej. J., \u00a7446, C-PHB 1, \u00a761.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00a714 (\"The Claimants\u2019 investments are protected in three distinct capacities: (i) their beneficial ownership over the Beneficially Owned Shares, (ii) their control over BD Agro, and (iii) their interest in Sembi\u2019s rights under the Sembi Agreement. Even one would be sufficient to trigger the protections of the BITs.\").\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the rights stemming from the Sembi Agreement qualify as an investment under sub-article (h) of the Canada-Serbia BIT. Sembi committed capital in Serbia by repaying the loans taken by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from the Lundin family for the acquisition of BD Agro\u2019s shares and for investments in BD Agro\u2019s operations. The funds for repaying such loans were provided to Sembi, and thus ultimately committed by Mr. Rand.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants reject Serbia\u2019s assertion that Serbian law governs the assignment of equitable rights in the Beneficially Owned Shares. They argue that the parties to the Sembi Agreement were free to choose the governing law and chose Cypriot law. The result is that Cypriot law governs the relationship between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi. Serbian law only applies to the transfer of legal title in the Beneficially Owned Shares.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute Serbia\u2019s allegation that the Sembi Agreement conflicts with Article 41(\u017e) of the Law on Privatization and is thus null and void. Cypriot law, which is the law of the contract, recognizes the transfer of interest as valid and enforceable. Even if Article 41(\u017e) were considered mandatory and would thus override Cypriot law, the outcome would be the same. Pursuant to Cypriot law, even if an assignment is not effective against the debtor (Serbia), it produces effects between the assignee (the Claimants) and the assignor (Mr. Obradovi\u0107).\n\n304.\n\nFurther and again in any event, according to Serbian law, the notion of assignment is narrower than under Cypriot law. It only denotes a transfer of legal title. Under the Sembi Agreement, legal title to the assets which could be transferred to Sembi without the need for additional documents, did vest in Sembi immediately upon conclusion. For those assets for which additional steps were required, beneficial ownership passed immediately. Since the immediate transfer contemplated in the Agreement does not qualify as an assignment under Serbian law, it cannot trigger the application of Article 41(\u017e). In addition, the Privatization Agreement was not \"assigned\" to Sembi, as Serbia would have it, because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 remained the party to the Privatization Agreement. There was thus no need for the Privatization Agency's approval. When the Claimants intended to assign the Privatization Agreement to Coropi, they indeed asked for the Agency's approval (which was arbitrarily withheld).\n\n305.\n\nFourth, the Respondent's witnesses admitted that shares could be \"alienated\" separately from the Privatization Agreement itself. Nothing prevented Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from transferring the Beneficially Owned Shares to Sembi independently of the Privatization Agreement, which is what he did through the Sembi Agreement.\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimants also challenge Serbia's argument that contracts cannot be assigned to a third party when the identity of the original party is of particular importance. It stresses that Serbia has not cited any authority for this proposition. This is all the more revealing considering that Serbia's experts testified that, even when the identity of the contract party matters, the economic benefit of the contract can be assigned to a third party. In any event, even if such a requirement existed *(quod non),* senior officials in the Serbian government and the Privatization Agency were aware of Mr. Rand's involvement.\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that both the terms of the Sembi Agreement and the Parties' subsequent conduct confirm that they understood that the Sembi Agreement transferred equitable rights over the Beneficially Owned Shares to Sembi. At the outset, the Claimants submit that the terms of the Agreement, particularly Article 4, are \"clear and unambiguous\" and cover the transfer of equitable rights over the Beneficial Owned Shares. There is thus no need to look any further to determine the Parties' intent. However, even if the Tribunal were to do so, it would only confirm this position. The effective parties to the Sembi Agreement, i.e. Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Rand, attest that they intended to transfer beneficial ownership in the Beneficially Owned Shares through the Sembi Agreement. This fact is evident from the conduct of the parties to the Sembi Agreement. Indeed, immediately after signing the Sembi Agreement, Sembi became involved in BD Agro's affairs and discussed those affairs at meetings of the Board of Directors. Sembi also recorded its beneficial ownership of the Beneficially Owned Shares in its 2008 financial statements.\n\n**(3) Analysis**\n----------------\n\n308.\n\nArticle 2 of the Canada-Serbia BIT reproduced above (\u00a7283) sets out that the Treaty applies to measures adopted by a Party relating to an investor of the other Party and a covered investment.\n\n309.\n\nArticle 1 of the Treaty defines a \"covered investment\" in the following terms:206\n\n\"'covered investment' means, with respect to a Party, an investment in its territory that is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an investor of the other Party existing on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, as well as an investment made or acquired thereafter.\"\n\nExh. CLA-1, Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 27 April 2015.\n\n310.\n\nThe same BIT provision gives the following definition of an investment:\n\n\"'investment' means:\n\n(a) an enterprise;\n\n(b) a share, stock or other form of equity participation in an enterprise;\n\n(c) bond, debenture or other debt instrument of an enterprise;\n\n(d) a loan to an enterprise;\n\n[...]\n\n(f) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise;\n\n(g) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of that enterprise on dissolution;\n\n(h) an interest arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in that territory, such as under: [...] (ii) a contract where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise\n\n[...].\"\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine whether Mr. Rand had an investment (i) under the Canada-Serbia BIT, and, if so, whether it was a covered investment (ii).\n\n***(i) Investment***\n--------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their investment falls within several categories of investment listed in sub-articles (a) to (j), in particular sub-articles (a)(b)(f) and (h).207 They insist that it is sufficient for their investment to correspond to one of the categories mentioned in Article 1.\n\nSee, for instance, Reply, \u00a7\u00a7625, 630, Rej. J., \u00a7446, C-PHB 1, \u00a761.\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Mr. Rand's investment falls within the ambit of Article 1(h) of the Treaty i.e. \"an interest arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in that territory.\" Indeed, each of the requirements of Article 1(h) are satisfied in this case:\n\n**(a) Interest**\n----------------\n\n314.\n\nTo qualify as in investment under Article 1(h) of the Serbia-Canada BIT, there must first be an \"interest.\" This term is undefined. As it appears in an international treaty, it must be interpreted in accordance with the Vienna Convention by giving the term its ordinary meaning, in its context and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. The term \"interest\" has a wide range of meanings from \"wanting to be involved with and to discover more about something\" to \"something that brings advantages to or affects someone or something\" among others.208 In an economic sense, \"interest\" is understood as \"money that is charged, esp. by a bank, when you borrow money, or money that is paid to you for the use of your money\" and \"an involvement or a legal right, usually relating to a business or possessions.\" In the context of Article 1 and the definition of investment, it is this latter connotation that is relevant. Any involvement or legal right would thus suffice to constitute an \"interest\" in its ordinary meaning. That the term is to be interpreted broadly is also evident from its context: items (i) and (ii) in sub-article (h) recognize that an interest can arise out of a broad range of contracts (\"contract involving the presence of an investor's property in the territory of the Party\"; \"contract where remuneration depends substantially on production, revenues, or profits of an enterprise\"). Moreover, Articles 1(k) and (l) recognize that all types of investments listed in Articles 1(a)-(h) are \"kinds of interests\", once again making clear that the term is to be understood broadly.209 Thus, shares, bonds, loans, are all interests that are protected by the Treaty as is any contractual right relating to a business.210\n\nCambridge Dictionary, available at https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/interest.\n\nExh. CLA-1, Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 27 April 2015, Art. 1 (\"but 'investment\u2019 does not mean: (k) a claim to money that arises solely from: (i) a commercial contract for the sale of a good or service by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of the other Party, or (ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing; or (l) any other claim to money; that does not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) to (j).\").\n\nArbitral tribunals have also recognized several different types of \"interests\" as investments. See, for instance, Claimants\u2019 Opening Presentation, pp. 182, 183 referring *inter alia* to Exh. CLA-5, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment of the Award, 2 November 2015, \u00a7272 (\"[n]either the international law principles nor the Committee\u2019s decision imply that investors holding beneficial ownership are left unprotected from interferences by host States.

It includes 'every kind of assets\u2019 and enumerates specific categories of investments as examples. One of those categories consists of 'shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures.\u2019 The plain meaning of this provision is that shares or other kind of interests held by Dutch shareholders in a company or in a joint venture having made investment on Venezuelan territory are protected under Article 1.\"); Exh.

Promissory notes, hedging agreements, sovereign bonds, contracts for the provision of services and arbitral awards crystallizing a party's rights and obligations have all been recognized as protected investments.

Mr. Obradovi\u0107 agrees to sign any such documents and do all such things as may be necessary to effect the transfer to [Sembi] of the [Privatization Agreement] together with any other assets whatsoever held by Mr. Obradovi\u0107 which are related to the business of BD Agro.\"214\n\nAs mentioned above, on 29 August 2006, BD Agro\u2019s General Assembly increased its capital by issuing an additional 171,974 shares, all of which were issued to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 (the New Shares). Accordingly, Mr. Obradovi\u0107's shareholding in BD Agro increased from 70% to 75.87%. The Privatized Shares and the New Shares make up the Beneficially Owned Shares.\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005, Art. 1.1.\n\nExh. CE-29, Agreement between D. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi, 22 February 2008.\n\nExh. CE-29, Agreement between D. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi, 22 February 2008.\n\n316.\n\nIn other words, through the Sembi Agreement, Sembi acquired a contractual \"interest\" in the Privatization Agreement which, at least, included an interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares.\n\n317.\n\nInitially, the Claimants asserted that their interest was their \"beneficial ownership\" over the Beneficially Owned Shares. Serbia objected *inter alia* that \"beneficial ownership\" was not recognized in Serbia at the time of the Sembi Agreement. Later, the Claimants submitted that, irrespective of beneficial ownership, they had a protected interest arising out of the Sembi Agreement.215 The Tribunal agrees. As just mentioned, through the Sembi Agreement, Sembi acquired a contractual interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. The type of interest and whether it is recognized under domestic law is not determinative for purposes of sub-section (h). What matters is that Sembi has an interest that falls within the ambit of Article 1(h).\n\nSee C-PHB 1, \u00a790 (\"[L]eaving aside beneficial ownership as a special category of ownership (i.e., leaving aside the Occidental annulment decision), the Sembi Agreement created enforceable rights against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 under Cypriot law (regardless of whether they are labelled as an assignment of beneficial ownership of the Beneficially Owned Shares or not). Those rights constitute an 'investment\u2019 [...]. It matters not that the rights are only enforceable against Mr. Obradovi\u0107; this is indeed normal for all contractual rights. From the perspective of the Canada-Serbia BIT, the same rights would also create an indirectly owned/held interest in BD Agro under Articles (f) and (h)(ii) of the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\").\n\n318.\n\nSerbia objects that no interest was transferred through the Sembi Agreement because the Agreement itself is invalid. That objection is not well-founded. The Sembi Agreement contains a choice of Cypriot law. The Parties' experts agree, and rightly so, that Cypriot law governs the relationship between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Sembi.216 There is no indication that the Sembi Agreement is invalid under the applicable law of Cyprus. At the hearing, Serbia's expert Professor Emilianides, admitted that interests in the Beneficially Owned Shares transferred to Sembi immediately upon conclusion of the Sembi Agreement.217 Thus, there is no ground to argue that the Sembi Agreement did not give rise to a valid interest in Sembi's favour.\n\nGeorgiades ER II, \u00a7\u00a73.5-3.6; Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 6, 182:3-10 (Emilianides).\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 6, 184:24-185:25 (Emilianides).\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the validity of the Sembi Agreement on the basis of Serbian law. It argues that the Agreement is invalid because it violates Article 41(\u017e) of the Privatization Law, which it contends applies despite the choice of Cypriot law because it is mandatory. The Claimants do not appear to seriously contest that Article 41 (\u017e) is mandatory but contest its application in this case.\n\n320.\n\nPursuant to ordinary rules of conflict of laws, a mandatory norm of a legal system other than the one applicable to a contract cannot displace the law of the contract unless it is a so-called overriding mandatory rule, also called *loi d\u2019application imm\u00e9diate* or *loi de police218* Even assuming that Article 41(\u017e) of the Privatization Law is such an overriding mandatory norm, an issue that the Tribunal can leave open, the Tribunal is of the opinion that it would not nullify the Sembi Agreement.\n\nUgljesa Grusic ER I, \u00a7\u00a763, 76 (\"Despite the fact that the [Serbian] Private International Law Act does not mention the concept of overriding mandatory provisions, there is an agreement in legal theory that Serbian private international law recognises this concept. The concept is known under the name of \"norme neposredne primene,\" which is a literal translation of the French term \"lois d'application imm\u00e9diate,\" or under the name \"prinudni propisi u me\u0111unarodnom smislu,\" which can be translated into English as \"mandatory provisions in the international sense\" [...] Articles 41\u017e and 59 of the 2001 Law on Privatisation [...] can be regarded as overriding mandatory provisions under Serbian private international law.\").\n\n321.\n\nArticle 41(\u017e) of the Privatization Law reads:219\n\n\"Subject to prior consent of the Agency, the buyer of the capital (hereinafter: assignor) may assign the agreement on sale of the capital or property to a third party (hereinafter: assignee) under the conditions stipulated by this law and the law on obligations.\n\nThe assignee may be a person who meets the conditions prescribed for the buyer of the capital or the propriety.\n\nThe assignor shall guarantee to the Agency that the assignee will meet his obligations from the assigned agreement on sale of the capital or property.\n\nAfter the assignment of agreement on sale of the capital or property, the assignee shall attain all the rights and obligations from the agreement on sale.\"\n\nExh. CE-220, 2001 Law on Privatization, Art. 41(\u017e).\n\n322.\n\nArticle 41(\u017e) thus requires the Privatization Agency's approval for the assignment of privatization agreements. To the Tribunal, this provision does not apply in this instance. Article 4 of the Sembi Agreement (reproduced above) contemplates two transfers: the transfer of \"right, title and interest\" in the Privatization Agreement for which no further actions are required, and the transfer of the Privatization Agreement itself for which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 agreed to sign any documents and do any further acts required to effectuate the transfer of the Agreement. These transfers could take place independently of each other, with only the latter requiring the approval of the Agency. The Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Georgiades confirmed this interpretation of the Agreement,220 and his testimony was not convincingly rebutted. As the Sembi Agreement does not immediately transfer the Privatization Agreement itself but does transfer Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s \"interests\" in the Privatization Agreement to Sembi, the provisions of Article 41(\u017e) would not be attracted.\n\nGeorgiades ER II, \u00a73.12 et. seq., particularly, \u00a7\u00a73.21-3.23 (\"In respect of the rights and assets, such as the BD Agro Shares or the interest in the Privatization Agreement, whose legal title remained with Mr Obradovic, transfer of legal title would have to be effected in accordance with the law applicable to such rights. [...] Therefore, even if Serbian law did not allow transfer of rights in the Privatization Agreement, this would not defeat the equitable assignment of such rights under Cyprus law, by virtue of the Sembi Agreement. In other words, the equitable assignment of these rights to Sembi is unaffected by Serbian law. [...] The transfer of legal title to the BD Agro Shares from Mr Obradovic to Sembi had to be effected in accordance with Serbian law. Nevertheless, under the Sembi Agreement, Sembi became the beneficial owner of the BD Agro Shares regardless of any restrictions on the transfer of legal title to the BD Agro Shares under Serbian law\").\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation of this position in the text of the Privatization Agreement itself: through Article 5.3.1, BD Agro\u2019s shares could be sold, assigned, or alienated two years after the conclusion of the Agreement without the approval of the Agency.221 The Agreement thus contemplates a transfer of shares (for which no approval is required) as an act distinct from the transfer of the Privatization Agreement (for which approval is required). Ms. Julijana Vu\u010dkovi\u0107, Director of the Privatization Agency's Center for Control, admitted that it was possible to \"alienate\" the interests in a privatization agreement (including the shares of the privatized entity) separately from the privatization agreement itself:\n\n\"Mr. Misetic: Ms Vu\u010dkovi\u0107, the transcript says you said: \"... we had as a clear omission in our agreements ... where we allowed disposal of capital during the validity of the agreement, we generally allowed shares to be alienated and we were still monitoring the agreement which was a substantial problem.\" That's what you told the Commission, correct?\n\nMs. Vu\u010dkovi\u0107: Yes, that's correct. It had to do exactly with this. You allow alienation of the shares by removing the pledge, and you allow the buyer to dispose of the shares, while the agreement is in force, and it's not been honoured, so you have no further influence when it comes to the privatization agreement.\"222\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005, Art. 5.3.1 (\"5.3 Further obligations of the Buyer [...] The Buyer undertakes that he will not perform or allow performance of the following actions, without previous written approval by the Agency: 5.3.1 he will not sell, assign or otherwise alienate shares in the period of 2 years as of the day of conclusion of the agreement.\").\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 4, 66:17-67:04. (Vu\u010dkovi\u0107).\n\n324.\n\nAs a result, Serbia's challenge to the validity of the Sembi Agreement based on of Article 41(\u017e) of the Privatization Law cannot be sustained.\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the validity of the Sembi Agreement on the ground of another mandatory Serbian law, the 2006 Securities Law, which prohibits the sale of shares in a public joint stock company outside the organized share market.223 The Claimants do not appear to seriously contest that Article 52(2) is mandatory,224 but dispute its application to the present facts. However, this provision restricts the \"trading\" or sale of securities.225 A \"sale\" under Serbian law results in the change of the legal owner of an asset.226 Thus, this provision is only concerned with the transfer of legal title to shares, not the transfer of an interest in shares. As a result, it would not apply in the present situation, which does not contemplate a change in legal title to the Beneficially Owned Shares but only the creation of an interest in those shares.\n\nExh. RE-111,2006 Law on Market in Securities and Other Financial Instruments, Art. 52(2).\n\nUgljesa Grusic ER I, \u00a776 (\"Article 52(2) of the 2006 Law on Market in Securities and Other Financial Instruments can be regarded as overriding mandatory provisions under Serbian private international law\").\n\nExh. RE-111, 2006 Law on Market in Securities and Other Financial Instruments, Art. 52 (\"Trade of securities shall be performed exclusively in organized market in the Republic which includes stock exchange and over-the-counter markets, unless otherwise determined by this Law. Trade of securities [just] specified shall be performed exclusively in compliance with the provisions of this Law, unless otherwise determined by this Law.\").\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 ER II, \u00a7188.\n\n326.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal dismisses Serbia's argument that \"if Serbian law allows for separate transfer of beneficial ownership in shares, rules regulating the market of securities must apply to such transfer as well [...]\", to which the Respondent adds that the \"Claimants' interpretation would leave restrictive rules from national laws of the state parties to the BITs without any purpose - those rules would be easily circumvented by simply labeling investors' rights as beneficial.\"227 As just explained, Article 52(2) does not prohibit the transfer of interests in shares. It attaches to the transfer of legal title in shares, which produces certain legal effects such as the registration in the Central Securities Depository.228 Sembi does not take advantage of those legal effects, circumventing the restrictions of Serbian law. To the contrary, the Claimants admit that Sembi does not hold legal title to the Beneficially Owned Shares. Sembi does, however, hold an interest in the Beneficially Owned shares, which is not prohibited by Article 52(2).\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00a752.\n\nSee, for instances, Radovi\u0107 ER I, \u00a771.\n\n327.\n\nFurthermore, Serbia invokes the invalidity of the Sembi Agreement based on Article 295(1) of the 2004 Law on Companies and Article 359 of the 2011 Law on Companies, which are in essence identical:\n\n\"Agreement by which a shareholder or proxy undertakes obligation to vote according to instructions of joint stock company or member of the board of directors, director or member of executive board is null and void.\"\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Mr. Rand was not a party to the Sembi Agreement. The restriction contained in Article 359 would thus not automatically apply, especially when Serbian law provides that any restrictions on rights are to be interpreted narrowly.229 Besides, Mr. Rand ceased to be a member of BD Agro's board on 9 July 2012. Thus, the breach, if any, of Article 359 of the Law on Companies was cured on that date. Further still, it is not evident that Article 359 would negate the entire Sembi Agreement or only the part thereof requiring Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to vote as instructed by Sembi.\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 ER III, \u00a757.\n\n329.\n\nIt follows from the analysis above that, through the Sembi Agreement, Sembi acquired a contractual interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. That interest was acquired through the commitment of capital in Serbia. Indeed, as was already discussed, through Sembi, Mr. Rand repaid to the Lundin Family the monies lent to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for the acquisition of shares in further investment in BD Agro.\n\n**(b) Capital or other resources committed in Serbia**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nIn addition to an interest, Article 1(h) of the Canada-Serbia BIT requires that the interest be acquired through the commitment of capital in Serbia. This requirement is satisfied too. Indeed, funds lent by the Lundins, for which Mr. Rand bore the financial burden, were transferred to bank accounts in Serbia for use in the country, as is clear from the corresponding payment confirmations.230\n\nSee, for e.g., Exh. CE-384, Confirmation of transfer of EUR 3,312,740 from Mr. Lundin to Marine Drive Holding, 15 September 2005.\n\n**(c) Economic activity in Serbia**\n-----------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nThe commitment of capital and other resources was made towards the activity of the BD Agro farm, which is economic in nature. At the time of Mr. Rand's initial investment in 2005, BD Agro was in a poor condition.231 During his involvement, it became one of the most modern dairy farms in Europe.232 It is therefore clear that the contribution of resources at issue was made towards an economic activity in Serbia in the meaning of Article 1(h) of the BIT.\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, 3:15-4:17 (Rand).\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, 4:18-5:9 (Rand).

CE-33, Letter from the Ministry of Economy to the Privatization Agency, 30 May 2012.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that Sembi's contractual interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares is an investment falling within the meaning of Article 1(h) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n***(ii) Covered investment***\n-----------------------------\n\nAccording to the Treaty definition reproduced above, a \"covered investment\" is an investment in the territory of a Contracting Party that is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by an investor of the other Contracting Party. Serbia does not challenge the fact that, as a Canadian national, Mr. Rand is an investor.233 Neither does it dispute that Mr. Rand controlled Sembi. Instead, it relies on such control to argue that Sembi does not have a seat in Cyprus.234 As Mr. Rand controls Sembi's contractual interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares, his investment is a covered investment, which is protected by the Treaty.\n\nExh. CLA-1, Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 27 April 2015, (\"Canada-Serbia BIT\"), Art. 1: \"'investor of a Party\" means a Party, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment. For greater certainty, it is understood that an investor seeks to make an investment only when the investor has taken concrete steps necessary to make the said investment, such as when the investor has made an application for permit or licence authorising the establishment of an investment.\"\n\nSee, for e.g. Rej., \u00a71001 quoting Reply, \u00a7105.\n\n***b. Payments for the benefit of BD Agro***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention to consider claims arising out of these alleged investments (\u00a7\u00a7274 et seq.). As a result, the Tribunal could dispense with examining whether jurisdiction exists in accordance with the Canada-Serbia BIT. However, in particular because the Claimants have not addressed this issue in the context of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal will also examine Serbia's jurisdictional objections under the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n334.\n\nSerbia argues that Mr. Rand's payments for the benefit of BD Agro do not qualify as investments under the Canada-Serbia BIT. Although the Claimants characterize these payments as \"loans to an enterprise\" under Article 1(d) of the BIT, their submissions are unclear as to whether the payments are loans or rather expenses aimed at securing the continuity of BD Agro's business operations. As observed in *Inmaris v. Ukraine,* payments made in furtherance of an investment are not investments themselves. Thus, if the Claimants were the owners of BD Agro, the payments made and expenses incurred in the day-to-day operations of BD Agro could not be regarded as a separate investment under the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that not all monetary claims fall within the scope of the Canada-Serbia BIT. In reality, most of such claims are expressly excluded. Thus, payments made for the benefit of BD Agro could give rise to a monetary claim by Mr. Rand against the company but would not constitute investments under the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n336.\n\nMoreover, Serbia alleges that there are no documents on record that establish the so-called \"loans\" granted by Mr. Rand to BD Agro. For example, the majority of Mr. Rand's payments - nearly EUR 2.2 million - were made for the purchase and transport of heifers to BD Agro. Those payments were recorded as claims of Mr. Rand against BD Agro in the bankruptcy proceedings. However, the Commercial Court in Belgrade held that Mr. Rand had not made such payments and the payments for the purchase of livestock were recorded in the bankruptcy as \"unofficial uncommanded agency under Article 220 of the Law on Contracts and Torts [Law on Obligations].\" As a result, they must be treated as \"any other claim to money\", which are expressly excluded from the protection offered by the Canada-Serbia BIT. The same applies to the payments made to BD Agro's consultants.\n\n337.\n\nSerbia adds that, even if the payments in question were considered as loans, they would not be part of the definition of investment under the Canada-Serbia BIT, which does not cover \"the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing\" (Article 1(k)(ii)). The negotiating history of the BIT confirms that it was the Parties' intention to exclude loans for the purchase of goods and services from the ambit of the Treaty.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mr. Rand made payments of approximately EUR 2.2 million for the replacement of BD Agro's herd. Through Rand Investments, Mr. Rand also paid approximately EUR 160,000 for the services provided to BD Agro by herd management experts Messrs. Wood and Calin. These payments were loans to an enterprise, qualifying as investment under Article 1(d) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimants reject Serbia's argument that, if they really were the owners of BD Agro, these payments cannot constitute loans, because monies expended towards day to day operations are not separate investments. That argument assumes that a shareholder cannot grant a loan to a company, which is obviously wrong. Moreover, \"shares\" and \"loans\" are separate categories of \"investment\" in the Canada-Serbia BIT and must be treated as such.\n\n340.\n\nThe Claimants equally dispute Serbia's view that they have not furnished evidence of Mr. Rand's loans. The Canada-Serbia BIT does not require that a loan be based on a written contract to constitute an investment.\n\n341.\n\nIn respect of Serbia's assertion that some of Mr. Rand's payments cannot constitute an investment because they are in the nature of a \"claim to money that arises solely from [...] the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing\", the Claimants emphasize that payments for the replacement of BD Agro's herd did not constitute trade financing, because they were linked to Mr. Rand's beneficial ownership of BD Agro.\n\n**(3) Analysis**\n----------------\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mr. Rand made payments of approximately EUR 2.2 million for the replacement of BD Agro's herd and that he paid approximately EUR 160,000 for the services that the herd management experts Messrs. Wood and Calin provided to BD Agro. The Claimants insist that these payments were \"loans\" to BD Agro and thus \"loans to an enterprise\", qualifying as an investment under Article 1(d) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n343.\n\nThe evidence on record shows that, in 2008, Mr. Rand paid EUR 2.2 million directly to Canadian suppliers and vendors for the purchase of heifers and for their transport from Canada to BD Agro.235 It also shows that Mr. Rand made payments to Messrs. Wood and Calin.236 However, except for Mr. Rand's testimony, there is no evidence on record that these payments were loans granted by Mr. Rand to BD Agro.237\n\nExh.

CE-68, Overview of Payments to Mr. Gligor Calin. See also, Rand WS I, \u00a7\u00a740, 44.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Commercial Court in Belgrade examined Mr. Rand's claim of EUR 2.2 million in the course of BD Agro's bankruptcy proceedings and found that those payments were not made in accordance with an agreement: \"[t]he Creditor [Mr. Rand] did not make payments on grounds of an agreement concluded with the bankruptcy debtor [BD Agro].\" See Exh. CE-136, Commercial Court in Belgrade Decision number 9. St-321/2015, 30 March 2018, Decision on the List of Determined and Contested Claims, p. 2 (English translation). The Claimants have supplied no evidence to the contrary.\n\n344.\n\nIn the circumstances, all that Mr. Rand had in respect of the EUR 2.2 million and the EUR 160,000 payments, was a claim to money. This is all the more evident for the EUR 2.2 million payments as, in BD Agro's bankruptcy, these purchases were registered as \"unofficial uncommanded agency in accordance with Article 220 of the Law on Contracts and Torts [Law on Obligations].\"238 Such claims are expressly excluded under Articles 1(k) and (l) of the Canada-Serbia BIT, which provide that \"investment\" does not mean:\n\n\"(k) a claim to money that arises solely from: (i) a commercial contract for the sale of a good or service by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of the other Party, or (ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing; or\n\n(l) any other claim to money; that does not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) to (j).\"\n\nExh. CE-136, Commercial Court in Belgrade Decision number 9. St-321/2015,30 March 2018, Decision on the List of Determined and Contested Claims, p. 2 (English translation).\n\n345.\n\nIn any event, even if the payments for the purchases of livestock and services were deemed to be loans, they would still be excluded under the Treaty. As was just seen, Article 1 (k)(ii) excepts from the definition of investment \"the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing.\" The meaning of \"commercial transaction\" is evident from Article 1 (k)(i), which describes a commercial contract as a \"contract for the sale of a good or service by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of the other Party.\" The purchase and transport of heifers as well as the provision of management services thus fall within the notion of \"commercial transaction.\"\n\n346.\n\nIn its post-hearing submission, Serbia articulated a separate jurisdictional challenge, according to which this Tribunal does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction under the Canada-Serbia BIT, because the impugned measures do not relate to the Canadian Claimants as required by Article 2 of the BIT.239 The Tribunal does not agree. Article 2 of the Treaty specifies that it applies to measures of a Party relating to an investor of the other Party who holds a covered investment.240 These requirements are met in this case. Mr. Rand is an investor under the Canada-Serbia BIT having a protected investment. The impugned measures, including the Agency's failure to release the pledge, termination of the Privatization Agreement, and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares, all relate to Mr. Rand's investment.\n\nR-PHB I, \u00a7112 et seq.\n\n***c. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n347.\n\nIt follows from the discussion above that Mr. Rand's control over Sembi's contractual interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares is a covered investment satisfying the requirements of Article 1 of the Canada-Serbia BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction in respect of claims arising out of that investment.\n\n**3. Illegality**\n-----------------\n\n348.\n\nSerbia submits that the Claimants have shown \"utter disrespect\" to Serbian law and that their purported investment is tainted with \"unlawfulness, fraud and deceit\", making it \"unworthy of protection.\" In particular, Serbia contends that Mr. Rand's investment is unlawful \"due to illicit and deceitful conduct\" in the participation in the public auction for BD Agro and conclusion of the Privatization Agreement; payment of the purchase price; fulfilment of investment obligations; disposal of BD Agro's land; and overall asset extraction scheme applied against BD Agro. Serbia alleges that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 violated Serbian law by breaching regulations governing the trading of securities (the \"Securities Law Objection\"); failing to disclose Mr. Rand's beneficial ownership to the Privatization Agency (the \"Non-Disclosure Objection\"); misappropriating funds from BD Agro's bank accounts (the \"Siphoning Objection\"); and illegally disposing of BD Agro's land (the \"Land Machination Objection\") (the latter three objections are referred to together as the \"New Illegality Objections\").\n\n***a. Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) Admissibility of the new illegality objections**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants' challenge to the admissibility of the New Illegality Objections on the basis that the objections are not new. According to Serbia, these objections were mentioned in the Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder and arise out of issues and facts discussed by the Parties in their submissions. In any event, the illegality complained of is of such a character that the Tribunal must review it at its own discretion.\n\n**(2) Scope of the illegality objections**\n------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nSerbia contends that the legality requirement is not limited to a breach of national laws and regulations, but also relates to the breach of general international legal principles, such as the principle of good faith. Further, the Tribunal should not focus only on one aspect of the investment but assess the investor's conduct comprehensively throughout the relevant period. This is especially so as the Claimants' purported investment was not a \"one-time act conducted on a single day\", but rather consisted in a complex set of transactions starting with the initial privatization process and continuing throughout the following years. For the Respondent, while illegality at the time of making the investment deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction, illegality during the performance of the investment is equally relevant as it defeats claims as a matter of merits.\n\n351.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Claimants' position that the objections are not concerned with the \"making\" of the Claimants' investment. It insists that the illegality analysis must continue at least until 8 April 2011, which is the date on which the last instalment of the purchase price was paid. The Securities Law Objection is concerned with the making of the Claimants' investment as it is based on breaches of rules on trading in securities. Similarly, the Non-Disclosure Objection relates to deceitful conduct in obtaining BD Agro's capital, and the Siphoning and Land Machination Objections address how monies to pay the purchase price of BD Agro were obtained. Therefore, all these objections deal with establishing or making the investment.\n\n**(3) Merits of the illegality objections**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nIn any event, according to Serbia, even if the Tribunal were not to follow the submissions above, it would nevertheless have to sustain Serbia's illegality objections on their merits.\n\n***(i) The Securities Law Objection***\n--------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nSerbia alleges that the MDH and Sembi Agreements were both contracts that contemplated the transfer of shares in a joint stock company outside the stock exchange. They thus contravened the 2002 and 2006 Securities Laws, pursuant to which securities can only be traded over the Belgrade Stock Exchange. The Sembi Agreement additionally violated Article 41(\u017e) of the Privatization Law.\n\n354.\n\nSerbia further submits that Mr. Rand's acquisition of 3.9% shareholding in BD Agro through MDH Serbia triggered an obligation on Mr. Obradovi\u0107, Mr. Rand, MDH, Sembi and MDH Serbia to issue a mandatory takeover bid for the BD Agro shares held by others. Had their failure to do so been discovered by the Serbian authorities, Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Rand would have lost control over BD Agro.241 For Serbia, the indirect acquisition of 3.9% of BD Agro's equity by Mr. Rand through MDH Serbia was illegal as it breached mandatory rules of Serbian law.\n\nRej., \u00a7823.\n\n***(ii) The Non-Disclosure Objection***\n---------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nFor Serbia, Mr. Rand misled the Agency during the Privatization and obtained his investment through \"misrepresentation\", \"deceitful conduct\",242 \"fraud\", \"breaching Serbian laws and by taking unlawful advantage over other participants at the auction for Privatization.\"243 Serbia's legislation at the time of BD Agro's auction allowed an individual or an entity to participate in an auction through an agent. If so, the agent was to submit a certified power of attorney before the auction. However, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 appeared at the auction acting in his own name and on his own behalf and there was no mention whatsoever of Mr. Rand.\n\nRej., \u00a712.\n\nRej., \u00a7808.\n\n356.\n\nSerbia further contends that Mr. Rand did not disclose that he was the actual buyer of BD Agro and presented Mr. Obradovi\u0107 as such because, unlike a foreign national, a Serbian citizen would benefit from the possibility to pay the purchase price in instalments. It adds that \"Mr. Rand effectively had a grace period of one year following the auction, after which he had to pay the remaining Purchase Price in five equal annual instalments, with no interest.\" Another reason for Mr. Rand's non-disclosure, says Serbia, was an \"evasion of liability\"244: the arrangement with Mr. Obradovi\u0107 would make it impossible to determine the actual owner of the investment. For Serbia, \"[i]n the event that the illegalities were to be discovered by the authorities, any criminal prosecution would be directed towards the \"nominal\" controlling owner and manager of the company.\"245 Serbia adds that the Claimants have not furnished any credible explanation of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's motives to participate in this arrangement with Mr. Rand.\n\nRej., \u00a7804.\n\nRej., \u00a7803.\n\n***(iii) Siphoning Objection***\n-------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nSerbia claims that the payment of the purchase price was the obligation of the buyer, *i.e.* Mr. Obradovi\u0107. Therefore, using funds of the privatized company itself to pay the purchase price constituted fraud. In this context, the Respondent alleges that most of the instalments of the purchase price were settled with BD Agro funds:\n\n\u2022 The third instalment was paid out of a loan transferred from NLB Bank to BD Agro and forwarded on that same day from BD Agro's account to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's account;\n\n\u2022 The fourth instalment was paid out of the proceeds of the sale of BD Agro's land as well as loans from Agrobanka and Banka Intesa to BD Agro, which were transferred to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's account;\n\n\u2022 The fifth instalment was paid out of a loan from Agrobanka to BD Agro, and forwarded on that same day to Mr. Obradovi\u0107; and\n\n\u2022 The sixth instalment and late interest was paid out of funds transferred from BD Agro's account to Inex's and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's accounts.\n\n358.\n\nFor the Respondent, the record evidences that Mr. Obradovi\u0107's business model consisted in BD Agro borrowing money from banks and transferring it to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to pay the purchase price to the Agency. This was only possible, says Serbia, because the Privatization Agency was tricked into believing that it provided the option of payment in instalments to a person entitled to this incentive, which turned out not to be the case.\n\n359.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that Serbia has not considered transactions outside those reflected in BD Agro\u2019s bank accounts, Serbia contends that even if such transactions are considered, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 extracted at least EUR 0.5 million from BD Agro, as the Claimants\u2019 own expert confirmed. Moreover, while the Claimants complain about Serbia\u2019s reliance on the descriptions of the transaction listed in the BD Agro\u2019s bank statements, they have not explained why those descriptions were wrong.\n\n**3.** ***Land Machination Objection***\n---------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nSerbia contends that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 fraudulently extracted between EUR 1.4 to 3.3 million for himself and his associates through \"land machinations.\" For example, land which was nominally assigned to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for EUR 400,000 was resold by him in a matter of months for EUR 1,417,000, and then later for EUR 3.3 million (the \"Land Swap Case\"). The value of the land was thus 3.5 to 8 times higher than the amount of the shareholder loan that it was supposed to settle. There was still another attempt to extract an even higher amount through other disposals of BD Agro\u2019s land, which was, however, successfully prevented by the Agency.\n\n361.\n\nMr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s acquittal in the Land Swap Case, says the Respondent, does not support the Claimant\u2019s case. The appellate court did not conclude that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 did not engage in any illegal conduct; it merely found that his actions did not reach the requisite level to trigger criminal liability. The judgment actually confirms that the land swap transaction was unlawful. It also notes that BD Agro acted in bad faith. In addition, the court found that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was the majority owner who controlled BD Agro.\n\n***b. Claimants\u2019 Position***\n----------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimants stress that Serbia only raised the Securities Law Objection in its Counter-Memorial and added the New Illegality Objections in its Rejoinder. For the Claimants, (a) the New Illegality Objections are belated and thus inadmissible; (b) the scope of the illegality objections is limited; and (c) all the illegality objections are without merit.\n\n**(1) Inadmissibility of the New Illegality Objections**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimants point out that Article 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules prescribes that jurisdictional objections must be raised \"*as early as possible\"* and at the latest in the Counter-Memorial. The New Illegality Objections do not comply with this rule, because they were presented in the Rejoinder. They are therefore inadmissible.\n\n364.\n\nThe Claimants accept that the New Illegality Objections could be admissible if they were based on facts that Serbia could not reasonably have known on or before 19 April 2019, when it filed its Counter-Memorial. However, that exception does not apply here.\n\n365.\n\nThe Non-Disclosure Objection, the first New Illegality Objection, is based on an assertion that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 violated Serbian law by failing to formally disclose Mr. Rand's beneficial ownership to the Privatization Agency. It is undisputed that Serbia knew of the Claimants\u2019 beneficial ownership at the latest since August 2017, when it received the Claimants\u2019 Notice of Dispute (\"NoD\"). The NoD contained a detailed description of the Claimants\u2019 ownership structure and their acquisition and subsequent beneficial ownership and control. In spite of this knowledge, Serbia did not raise the Non-Disclosure Objection in time. It should not be permitted to do so now.\n\n366.\n\nThe Money Siphoning Objection, the second New Illegality Objection, is founded on allegations that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 used funds from BD Agro\u2019s accounts to purchase the Beneficially Owned Shares. These allegations were made in 2009 already, when the representatives of BD Agro\u2019s minority shareholders and employees complained to various Serbian authorities, including to the Privatization Agency, about suspicious transfers from BD Agro\u2019s accounts. The Claimants submit that \"while these allegations form the bedrock of Serbia\u2019s Rejoinder, they were not even hinted at in the Counter-Memorial.\" As a result, this objection is also untimely and must be denied.\n\n367.\n\nThe Land Machination Objection, the third New Illegality Objection, arises from assertions that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 stripped BD Agro of some of its land, extracting millions from BD Agro, and used BD Agro land for an illegal land swap with the Ministry of Agriculture. The Claimants stress that these \"machinations\" have been the subject of criminal complaints and investigations since at least 2015 and, in the case of the land swap, of ongoing criminal proceedings. The State Attorney\u2019s Office that represents Serbia in this arbitration became aware of the land swap matter in 2010. Accordingly, this objection is also untimely.\n\n368.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the Tribunal should not exercise its power under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to hear the New Illegality Objections *ex officio.* They insist that \"Serbia's strategic choice to only raise the New Illegality Objections in its Rejoinder was obviously premised on a gamble that the Tribunal would exercise its discretionary powers and would entertain the New Illegality Objections despite their belatedness and despite all the difficulties that their belated filing caused to the Claimants, who only had six weeks to address them.\"246\n\nRej. J., \u00a7520.\n\n**(2) Scope of the illegality objections**\n------------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimants concede that, under certain circumstances, the illegality of an investment may deprive an arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction. However, they emphasize that international law imposes strict limitations on illegality objections. Most importantly, illegality only affects jurisdiction if the illegal conduct occurs at the time when the investment is made. Here, the investment in the Beneficially Owned Shares was made on 4 October 2005 when Mr. Obradovi\u0107 entered into the Privatization Agreement, which formed the legal basis of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's and thus also the Claimants' acquisition of the Beneficially Owned Shares. The only two objections that could thus fall within the required temporal scope are the Securities Law Objection and the Non-Disclosure Objection. The Siphoning and Land Machination Objections arise from allegations that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and the Claimants took improper advantage of the Beneficially Owned Shares. These objections do not relate to the making of the investment and, therefore, cannot impact the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimants oppose Serbia's argument that the \"making\" of the investment covers the entire period from the conclusion of the Privatization Agreement until full payment of the purchase price on 8 April 2011. As investment tribunals have observed, the legality requirement applies only to the \"making\" of an investment and not its implementation and operation. Here, the relevant date is 4 October 2005, when Mr. Obradovi\u0107 executed the Privatization Agreement.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that only \"fundamental violations\" of legal rules that apply to the making of an investment deprive a tribunal of jurisdiction. None of Serbia's allegations meet this requirement.\n\n**(3) Merits of the illegality objections**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nIn any event, according to the Claimants, even if the Tribunal were not to follow their submissions above, it would reach the conclusion that the illegality objections are unfounded.\n\n***(i) The Securities Law Objection***\n--------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Securities Law Objection incorporates by reference the arguments presented in the Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objections. Such arguments cannot be accepted for the reasons mentioned earlier. Particularly, the provisions which the Respondent contends have been breached - Article 59 of the 2001 Law on Privatization, Article 52(1) of the 2002 Law on Capital Markets and its equivalent Article 52(2) of the 2006 Law on Capital Markets - do not apply to transfers of beneficial ownership; they only relate to transfers of legal title to shares in public companies. Restrictions on trading with shares of public companies are thus irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n374.\n\nThe only additional argument, so say the Claimants, relates to Mr. Rand\u2019s Indirect Shareholding, which was acquired by MDH Serbia between October 2008 and October 2012, and allegedly triggered the obligation for Mr. Obradovi\u0107, Mr. Rand, MDH, Sembi and MDH Serbia to bid for the BD Agro shares which they did not hold. Serbia\u2019s argument that had this failure been discovered by Serbian authorities, Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Rand would completely lose control over BD Agro does not withstand scrutiny. The Serbian Securities Commission could only have imposed (i) the temporary suspension of MDH Serbia\u2019s right to vote the 3.9% shareholding; (ii) a misdemeanor fine; and (iii) an obligation to launch a mandatory takeover bid. For the Claimants, an omission to make a takeover bid would not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, because it does not affect any \"fundamental legal principle of Serbian law.\"\n\n***(ii) The Non-Disclosure Objection***\n---------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimants deny Serbia\u2019s allegation that Mr. Rand deceived the Serbian authorities when he allegedly failed to disclose his beneficial ownership during the auction for the Beneficially Owned Shares or thereafter.\n\n376.\n\nFirst, the Claimants stress that Serbia has not identified any provision of the Canada-Serbia BIT that requires Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and/or Mr. Rand to formally disclose their beneficial ownership arrangement.247 Indeed, the Treaty does not require an investment to be disclosed to the host State. Moreover, Serbia has failed to identify a provision of Serbian law which would contain a disclosure obligation. Even if Article 2 of the Law on Privatization contained such an obligation as Serbia alleges *(quod non),* that provision would only apply to the public entities involved in the privatization process, and not to the buyers. Further, there is no sanction for failure to comply with Article 2. Nor has Serbia cited any decision of a Serbian body sanctioning a private entity for breach of Article 2. Moreover, even if Serbian law required a formal disclosure of beneficial ownership *(quod non),* and even if the beneficial ownership was not disclosed, Serbia is estopped from relying on the lack of disclosure due to the Agency's acquiescence to, and lack of interest in, the Claimants' beneficial ownership of BD Agro. Finally, the Claimants notes that the Agency did not require the disclosure of beneficial ownership in BD Agro's privatization, although it did request disclosures in other privatizations, such as \"Vranje\" and Beopetrol.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7\u00a7108 et seq.\n\n377.\n\nSecond and in any event, the Claimants repeatedly disclosed their beneficial ownership to the Serbian authorities, including the Privatization Agency.248 Mr. Rand's beneficial ownership of BD Agro was widely known, as is, for instance, evident from the following facts:\n\n\u2022 In May 2005, Mr. Rand visited BD Agro and met with various Government officials to discuss his potential investment. These officials included Mr. Predrag Bubalo, the then Minister of Economy, Mr. Ljubi\u0161a Jovanovi\u0107, the then Assistant (Deputy) Minister of Economy, Mr. Mladjan Dinki\u0107, the then Minister of Finance, and Mr. Danilo Golubovi\u0107, the then Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management;\n\n\u2022 On 16 May 2005, Mr. Jovanovi\u0107, Assistant Deputy Minister of Economy sent an email to Mr. Rand, in which he summarized the status and economic condition of BD Agro, the improvements that could be made and the reasons \"WHY TO INVEST IN DOBANOVCI\", including the fact that, as a result of its location, the value of BD Agro's land would be \"permanently increasing\";\n\n\u2022 On 4 June 2005, i.e. approximately three weeks after Mr. Jovanovi\u0107 sent him the information about BD Agro, Mr. Rand wrote to Minister Bubalo to thank him for his hospitality during his visit to Belgrade and to inform him that he was interested in participating in the public auction of BD Agro;\n\n\u2022 When Mr. Obradovi\u0107 submitted the winning bid at the public auction on 29 September 2005, Mr. Jovanovi\u0107 immediately reported the outcome of the auction to Mr. Rand. He sent the email from his official email account at the Ministry of Economy, stating that he \"presume[d] that [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] ha[d] already informed that you all succeeded in farm acquisition!\"\n\nRej. J., \u00a7\u00a7126 et seq. and \u00a7\u00a7185 et seq.\n\n378.\n\nThe Claimants challenge Serbia's conjectures about the motivation for investing through Mr. Obradovi\u0107. They explain that the reason for proceeding through Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was \"purely practical\": Mr. Rand lives in Vancouver and does not speak Serbian. He was thus unable to attend to various matters pertaining to his Serbian companies that required the owner's local attention. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 becoming the nominal owner was thus the most practical solution to address these concerns. As the nominal owner, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was able to act upon Mr. Rand's informal instructions because he did not need to prove his authority vis-\u00e0-vis third parties. The nominal ownership also gave Mr. Obradovi\u0107 more credibility in Serbia.\n\n379.\n\nAs for the questions which Serbia raises about Mr. Obradovi\u0107's motives, they are \"entirely irrelevant\", say the Claimants. Whatever they were, Mr. Rand and Sembi had beneficial ownership of and control over BD Agro. In any event, Mr. Obradovi\u0107's motivations are not questionable: he worked for Mr. Rand based on a success fee payable if and when Mr. Rand's investments became profitable. Mr. Rand also advanced funds to cover Mr. Obradovi\u0107's expenses, including, among other things, the purchase of an apartment in Belgrade and his daughter's tuition fees in the United States.\n\n***(iii) The Siphoning Objection***\n-----------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Serbia has failed to demonstrate any impropriety with respect to the money transfers between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and BD Agro or between BD Agro, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and other Serbian companies beneficially owned by Mr. Rand. This is, in particular, evidenced by the absence of criminal proceedings against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in relation to these transfers.\n\n381.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants dispute Serbia's claim that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 owed any monies to Sembi. They contend that, if all relevant transactions are taken into consideration, the net balance of payments between BD Agro, on one side, and Mr. Obradovi\u0107 together with Mr. Rand and his Serbian companies, on the other side, is in favour of BD Agro.\n\n382.\n\nThe Claimants also challenge the analysis of the transactions on which Serbia relies for its Siphoning Objection. First, some of the transactions that created a financial benefit for BD Agro were not reflected in BD Agro's bank accounts. Second, Serbia's review was based on descriptions of transactions included in BD Agro's bank statements. These descriptions were in part incorrect or inconclusive. For example, several transactions which were labelled as purchase of goods and therefore excluded from Serbia's analysis were in reality shareholder loans.\n\n***(iv) The Land Machination Objection***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Land Machination Objection relates to the performance of the Privatization Agreement rather than its conclusion and thus can have no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In any event, the objection is ill-founded, since all of the impugned transactions involving BD Agro's land were legitimate. Although Serbia now raises an objection, the Privatization Agency never complained at the time that these transactions breached the Privatization Agreement. Additionally, the Belgrade Court of Appeal acquitted Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in the Land Swap case.\n\n***c. Analysis***\n-----------------\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal examines the admissibility of the New Illegality Objections (a), before reviewing the scope of all of Serbia's illegality objections (b) and the merits of those objections (c).\n\n**(1) Admissibility of the New illegality Objections**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimants contest the admissibility of the New Illegality Objections as they were advanced for the first time in Serbia's Rejoinder. Serbia disagrees, contending that these objections were \"presented\" in its Counter-Memorial and \"further developed\" in its Rejoinder. Pursuant to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has the power to review its jurisdiction *ex officio.* Hence, the Tribunal can dispense with deciding the Claimants' admissibility objection and allow the New Illegality Objections *ex officio,* which it does. It is satisfied that the Claimants had the opportunity to address the Tribunal on these objections. They did so orally at the hearing and in writing both before and after the hearing.\n\n**(2) Scope of the illegality objections**\n------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nSerbia raises four objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *\"ratione voluntatis:* the Securities Law Objection, the Disclosure Objection, the Siphoning Objection and the Land Machination Objection. Serbia acknowledges that the Canada-Serbia BIT does not contain an express legality requirement but insists that the Treaty implicitly requires legality.\n\n387.\n\nContracting Parties to an investment treaty are free to introduce a legality requirement, i.e. to limit the protections of the treaty to investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State. Depending on the language used in the investment treaty, this limitation may be a bar to jurisdiction, i.e. to the procedural protection under the treaty, or a defense on the merits, i.e. to the application of the substantive treaty guarantees. Here, the Contracting Parties to the Canada-Serbia BIT did not include any such limitation into the text of BIT. The definitions of \"investment\" and \"covered investment\" in Article 1 of the BIT and the dispute settlement clause in Article 22 do not require investments under the BIT to be made in accordance with host State law. In application of the treaty interpretation rules codified in the Vienna Convention, the Tribunal does not find it correct to read into the Treaty to introduce a requirement that the Contracting Parties have not provided, especially in circumstances where other provisions in the BIT expressly refer to domestic law.249 Serbia has advanced no reason why the Tribunal should do so.\n\nE.g. Exh. CLA-1, Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 27 April 2015, Art. 1 (\"'confidential information' means confidential business information or information that is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under the law of a Party\"; \"enterprise\" means an entity constituted or organized under applicable law [...]\").\n\n388.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s *\"ratione voluntatis* jurisdictional objections.\n\n389.\n\nAdditionally, even if the Tribunal were to review these objections, it would also dismiss them.\n\n**(3) Merits of the illegality objections**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe first issue arising in implying a legality requirement into a treaty turns on the time at which the requirement must be met. With an express requirement, the answer is likely to lie in the treaty wording. Here, the Tribunal will simply adopt the same view as the majority of investment tribunals and opt for the time when the investment is established, i.e. when it is made, not when it is operated.250 In this context, it notes that Article 12 of the Privatization Agreement provides that the Buyer will acquire ownership rights over BD Agro in proportion to the instalments paid.251 Thus, the \"making\" of the investment, i.e. Mr. Rand's indirect acquisition of interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares lasted throughout the period when payment instalments were paid, ending on 8 April 2011 with the last instalment. Further, it is common ground between the Parties, and rightly so, that only violations of fundamental rules of law would deprive a tribunal of jurisdiction.252\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. RLA-123, *Oxus Gold plc v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 17 December 2015, \u00a7707; Exh. CLA-169, *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, \u00a7327.\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005, Art. 12: \"With conclusion of this agreement, which has the effect of the articles of incorporation of the subject, the buyer acquires the right of management, participation in profit and the right to a part of the liquidation mass, proportionately to the amount of purchased capital. The right to free disposal of purchased capital is acquired by the buyer pursuant to the provisions of Article 456 of the Company Law and provisions of the agreement, and in proportion to paid value of sale and purchase price.\"\n\nExh. CLA-170, *Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investments v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Award, 22 June 2010 (excerpts), \u00a7187 ; Exh. CLA-171, *Peter A. Allard v. Government of Barbados,* PCA Case No. 2012-06, Award on Jurisdiction, 13 June 2014, \u00a794.\n\n***(i) Securities Law Objection***\n----------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nSerbia's Securities Law Objection is presented in two parts. First, Serbia alleges that, as the MDH Agreement and the Sembi Agreement contemplated a transfer of shares in a joint stock company outside the Belgrade Stock Exchange, they violated Serbian Securities Laws. Serbia further alleges that the Sembi Agreement also contravened Article 41 (\u017e) of the Privatization Law. As mentioned above, the investment in this case is Mr. Rand's control over Sembi's contractual interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. Sembi's contractual interest arises through the Sembi Agreement, not the MDH Agreement. The latter Agreement is thus irrelevant for the present purposes. The Tribunal has already reviewed and dismissed the objections in relation to the Sembi Agreement above (\u00a7\u00a7320 et seq.).\n\n392.\n\nSecond, Serbia submits that Mr. Rand's acquisition of 3.9% of BD Agro's equity through MDH Serbia starting in 2008 required Mr. Obradovi\u0107, Mr. Rand, MDH, Sembi and MDH Serbia to make a bid to take over BD Agro's shares still in the hands of third parties, and that they failed to do. Serbia asserts that, had this failure been discovered, Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Rand would lose their voting rights in BD Agro pursuant to Article 37 of the Takeover Law.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree. The Claimants\u2019 omission to issue a takeover bid would not automatically trigger the loss of Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Rand\u2019s voting rights. It is not evident that the sanction in Article 37, which came into force in 2012, would apply to an alleged breach that occurred in 2008 when MDH Serbia first acquired BD Agro\u2019s shares. Indeed, the testimony of the Claimants' expert Ms. Tomi\u0107 Brku\u0161anin according to which Article 37 could not be applied retroactively was not cogently rebutted.253 Moreover and in any event, as observed, only violations of fundamental rules would deprive a tribunal of its jurisdiction and Serbia has not established that the failure to issue a takeover bid would affect a fundamental principle of Serbian law. The contrary rather emerges from the fact that a failure to issue a takeover bid does not affect the validity of the transfer of shares, nor the ownership of the newly acquired shares.254\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 4, 186:12-190:05.\n\nMs. Brku\u0161anin ER 1 \u00a7114 The Respondent\u2019s expert Dr. Radovic did not contest this evidence.\n\n394.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal dismisses this Objection.\n\n***(ii) Non-Disclosure Objection***\n-----------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nSerbia contends that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 violated Serbian law by failing to formally disclose Mr. Rand\u2019s beneficial ownership to the Privatization Agency. There is no rule under Serbian law that required Mr. Rand to disclose his investment structure. Article 2 of the Law on Privatization, on which Serbia relies, does not contain such an obligation,255 and Serbia has pointed to no decisions of any Serbian authority sanctioning a private entity for the breach of the principle of transparency under Article 2. Article 19 of the Decree on Sale of Capital and Assets by Public Auction, another provision on which Serbia relies, does not provide either for a disclosure of the kind alleged by Serbia.256 Further, the Tribunal recalls that the Agency did not require the disclosure of beneficial ownership in BD Agro\u2019s privatization, although it did request disclosures in other privatizations.257 Further and in any event, even if disclosure was required, for the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal has determined that Serbian government officials were well aware of Mr. Rand's control over BD Agro.\n\nExh. CE-220, Law on Privatization, Art. 2: \"Privatization is based on the following principles: 1) Creation of conditions for economic development and social stability; 2) Transparency; 3) Flexibility; 4) Establishing of sale price in accordance with market conditions.\"\n\nExh. RE-218, Regulation on the Sale of Capital and Property at a Public Auction (52/2005), Art. 19.\n\nIn the public invitations for tender in respect of Duvanska Industrija \"Vranje\" (2003), the Agency expressly asked for the disclosure of beneficial ownership structures. See Exh. CE-890, Public Invitation for participation in a public tender process for the sale of socially owned capital of Duvanska industrija \"Vranje\" a.d., p. 2 (pdf). It did the same in the public invitation for Beopetrol a.d. (2003). See Exh. CE-891, Public Invitation for participation in a public tender process for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Beopetrol a.d. Beograd, p. 2 (pdf).\n\n396.\n\nIn respect of Serbia's allegations that Mr. Rand acted abusively by \"hiding behind\" Mr. Obradovi\u0107, it is true that only Serbian natural persons were permitted to pay for privatized companies in instalments.258 However, it remains that nothing prevents non-Serbian nationals from participating in privatizations. Therefore, by participating indirectly in BD Agro's privatization through Mr. Obradovi\u0107, Mr. Rand did not create for himself an opportunity that otherwise he would have lacked. He could have bought BD Agro directly. By acting through Mr. Obradovi\u0107, Mr. Rand did, of course, receive the benefit of paying the purchase price in instalments and it is true, that Mr. Obradovic effectively paid the purchase price in 11 instead of six instalments. However, these facts in and of themselves do not meet the high threshold set for an abuse, especially in circumstances where Mr. Rand advanced good reasons for involving Mr. Obradovi\u0107,259 and interest was paid on the overdue instalments, which monies the Agency accepted without protest.260 Further and in any event, as already explained, Serbia was well aware of Mr. Rand's involvement in BD Agro from the very beginning (\u00a7239), and cannot now be heard to complain about Mr. Rand acting through Mr. Obradovi\u0107.\n\nExh. RE-218, Regulation on the Sale of Capital and Property at a Public Auction (52/2005), Art. 39(1).\n\nRand WS III, \u00a7\u00a711-14.\n\nExh. RE-33, Banking excerpts confirming payment of installments of purchase price by Mr. Obradovic, 15 October 2015.\n\n397.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal dismisses this Objection.\n\n***(iii) Siphoning Objection***\n-------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nThe Siphoning Objection is principally based on allegations that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 used funds from BD Agro's accounts to pay the purchase price for the Beneficially Owned Shares, to fulfil his investment obligations under the Privatization Agreement, and for his personal enrichment. The Respondent submits that the allegedly improper money transfers amounted to fraud under Serbian law.\n\n399.\n\nSerbia has not cogently explained which rules have been breached and how. There are no criminal proceedings pending against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 regarding any such alleged fraud, despite similar allegations being made against him in 2009 when the representatives of BD Agro's minority shareholders and employees complained to various Serbian bodies, including the Privatization Agency, of the alleged \"suspicious transactions from BD Agro's accounts.\"261 This is all the more surprising as Serbia was in control of BD Agro from 21 October 2015. Yet, no claim of financial or other irregularity has been made against Mr. Obradovi\u0107. It also remains that, as BD Agro was a publicly traded company, its financial statements, which form the bases of Serbia's allegations, were audited by three different auditors, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, that found no irregularity.262 Mr. Rand's own accountant, who visited BD Agro on a quarterly basis and reviewed the financial documents of the company, did not raise any issues either.263 Finally, Serbia's expert, Mr. Sandy Cowan, on whom Serbia relied to make this objection, admitted that he had not considered certain transactions in his analysis,264 and that his analysis was based on descriptions of transactions used in BD Agro's bank statements, which could be incorrect or inconclusive.265\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7179; Rej., \u00a7515.\n\nObradovi\u0107 WS III, \u00a752.\n\nObradovi\u0107 WS III, \u00a752; Rand WS III, \u00a748.\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 8, 164:11-165:10 (Cowan).\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 8, 163:13-164:6 (Cowan).\n\n400.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that this objection is not well-founded and dismisses it.\n\n***(iv) Land Machination Objection***\n-------------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Land Machination Objection is grounded on allegations that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 stripped BD Agro of some of its land and thereby extracted large sums from BD Agro. Serbia also alleges that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 committed some of BD Agro's land to an illegal land swap with the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\n402.\n\nWhile Serbia complains of \"machinations\" in respect of a number of transactions, and while there might have been some irregularities in some transactions, here again, Serbia has not cogently explained which rules have been breached and how. Serbia's allegations are not supported by domestic proceedings against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in respect of these transactions, despite BD Agro being within Serbia's control since 2015. For instance, there are no court decisions against Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for the transfer of land to Calpro or the transfer to Ms. Nedeljkovic. Although the contract in the Land Swap Case was declared null and void, it remains that such contract was concluded on a recommendation from the cadaster office266 and on the express approval of the Ministry of Agriculture.267 It also noted that, the Court of Appeal in Belgrade acquitted Mr. Obradovi\u0107 in that case.268 For these reasons, the Tribunal denies this objection.\n\nExh. RE-395, Letter from the Cadaster Office to BD Agro, 8 February 2008.\n\nExh. CE-762, Decision of Ministry of Agriculture, 4 January 2010.\n\nExh. CE-907, Decision of the Court of Appeal in Belgrade, 26 May 2021.\n\n***d. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n403.\n\nIt follows from the discussion above that the Tribunal has *\"ratione voluntatis\"* jurisdiction in respect of claims arising out of Mr. Rand's investment in Serbia.\n\n**4. Non-Retroactivity and Time Bar**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***a. Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent addresses two legally distinct issues under the heading of temporal jurisdiction (items (b) and (c) below). First, however, it opposes the Claimants' characterization of the factual basis of their claims (item (a) below).\n\n**(1) Characterization of the factual basis of the claims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Tribunal joined jurisdiction to the merits in Procedural Order No. 3. This \"incontrovertibly\" showed that the Tribunal considered that the facts underlying jurisdiction were \"such as to necessitate full consideration which may only be achieved by hearing both parties - and decidedly not by merely relying on what the Claimants allege.\"269 Moreover, the Claimants' themselves argued that the factual basis of most of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections were \"inextricably intertwined\" with the merits.270\n\nRej., \u00a7949.\n\nRej., \u00a7951 relying on Claimants\u2019 Reply to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00a77.\n\n406.\n\nWhile in a treaty arbitration it is for the claimant to allege the facts which in its view constitute treaty breaches, a respondent has the right to dispute those facts and their characterization as treaty breaches.\n\n**(2) Non-retroactivity**\n-------------------------\n\n407.\n\nSerbia submits that the principle of non-retroactivity according to which legal obligations arising under an international agreement cannot bind parties with respect to acts committed before the legal obligation came into existence deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over claims based on acts and facts preceding the entry into force of the Canada-Serbia BIT. More specifically, the Respondent argues, all the claims raised in this arbitration arise from acts and facts which were committed or were in existence before the Treaty's entry into force or were the direct result of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's breach of the Privatization Agreement that also occurred prior to the entry into force. These claims are therefore precluded by the principle of non-retroactivity.\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the alleged breaches are \"deeply and inseparably rooted\" in the Respondent's pre-BIT conduct. For Serbia, \"it is impossible to divorce termination of the contract from its breach, or to divide the retention of pledge from the performance under the contract, or equally to delineate breaches of contract and interests of BD Agro's employees and minority shareholders initiating the procedure with the Ombudsman.\"271 The Claimants' argument that the breaches are based on the formal act of termination is \"artificial\" and \"purposefully tailored\" to overcome the temporal limitation. Serbia adds that, once the breach was declared and remedies suggested, there were only two possible options: termination by the Agency or performance by Mr. Obradovi\u0107. It is true that the Agreement was formally terminated after the BIT's effective date, but this was only because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 made \"false promises\" that the breaches would be remedied.272 He \"misled\" the Agency causing the postponement of the termination and the Claimants now seek international protection on that basis.273\n\nRej., \u00a7939.\n\nRej., \u00a7929.\n\nRej., \u00a7929.\n\n409.\n\nSerbia also stresses that the Claimants admitted that the dispute arose prior to the entry into force of the Canada-Serbia BIT. Indeed, they conceded that Sembi found the Agency's refusal to release the pledge to be a violation of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT before it became a violation of the Canada-Serbia BIT. Sembi's owners are Canadian nationals who appear in this arbitration as Claimants in their own right. It therefore follows, so says the Respondent, that a dispute arose between the Parties prior to the effective date of the Canada-Serbia BIT, which deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the claims of the Canadian Claimants.\n\n**(3) Time bar**\n----------------\n\n410.\n\nSerbia submits that Article 22 of the Canada-Serbia BIT sets forth an unconditional preclusive three-year limitation period within which an investor/enterprise must submit a claim from the date on which they first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that they had incurred loss or damage. These are \"imperative conditions\", without the satisfaction of which the Tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction.\n\n411.\n\nAccording to Serbia, since the Request for Arbitration was received by the ICSID Secretariat on 14 February 2018, the cut-off date is 14 February 2015 (the \"Cut-Off-Date\"). Therefore, Mr. Rand must have acquired actual or constructive knowledge of a breach causing loss not earlier than 14 February 2015. If he acquired knowledge before that date, the claim is time barred.\n\n***(i) Knowledge of breach***\n-----------------------------\n\n412.\n\nFor the Respondent, Mr. Rand was well aware of all circumstances leading to the alleged breaches and loss as he was familiar with all the facts constituting the cause of action well before the Cut-Off Date. In particular, from the moment when Mr. Obradovi\u0107 received the First Notice dated 25 February 2011 (which the Claimants received on 1 March 2011), he must have known about the potential loss.\n\n413.\n\nSerbia challenges the Claimants\u2019 argument according to which Mr. Rand could not possibly know on 1 March 2011 or at any time prior to the Cut-Off Date that the Privatization Agreement would be terminated due to a substantial breach of the contract. The First Notice sets out several breaches of the Privatization Agreement and multiple violations of its Article 5.3.4. It provides reasons and evidence seeking to establish these breaches. It also grants 60 days to remedy the breaches of Articles 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 and specifies the consequences of a failure to remedy.\n\n414.\n\nSerbia notes that, while it was possible to avoid termination by remedying the breach of Article 5.3.4, i.e. by reinstating the funds that were unlawfully lent to third parties, remediation was entirely within Mr. Obradovi\u0107's control, as opposed to Serbia\u2019s. Further, there were six other notices of breach before the Cut-Off Date and several meetings during which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 or representatives of BD Agro were advised that the existence of an unremedied breach was the main issue pending between the contract parties.\n\n415.\n\nSerbia contends that it is \"suspicious\" that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 never challenged the retention of the pledge as a contractual breach before the forum chosen in the Privatization Agreement. Equally suspicious is the Claimants\u2019 submission that they could not \"realistically foresee\" the termination of the Agreement despite the numerous notices of the breach of Articles 5.3.3 and 5.3.4.274 It is \"simply impossible\" that dozens of warnings did not alert Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and that argument illustrates how the Claimants built their case to overcome the *ratione temporis* hurdle.275\n\nRej., \u00a7912.\n\nRej., \u00a7912.\n\n416.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Agency\u2019s refusal to release the pledge (1), as well as the Ombudsman\u2019s intervention, (2) and the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares (3) are time barred.\n\n**(a) Refusal to release the pledge**\n-------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nSerbia observes that the Privatization Agency clearly communicated the reason for not releasing the pledge in 2014, which was an \"imminent and direct consequence\" of the breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement. During a meeting held on 4 February 2014, the Privatization Agency informed Mr. Obradovi\u0107 that it could not release the pledge over the shares because of the breach. Therefore, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was aware of the Agency\u2019s refusal to release the pledge already in February 2014, much before the Cut-Off Date.\n\n418.\n\nSerbia rejects the argument that its refusal to release the pledge over BD Agro\u2019s shares on the Cut-Off Date and subsequently was a wrongful \"continuous act.\" The Agency was contractually entitled to retain the pledge and \"[a] [c]ontractual act is not in itself a wrongful act and as such cannot qualify for a continuing wrongful act under international law.\"276 The Respondent adds that \"the continuing act, in terms of the retention of the pledge as a security for the performance under the contract, has never come into existence under international law as it has never reached the threshold of an internationally wrongful continuing act.\"277 It also notes that the Claimants failed to challenge such act before the Commercial Court in Belgrade in accordance with the choice of forum clause in the Privatization Agreement. Moreover, argues Serbia, the Claimants should not be allowed to rely on their own failures. Mr. Obradovi\u0107's failure to remedy the alleged breach of Article 5.3.4, together with his \"manipulative promises\" to the Privatization Agency, cannot be used to overcome the time bar of the Canada-Serbia BIT\n\nRej., \u00a7914.\n\nRej., \u00a7914.\n\n**(b) Ombudsman\u2019s intervention**\n--------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nSerbia points out that the Ombudsman commenced his investigation into BD Agro in late 2014 based on complaints received from BD Agro's employees. Thus, says Serbia, \"the concern of the employees/stockholders over their status and property rights that gave rise to their complaint to the Ombudsman did exist before [14 February 2015].\"278\n\nRej., \u00a7922.\n\n**(c) Termination of the Privatization Agreement and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nSerbia submits that the events following the breach of the Privatization Agreement were foreseeable and inevitably led to the termination of the Privatization Agreement. Foreseeability arises, so says Serbia, from numerous letters exchanged between Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and the Agency, the existing legal framework, and Mr. Obradovi\u0107's prior experience with the privatization process in Serbia.279\n\nRej., \u00a7927.\n\n***(ii) Knowledge of loss***\n----------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent submits that knowledge of possible loss is sufficient to trigger the limitation period under the Treaty. The investor need not have suffered actual loss. Here, the Claimants should be regarded as having knowledge of their alleged loss or damage on the date of the First Notice which was given on 1 March 2011. The three-year period thus expired on 1 March 2014, well before the Cut-Off Date.\n\n***b. Claimants\u2019 Position***\n----------------------------\n\n**(1) Characterization of the factual basis of the claims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Claimants contend that it is for them, not for Serbia, to formulate their claims and identify the measures that they deem to constitute breaches of the Canada-Serbia BIT. The Tribunal must assess its jurisdiction based on the Claimants\u2019 characterization of their claims. Serbia's attempts to mischaracterize the factual matrix of the claims should not be followed. The Respondent cannot be allowed to recast the claims to its advantage thereby manufacturing a *ratione temporis* objection.\n\n423.\n\nIn their submission, the Claimants have made it \"abundantly clear\" that they impugn three instances of Serbia\u2019s conduct: *\"(i)* the continuous refusal to release the pledge over the Privatized Shares; *(ii)* the unjustified and arbitrary investigation of BD Agro by the Ombudsman and the unlawful issuance of his 'recommendations\u2019; and (iii) the unlawful termination of the Privatization Agreement and the subsequent unlawful seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares.\" Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s suggestions, the Claimants have never argued that the Privatization Agency\u2019s finding of a purported violation of the Privatization Agreement, which was notified to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for the first time in March 2011, constituted the basis of their claims.\n\n**(2) Non-Retroactivity**\n-------------------------\n\n424.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 submission, the claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT are not precluded by the principle of non-retroactivity of international treaties because they are based on conduct that occurred after the Treaty\u2019s entry into force.\n\n425.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that the Privatization Agency was in continuous breach of its obligation to release the pledge over the Beneficially Owned Shares from its first refusal on 8 April 2011 until the shares were expropriated on 21 October 2015. From the time when the Canada-Serbia BIT entered into force on 27 April 2015, this conduct fell within the scope of the BIT and there is no violation of the principle of non-retroactivity.\n\n426.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that while the Ombudsman initiated his unlawful investigation of BD Agro in late 2014, he pursued it until he issued his recommendation on 23 June 2015. Hence, the claims based on the investigations which were ongoing at the time of the Treaty\u2019s entry into force and on the later recommendations comply with the principle of non-retroactivity.\n\n427.\n\nFurther still, the Claimants underline that the Privatization Agency terminated the Privatization Agreement on 28 September 2015 and transferred the Beneficially Owned Shares on 21 October 2015. Once again, both measures occurred when the Treaty was in effect and there is thus no violation of the principle of non-retroactivity.\n\n428.\n\nMoreover, say the Claimants, Serbia's argument that the present \"dispute\" arose before the Treaty's entry into force is misguided. It is irrelevant when a dispute arises. What matters is that the Claimants bring claims for breaches of the Canada-Serbia BIT. In any event, the present dispute arose after the Treaty's into force. The First Notice is not the source of this dispute. At that time, the Claimants could not have known that Serbia would expropriate their investment more than four years later. In addition, the notices of contract breach which the Respondent invokes show at best that the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the expropriation were neither automatic nor unavoidable. For the Claimants, the relevant date to determine whether the claims respect the principle of non-retroactivity is that of the expropriation, not those of the first and later notices.\n\n**(3) Time-bar**\n----------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimants insist that their claims fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they became aware of the breaches and resulting loss on or after the Cut-Off-Date, at a time when the Canada-Serbia BIT was in force. Contrary to the Respondent's assertion, neither the First Notice nor the Privatization Agency's subsequent notices could have possibly triggered the three-year time limit because the Canada-Serbia BIT was not in force at that time.\n\n***(i) Knowledge of breach***\n-----------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Claimants insist that none of their claims described above, be it the refusal to release the pledge (1), the intervention of the Ombudsman (2), or the unlawful termination of the Privatization Agreement (3), are time-barred.\n\n**(a) Refusal to release the pledge**\n-------------------------------------\n\n431.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Claimants became aware of the breach perpetrated through the continuous refusal to release the pledge, which lasted until the expropriation of the Claimants' investment, on 27 April 2015. In response to Serbia's challenge of the wrongful and continuous nature of that action, they argue that it does not matter whether conduct is contractual or not to determine whether it is continuous.280 In *SGS v. Philippines,* for instance, the tribunal recognized that non-performance of a contract may constitute a continuous breach under international law.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7621.\n\n432.\n\nThe Claimants equally dispute Serbia's argument linked to the lack of challenge in local courts. They assert that international claims are not predicated on the exhaustion of local remedies and add that the expropriation was the result of the conduct of the Privatization Agency. Had the Privatization Agency released the pledge, there would have been no seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares, with the result that \"the Claimants are absolutely not required to have sought redress before the courts in order to assert a claim of Serbia's breach of its international obligations on the basis of the Privatization Agency's refusal to release the pledge.\"281\n\nRej. J., \u00a7629.\n\n433.\n\nFinally, the Claimants reject Serbia's conclusion that the above factors, taken together with Mr. Obradovi\u0107's \"indolence\" to remedy the alleged breaches amount to an \"impermissible [...] modification\" of the Cut-Off-Date. More specifically, they explain that \"Mr. Obradovi\u0107's alleged 'indolence to remedy the alleged breaches' could not have possibly amounted to any 'tolling' of the time limitation period for submitting a claim to arbitration under the Canada-Serbia BIT because the Claimants did not even have a claim to arbitrate at the time of that alleged conduct.\"282\n\nRej. J., \u00a7630.\n\n**(b) Ombudsman\u2019s intervention**\n--------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimants submit that one of the reasons why Serbia breached the Canada-Serbia BIT lies in the Ombudsman starting an unjustified, heavily publicized and politically-motivated investigation of BD Agro that culminated in the issuance of unlawful \"recommendations\" and prompted the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the expropriation of the investment. The Claimants became aware of the Ombudsman's unlawful investigation and of his \"recommendations\" on 23 June 2015, i.e. after the Cut-Off-Date.\n\n**(c) Termination of the Privatization Agreement and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe Claimants also assert a breach of the Canada-Serbia BIT due to the Agency's unlawful termination of the Privatization Agreement on 28 September 2015 and the subsequent unlawful order to transfer the Beneficially Owned Shares on 21 October 2015. These events occurred after the Cut-Off-Date and, therefore, the related breaches cannot be time barred.\n\n***(ii) Knowledge of loss***\n----------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimants stress that the limitation is only triggered once the investor has become aware of the \"loss or damage\" inflicted by the breach. For the claims to be time barred, Serbia must thus prove that the Claimants acquired knowledge that they suffered loss as a result of Serbia's breach of the Canada-Serbia BIT more than three years before initiating this arbitration, which is obviously impossible.\n\n437.\n\nThe Claimants insist that they became aware of the loss caused by Serbia's violations of the Treaty only on 21 October 2015 when the Beneficially Owned Shares were seized, and the Claimants were thus definitively deprived of their investment. This was after the Cut-Off-Date. Even if the Claimants could be said to have acquired knowledge of the loss due to the failure to release the pledge and the Ombudsman's unlawful interference on 27 April 2015 and 23 June 2015, respectively, both these dates would also fall after the Cut-Off-Date.\n\n438.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is incorrect that the termination of the Privatization Agreement and subsequent seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares are mere consequences of the first notice, of which the Claimants should have been aware upon receipt of that first notice long before the Cut-Off-Date. While Article 22(2)(e)(i) of the Canada-Serbia BIT contemplates two forms of knowledge of breach and loss, i.e. actual knowledge (what the claimant did in fact know) and constructive knowledge (what the claimant should have known), very few investment tribunals have enquired whether the claimant had constructive knowledge of the alleged breach and loss. Further, constructive knowledge does not mean that the investor is required to anticipate before the Cut-Off-Date, what the State's conduct will be thereafter, with the result that the investor would be deemed to have knowledge of the State's conduct before it actually occurred.\n\n***c. Analysis***\n-----------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal first examines the Parties' submissions on the characterization of the factual basis of the claims (a). Then, it reviews the two legally distinct issues of temporal scope of application of the Treaty and non-retroactivity (b). Finally, it discusses the time bar or statute of limitation of claims (c).\n\n**(1) Characterization of the factual basis of the claims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nAt the outset, the Parties diverge when it comes to the basis on which the Tribunal must assess its temporal jurisdiction. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should adopt its own characterization of the alleged breaches, whereas the Claimants submit that it must accept the claims as pled.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal tends to agree with the Claimants. Article 22(2)(e)(i) of the Canada-Serbia BIT reproduced above provides that an investor may submit a claim to arbitration if not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach. The use of the word \"alleged\" to qualify the breach suggests that the Tribunal must assess its jurisdiction on the basis of the claims as pled. Other tribunals, interpreting similarly worded investment agreements, have reached the same conclusion.283 Serbia advances no convincing explanation why this reasoning should be different in respect of non-retroactivity.\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. CLA-103, *Infinito Gold Ltd. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 December 2017, \u00a7\u00a7186, 187 (\"at the jurisdictional stage, a tribunal must be guided by the case as put forward by the claimant in order to avoid breaching the claimant's due process rights. To proceed otherwise is to incur the risk of dismissing the case based on arguments not put forward by the claimant, at a great procedural cost for that party. [...] [T]he Tribunal must assess the case before it focusing on the measures that the Claimant has deemed fit to challenge, and determine its jurisdiction, the admissibility of these claims and, if appropriate, the prima facie existence of rights to be protected at the merits phase, on that basis.\").

The Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, ICSID Case No. UNCT/14/2, Award, 16 March 2017, \u00a7\u00a7163-165.\n\n**(2) Non-retroactivity**\n-------------------------\n\n442.\n\nAs a matter of principle and subject to a contrary agreement which is not at issue here, only a treaty that is in force binds the Contracting States.284 As a corollary, acts carried out at a time when the treaty had not yet entered into force are not subject to the treaty rules. In other words, a treaty does not have retroactive effect, it does not capture acts or omissions predating its effectiveness.285 There are exceptions to the non-retroactivity principle, but the Parties have not invoked any such exception, and rightly so, continuing acts that are ongoing on the date of entry into force of the treaty fall within the temporal scope of application of the treaty for the period that follows the entry into force. As observed in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic,* prior acts may only be taken into consideration for \"'purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or scope of the violations of the BIT that occurred after the entry into force' or the relevance of prior events to breaches taking place after the treaty's entry into force.\"286\n\nRLA-44, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), Art. 26.\n\nRLA-44, VCLT, Art. 28.

An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that:\n\n(a) the respondent Party has breached an obligation under Section B, other than an obligation under Articles 8(3), 12, 15 or 16; [...].\"\n\n444.\n\nAs the Canada-Serbia BIT entered into force on 27 April 2015, the Tribunal can only assert jurisdiction over measures which were adopted (or ongoing) on or after that date,287 which is the case of all the claims put forward:\n\ni. *Termination of the Privatization Agreement and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares:* The \"heart\" of the Claimants' case - so say the Claimants - is Serbia's allegedly unlawful termination of the Privatization Agreement and subsequent seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares.288 The Agreement was terminated on 28 September 2015.289 The Beneficially Owned Shares were seized on 21 October 2015.290 Both measures post-date the Treaty's entry into force on 27 April 2015;\n\nii. *Refusal to release the pledge:* The Claimants challenge the Privatization Agency's \"continuous refusal\" to release the pledge over the Beneficially Owned Shares. The Agency first refused to release the pledge at a meeting with Mr. Obradovi\u0107 on 4 February 2014291 before the Treaty's entry into force. However, it repeated its refusal on several occasions thereafter, including after 27 April 2015.292 In the circumstances, this claim falls within the temporal scope of the Canada-Serbia BIT in respect of the period post-dating 27 April 2015.\n\niii. *Ombudsman\u2019s intervention:* The Claimants also contest the \"unjustified and arbitrary investigation\" of BD Agro by the Ombudsman and the unlawful issuance of his \"recommendations.\"293 The Ombudsman's investigation started in late 2014, was \"ongoing\" when the Treaty entered into force on 27 April 2015, became known to Mr. Rand on 23 June 2015,294 the \"recommendations\" being issued four days later on 27 June 2015. Claims arising from these measures thus also fall within the temporal scope of the Canada-Serbia BIT with respect to the time following 27 April 2015.\n\nExh. RLA-31, *Aaron C. Berkowitz, Brett E.

That provision only applies to claims that are within the temporal scope of the Treaty, as discussed in section (b) above.\n\n446.\n\nArticle 22(ii)(e)(i) of the BIT prescribes that an investor cannot bring claims if more than three years have elapsed from the time when the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and loss:\n\n\"Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n[...]\n\n2. An investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Article 21 only if:\n\n[...]\n\n(e) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 21(1):\n\n[...]\n\n(i) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage thereby\n\n[...]\"\n\n447.\n\nThe Parties agree that the relevant Cut-Off-Date is 14 February 2015, i.e. three years before the Claimants initiated the present arbitration. They similarly concur that knowledge can be actual or constructive and that what matters is first knowledge.295 It appears further undisputed that continuing acts that are ongoing on the Cut-Off Date are within the ambit of the Treaty for the period that follows the Cut-Off Date.296 Finally, pursuant to the wording of the Treaty, the three-year time limit is only triggered if the investor not only has knowledge of a breach of the treaty but also of the damage caused by that breach.297\n\nSee, for e.g., Rej., \u00a7896.\n\nRej., \u00a7936 (\"Respondent does not contest the existence of the concept of internationally wrongful acts of a continuous character nor Article 14 of the ILC Draft Articles.\"). The Commentaries to the ILC Draft Articles clarify that a course of conduct, which has started before the underlying treaty entered into force, can give rise to a continuing wrongful act in the present (\"In cases where the relevant obligation did not exist at the beginning of the course of conduct but came into being thereafter, the 'first\u2019 of the actions or omissions of the series for the purposes of State responsibility will be the first occurring after the obligation came into existence.\").

Dominican Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award, 31 May 2016, \u00a7194.\n\n448.\n\nApplying these principles, the Tribunal finds that the none of the claims are time-barred.\n\n***(i) Refusal to release the pledge***\n---------------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nAs noted in the context of non-retroactivity, the Claimants challenge the Privatization Agency's \"continuous refusal\" to release the pledge of the shares. Here again, Mr. Rand acquired knowledge of breach after the cut-off date of 14 February 2015.\n\n***(ii) Ombudsman\u2019s intervention***\n-----------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nThe Claimants contest the \"unjustified and arbitrary investigation\" of BD Agro by the Ombudsman and the unlawful issuance of his \"recommendations.\"298 As was already noted, the Ombudsman\u2019s \"recommendations\" were issued on 27 June 2015, after the Cut-Off Date. The Claimants also allege that the Ombudsman \"prompted\" the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares, in which case, Mr. Rand could only acquire the relevant knowledge after the shares were seized *i.e.* after 21 October 2015, again well after the cut-off date.\n\nRej. J., \u00a7598.\n\n***(iii) Termination of the Privatization Agreement and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nThe \"heart\" of the Claimants\u2019 case is Serbia\u2019s allegedly unlawful termination of the Privatization Agreement and subsequent seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares.299 The Agreement was terminated on 28 September 2015300 and the Beneficially Owned Shares were seized on 21 October 2015.301 Hence, neither of these events pre-date the Cut-Off Date of 14 February 2015.\n\nRej.

CE-105, Decision of the Privatization Agency on the Transfer of BD Agro's Capital, 21 October 2015.\n\n452.\n\nThis being so, Serbia argues the Claimants must have been aware that the Agreement could be terminated, and they could incur a loss as soon as on 1 March 2011 when BD Agro received the First Notice dated 25 February 2011. However, the breach alleged by the Claimants arises out of the termination of the Agreement not of the First Notice or any subsequent ones.302\n\nRej. J., \u00a7\u00a7599-600 (\"Nowhere in their submissions did the Claimants ever argue that the Privatization Agency's finding of the purported violation of the Privatization Agreement, which was notified to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 for the first time in March 2011, constituted the basis of their claims [...] the Claimants obviously mention in their submissions the Privatization Agency's notifications as well as the Privatization Agency's other problematic actions that also predate the Canada-Serbia BIT. The Claimants, however, do not refer to these pre-treaty facts because they would consider such facts to constitute Serbia's breaches of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\").\n\n***d. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n453.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing discussion, that the Treaty\u2019s temporal scope of application and the statute of limitation are no bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**5. Abuse of Process**\n-----------------------\n\n454.\n\nThe Respondent also objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground of abuse of process. The Claimants do not take issue with the characterization of this objection as a matter of jurisdiction rather than admissibility. As this distinction makes no difference to the outcome reached below, the Tribunal will review this objection in the present context.\n\n***a. Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the \"Claimants\u2019 conduct represents an abuse of the arbitration mechanism\" with the consequence that their investment should be denied protection. It first contends that Mr. Rand\u2019s conduct is abusive because he initiated this arbitration \"fully cognizant of the fact that [he] did not acquire a property right that was recognized and protected under the laws of the host State.\"303\n\nRej., \u00a71047.\n\n456.\n\nThe arbitration is also abusive, says Serbia, because it arises out of a domestic investment, and essentially concerns whether the Privatization Agency validly terminated the contract it had concluded with Mr. Obradovi\u0107, a Serbian national and the buyer of BD Agro. The initiation of the present arbitration is thus \"nothing more than an attempt of Claimants to internationalize [a] domestic dispute and to misuse the ICSID System for purposes it was not intended, in contravention with the principle of good faith.\"304\n\nRej., \u00a71045.\n\n457.\n\nSerbia also considers that Mr. Rand\u2019s \"fabricated\" his beneficial ownership of BD Agro to \"circumvent\" jurisdictional requirements. It emphasizes that Sembi\u2019s 2008 financial statements that allegedly record the beneficial ownership were filed with the Cypriot Registrar of Companies as late as August 2014, at a time when the dispute with the Agency was foreseeable. For Serbia, this shows Mr. Rand\u2019s intention to \"deceive\" the Respondent and \"manipulate\" the Tribunal and constitutes an \"abuse of the arbitration mechanism.\"305\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7169.\n\n458.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, between 2013-2015, Mr. Rand attempted to transfer the Privatization Agreement to Mr. Rand\u2019s Cypriot company, Coropi, knowing fully well that the Agency\u2019s consent was required for the transfer. That attempt failed. Yet, Mr. Rand nevertheless commenced this arbitration, based on his alleged beneficial ownership, effectively acting as if the transfer had taken place. For the Respondent, this claim is not in good faith and should thus be dismissed as such.\n\n459.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that Mr. Rand intends to use this arbitration to collect EUR 2.7 million that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 admitted owning to Sembi, trying to settle this business issues in a manner that constitutes an abuse of process.306\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7168.\n\n***b. Claimants\u2019 Position***\n----------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe Claimants put forward that this objection rests entirely on the incorrect premise that treaties only protect property rights that were \"recognized and protected under the laws of the host state.\" They recall that, international investment law protects not only proprietary rights, but also rights *in personam* and rights of beneficial ownership. According to them, numerous international tribunals and scholars share this view.\n\n461.\n\nFor the Claimants, Serbia's contention that \"the beneficial ownership theory was fabricated in order to circumvent jurisdictional obstacles\" is contradicted by several facts which occurred years before the dispute arose. For instance, the MDH Agreement through which beneficial ownership was transferred to MDH was concluded in 2005, which shows that Messrs. Rand and Obradovi\u0107 both intended that Mr. Rand become the beneficial owner of BD Agro upon its privatization. In 2008, on the basis of the Sembi Agreement, Sembi recorded its beneficial ownership of the Beneficially Owned Shares in its annual returns, which were filed in 2009. Still in 2008, Mr. Rand paid EUR 2.2. million for the purchase and transport of heifers from Canada to BD Agro. He would not have made these payments if he had not been the beneficial owner of BD Agro.\n\n462.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants find \"disingenuous\" Serbia's portrayal of the Claimants' efforts to obtain nominal ownership of BD Agro in 2013-2015 as an attempt to restructure the investment to gain international protection for a foreseeable dispute. When Mr. Rand first sought to assign the Privatization Agreement to Coropi in 2013, the termination of the Privatization Agreement, let alone the subsequent seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares, was not foreseeable.\n\n463.\n\nThe Claimants also oppose Serbia's submission that the claims are abusive because they are motivated by an attempt to collect EUR 2.7 million from Mr. Obradovi\u0107. For one, this allegation was raised belatedly. Further, even if true, this would not constitute an abuse of process as it does not involve fictitious transactions or the restructuring of an investment after the impugned breach. Further still, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 does not owe EUR 2.7 million to Sembi. Under the Sembi Agreement, Sembi acquired receivables against BD Agro of EUR 4.7 million, arising under loans that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had granted to BD Agro from the Lundins' funds. BD Agro later repaid these loans to Mr. Obradovi\u0107. Sembi directed Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to use EUR 2 million to pay the last two instalments of the purchase price of BD Agro. The remaining EUR 2.7 million were used for other purposes, unrelated to BD Agro. It is on the ground of accounting rules that Sembi records these amounts as owed by Mr. Obradovi\u0107.\n\n***c. Analysis***\n-----------------\n\n464.\n\nThe doctrine of abuse of right is a general principle of law that \"prohibits the exercise of a right for purposes other than those for which the right was established.\"307 Abuse of process is a subcategory of abuse of right focusing on the misuse of a procedural right and especially of the right to arbitrate. For instance, a corporate restructuring to benefit from treaty jurisdiction over a foreseeable dispute has been found to constitute an abuse of process.308 It is well-settled that the threshold for finding an abuse of right or process is high.309\n\nExh.

CLA-28, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Award, 27 September 2017, \u00a7376, where the Claimants commence an arbitration to gain a benefit which is inconsistent with the purpose of international arbitration.\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. RLA-188, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. The Commonwealth of Australia,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00a7539.\n\n465.\n\nIn the circumstances of this dispute, the Tribunal does not discern an abuse.\n\n466.\n\nSerbia's position that Mr. Rand started this arbitration knowing that he had no rights and seeking to \"internationalize\" a domestic dispute is misconceived. The foregoing analysis has shown that the dispute has connections with more than one national legal system and is thus international in nature.\n\n467.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Mr. Rand fabricated transactions to benefit from the arbitration clause in the Canada-Serbia BIT. The Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Treaty arises out of the contractual interest Mr. Rand acquired in the Beneficially Owned Shares through the Sembi Agreement. Serbia does not allege that that Agreement was forged or fictitious. It only challenges whether and, if so, when Sembi's 2008 financial statements were filed with the Cyprus Registrar of Companies. Yet, other contemporaneous documents prove that Sembi's relationship with BD Agro commenced in 2008.310 Neither does Serbia contend that the dispute with the Agency was foreseeable at the time Messrs. Rand and Obradovi\u0107 entered into the Sembi Agreement in 2008.\n\nSee C-PHB 2, \u00a733(e) and Exh. CE-911, Sembi's Income Declaration for 2008 filed with Cyprus Income Tax Office, 7 June 2010.\n\n468.\n\nIn the same vein, the Respondent's argumentation in connection with the assignment to Coropi is unfounded. The Tribunal's assessment of the record does not confirm Serbia's views. As explained earlier, in 2008, through the Sembi Agreement, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 transferred certain interests to Sembi. The Agency's approval was not required for the transfer as the Privatization Agreement itself was not transferred. In 2013, when the Claimants intended to assign the Agreement as such to Coropi, they asked for the Agency's approval. That attempt was unsuccessful. Mr. Rand initiated the present arbitration in 2019 based on the interests he had indirectly acquired through the Sembi Agreement, not based on the assignment of the Agreement.\n\n469.\n\nFinally, Serbia's contention with respect to Mr. Rand's attempted collection of a EUR 2,7 million debt of Mr. Obradovi\u0107 cannot be given more credit. It is entirely speculative; Serbia produces no evidence whatsoever in support. Moreover, either Serbia is responsible for breaching the Canada-Serbia BIT in which event it will have to compensate Mr. Rand or it is not. Whatever the outcome, there will be no collection of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's alleged debt. Further, even if the facts underlying Serbia's argument were accepted, the Tribunal does not consider that they show an abuse of process.\n\n470.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Serbia's abuse of process objection.\n\n***d. Conclusion on Jurisdiction***\n-----------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over Mr. Rand's claims under the ICSID Convention and the Canada-Serbia BIT in respect of his interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares but lacks jurisdiction over his claims in respect of his payments for the benefit of BD Agro and his indirect shareholding in BD Agro. It also does not have jurisdiction over the claims of the other Claimants under the Canada-Serbia BIT, nor does it have jurisdiction over Sembi under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT. Accordingly, in the liability section below the Tribunal will only review the alleged breaches of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n**VII. LIABILITY**\n------------------\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Parties' arguments on attribution ((A) below), the general defense based on the exercise of sovereign powers invoked by Serbia ((B) below), and then the Parties' positions on each alleged breach ((C) and (D) below) followed by a discussion of the exception under Article 18(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT ((E) below).\n\n**A. Attribution**\n------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n473.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Privatization Agency was structurally and functionally part of the Serbian administration and, thus, represented a *de facto* organ of Serbia under Article 4 of the ILC Articles. Specifically, it points to the following elements:\n\n\u2022 The Serbian Government appointed the Agency's Board of Directors, the Management Board as well as the Director of the Agency;\n\n\u2022 The Commission for Control, the body that decided upon the termination of the Privatization Agreement, was established by the Ministry of Economy;\n\n\u2022 The Agency was supervised by the Ministry of Economy and the Serbian Government. For instance, the Agency's own representatives confirmed that the entire privatization process was supervised by the Ministry of Economy and the Council of Ministers. The Agency also had to report to the Ministry of Economy at least twice a year;\n\n\u2022 \"Most of the money\" earned by the Agency from the sale of privatized assets was forwarded to the state budget. These funds were then put to Government use in accordance with the national investment plan;\n\n\u2022 The European Court for Human Rights \"repeatedly and unequivocally\" confirmed that the Agency was a \"state body.\"\n\n474.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimants argue that the conduct of the Agency is attributable to Serbia under Article 5 of the ILC Articles. For them, the fact that the Agency exercises governmental authority is evident from the following facts:\n\n\u2022 Privatization agreements, which fell within the Agency's purview, are not ordinary commercial agreements. They are deemed *sui generis* contracts pursuing a specific aim of promoting economic development and social security;\n\n\u2022 The Agency was a \"holder of public powers\" under Article 46 of the Law on State Administration. The Agency exercised such public powers when concluding, performing and terminating the Privatization Agreement. This was also confirmed in arbitral proceedings involving the Agency, including the *Uniworld* arbitration;\n\n\u2022 The Notice of Termination and the Decision on Transfer of Capital have characteristics of administrative acts. In addition, the unilateral seizure and transfer of the Beneficially Owned Shares by the Agency was an exercise of governmental authority. No private party could have done so, and Serbia does not argue to the contrary.\n\n475.\n\nIn the further alternative, the Claimants contend that the impugned actions of the Agency were directed and controlled by Serbia within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles. They observe that the Agency always acted under binding instructions given by the Ministry of Economy. In fact, the Agency's representatives referred to the Ministry's instructions as \"orders\" and considered themselves bound to follow such orders. They further note that the Agency refused to take any decision regarding the Privatization Agreement before it received the Ministry's conclusions from the latter's supervision procedure. When it received those conclusions, it followed them and terminated the Agreement \"in line with the Report of the Ministry of Economy.\"311\n\nExh. CE-50, Notice on Termination of the Privatization Agreement.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n476.\n\nSerbia submits that a \"closer look\" at the relevant authorities including the ILC Articles reveals that the Privatization Agency's conduct in the present case cannot be attributed to it.\n\n477.\n\nSerbia denies that the Agency is a *de facto* organ under Article 4 of the ILC Article, noting that the Agency has a separate legal personality which, it says, creates a \"strong presumption\" against the existence of a *de facto* organ.312 This conclusion is all the more certain as the Agency does not act in \"complete dependence\" on the State. Quite the opposite, the Agency has an independent budget and autonomous management, and engages in commercial activities. Contrary to the Claimants\u2019 suggestion, the fact that the Agency is an organ of the State from a \"functional perspective\" is irrelevant. Several arbitral tribunals have held that the fact that an entity carries out public activities is not determinative of its status as a state organ, if it is not structurally an organ.313\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7542.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7542 et seq.\n\n478.\n\nSerbia equally disputes that the Agency\u2019s conduct can be attributed to it under Article 5 of the ILC Articles. The Claimants\u2019 position that the Agency acted as an \"agent\" of Serbia in administering the sale of socially and State-owned assets is irrelevant. Only those acts that are the subject-matter of the Claimants\u2019 complaints are of relevance. These acts, including the Agency\u2019s refusal to release the pledge over the Privatized Shares and to consent to the assignment of the Privatization Agreement, and the termination of such agreement are commercial in nature. They can be undertaken by any party to a commercial contract, with the result that they would not fall within the ambit of Article 5 of the ILC Articles. Further, the transfer of the Agency\u2019s functions to the Ministry of Economy following the dissolution of the Agency cannot as such make these functions governmental in nature.314\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7572.\n\n479.\n\nSerbia also challenges the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Agency\u2019s conduct is attributable on the basis of Article 8 of the ILC Articles. It emphasizes that conduct can only be attributed to the state on this ground if instructions, direction and control are established with respect to specific conduct of a person or group of persons. Here, the Claimants have failed to establish the specific conduct by the Agency that violated their rights, nor have they shown that such conduct was exercised on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Serbia. For instance, while the Claimants insist that the Agency\u2019s decision to terminate the Privatization Agreement \"had been imposed\" by the Ministry of Economy, the record contains no such instruction.315 Similarly, although the Claimants argue that the Agency acted on the instructions of the Ombudsman in terminating the Privatization Agreement, the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations are not binding.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7585.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n480.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the acts of the Ministry of Economy, the Ombudsman and the Privatization Agency are attributable to Serbia under Articles 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles. Serbia does not contest the application of the ILC Articles, nor that the actions of the Ministry of Economy and the Ombudsman are attributable to it, since both are its organs under Serbian law.316 It does, however, dispute that the conduct of the Agency is attributable to the State.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7537, 539 (\"It is not in dispute between the Parties that [the ILC Articles] should govern the question of attribution to Respondent [...] Claimants also contend that the conduct of the Ministry of Economy and the Ombudsman should be attributed to Respondent, which is not in dispute, since both are Respondent\u2019s organs under Serbian law.\").\n\n***a. Article 4 of the ILC Articles***\n--------------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nArticle 4 of the ILC Articles sets out the basic rule that the conduct of a State organ is an act of the State and is thus attributed to the State:\n\n\"Article 4 - Conduct of organs of a State\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\"\n\n482.\n\nThe Claimants appear to have abandoned their claim that the Privatization Agency is a *de jure* organ of Serbia under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.317 They are right to have done so. The starting point for characterizing an entity as a state organ is the internal law of the State in question318 and the fact that an entity has separate legal personality creates a presumption that it is not a state organ within the meaning of Article 4.319 Here, according to the Law on Privatization Agency, the Agency has independent legal personality.320\n\nSee Mem., p. 94 (\"The Privatization Agency was an organ of the Republic of Serbia within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles\") and Reply, \u00a7940 (\"Although the Privatization Agency is not explicitly described as a State organ under Serbian law,\"); C-PHB 1, \u00a7171.\n\n*See* Exh.

The use of the word \"include\" shows that a body which acts as an organ but does not qualify as such under the internal law of the State may nevertheless be deemed an organ under Article 4 (ILC Commentary 11 ad Article 4).321 On this basis, the International Court of Justice has developed the notion of *de facto* organ in the context of the attribution of activities of paramilitary groups.322 Persons or groups may thus be equated to a *de jure* organ if they act \"in 'complete dependence' on the State, of which they are ultimately merely the instrument.\"323 This is not the case here. The Agency was not \"completely dependent\" on the State. It had its own independent means of financing (commission from sales),324 its own bank account,325 and was independent in disposing of its budget.326 Further, the Agency's activities were largely commercial, including, for instance, selling certain types of publicly held shares and stock.327 This, of itself suffices to dispel the notion that the Agency is a *de facto* organ of the State,328 not to speak of the lack of \"complete dependence\" from the State.\n\nSee Exh.

The Republic of Poland,* PCA Case No. 2015-13, Award, 27 June 2016, \u00a7210 (\"The ILC's commentary to Article 4 suggests that 'the conduct of certain institutions performing public functions and exercising public powers (e.g. the police) is attributed to the State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous and independent of the executive government'. By contrast, where an entity engages on its own account in commercial transactions, even if these are important to the national economy, this inference will not be drawn.\").\n\n484.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Agency was not an organ of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles. The fact that the Agency carried out \"public services\", that members from Serbian ministries sat on Commissions set up within the Agency, or that the Agency had to advise the Ministry Economy on its activities twice a year does not change the fact that, structurally, the Agency is not an organ of Serbia. Neither does the fact that the European Court of Human Rights characterized the Agency as a \"state body\" lead to a different conclusion. All of these factors might, however, be relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s examination of whether the acts of the Agency can be attributed to Serbia under Articles 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles, to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n***b. Article 5 of the ILC Articles***\n--------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nArticle 5 of the ILC Articles provides that the acts of entities which are not organs but exercise governmental authority may be attributable to the State if they are carried out in that capacity:\n\n\"Article 5 - Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\"\n\n486.\n\nFor an act to be attributed to a State under Article 5, two conditions have to be fulfilled cumulatively: first, the impugned act must be performed by an entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority; and second, the act itself must be performed in the exercise of governmental authority.329\n\nSee Exh. RLA-83, *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, \u00a7163.\n\n487.\n\nThe first requirement that the Agency be empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority does not appear to be in dispute between the Parties, and correctly so. The Privatization Agency was empowered by the Law on Privatization Agency330 and the Privatization Law331 to exercise certain tasks and assume certain responsibilities that originally belonged to the Ministry of Economy332 in the process of privatization of State or socially-owned assets. The privatization process itself, which the Agency implemented and controlled, was entirely non-commercial, which the Supreme Court of Cassation of Serbia recognized as well.333 The Privatization Agency itself recognized that, when performing its tasks under the Law on Privatization Agency and the Privatization Law, it was \"not [acting] as a contract party but as the holder of public powers.\"334 The Ministry of Economy justified its supervision of the work of the Agency by referring to Article 46 of the Law on State Administration,335 which provision entitled the Ministry of Economy to supervise \"holders of public authorities while performing delegated state administration tasks.\"336 The Ombudsman too can review the activities of an entity only when it has acted as a public authority.337\n\nExh.

My question was: is the Ombudsman authorised to review all activities of holders of public authority, or only their activities that constitute delegated state administration tasks? Prof. Radovi\u0107: Not all activities, only activities where the public authority acts as an authority.\").\n\n488.\n\nBy contrast, the Parties are in disagreement on the second requirement according to which the impugned acts must have been performed in the exercise of governmental authority.\n\n489.\n\nThe term \"governmental authority\" is not defined in the ILC Articles. In the context of ILC Article 5, the tribunal in *Jan de Nul* held that \"governmental authority\" meant the use of \"pr\u00e9rogatives de puissance publique\",338 an interpretation that has since been followed by a number of tribunals. Not every act of an entity empowered to exercise governmental authority is attributable to the state: the commentary to the ILC Articles clarifies that \"the conduct of an entity must [...] concern governmental activity and not other private or commercial activity in which the entity may engage.\"339 Thus, if the conduct in question was one that could be undertaken by a private counterparty,340 then that would not satisfy the second limb of Article 5, and that conduct would not be attributable to the state.\n\nExh. RLA-83, *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008*,* \u00a7170; Exh RLA-115, *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v.

Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, \u00a7170 (\"[a]ny private contract partner could have acted in a similar manner.\").\n\n490.\n\nAs discussed below, the Agency's seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares deprived Mr. Rand of the entirety of his investment. No further harm could be suffered by him. As a result, the Tribunal focuses its analysis on whether the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares was performed in the exercise of governmental authority or whether the Agency acted in a commercial or private capacity when it seized the Shares.\n\n491.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares involved the exercise of governmental authority. Article 41(2) of the 2014 Privatization Law provided that the capital acquired by the buyer on the basis of a privatization agreement would be transferred to the Privatization Agency upon termination.341 After it terminated the Agreement, through its Decision on Transfer of Capital, the Agency seized all the Beneficially Owned Shares. No private party could have done so. Serbia does not appear to challenge that a private entity cannot seize shares from a buyer without first securing its consent or prevailing in litigation before a competent court or tribunal.\n\nExh. CE-223, Article 41(2) of the 2014 Privatization Law: \"In case of termination of the agreement on sale of the capital, the entire capital referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, including own shares acquired based on the capital increase through new stakes, shall be transferred to the Agency.\" An analogous provision was contained in Article 41(5) of the 2001 Law on Privatization, in effect on the date the Privatization Agreement was concluded, Exh. CE-220, 2001 Law on Privatization.\n\n492.\n\nSerbia's objection that the seizure is an \"automatic consequence\"342 of the termination of the Privatization Agreement does not change the assessment. If anything, it would rather reinforce it. The Agency's power to unilaterally appropriate for itself the ownership of the Beneficially Owned Shares is sovereign in nature, whether or not it is the consequence of another act.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7571.\n\n493.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Agency's seizure of the Beneficially Owned Share is attributable to Serbia. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal can dispense with reviewing the third basis for attribution under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.\n\n**B. Exercise of Sovereign Powers**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n494.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's \"primary defense\" to its \"clear\" Treaty breaches is that the Agency purportedly acted as a regular commercial party and its conduct, therefore, cannot violate international law. They stress that this defense lacks merits for the reasons explained in the context of attribution as well as for other reasons.\n\n495.\n\nFirst, so argue the Claimants, there is no \"firm requirement\" that any treaty breach must involve the exercise of sovereign powers. Several investment tribunals have held that every act of a sovereign State can be characterized as a \"sovereign act\", including the breach or termination of a contract to which the State is a party. For the Claimants, there is no reason to allow a State to escape its liability under an investment treaty merely because its relationship with an investor is contractual. The formalism advocated by the Respondent would enable States to pursue sovereign objectives with impunity under the \"guise\" of a contractual relationship.343\n\nReply, \u00a71018.\n\n496.\n\nThe Claimants' second argument is that several investment awards have confirmed that privatization *per se* is governmental, not commercial in nature. Here, the privatization process was an \"inherently governmental process\" pursuing \"governmental interests.\"344 The public policy goals underlying the privatization of BD Agro can be seen from the Privatization Agreement itself. No ordinary share purchase agreement would require the buyer to invest in the target company, maintain its business operations and set forth a comprehensive social program, as the Privatization Agreement did. The fact that aspects of the Privatization Agreement were governed by private law is without relevance. Investment tribunals have found that the application of private law to elements of the activity of state agencies does not change the governmental nature of the other acts of that agency. In addition, the legal framework of the Agreement \"substantially differed\" from regular private law contracts.345\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71021-1024.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71028-1029.\n\n497.\n\nIn third place, the Claimants assess that it is obvious that the Agency was vested with and exercised sovereign powers unavailable to any commercial party. The Agency benefited from \"special powers\" under the Law on Privatization. In the present case, the Agency's conduct had \"nothing to do with an ordinary commercial conduct.\"346 For instance, commercial parties cannot seize shares from their counterparts without first securing their consent or prevailing in litigation before a competent court. For the Claimants, the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the subsequent seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares were sovereign acts \"par excellence.\" Serbian law confirms that the conduct of the Agency in connection with the performance and termination of the Privatization Agreement was the conduct of \"holders of public authorities while performing delegated state administration tasks\" within the meaning of Article 46 of the Law on State Administration. Further, the Claimants emphasize that the termination produced legal effects that \"no ordinary commercial legal relationship could conceivably have had.\"347\n\nRely, \u00a7\u00a71006-1007.\n\nReply, \u00a71039.\n\n498.\n\nFourth, say the Claimants, the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares were sovereign acts because they were not motivated by any commercial consideration. They represented abuses of governmental power motivated by a desire to maintain the Privatized Shares within the Agency's reach for \"impending seizure.\"348\n\nReply, \u00a71032; see also Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 213 ff. and Mem., \u00a7146.\n\n499.\n\nThe Claimants' fifth and last argument is that the termination and seizure resulted from, and implemented, the Ombudsman's unlawful investigation and his recommendations, which were sovereign acts. Further, the Agency \"sought and received instructions\" from the Ministry of Economy in respect of the termination.349 Investment awards have concluded that the termination of a contract involved a State's sovereign powers because it was based on the intervention of State bodies, which was clearly the case here.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71034-1035 and 1043-1046.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n500.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, even if the Agency's conduct in relation to the Agreement were unlawful, such conduct could not trigger Serbia's liability under the BITs because the Agency did not exercise sovereign powers.350 The relevant test to determine whether an entity exercised sovereign powers is whether the complained conduct was a \"conduct any contract party could adopt.\"351 The Tribunal must assess and distinguish, on the one hand, \"ordinary commercial contractual practice\" and, on the other hand, \"exercise of [...] state functions.\"352\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7591-623; Rej., \u00a7\u00a71132-1154.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7592-598, referring to Exh. CLA-37, *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00a7348.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7595; see also Rej., \u00a71154.\n\n501.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimants' argument that the \"sovereign objectives\" behind the Agreement necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Agency exercised sovereign powers.353 In the same vein, Serbia challenges the Claimants' argument that the \"inherently governmental\" nature of the Agreement characterizes the Agency's acts as sovereign. It stresses that the \"broader social purpose\" of privatization is beside the point. What matters, says the Respondent, is the use of *\"pr\u00e9rogatives de puissance publique\"* or \"governmental authority\", which is clearly missing here. Further, the exercise of governmental authority must be established in each specific instance of impugned conduct and \"cannot be drawn from generalizations about the nature of the process\"354. The Agency's refusal to release the pledge and assign the Agreement and the termination were \"normal\", \"lawful\" \"reasonable\" and \"commercial\" acts of a \"contracting party.\"355\n\nRej., \u00a71137.\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00a772.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7599-602.\n\n502.\n\nFurther, the Respondent objects to the Claimants' argument that the termination and transfer of shares were sovereign acts because they were not motivated by any commercial considerations. It considers that the argument starts from a \"wrong premise\", because it assumes that, for an act to be governmental in nature, it cannot be motivated by commercial considerations. Yet, what matters is the substance of an act, not its motivation. Investment tribunals have not looked into the reasons behind an act but into whether the act itself was an exercise of governmental authority irrespective of the reasons for which it was undertaken.\n\n503.\n\nSerbia also counters the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Privatization Agency acted in a sovereign capacity when terminating the Agreement because it had received instructions on termination from the Ministry. For the Respondent, the Ministry supervised the Agency\u2019s control over the performance of the Agreement and provided instructions in this regard but did not address termination itself. In any case, even if there were instructions to the Agency to terminate the Privatization Agreement *(quod non),* this still would not make the termination an exercise of governmental powers. The involvement of state organs is insufficient to transform a commercial act into an exercise of governmental powers.\n\n504.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes that the legal consequences of the termination and especially the transfer of the Privatized Shares confer \"public character\" to the Agency\u2019s acts. While it is correct that the legal framework governing the Agency is different from general contract law, it \"remains firmly in the field of private law\" and within the jurisdiction of civil courts as opposed to administrative courts.356\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7622; see also Rej., \u00a7\u00a71150 and 1152.\n\n505.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the Claimants\u2019 position that, since the Agency terminated the Agreement in reliance not on its Article 7 but on the Law on Privatization, the termination constituted an exercise of governmental powers. The grounds for termination in Article 7 of the Privatization Agreement supplement the grounds in Article 41a of the Law on Privatization. They were all part of the commercial relationship \"entered freely\" by the Buyer and the Agency. Moreover, the Respondent insists that the reason for the termination was the violation of a contract provision, which is a commercial reason that has \"nothing to do\" with exercise of governmental powers.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n506.\n\nSerbia insists that none of the impugned acts involve the exercise of sovereign power, with the result that the Tribunal must dismiss all of the claims. By contrast, the Claimants stress that the Treaty contains no such requirement, which should thus not be imposed by the Tribunal. They also emphasize that in any event each of the acts complained of involved sovereign power.\n\n507.\n\nThe Canada-Serbia BIT does not expressly require that the measures alleged as breaches must have been carried out by a State in its sovereign capacity. There is no question, however, that the international responsibility of a State under a treaty can only be engaged in the exercise of sovereign powers for acts not as a party to a contract.357 Indeed, the substantive standards of investment treaties are intended to protect foreign investors from unlawful measures taken by the host State in its capacity as sovereign.358 Therefore, save possibly for certain umbrella clause claims, treaty breaches can only result from actions performed by the State as a sovereign.\n\nSee, for instance Exh. RLA-116, *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability, 30 July 2010, \u00a7\u00a7 153, 154 (\"[i]n investor-State arbitrations which involve breaches of contracts concluded between a claimant and a host government, tribunals have made a distinction between *acta iure imperii* and acta *iure gestionis,* that is to say, actions by a State in exercise of its sovereign powers and actions of a State as a contracting party. It is the use by a State of its sovereign powers that gives rise to treaty breaches, while actions as a contracting party merely give rise to contract claims not ordinarily covered by an investment treaty.\"). See also Exh. CLA-24, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries.\n\nExh. CLA-37, *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00a7348 (holding that that there is no exercise of sovereign power if the conduct in question is \"conduct which any contract party could adopt.\").\n\n508.\n\nFor the reasons previously mentioned, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares (\u00a7490). In other words, it will review whether the Agency exercised sovereign prerogatives in seizing the Beneficially Owned Shares. Attribution in and of itself is not sufficient. As it is clear from ILC Articles 1 and 2, for the international responsibility of a State to be engaged, it must have committed an internationally wrongful act, *i.e.* an act that is attributable to that State under international law and that constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that State.359\n\nSee also for instance Exh. RLA-84, *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, \u00a7129 (\"finding of attribution does not necessarily entail that the acts under review qualify as sovereign acts.\").\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 41(2) of the Privatization Law empowered the Agency to seize the Beneficially Owned Shares automatically, without the intervention of a court or tribunal and without returning the purchase price. Private contract parties do not have such rights. The seizure is an authoritative decision of the Agency, which determines the rights of the Buyer in a definitive manner and cannot be directly challenged.360 On this basis, it is clear that in seizing the shares, the Agency exercised sovereign powers.\n\nSerbia agrees. See Rej., \u00a71118 (\"[a]s the termination could be challenged by the buyer in a civil court, the latter could also seek interim measure to prevent the Agency from further disposing with shares.\"). See also Mirjana Radovi\u0107 ER I, \u00a754.\n\n**C. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n510.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Serbia failed to accord them fair and equitable treatment (FET) as required under the Canada-Serbia BIT. They argue that the Canada-Serbia BIT envisages \"essentially the same level of protection\"361 as the Cyprus-Serbia BIT and dispute Serbia's submission that Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT is \"less generous\" than Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT as the former is linked to the international minimum standard of treatment.362 They also reject Serbia's stand that the international minimum standard of treatment is restricted to conduct that is \"shocking or egregious\"363, and assert that the Tribunal should apply the standard set in *Waste Management II v. Mexico.364*\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71205-1212.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71206-1207.\n\nReply, \u00a71213.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71206-1222, also referring to Exh. RLA-39, *Mondev International Ltd. v.

Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Award, 29 June 2012, \u00a7\u00a7218-219.\n\n511.\n\nFor the Claimants, the following measures breached the FET provision of the Canada-Serbia BIT: (a) the termination of the Privatization Agreement; (b) the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares; (c) the refusal to release the pledge; (d) the refusal to allow the assignment of the Privatization Agreement; and (e) the Ombudsman's interventions.\n\n***a. The Termination of the Privatization Agreement***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the termination of the Privatization Agreement was unlawful. First, the Privatization Agreement was not breached ((i) below). Even if it were, the alleged breach was not a valid ground for termination ((ii) below). In any event, termination was in bad faith ((iii) below) and disproportionate ((iv) below).\n\n**(1) The Privatization Agreement was not breached**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nIt is the Claimants' submission that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 did not breach Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement when BD Agro took a loan of approximately EUR 2 million from Agrobanka, secured it with a pledge on its land, and used the monies for the benefit of Mr. Obradovic's companies as described above, and re-lent part of the funds to Crveni Signal and Inex.\n\n514.\n\nFirst, the Claimants point out that Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement imposed obligations solely on Mr. Obradovi\u0107 while the pledge that allegedly violated Article 5.3.4 was established by BD Agro, not Mr. Obradovi\u0107.\n\n515.\n\nSecond, Article 5.3.4 only precluded Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from pledging BD Agro's assets as security for loans taken by third parties. Here, BD Agro pledged its land to secure a loan which it took for itself and used for the operation of its farm to a significant extent. For the Claimants, re-lending money originally lent to BD Agro constitutes use of funds by BD Agro and, therefore, cannot violate Article 5.3.4. They further stress that there was nothing irregular in BD Agro's use of the funds, as is evident from the fact that both Crveni Signal and Inex partially repaid their debts to BD Agro.\n\n516.\n\nThe Claimants consider that Serbia's assertion according to which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 also breached Article 5.3.4 because BD Agro pledged its assets as security for the EUR 0.6 million loan taken by Crveni Signal on 2 June 2010 is \"irrelevant, baseless and belated.\" They submit that this argument was raised for the first time in the Respondent's post-hearing submission and was not mentioned in the Notice of Termination. Further, and in any event, Serbia admitted that Crveni Signal's June 2010 loan was repaid on 29 December 2010. While the pledge securing this loan remained registered thereafter, this was due to the failure of the state-controlled Nova Agrobanka to provide the confirmations necessary to remove the pledge. Yet, the pledge was no longer enforceable and could thus not be in breach of the Privatization Agreement.\n\n**(2) There was no valid ground for termination**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, even if there had been a breach, Article 5.3.4 is not among the grounds for termination exhaustively listed in Article 7.1 of the Privatization Agreement. The Agreement could not, therefore, be terminated for breach of Article 5.3.4, which Radovi\u0107 & Ratkovi\u0107, the law firm engaged by the Agency, confirmed. Serbia's contrary arguments cannot be sustained for several reasons.\n\n518.\n\nFirst, according to the Claimants, Serbia's position that the Agency could terminate the Privatization Agreement for any breach would render Article 7.1 useless. Serbia has not explained why the Agency, which drafted the Privatization Agreement and had detailed knowledge of the Law on Privatization, would include a meaningless provision in the Agreement.\n\n519.\n\nSecond, so the Claimants submit, Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization, which Serbia also invokes, does not entitle the Agency to terminate the Agreement. Article 41a(1)(3) is a \"generic provision\" that provides that a privatization agreement can be deemed terminated if, within an additional period granted to a buyer, the buyer disposes of the property subject to privatization in a manner contrary to the agreement. Article 41a(1)(3) cannot be read in isolation; it must be considered in the context of an actual privatization agreement. Here, Article 41a(1)(3) cannot override the Agreement and the choice of the Agency, as the sole drafter of the Agreement, not to include the breach of Article 5.3.4 among the grounds for termination under Article 7. Moreover, the Respondent's interpretation is contrary to the wording of Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization, which refers to compliance with the \"provisions\" (in plural) of a privatization agreement. Article 41a(1)(3) thus refers to both Article 5.3.4 and Article 7.1 of the Privatization Agreement.\n\n520.\n\nTheir view, say the Claimants, is consistent with the opinion of Radovi\u0107 & Ratkovi\u0107, the law firm retained by the Agency. That firm found that, pursuant to Article 7 of the Privatization Agreement and Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization, the Agency had no right to terminate the Privatization Agreement for the alleged breach of Article 5.3.4. At the time of the termination, the Agency was aware of its lawyers' assessment of the legal position.\n\n521.\n\nThird, for the Claimants, the alleged breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement was minor and did not concern an essential term of the Agreement. Under Article 131 of the Law on Obligations, an agreement can only be terminated for the violation of an essential obligation, provided that violation is not minor.\n\n522.\n\nFor the Claimants, the purported breach of Article 5.3.4 did not meet either of the conditions set forth under Article 131. Article 5.3.4 is not an essential obligation because its breach would not endanger the achievement of the main purpose of the Agreement. The provision only secures the buyer's performance of its other obligations in the Agreement. The accessory character of the provision is further evidenced by the fact that it is not included in the exhaustive list of termination grounds in Article 7.1. Additionally, even if Article 5.3.4 imposed an essential obligation *(quod non),* the alleged violation would be minor in a quantitative sense because the pledge in question was \"insignificant\" compared to the value of BD Agro's assets. The violation would also be minor in a qualitative sense because the violation would not affect the achievement of the remaining \"main goal and purpose\" of the Agreement, which was the payment of the final instalment of the purchase price. In fact, only four months after the alleged breach, the purchase price was paid in full and the Privatization Agreement was consummated.\n\n523.\n\nFourth, the Claimants put forward that the Privatization Agreement could not be terminated for the alleged violation of Article 5.3.4 after the obligations under Article 5.3.4 had expired on their own terms, *i.e.* after the payment of the full purchase price.\n\n524.\n\nFifth and in any event, the purported breach was cured before the termination. The Claimants point out that the 2010 Loan was repaid long before the Agency terminated the Privatization Agreement. While the underlying pledges remained registered in the cadaster, this was only because the state-controlled and managed Nova Agrobanka arbitrarily refused to issue a confirmation necessary for their deletion.\n\n525.\n\nSixth, it is the Claimants' position that under the Privatization Law, the Agency was only entitled to monitor the buyer's compliance with its obligations under the Privatization Agreement. Unlike what it sought to do, it could not request any remedies that it deemed appropriate. In any event, the remedies which the Agency pursued were unjustified and unlawful:\n\n\u2022 For instance, the alleged breach of Article 5.3.3 could not have been remedied; the cows were culled and could not be risen from the dead. Moreover, the crux of the allegation was that BD Agro had pledged its assets and used the borrowed funds for the benefit of third parties. That alleged breach could have been cured by cancelling the pledge or obtaining the return of the funds. Either one of these actions would have been sufficient to remedy the alleged breach of Article 5.3.4. There was therefore no justification for the Agency's request that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 perform both.\n\n\u2022 The Agency's insistence that the pledge be deleted from the cadaster \"served no purpose.\" Nova Agrobanka could not have exercised any rights under the pledge given that the secured loan had been repaid. Moreover, Nova Agrobanka was controlled by Serbia and Mr. Obradovi\u0107 could not be held accountable for the bank's failure to take action for the deletion of the pledge.\n\n\u2022 The Agency repeated all of its requests without engaging with the factual evidence and legal reasoning with which it was provided and which showed that no breach had occurred; that had there been a breach, it had been cured; and that the Agency was not entitled to terminate the Privatization Agreement. The Agency repeatedly requested the same information, the information was provided, and then the Agency requested it again.\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimants refute the Respondent's position that the Agency was under an obligation to determine whether a breach had been remedied. They emphasize that, after the performance of the Agreement on 8 April 2011, the Agency was limited to ascertaining whether the alleged breach was \"still present\", which is different from assessing whether a breach has been remedied. Indeed, a party can cease to be in breach not only when it remedies the breach, but also when the breached obligation no longer applies. For the Claimants, the latter is exactly what happened - the obligations arising out of Article 5.3.4 ceased to apply when the full purchase price was paid on 8 April 2011. As Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had no further obligations under the Privatization Agreement after 8 April 2011, the Privatization Agreement could not be terminated after that date.\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimants equally dispute the Respondent's argument that a buyer's duty to remedy a pre-existing breach of an obligation survives the expiration of such an obligation, stating that this argument finds no support in Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization. Following the Respondent's view would mean that a buyer would be required to remedy a pre-existing breach while at the same time it would be entitled to engage in the very same conduct that led to the alleged breach in the first place (as the obligation baring such conduct had expired). This would obviously be an absurd situation.\n\n528.\n\nThe Claimants strongly reject the Respondent's argument that all issues with the Privatization Agency would have been resolved had Inex and Crveni Signal repaid the funds owed to BD Agro. This is clearly a \"made-for-arbitration argument\", contrary to contemporaneous documentary evidence and testimony of witnesses on both sides.\n\n529.\n\nFinally, the Claimants underline that most of the practice and case law relied upon by the Respondent in support of its arguments concern privatization agreements concluded before Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization was \"substantially amended\" in 2005.365 The Tribunal should therefore be cautious in relying on those authorities.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7407-408.\n\n**(3) Termination was in bad faith**\n------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Agency acted in bad faith in terminating the Privatization Agreement, which say the Claimants, is evident from the following facts:\n\n\u2022 The Agency kept the Claimants \"in limbo\" for years refusing to finalize BD Agro's privatization. As explained below, it made several requests which it must have known to be unlawful and not susceptible of being fulfilled. For instance, in April 2015, the Agency requested that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 submit evidence that he had performed his obligations under Article 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 \"no later than\" 8 April 2011. This request was clearly unlawful because Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization only entitles the Agency to verify compliance at the end of the additional term for compliance, not in the past;\n\n\u2022 In October 2006, the Agency declared that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had complied with Article 5.2.1 of the Agreement which required him to contribute approximately EUR 2 million to BD Agro. Nevertheless, it continued to ask for evidence of compliance nine years after its statement;\n\n\u2022 The Agency also continued to request proof that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had fulfilled his obligations under Article 5.3.3 despite knowing that the alleged breach of Article 5.3.3, *i.e.* the culling of cows could not be complied with as the cows had been culled long before 8 April 2011. In addition, the culling represented a force majeure event which the Agency acknowledged during internal meetings. In any event, despite the fact that the culling of the cows obviously could not have been cured, the Agency continued to request evidence of compliance with Article 5.3.3 until the Privatization Agreement was terminated;\n\n\u2022 The Agency's conduct was \"procedurally abusive.\" To take but one example, in the last notice sent to Mr. Obradovi\u0107, the Agency asked for performance of several obligations within a five-day period, which was plainly impossible;\n\n\u2022 When the Agency eventually proceeded to terminate the Privatization Agreement, it did so even though it had opinions from the Ministry of Economy and its law firm Radovi\u0107 & Ratkovi\u0107 that there was neither an economic nor a legal justification for termination;\n\n\u2022 The Agency retained the pledge of the Beneficially Owned Shares after the payment of the purchase price despite acknowledging that the pledge should have been lifted once the price was paid.\n\n**(4) Termination was disproportionate**\n----------------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the subsequent transfer of the Beneficially Owned Shares was unlawful under Serbian law and resulted in an unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' investment. Even if the Tribunal held that the termination and share transfer complied with the law, the expropriation would still be unlawful, since Serbia's acts were \"completely disproportionate\" under Serbian and international law.\n\n532.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the constitutional principle of proportionality requires the Privatization Agency, as a holder of public powers, to proceed with the termination of the Privatization Agreement only if it is proportionate and necessary. Even if the Privatization Agency were not found to hold public powers and its acts were examined on a mere contractual level *(quod non),* those acts would constitute a violation of Articles 12 and 13 of the Law on Obligations, which impose a duty of good faith and prohibit the abuse of a right.\n\n533.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the proportionality test under Serbian law is based on three sequential questions: first, whether a measure was taken for legitimate reasons; second, whether less obstructive alternatives were available; and, third, whether the benefits of the measure outweigh its costs. The termination of the Privatization Agreement fails this test on all counts:\n\n\u2022 The termination did not serve any legitimate purpose as Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had complied with his obligations under Article 5.3.4, and breaches of that provision were not valid termination grounds pursuant to Article 7.1 of the Privatization Agreement;\n\n\u2022 Even if Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had violated Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement, the Agency should have provided him with a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violation requesting the repayment of loans from third parties or the \"non-exercise\" of the pledge on BD Agro's assets. Instead, the Privatization Agency insisted on the return of the funds as well as on the deletion of the pledge, ignoring the fact that Nova Agrobanka could no longer exercise the pledge after BD Agro had fully repaid its EUR 2 million loan on 22 June 2012. The Privatization Agency's reactions to alleged breaches of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement were thus excessively restrictive;\n\n\u2022 The termination was disproportionate *stricto sensu* because the Privatization Agency's requests to remedy the alleged breach of Article 5.3.4 lost their purpose following the full payment of the purchase price on 8 April 2011.\n\n534.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the principle of proportionality is part of international law and has been applied by several investment tribunals. The tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador* for instance observed that the principle of proportionality meant that even if an investor has violated its duties, any penalty imposed by the State must be proportionate to the violation and its consequences.\n\n535.\n\nFor the Claimants, the termination of the Privatization Agreement was a disproportionate response to the purported breach of Article 5.3.4. The pledge caused no damage: the existence of the pledge did not impact on BD Agro's value. The Ministry of Economy itself recognized it when it considered in 2012 that there was no economic justification for terminating the Privatization Agreement because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had already paid the purchase price and the encumbrances did not threaten the continuity of BD Agro's business. The lack of proportionality is also evident from the fact that the termination of the Privatization Agreement and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares occurred over four years after the full price for BD Agro was paid.\n\n536.\n\nThe Claimants dismiss the Respondent's contention that the Agency had no option but to terminate the Agreement. They note that the Respondent has not explained, for instance, why the Agency could not issue a contractual penalty for the purported breach of Article 5.3.4. Neither has Serbia explained why the Agency could not waive a breach of the Privatization Agreement. In fact, the Privatization Agreement suggests the contrary: under Article 5.3.4, the Agency could give prior consent to a disposition that would otherwise breach that provision. Thus, there is no reason why the Agency would lack the authority to subsequently waive any breach based on such a disposition. Moreover, the Respondent\u2019s experts confirmed that privatization agreements cannot be terminated for minor breaches, which can only mean that the Agency could waive minor breaches.\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute Serbia\u2019s argument that their proportionality challenge was belated. Since the beginning of the arbitration, they have submitted that the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the expropriation of the Beneficially Owned Shares was disproportionate. Even if the claim had been raised at the Hearing, as Serbia argues, Serbia would still suffer no prejudice. The claim was not based on new facts and Serbia had ample opportunity to address it in its post-hearing briefs, which it actually did.\n\n538.\n\nFor the Claimants, Serbia\u2019s submission that the Privatization Agreement was terminated because the Privatization Agency needed to send a message that non-compliance would not be tolerated shows that the Agency failed to weigh the seriousness of the alleged breach and harm against the significance of the termination sanction. It simply imposed an exemplary punishment, which was the \"antithesis\" of proportionality.\n\n539.\n\nThe Claimants finally challenge Serbia\u2019s argument that the requested remedies were meant to \"protect the well-being of BD Agro\" from Mr. Obradovi\u0107's mismanagement. They turned BD Agro into one of the largest and most modern farms in Europe despite the enforced slaughter of the original herd, the ban on cow imports, and the severe drought in 2012. By contrast, under Serbia\u2019s stewardship, BD Agro wound up in bankruptcy.\n\n***b. Seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares pursuant to a Decision on Transfer of Capital, by which the ownership of the shares passed to the Privatization Agency through registration on the Agency\u2019s account with the Central Securities Depository, was in \"willful disregard of the law.\"\n\n541.\n\nThe Claimants also deny the Respondent\u2019s argument that, because the transfer of shares was an \"automatic\" consequence of termination under the Law on Privatization, it cannot be wrongful. Such defence has no basis in international law.366 Serbia bears liability for its \"individual volitional acts\" as well as for acts which \"automatically\" result from the application of its domestic legislation, as long as they impact the Claimants\u2019 investment. Further, the Respondent cannot rely on the \"legal characteristics\" of the measures under its own domestic laws to escape its international liability.367 Therefore, it is irrelevant whether the transfer of the Beneficially Owned Shares automatically resulted from the termination of the Privatization Agreement or not.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71076-1079.\n\nReply, \u00a71078.\n\n***c. Refusal to release the pledge***\n--------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Privatization Agency was entitled to maintain the pledge for a period of five years only, *i.e.* from the conclusion of the Privatization Agreement until the payment of the full purchase price. Accordingly, the Agency should have released the pledge immediately after Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s payment of the last price instalment on 8 April 2011. Discussions within the Agency\u2019s Commission of Control show that the Agency knew that it had to release the pledge upon payment of the price. However, it did not do so, thereby breaching the non-impairment clause.\n\n543.\n\nThe Claimants dispute that the Agency could lawfully maintain the pledge as long as it considered Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to be in breach of any obligations under the Privatization Agreement. First, the purpose of the pledge was to secure monetary receivables, not Mr. Obradovi\u0107's compliance with all obligations under the Agreement, including those arising under Article 5.3.4. As soon as the last instalment of the purchase price was paid, the pledge should have been released. Second, even if the pledge had secured Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations under Article 5.3.4 *(quod non),* the Privatization Agency would still have been required to release the pledge on 8 April 2011, when the term of the Privatization Agreement ended. Third, Article 2 of the Share Pledge Agreement is unambiguous in that it does not allow the Agency to retain the pledge after payment in full. Even if there was an ambiguity, it would have to be resolved in favor of Mr. Obradovi\u0107 as the non-drafting party.\n\n***d. Refusal to allow the assignment of the Privatization Agreement***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Agency\u2019s \"refusal to allow\" the assignment of the Agreement \"significantly contributed to BD Agro\u2019s insolvency\" and \"constituted an arbitrary and unreasonable measure.\"368 They further contend that \"Serbia had no problems with approving of assignment of privatization agreements for other companies [Mr. Rand] acquired in Serbia\" and that \"[t]he fact that the Agency refused to do so in the case of BD Agro thus clearly demonstrate[d] the arbitrariness of its conduct.\"369\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71177-1180.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00a7272.\n\n545.\n\nThe Claimants dispute Serbia's submission that the assignment could not be approved because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and Coropi did not provide the documents requested by the Agency. Some documents - such as the confirmation of compliance with Article 12 of the Privatization Agreement - simply could not be provided. The request for other documents, such as the bank guarantee requested by Serbia in January 2015, a year and a half after the Agency's consent to the assignment was first sought, was \"entirely unreasonable.\" The entire purchase price had been paid by then and the Agency was not entitled to any further payments that the guarantee would have secured. At any rate, the Claimants stress that the Respondent's contentions are \"at odds with reality\" because the negotiations relating to the assignment never progressed as the Agency acted in bad faith throughout the process.370\n\nReply, \u00a71179, referring to Exh. CE-768 (transcript from Agency Control Commission Meeting of 23 April 2015), p. 9.\n\n546.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute Serbia's claim that the refusal to allow the assignment of the Privatization Agreement did not impair the Claimants' investments because it did not affect Mr. Obradovi\u0107's rights under the Privatization Agreement. This contention is absurd, say the Claimants, because \"the purpose of the entire Privatization Agreement was to transfer the ownership of the Beneficially Owned Shares to Mr. Obradovi\u0107\" and \"[o]ne of the most fundamental aspects of ownership is the owner's ability to dispose with the property.\"371 On this basis, the Claimants insist that the \"Privatization Agency prevented Mr. Obradovi\u0107 from transferring the nominal title to the Beneficially Owned Share [sic] not only by arbitrarily refusing to release the pledge but also by rejecting without any legitimate reasons the requests for the assignment of the Privatization Agreement to Coropi.\"372\n\nReply, \u00a71180.\n\nReply, \u00a71180.\n\n***e. Ombudsman\u2019s interventions***\n----------------------------------\n\n547.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Ombudsman\u2019s \"intervention\" was grossly arbitrary and a \"patent example of an abuse of powers without any legitimate purpose.\"373 They insist that the Ombudsman \"blatantly overstepped\" his legal mandate when he \"pushed\" for the termination of the Privatization Agreement. Moreover, rather than protecting the rights of Serbian citizens, the Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations showed little concern for the rights of BD Agro\u2019s employees. His purported recommendations served as a pretext for his \"willful pressure\" on the Ministry of Economy and the Privatization Agency to terminate the Agreement. The latter terminated the Privatization Agreement only after the Ombudsman\u2019s unlawful intervention, which was arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\nReply, \u00a71190-1199, in particular, \u00a7\u00a71194 and 1198.\n\n***f. Other breaches***\n-----------------------\n\n548.\n\nSerbia also breached the FET standard, argue the Claimants, by adopting measures against the Claimants\u2019 investment in bad faith. First*,* the Privatization Agency acted in bad faith when it refused to release the pledge and refused to allow the assignment of the Privatization Agreement. This was done with the sole aim of retaining the option to expropriate the Claimants\u2019 shares. Second, the Privatization Agency acted in bad faith when it terminated the Privatization Agreement as it knew that the alleged violation of Article 5.3.4 was not a valid ground for termination under Article 7.1 of the Privatization Agreement. For the Claimants, Serbia\u2019s bad faith alone suffices to constitute a breach of the FET standard.\n\n549.\n\nThe Claimants submit that still another breach of the FET standard occurred as a result of Serbia\u2019 actions that \"amounted to a pattern of orchestrated wrongful conduct\"374 that effectively destroyed the Claimants\u2019 investment. Serbia \"deliberately and consistently\" adopted measures aimed at destroying the Claimants\u2019 investment in BD Agro, including by refusing to release the pledge and approve the assignment of the Privatization Agreement. Further, the actions of the Privatization Agency, the Ombudsman and the Ministry of Economy, \"completely deprived\" the Claimants of all their interests in BD Agro. Moreover, Serbia also failed \"to pay any regard whatsoever to the protection of the Claimants\u2019 interests.\"375\n\nReply, \u00a71232.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71248, 1252-1253.\n\n550.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that the Agency and the Ombudsman frustrated their legitimate expectations by \"blatantly disregard[ing]\" the terms of the Agreement,376 which constitutes yet another breach of the FET standard. In particular, the Agency deceived the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations (i) that the pledge over BD Agro\u2019s shares would be released after full payment of the purchase price and that the Claimants would be free to dispose of the shares; (ii) that the Privatization Agreement would not be terminated for reasons not stipulated therein; (iii) that the Claimants business would be conducted in a stable regulatory framework, without undue government influence. They add that the Ombudsman also breached the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations by his unlawful interference with and pressure on the Ministry of Economy and the Privatization Agency to terminate the Privatization Agreement.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71255-1272, in particular, \u00a71260.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n551.\n\nSerbia disputes that any of the measures identified by the Claimants were wrongful. It submits that the relevant standard of treatment accorded under Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT is the \"customary international law minimum standard\", which differs from \"autonomous\" standards such as the one found in Article 2(2) of the Serbia-Cyprus BIT.377 The Claimants\u2019 submission that the two standards are essentially identical \"blatantly disregards\" the wording of Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.378 Autonomous standards cannot be regarded as reflecting customary rules.379\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a71318-1320.\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a71321-1322, referring to Exh. RLA-136, *Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, 24 March 2016, \u00a7503, and Exh. RLA-138, *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, 12 January 2011, \u00a7176.\n\nRej., \u00a71324, referring to Exh. CLA-129, *Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, \u00a7\u00a7271-273.\n\n552.\n\nSerbia further contends that the applicable threshold to find a breach under customary international law is \"exceptionally high\" and require \"manifest\" arbitrariness,380 which the Claimants have failed to prove. Moreover, it points out that a mere contractual breach cannot be considered an arbitrary act in breach of FET, unless it is also shown that the State committed an \"outright and unjustified repudiation of the transaction\" and prevented the investor from resorting to any remedy to resolve the problem, or that the breach of contract was \"motivated by sectoral or local prejudice.\"\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a71329-1334, in particular \u00a7\u00a71333 and 1334.\n\n***a. Termination of the Privatization Agreement***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Privatization Agreement was breached**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, in principle, a breach of Article 5.3.4 could take two forms: first, a loan taken by the buyer for which the privatized entity's property is pledged as security and second, a loan taken by the privatized entity itself against a pledge of its property as security and the transfer of the borrowed funds to a third party. In both cases, there is a pledge in favor of the lender on the privatized entity's property, while the user of the borrowed funds secured by the pledge is a third party, and there is a breach of Article 5.3.4. Such breach can be remedied by deleting the pledge on the privatized entity's property or by the third party repaying the funds to the privatized entity. Neither happened in this case.\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent points out that there were several breaches of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement. All of these breaches were remedied, but for the breach due to the 2010 Loan, as a result of which the Agreement was terminated.\n\n555.\n\nSerbia insists that there was an \"obvious\" and \"straightforward\" breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement.381 For the Respondent, it is clear that the transactions relating to the 2010 Loan Agreement involving Crveni Signal and Inex were not part of BD Agro's \"regular business activity.\"382 It would make \"no sense\" and \"completely ignore [...] the ordinary meaning\" of the wording of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement if loans to third parties and the assumption/repayment of third party debts were to qualify for the exception in Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement.383\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a795 ff. and 116-125.\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a7100-101.\n\nRej., \u00a7102.\n\n556.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants' position that the funds used to assume Crveni Signal's debt and to provide Inex with a loan were \"used by\" BD Agro within the meaning of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement leads to \"absurd results.\"384 That position relies on an \"inaccurate translation\" of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement when the proper construction of the Serbian wording of the provision confirms that the exception envisaged therein is limited to funds used \"for the benefit of BD Agro and nobody else.\"385\n\nRej., \u00a7103.\n\nRej., \u00a7104, referring to the Radovi\u0107 ER II, \u00a724.\n\n557.\n\nFurther, the Respondent challenges the Claimants\u2019 argument according to which a pledge under Article 5.3.4 should be interpreted so that the words \"to be used by the subject\" encompass lending funds secured by a pledge to third persons. It submits that the Claimants\u2019 interpretation is wrong considering the text and purpose of Article 5.3.4 as well as Serbian court practice. As far as the text is concerned, the Serbian original emphasizes the end use of the funds by the privatized entity. As for the purpose of Article 5.3.4, it is clear as well and consists in safeguarding the property of the privatized company and preventing its use for the benefit of third persons. While the privatized company could give loans to third persons, Article 5.3.4 prohibits loans given from funds obtained by pledging the company\u2019s assets as it \"endanger[s] its very substance.\"386\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7181.\n\n**(2) There was a valid ground for termination**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the termination of the Privatization Agreement due to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's breach of Article 5.3.4 was valid and in accordance with Serbian law. The Privatization Agreement could be terminated for a breach of Article 5.3.4 even after the purchase price was paid in full, as can be seen from the Agency\u2019s consistent practice and judicial decisions.\n\n559.\n\nAccording to Serbia, the objective of privatization, as set out in Article 2 of the Law on Privatization and interpreted by the Serbian Supreme Court, was not limited to the sale of the entity being privatized, but included the development of the entity to promote overall economic growth, the creation of stable business and social security conditions.387 The Supreme Court further observed that all obligations in a privatization agreement are equally relevant for the achievement of the goal of privatization. Failure to perform any of the contractual obligations obstructs the very purpose of privatization. Thus, says the Respondent, a privatization agreement can be terminated on the ground of a Buyer\u2019s failure to perform any of its contractual obligations. This is exactly what happened here: the Privatization Agreement was rightfully terminated because Mr. Obradovi\u0107 breached Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7172, citing Exh. RE-165, Judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of the Republic Serbia, Prev 129/2013, 19 June 2014, p. 2.\n\n560.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the motive for Mr. Obradovi\u0107's breaches of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement is relevant. It points out that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 benefited from each breach of Article 5.3.4. For instance, in June 2010, on the same day that Crveni Signal took a loan from Agrobanka which was guaranteed by BD Agro, Crveni Signal also concluded a loan agreement with Mr. Obradovi\u0107 through which it lent him RSD 65 million. Thus, the money that Crveni Signal received from Agrobanka, which was secured by BD Agro's assets, was actually used to benefit Mr. Obradovi\u0107. Similarly, the funds BD Agro received from Agrobanka under the 2011 Loan that BD Agro later transferred to Inex, also eventually ended up in Mr. Obradovi\u0107's personal bank account. Mr. Obradovi\u0107 then used part of that money - received from Inex and Crveni Signal - to pay the last instalment of the purchase price on 8 April 2011.\n\n561.\n\nSerbia also challenges the Claimants' submission that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and others, including Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, were unaware that the breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement could have been remedied by simply repaying the outstanding loans given to Crveni Signal and Inex. It insists that the opposite is true. For instance, the letter which Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 sent as general manager of BD Agro on 2 July 2015, months before the termination, recognized that the problem with the fulfilment of the Privatization Agreement was \"in relation to lending to third parties, namely Inex Nova Varos ad Nova Varos and Crveni signal a.d. Beograd.\" Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 thus admitted that obligations under the Privatization Agreement were not complied with in relation to Crveni Signal and Inex.\n\n562.\n\nThe Respondent also contests the Claimants' argument that the Agreement could not be terminated under Article 41a(1)(3) of the Privatization Law. The Claimants' interpretation presupposes that, when Article 41a(1)(3) refers to the Privatization Agreement, it refers to its Article 7 only. This is not correct, since under Article 41a(1)(3) one must determine \"what kind of disposal of the property is contrary to the privatization agreement and not which disposal represents the reason for termination according to privatization agreement itself.\"388 A reference to the termination grounds listed in the privatization agreement is required to apply a different provision, *i.e.* Article 41a(1)(7), which provides for termination \"in other cases provided for by the agreement.\"389\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7243.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7243.\n\n563.\n\nFurthermore, for Serbia, the Claimants\u2019 interpretation would make Article 41a(1)(3) redundant by limiting it to cases that are already covered by Article 41a(1)(7). Once the parties to the Privatization Agreement stipulated a prohibition of certain dispositions in the Agreement, a breach of that prohibition \"automatically\" became a reason for termination by force of law under Article 41a(1)(3). This situation must be distinguished from the parties\u2019 stipulating additional reasons for termination in the privatization agreement itself, which would fall under Article 41a(1)(7). Serbian court decisions support this view.\n\n564.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 position that the termination of the Privatization Agreement was illegal because the obligation under Article 5.3.4 had \"ceased to exist\" when the purchase price was paid in full. It points out that the Agency has terminated other privatization agreements after that time and that the Serbian courts have not held such termination unlawful.\n\n565.\n\nMoreover, Serbia rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that the termination was illegal because Article 5.3.4 is not an \"essential term\" of the Privatization Agreement. Serbian law does not recognize the concept of essential obligations. Article 131 of the Law on Obligations which the Claimants invoke, does not contain these words. Further and in any event, says the Respondent, the purported distinction between essential and non-essential obligations has no place in the specific context of privatization. It would contradict the decisions of Serbian courts that in a privatization all contractual obligations are equally important to achieve the purpose of privatization.\n\n566.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent disputes the Claimants\u2019 argument that the breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Privatization Agreement was \"minor\", and as such did not allow a termination of the Privatization Agreement. The funds borrowed in 2010 did not represent an insignificant part of BD Agro\u2019s assets. BD Agro\u2019s purchase price was EUR 5.5 million. The funds that were used for the benefit of Crveni Signal and Inex were EUR 959,719, approximately 17% of the total purchase price, and 140% of the value of its one instalment. As failing to pay just one instalment was a reason for termination, \"the pertinent funds were obviously far from minor.\"390 Second, the breach did threaten the main purpose of the Privatization Agreement. As already observed, Serbian courts have repeatedly found that, in such respect, all contractual obligations in a privatization process are equally relevant.\n\nRej., \u00a7222.\n\n567.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimants cannot now challenge the validity of the termination as they \"deliberately\" chose not to repay the outstanding loans given to Crveni Signal and Inex.391 It emphasizes that BD Agro was overly indebted at the time and that its bank accounts were blocked, which were likely the reasons for BD Agro's failure to do so, as it was \"evident\" that BD Agro's creditors would collect any payments ending up in BD Agro's accounts.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7\u00a7221-222.\n\n568.\n\nIt is the Respondent's further submission that the Claimants' allegation that they failed to remedy the breach of the Privatization Agreement because the Agency was not clear in its communications are wrong. The Agency repeatedly invited Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to remedy the breach, but the Claimants made a \"deliberate decision\" that debts of Crveni Signal and Inex would not be repaid. For the Respondent, \"this situation is nothing else but a manifestation of bad faith.\"392\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7223.\n\n569.\n\nSerbia also disagrees with the Claimants' argument that the Agency \"requested the impossible\" when it asked them to remedy the earlier breach of Article 5.3.3 of the Privatization Agreement. The Agency did not require that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 retroactively cure this breach, but simply asked for an audit report containing an unequivocal statement that Article 5.3.3 of the Privatization Agreement had not been breached.\n\n570.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Agency had no option other than to terminate the Agreement. It could not claim damages, as the Claimants suggest, as it had not suffered any damages due to the breach of Article 5.3.4. Neither could it waive the breach. Either the privatization was successful, and all obligations were completed, or it was not. Judicial decisions support this view. The Agency could either prolong the time limit for compliance or terminate. As Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had repeatedly failed to remedy a breach, extending the deadline for doing so would have been \"pointless.\" In addition, in September 2015, when Mr. Obradovi\u0107 threatened to sue the Agency, \"it was obviously pointless and unreasonable to grant him additional time to comply with Article 5.3.4.\"393\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7262.\n\n571.\n\nFor Serbia, the Claimants\u2019 submission that the payment of the last instalment of the purchase price made the breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement irrelevant, cannot be sustained. Since a breach of Article 5.3.4 occurred and an additional period for compliance was granted before the payment of the purchase price, Mr. Obradovi\u0107's obligations under the Agreement continue[d] to exist.*\"*394 Further, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 continued to pay interest for late payment to the Agency until December 2011.395 For the Respondent, the sequence of events described above \"shows that the breach was important and significant not only from the perspective of the Privatization Agreement but also from the perspective of Mr. Obradovic who paid the last instalment by committing the breach.\"396\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a799, 101 and 104; Rej., \u00a7214\n\nRej., \u00a7214.\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00a778.\n\n572.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants wrongly assert that the pledges were retained due to the state-owned Agrobanka\u2019s failure to issue a necessary confirmation. The refinancing agreement for the 2011 Loan explicitly retained the pertinent pledges. There was thus no basis for them to be deleted. In addition, there was no evidence that the Claimants had ever requested deletion, nor sought deletion in court.\n\n573.\n\nSerbia essentially disagrees that the case law on which it relies is irrelevant as it relates to the termination of privatization agreements concluded before the Law on Privatization was amended in 2005. It points out that the relevant provisions of the Privatization Law have remained unchanged. The import of the court judgments is not limited to the termination of pre-2005 privatization agreements, and, the Claimants have not supplied a single decision on the Law on Privatization before or after 2005 that contradicts the Respondent\u2019s assertions.\n\n**(3) Termination was not in bad faith**\n----------------------------------------\n\n574.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimants\u2019 contentions that termination of the Agreement was declared in bad faith. Termination was the measure of last resort in response to Mr. Obradovi\u0107's failure to remedy the breach after repeated notices of the Agency. BD Agro's bankruptcy, which was an unavoidable result from Mr. Obradovi\u0107's mismanagement, does not change the purpose behind the termination, which was to protect the company.\n\n575.\n\nAnother equally important purpose behind the termination, says the Respondent, was to \"strengthen\" compliance with third party privatization agreements. Indeed, \"[w]hen the Buyer is asked to remedy an already existing violation of Article 5.3.4, this sends a message to thousands of other buyers that non-compliance has not been and will not be tolerated.\"397 This was especially important as the Agency was faced with having to terminate around 20-30% of the privatization agreements. If the Agency had waived non-compliance, it would have encouraged other buyers not to comply with their own obligations. It might even have led to discrimination claims.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7264.\n\n576.\n\nFurther, for the Respondent, the Claimants are wrong in arguing that the Agency acted in bad faith because it knew that the violation of Article 5.3.4 was not a valid ground for termination under Article 7 of the Privatization Agreement. The transcript of the meeting of the Commission for Control reveals that the Agency was aware that it could terminate on the basis of Article 41a of the Law on Privatization irrespective of the content of the Privatization Agreement. The Agency had, in fact, terminated privatization agreements on the basis of Article 41a alone, even when the breach did not appear among the grounds of termination in the agreement itself.\n\n577.\n\nThe Claimants are equally wrong, says Serbia, when they assert that the Agency continued to ask Mr. Obradovi\u0107 to remedy the breaches of the Privatization Agreement, despite the opinions of the Ministry and the Agency's own external legal advisors. The Ministry did not address the legal aspects of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's compliance with the Agreement. As far as the external legal advisors, theirs was merely an opinion which did not bind the Agency. The Agency considered different opinions and took its decision based on the law, which can hardly be considered unreasonable, arbitrary or in bad faith.\n\n578.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the Agency was under an obligation to terminate the Privatization Agreement in application of Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization, if it did not provide additional time for compliance. As many deadlines had passed without Mr. Obradovi\u0107 remedying the breach, providing additional time would have been pointless.\n\n**(4) Termination was not disproportionate**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the termination of the Privatization Agreement was proportionate. While the Claimants argue that the \"lack of proportionality\" under Serbian law was one of the reasons why the termination of the Privatization Agreement was unlawful, Serbia states that proportionality is irrelevant as \"the principle of proportionality in the Constitution of Serbia applies to restrictions of human and minority rights, and has no place in contractual relationships.\"398 For the Respondent, the \"idea\" of proportionality in a contractual context is reflected in Article 131 of the Law on Obligations, which bars termination of contracts in cases where only an insignificant part of the obligation remains unfulfilled. For the reasons explained below, a violation of Article 5.3.4 was not a minor breach, which confirms that the Agency's termination was proportionate.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7294.\n\n580.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the termination meets the Claimants' own \"made up\" test for proportionality under Serbian law. The termination pursued \"legitimate aims\" and was the only viable option available to the Agency. The proportionality analysis must not only balance the purpose to be achieved and the means employed from an economic point of view, but also take into account the buyer's \"bad faith\" and \"recalcitrant attitude\", as well as the general purpose of privatization. From this perspective, the termination was \"clearly proportional.\"\n\n581.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants' contention that the termination of the Privatization Agreement breached the standard of proportionality applicable to all treaty standards under general international law. This argument was raised at the hearing for the first time in \"gross violation\" of the applicable procedural rules, putting the Respondent in a position of \"gross inequality\"; it should thus be disregarded.\n\n582.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that the proportionality argument should be rejected because it is based on the wrong factual assumptions. For instance, while the Claimants insist that it is undisputed that the purpose of Article 5.3.4 was to ensure that Serbia would be paid the full purchase price, the purpose of that provision was not limited in this manner. Rather, the purpose of Article 5.3.4 \"was to ensure that BD Agro would be 'a stable company with a continuous, viable business activity'\", in order to secure the fulfilment of all the obligations under the Privatization Agreement and \"to secure a general public interest in the well-being of privatized companies.\"399\n\nR-PHB \u00a71, \u00a7280.\n\n583.\n\nWhile the Claimants insist that upon the payment of the purchase price, the contract was completed and Article 5.3.4 no longer had any purpose, the Respondent objects that the Agency's insistence on remedying the breach of Article 5.3.4 also sought to strengthen general compliance with privatization agreements in a situation where there was widespread non-compliance. It was particularly important not to turn a \"blind eye\" to the breach of the Privatization Agreement as it would have encouraged non-performance by others. The Agency could not tolerate contract breaches on the basis of their alleged minor significance, as the Claimants suggest, because managing such differentiation would be difficult, if not impossible, in an environment of extensive non-performance.\n\n584.\n\nSerbia also argues that the Claimants' argument that Serbia did not suffer harm as a result of the breach of the Privatization Agreement such as to justify termination, is inaccurate as it was the Agency, not the Respondent, that terminated the Privatization Agreement. In any event, says Serbia, direct economic harm to the Agency was irrelevant. Considering the purposes of Article 5.3.4, what was \"economically relevant\" was BD Agro's \"well-being\", which was \"clearly endangered.\"400 In addition, economic harm should not be a \"decisive consideration\" with regard to termination of privatization agreements, since termination served to induce general compliance, which is important to meet the goals of privatization.\n\nR-PHB \u00a71, \u00a7280.\n\n585.\n\nSerbia also disputes the Claimants' submission that the Agency took the most severe action it possibly could when terminating the Agreement. As already discussed, the Agency had only two options, either to set another time limit for compliance or to terminate. It obviously could not issue a certificate of compliance, because there was no compliance. Neither could it sue for damages, because the damage was not inflicted to the Agency but to BD Agro. For the Respondent, in view of Mr. Obradovi\u0107's bad faith, as he attempted to deceive the Agency and stated that he intended to sue the Agency, granting further extensions for compliance would have served no purpose. Thus, the only \"viable and reasonable\" option was termination.\n\n***b. Seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the fact that, after the termination, the Beneficially Owned Shares were transferred to the Agency without compensation was an \"automatic consequence\" of the termination provided by the Privatization Law to which Mr. Obradovi\u0107 had consented when concluding the Privatization Agreement.401 As such, the transfer of shares represented the exercise of a contractual right of the Agency. It was not an act *iure imperii,* entailing international responsibility.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7635.\n\n587.\n\nAccording to Serbia, the physical taking of assets that occurred in this case, *i.e.* the transfer of the Beneficially Owned Shares, cannot by itself represent an act of direct expropriation. By entering into the Privatization Agreement, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 accepted all of the consequences of a possible breach and termination of the Agreement. The Agency did not invent the transfer of shares as a consequence of the termination. This possibility was well known to Mr. Obradovi\u0107 at the time when he concluded the Agreement. The Respondent insists that the Claimants cannot seriously dispute that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 accepted the obligation to return the shares in case of termination.\n\n588.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants\u2019 argument that the application of the Law on Privatization as part of the contractual framework amounts to Serbia invoking national law to escape liability under international law. For Serbia, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 accepted the application of the Law on Privatization (including the provision on transfer of shares in case of termination) when he entered into the Agreement. The Law on Privatization was incorporated into the Privatization Agreement. It is thus wrong that the Agency\u2019s use of its contractual prerogatives would run against Serbia\u2019s international obligations. The Claimants\u2019 view that contract provisions are subject to an \"international constitutionality\" test cannot be shared.\n\n589.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Ombudsman\u2019s intervention lacked due process. As the Ombudsman did not conduct any proceedings that could affect the Claimants\u2019 rights, there is \"no room\" to resort to due process guarantees to protect the Claimants.\n\n***c. Refusal to release the pledge***\n--------------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants only allege unlawfulness in respect of the Agency's refusal to release the pledge because, according to them, the refusal to release the pledge was contrary to the Privatization Agreement and the Share Pledge Agreement, and not because the Agency's conduct contravened Serbian law. However, Serbian contract law allowed the refusal to release the pledge. The purpose of the pledge was to ensure compliance with all obligations under the Privatization Agreement. That purpose was not exhausted by the payment of the full purchase price and therefore the Agency was under no obligation to immediately release the pledge on payment of the last instalment. Further, Article 122 of the Law on Obligations entitles the Agency to refuse to perform its obligations to release the pledge until Mr. Obradovi\u0107 complied with his obligation under Article 5.3.4, which meant that the Agency was right in refusing to release the pledge until Mr. Obradovi\u0107 rectified his breaches of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement.\n\n591.\n\nIn respect of the Claimants' argument that the refusal to release the pledge was arbitrary and unreasonable because the discussions within the Commission of Control show that the Agency acted in bad faith, the Respondent submits that such commission retained the pledge for the reason that the Agency had mentioned from the beginning, *i.e.* to ensure Mr. Obradovi\u0107's compliance. There was nothing new in the Agency's position which had not been previously communicated to Mr. Obradovi\u0107. The Agency had taken the same position in other privatizations as well. For the Respondent, the evidence on record bears out that the Commission did not act arbitrarily or unreasonably, \"but engaged in rational decision making, carefully weighing issues before it and then took a rational decision not to release the pledge.\"402\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00a7306.\n\n592.\n\nAs regards the Claimants' submission that the pledge could only secure monetary receivables and could thus not be retained to secure Mr. Obradovi\u0107's compliance with other obligations, the Respondent points out that this is not supported by Serbian law. Relying on its expert, the Respondent insists that \"in case of privatization, the pledge secured the Privatization Agency's (future and conditional) right to claim shares back from the buyer in case his potential breach of contract eventually led to termination of the privatization agreement.\"403\n\nRej., \u00a71284.\n\n***d. Refusal to allow assignment of the Privatization Agreement***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Agency's refusal to permit the assignment of the Agreement did not affect Mr. Obradovi\u0107's rights under the Privatization Agreement. Further, the Agency\u2019s \"insistence on proper documentation\" to decide on the assignment was not arbitrary.404 The Agency did not, for instance, have to accept the security provided by Mr. Obradovi\u0107, especially when he had a \"proven record of negligence.\" Moreover, the Agency was always clear that it could not take any decision with regard to BD Agro while the Ministry\u2019s Supervision Proceedings were ongoing. Therefore, the Agency\u2019s conduct \"clearly shows\" that there was no bad faith on its part.\n\nRej., \u00a71303.\n\n***e. Ombudsman\u2019s interventions***\n----------------------------------\n\n594.\n\nSerbia disagrees that the Ombudsman\u2019s investigations and recommendations influenced the Agency\u2019s decision to terminate the Agreement and notes that there is no evidence in the record to this effect.405 These recommendations were not binding and, in any event, the Ombudsman did not ask for termination, only for a decision on the status of the Agreement.\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a71252-1256.\n\n***f. Other breaches***\n-----------------------\n\n595.\n\nIn connection with other alleged breaches, Serbia considers that it did not breach FET on the ground that the Agency acted in bad faith when it refused to release the pledge or to consent to the assignment of the Privatization Agreement or when it terminated the Privatization Agreement for breach of Article 5.3.4. Nor did the Agency know that it could not do so under Article 7.1 of the Agreement. All these arguments have been addressed above.\n\n596.\n\nThe Respondent equally disputes that there was a \"pattern of orchestrated conduct\" aimed at destroying Claimants\u2019 investment. For Serbia, this is simply a reiteration of the Claimants\u2019 bad faith argument, which has already been addressed.\n\n597.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it did not frustrate the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. First, the minimum standard of treatment to be applied pursuant to the Canada-Serbia BIT does not protect legitimate expectations as a stand-alone element of FET. Neither does it protect the expectation of a stable regulatory framework. Further, contract violations, without more such as a denial of justice or discrimination do not suffice to establish FET breaches. Second and in any event, the Claimants could not possibly have held reasonable expectations about the release of the pledge or the termination because neither Mr. Obradovi\u0107 nor Mr. Rand sought professional legal advice with respect to these matters. Further, both Messrs. Obradovi\u0107 and Marki\u0107evi\u0107 accepted that the Agreement had been breached, so it is \"absurd and double-faced\" for the Claimants to assert now that they had an expectation that is contrary to the one they actually held at the time. Third, the Agency\u2019s conduct was always in line with Serbian law and the Privatization Agreement and therefore the Agency\u2019s conduct could not be said to violate the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n598.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Serbia has breached the FET guarantee which is contained in Article 6 of the Canada-Serbia BIT and reads as:\n\n\"ARTICLE 6\n\nMinimum Standard of Treatment\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to a covered investment treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.\"\n\n599.\n\nThe wording just quoted unequivocally limits FET to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens (\"MST\"). The Parties diverge on the content of MST: the Claimants consider that it has evolved over time and is now equivalent to the so-called \"autonomous\" FET standard found in other BITs, while Serbia holds a much narrower view.\n\n600.\n\nThe decision of the U.S.-Mexico Claims Commission in *Neer* of 1926 adopted a restrictive definition of the standard:\n\n\"[T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"406\n\nExh. CLA-133, *LFH Neer and Pauline Neer (USA) v. United Mexican States* (1926), \u00a74.\n\n601.\n\nIt is by now well accepted that such definition has evolved over the years and now offers wider protection to foreign investors than that contemplated in *Neer*.407 How has it evolved and what is the contemporary scope of the protection? On the basis of the authorities cited by the Parties, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the award in *Waste Management II,* which interpreted Article 1105 of the NAFTA, a provision equivalent to Article 6 of the Canada-Serbia BIT, correctly identified the content of the standard:\n\n\"[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant. Evidently the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\"408\n\nExh. RLA-136, *Mesa Power Group, LLC v.

The conduct in question must engender a sense of outrage or shock, amount to gross unfairness or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable standards, or there must have been a lack of due process which has led to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.

For the reasons mentioned below, the Tribunal finds that the Agency\u2019s conduct in terminating the Agreement was unlawful and, therefore, the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares breached Article 6 of the BIT. Having reached this conclusion, for reasons of procedural economy, the Tribunal can dispense with reviewing whether the other measures invoked were also taken in violation of Article 6. Indeed, even if they did, Mr. Rand would not have incurred additional harm, as the seizure of the shares deprived him of the entirety of his investment.\n\na. ***Seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n606.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Agency seized the Beneficially Owned Shares pursuant to its Decision on the Transfer of BD Agro's Capital of 21 October 2015,413 which in relevant part reads as follows:\n\n\"DECISION ON TRANSFER OF CAPITAL of the subject of privatization BD Agro ad Dobanovci\n\n1. *The Privatization Agency is transferred the capital* of the subject of privatization *BD Agro* ad Dobanovci, Lole Ribara bb, registration number: 07054688.\n\n[...]\n\nExplanation\n\n[...]\n\n*Since the Buyer failed to deliver evidence of compliance with the obligations referred to in item 5.3.4 of the Agreement,* within additionally granted term, and pursuant to the auditor's reports of 2011, 2012 and 2015, as well as documentations delivered along with auditor's reports, the obligation was not performed, at its 22nd session held on September 28, 2015, *the Commission for control of performance* of the obligations of the buyer or strategic investor from concluded agreements in privatization procedure *rendered the decision that the Agreement on sale* of socially owned capital through the method of public auction of the subject of privatization Poljoprivredno prehrambeni kombinat Buducnost Dobanovci (now: ad *Bd Agro Dobanovci) of October 4, 2005 was considered terminated due to default* in accordance with Article 88, paragraph 3 of the Law on Privatization, and in regards to Article 41a, paragraph 1, item 3 of the Law on Privatization (Official Gazette of the RS, no. 38/01, 18/03, 45/05, 123/07- other law, 30/10-other law, 93/12, 119/12, 51/14 and 52/14-CC) and pursuant to the Report of the Ministry of Economy on performed control of the work of the Privatization Agency of April 7, 2015.\n\n*Since the sale agreement was terminated, the Agency rendered the decision as in the wording,* pursuant to the provision of Article 41, paragraph 2 of the Law on Privatization.\"\n\nExh. CE-105, Decision of the Privatization Agency on the Transfer of BD Agro's Capital, 21 October 2015 (emphasis added).\n\n607.\n\nThe decision just quoted makes it clear that the justification for the seizure of the shares of BD Agro lied in the termination of the Agreement. Hence, if the termination turned out to be invalid, the seizure would lack any justification and be invalid as well.\n\n608.\n\nThe Agreement was terminated pursuant to the Notice of Termination, which had the following main content:\n\n*\"In accordance with item 5.3.4 of the Agreement, the Buyer undertook not to encumber with pledge the fixed assets of the subject during the term of the Agreement,* except for the purpose of securing claims towards the subject accrued based on regular business activities of the subject, that is, except for the purpose of acquiring of the funds to be used by the subject.\n\nHaving in mind that *in the procedure for control of performance of the obligations from the relevant Agreement it was concluded that the Buyer had not acted pursuant to the stated contractual obligation, the Buyer was granted additional terms for fulfillment, the last of which, by the Decision of the Commission for Control* of fulfilment of obligations of the buyer, or strategic investor from the agreements concluded in the privatization procedure (hereinafter: Commission) was *dated April 23, 2015. The stated Decision,* rendered in accordance with the Report of the Ministry of Economy on performed supervision of the work of the Privatization Agency of April 7, 2015, *stipulated for the Buyer,* inter alia, *to deliver,* within additionally granted term of 90 days after the date of receipt of the Notice, *evidence of actions in compliance with the Notice regarding the additionally granted term of November 9, 2012, and should,* among other things, *perform the obligation referred to in Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement concluding with* [i.e. ending on] *April 8, 2011,* and deliver evidence that all encumbrances have been deleted and all other security instruments for the obligations of third parties have been returned, and all encumbrances which have been registered on no grounds were deleted, as well as that all the loans given to third parties by the Subject of privatization from loan amounts secured by encumbrances on the property of the Subject have been returned and deliver auditor's report where the auditor would declare on actions of the Buyer in line with all the items of the Decision of the Agency granting additional term for the Buyer.\n\n[...]\n\nIn respect of performance of the obligation referred to in item 5.3.4 of the Agreement within additionally granted term, and pursuant to auditor's reports of 2011, 2012 and 2015, as well as documentation delivered along with auditor's reports and subsequently, it was ascertained that the pledge was registered on the immovable property of the Subject as security instrument for the loan of the Subject in the amount of 221,000,000.00 dinars [...], which the Subject received from Agrobanka Belgrade. Part of that loan in the amount of 70,944,422.77 RSD was used on the basis of the Guarantee Agreement no. J182/10-00 of June 2, 2010 (Subject is the guarantor), for settling of the obligations of the company AD Crveni signal Belgrade towards Agrobanka, which the said company had on the basis of the Short Term Loan Agreement 181/10-00 of June 2, 2010 in the amount of 65,000,000.00 dinars. Subsequently, part of the stated loan in the amount of 221,000,000.00 was used for issuing a loan to the company AD Ineks Nova Varos, in the amount of 30,670,690.00 dinars. Pursuant to the report of the auditor Prva revizija doo Belgrade of January 2015 delivered to the Agency on April 30, 2015, BD Agro claimed the funds in the amount of 18,170,690.00 dinars from the company Ineks Nova Varos on the stated basis, and the funds in the amount of 65,904,569.84 dinars from Crveni signal.\n\n[...]\n\n*Since the Buyer failed to provide evidence* in the additionally granted term *that he had complied with the obligation referred to in item 5.3.4* of the Agreement, and according to the auditor's reports of 2011, 2012 and 2015, as well as documentation submitted along with auditor's reports, *the obligation has not been performed, we hereby inform you that, at its 22nd session held on September 28, 2015, the Commission for control* of fulfilment of obligations of the buyer, or strategic investor from the agreements concluded in the privatization procedure *rendered the decision that the Agreement on sale of* socially owned capital through the method of public auction of the subject of privatization [...] *BD Agro* ad Dobanovci, concluded on October 4, 2005, *is considered terminated due to non - fulfillment,* and in accordance with Article 88, paragraph 3 of the Law on Privatization [...] and in regards to Article 41a, paragraph 1, item 3 of the Law on Privatization (....) in line with the Report of the Ministry of Economy on performed supervision of the work of the Privatization Agency of April 7, 2015.\n\n[...]\n\nIn accordance with the stated Decision, the Decision on transfer of shares acquired by the Buyer on the basis of the Agreement on sale of socially owned capital through the method of public auction of the subject of privatization (BD Agro ad Dobanovci) to the Privatization Agency will be rendered.\"414\n\nExh. CE-50, Notice on Termination of the Privatization Agreement (emphasis added).\n\n609.\n\nThe Agreement was thus terminated on 28 September 2015 for an alleged breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement, in respect of loans given to Crveni Signal and Inex in December 2010, which Serbia confirms.415 The other breaches of the Agreement alleged by Serbia thus played no role in the termination.416\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7131.\n\nIn its first post-hearing brief, Serbia argued that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 breached Article 5.3.4 also because BD Agro had pledged its assets as security for a EUR 0.6 million loan taken by Crveni Signal on 2 June 2010. The Notice of Termination does not mention this, and the loan was repaid on 29 December 2010, which Serbia admits. R-PHB 1, \u00a7199.\n\n610.\n\nArticle 5.3.4 of the Agreement expressly limits the prohibition to pledge assets to the duration of the Agreement:\n\n\"5.3 Further obligations of the Buyer\n\nThe Buyer undertakes that he will not perform or allow performance of the following actions without previous written approval by the Agency:\n\n[...]\n\n5.3.4 The Buyer will not encumber with pledge the fixed assets of the subject *during the term of the Agreement,* except for the purpose of securing claims towards the subject accrued based on regular business activities of the subject, that is, except for the purpose of acquiring of the funds to be used by the subject.\"417\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, p. 4 (emphasis added).\n\n611.\n\nAccordingly, a breach of Article 5.3.4 can only occur if BD Agro's assets are encumbered during the term of the Agreement.418 The record shows that the term of the Agreement is tied to the payment of the purchase price:\n\n\u2022 The Share Pledge Agreement provided that the Agreement would \"conclude\" on payment of the Purchase Price:\n\n\"Article 2\n\nConfirmation of the shares referred to in Article 1 of this Agreement is pledged with the Agency by the Pledgor for the period of 5 years as of the day of conclusion of the sale and purchase agreement, that is, until final payment of sale and purchase price.\"419\n\n\u2022 The Agency's Rulebook on Procedure for Control also required the release of the share upon full payment of the purchase price:\n\n\"9.5. In the case of contracts for the sale via public auction of socially-owned capital where pledges have been established on the sold shares/shareholdings until the purchase price is paid in full, the project manager or assistant manager at the Contract Compliance Centre, on foot of an application by the buyer of the capital, accompanied by confirmation from the Finance Centre that the purchase price for the entity being privatised has been paid in full, shall draft a decision removing the pledge from the shares/shareholdings.\"420\n\n\u2022 On 25 February 2011, the Privatization Agency alleged certain violations of the Privatization Agreement, particularly Articles 5.3.3 and 5.3.4. Doing so, it expressly confirmed that those provisions were in effect during the term of the agreement, *i.e.* until the full payment of the purchase price:\n\n\"The last control was performed regarding the performance of obligations of the Buyer referred to in items 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 of the Agreement, namely the obligations which limit the disposal of the fixed assets of the Subject of privatization (alienation and encumbering).\n\n[...]\n\nThe above stated obligations are in effect during the term of the agreement (October 04, 2010), which has been extended, since the Buyer failed to pay the sixth instalment of the sale and purchase price, on which basis the third and last additional term has been granted.\"421\n\n\u2022 On 11 June 2013, the Agency's lawyers, Radovi\u0107 Ratkovi\u0107, concluded unequivocally that the term of the Agreement was until its \"complete fulfilment\", which occurred on 8 April 2011 when the full purchase price was paid. At that time, BD Agro was fully privatized and all legal and contractual prerogatives of the Agency ceased to exist. The Agreement could not be terminated for breach of Article 5.3.4 after that date:\n\n\"Article 5.3.4 stipulates that the Buyer will not encumber with pledge the fixed assets of the subject during the term of the Agreement, except for the purpose of securing claims towards the subject accrued based on regular business activities of the subject, that is, except for the purpose of acquiring of the funds to be used by the subject. As per this Agreement and the Law on Privatization, violation of this obligation is not sanctioned by termination of agreement. The duration of this ban equals the term of the Agreement. *The term of the Agreement is the period until its complete fulfilment. Fulfilment of the agreement occurred on April 8, 2011, when the buyer fully paid the agreed purchase price, by which the socially owned capital which was the subject of sale was completely privatized.*\n\n[...]\n\nBased on the data available, we conclude that the Agreement on sale of the socially owned capital of the subject \"BD AGRO a.d.\" was performed and fulfilled as of April 8, 2011. *After the payment of the sale and purchase price, socially owned capital of the subject of privatization was finally privatized and thus all contractual and legal control authorities of the Privatization Agency ended* [...].\"422\n\nThe Claimants deny that Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement was breached, stating, for instance, that Article 5.3.4 does not apply to BD Agro as that provision only binds Mr. Obradovi\u0107 and that, in any event, Article 5.3.4 does not preclude re-lending money originally borrowed by BD Agro. The Tribunal need not examine these arguments. Indeed, for the reasons mentioned below, the Tribunal concludes that even if there had been a breach, it could not be invoked when the Agreement was terminated in September 2015.\n\nExh. CE-17, Privatization Agreement, 4 October 2005.\n\nExh. CE-763, Privatization Agency's Rulebook on Procedure for Control, 20 May 2010.\n\nExh. C-30, Report of the Privatization Agency on Control of BD Agro, 25 February 2011.\n\nExh. CE-34, 2013 Legal Opinion, 11 June 2013 (emphasis added).\n\n612.\n\nThe full purchase price was paid on 8 April 2011. As the obligation contained in Article 5.3.4 ceased on that date, it could not be breached thereafter. This is a matter of simple logic. It also arises from the clear wording of Article 5.3.4, to which the Tribunal must give effect under Serbian law. The wording of Article 5.3.4 is clear in that it is limited to the term of the agreement, which, in turn is linked to the payment of the purchase price. The purpose of Article 5.3.4 also supports this interpretation: as the Serbian courts have observed, this provision is meant to prevent buyers from reselling or encumbering the company's assets when they have not yet fully paid the purchase price.423 Once a buyer has paid the purchase price, the protection afforded by Article 5.3.4 becomes unnecessary.\n\nExh. CE-722, Judgment of the Commercial Appellate Court No. P\u017e 8687/2011, 18 December 2012 (\"[t]he goal of the provision of Article 5.3.4 is to protect the property of the subject of privatization and to safeguard the material base of the business of the subject of privatization, without which the buyer, due to their nature and the nature of the contract, cannot fulfill other contractual obligations, cannot secure continuity of business operations of the enterprise and fulfillment of the agreed obligations.\").\n\n613.\n\nThe testimony of the Claimants' Serbian law expert, Mr. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 that, after payment of the purchase price on 8 April 2011, all essential obligations of the Agreement were performed, the term of the Privatization Agreement lapsed, and the obligations under Article 5.3.4 expired because they were to last only \"during the term of the [Privatization] Agreement\"424 was not cogently challenged.425\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 ER II, \u00a770.\n\nProfessor Radovi\u0107's oral testimony was not entirely clear on this issue. The Tribunal will avoid giving it much weight, which is in any event not necessary considering the other elements in the record. This said, the Tribunal understood that Professor Radovi\u0107 conceded that, after 8 April 2011, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 could not commit new breaches of the Privatization Agreement. While she insisted that even after 8 April 2011, Mr. Obradovi\u0107 was required to remedy the breach that had allegedly occurred, she later conceded that that interpretation was not supported by the text of the Privatization Law and that all the Agency could do after 8 April 2011 was determine if an alleged breach that pre-existed the determination of the Agreement still existed. See Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 6, 21:1 et seq.\n\n614.\n\nOn 21 September 2011, the Serbian Commercial Appellate Court confirmed that the Privatization Agency had \"limited capacity\" to terminate a privatization agreement, and that, once such an agreement was performed, it could not be terminated:\n\n\"The Privatization Agency holds time limited capacity to terminate the privatization agreement for the period within which, in line with the provisions of the privatization agreement, there is a determined obligation of the buyer of the capital to comply with various obligations from the agreement. With expiration of control deadline for performance of privatization agreement, the agreement is performed in respect of the Agency as the seller of socially owned capital, and in that case, there is no room for termination of performed agreement.\"426\n\nExh. CE-49, Excerpt from the Judgment of the Commercial Appellate Court Pz. 11202/2010, 21 September 2011, p. 3.\n\n615.\n\nIn light of these elements, the Tribunal concludes that the Privatization Agreement could not be terminated after 8 April 2011 for an alleged breach of Article 5.3.4 that had occurred before that date. Therefore, the termination of the Agreement was unlawful.\n\n616.\n\nIt is true that Serbia argues that it could terminate the Agreement pursuant to Article 41 (a)(3) of the Privatization Law. However, that does not seem to be the case. Article 41(a)(3) of the Privatization Law provides that a privatization agreement must be terminated for \"non-fulfillment\" if, in spite of a grace period, the buyer disposes of the privatized assets in a manner contrary to the agreement or for the grounds provided in the agreement:\n\n\"The agreement on sale of the capital or property shall be deemed terminated due to non-fulfillment, if the buyer, even within an additionally granted term for fulfillment:\n\n[...]\n\n3) disposes of the property of the subject of privatization contrary to provisions of the agreement;\n\n[...]\n\n7) in other cases provided for by the agreement.\"\n\n617.\n\nThis provision is of little assistance to the Respondent. Once the Agreement had ended, there was nothing left to be fulfilled, and hence no possible case of \"non-fulfillment.\" In addition, as the Agreement specified that the obligation not to encumber assets was limited to the term of the Agreement, which had expired, no disposition of property could be contrary to the Agreement. Having thus concluded, the Tribunal need not examine the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Agreement could only be terminated as stipulated in Article 7 thereof and not Article 41(a)(3) of the Privatization Law. Indeed, even if Article 7 did not exclude Article 41(a)(3), the latter provision would not apply in this case.\n\n618.\n\nAssuming that a contract that has ended could be terminated, Serbia would also be wrong in relying on Article 41(a)(3) of the Privatization Law, because, pursuant to Article 131 of the Law on Obligations, an agreement cannot be terminated for \"non-performance of an insignificant part of an obligation.\"427 The Parties\u2019 Serbian law experts appear to agree that a contract cannot be terminated for failure to perform a minor part of an obligation that does not endanger the purpose of the contract.428 Here, the purpose of the privatization contract could not be endangered as it had already materialized. As was mentioned earlier, with the full payment of the price, the privatization was achieved.\n\nExh CE-462, Certain provisions of the Law on Obligations, Art. 131: \"[A]n agreement cannot be terminated due to non-performance of an insignificant part of the obligation.\"\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 ER II, \u00a796; Radovi\u0107 ER I, \u00a734. See also Exh. CE-714, B. Vizner, Komentar Zakona o obveznim (obligacionim) odnosima [in English: Commentary on the Law on Contracts and Torts] (1978, Zagreb), p. 3 (\"It follows that in cases of failure to fulfil a negligible part of an obligation, the court's assessment takes a two-pronged approach: a subjective assessment - in relation to safeguarding the objective, purpose of the concluded contract, and an objective assessment - in relation to obtaining the more significant benefit that is usually obtained, having in mind, in particular, the interrelation between the scope of the fulfilled and unfulfilled part of the contractual obligation.\").\n\n619.\n\nFinally, Serbia invokes decisions of the Privatization Agency which allegedly represent a \"well established practice\" according to which privatization agreements were regularly terminated even after the full payment of the purchase price. Be this as it may, these decisions do not relate to terminations after payment of the full purchase price based only on a violation of the limitation on pledging the privatized company's assets. Moreover, even if such decisions existed, they would hardly allow the Tribunal to ignore the outcome of its legal analysis.\n\n620.\n\nIn considering all the facts and circumstances that led to the (unlawful) termination of the Agreement and the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares, the Tribunal finds it incumbent to also consider the Agency's own conduct.429 Indeed, the record bears out that the Agency well knew that on payment of the full purchase price on 8 April 2011, it was bound to release the pledge. Had it done so, as it was contractually obligated to do, there would have been no restriction on Mr. Obradovi\u0107 pledging or otherwise transferring BD Agro's assets. The restriction on pledging BD Agro's assets contained in Article 5.3.4 no longer served any purpose. Rather than releasing the pledge over the Beneficially Owned Shares however, the Agency chose to retain it,430 to then terminate the Agreement for breach of Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement and eventually to seize the Beneficially Owned Shares. The Agency thus willfully breached the Agreement:\n\n\u2022 On 25 February 2011, the Agency confirmed that the obligations under Article 5.3.4 were in effect only until the full payment of the purchase price, which was in line with the Privatization Agreement,431 the Share Pledge Agreement,432 and the Agency's Rulebook;433\n\n\u2022 On 8 April 2011, the sixth instalment of the purchase price was paid.434 The Privatization Agency could arguably refuse the payment and, defer the expiry of the Privatization Agreement. It chose not to do so;\n\n\u2022 On 6 January 2012, the Privatization Agency confirmed that \"the buyer, as of April 8, 2011, has settled his obligations in respect of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th installment and thus paid the entire sale and purchase price.\"435 Thus, based on the Agency's own determinations above, the pledge should have been released on 8 April 2011;\n\n\u2022 On 30 May 2012, the Ministry of Economy determined that there was \"no economic justification\" for terminating the Agreement:\n\n\"We think that there is *no economic justification to terminate the agreement* of sale of socially owned capital of the subject of privatization, having in mind:\n\n- *That the buyer paid the entire amount of the sale and purchase price,*\n\n- That he used the funds received from disposal of the property to comply with the obligations of the subject of privatization towards the employees, state creditors and commercial banks, mostly through assignation payments, since his bank account was blocked,\n\n- That the stated disposal of the property did not threaten the continuity of business activities of this company,\n\n- As well as that the buyer of the capital achieved the highest possible level of organization of this type of primary agricultural production with the application of the latest methods in the field of primary production.\"436\n\n\u2022 In June 2012, BD Agro repaid the 2010 Loan that had caused the alleged breach;437\n\n\u2022 Despite these events, throughout 2012, the Agency continued to insist that the breach of Article 5.3.4 be rectified;438\n\n\u2022 On 11 June 2013, the Agency's lawyers, Radovi\u0107 Ratkovi\u0107 concluded that the Agreement could not be terminated for breach of Article 5.3.4, because \"all significant elements\" of the contract had been performed by the buyer,439 and that the \"control activities\" of the \"Agency after 8 April 2011 were irrelevant\" as the Agreement had ended by then.440\n\n\u2022 They also disagreed with the approach taken by the Agency that it could \"keep alive\" a pre-existing breach by sending new notices with additional time limits for performance:\n\n\"In our determination of the buyer's deadline for meeting the obligations stipulated by Articles 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 of the agreement, and having in mind the fact that the buyer fully paid the sale and purchase price, we took into consideration the opinion stated by the Center for Privatization [i.e. the Agency], but we cannot agree with that opinion. The interpretation of the Center 'that by setting of an additionally granted term for fulfillment, the agreement stays in force' cannot be applied to this specific legal situation. Namely, in a situation when the buyer fulfilled all obligations defined as significant elements of the agreement and when the agreement was fully performed, one cannot set an additionally granted term for fulfillment per which the agreement would stay in force. The Agency's action cannot 'keep in force' a legal matter that was completely fulfilled and executed.\"441\n\n\u2022 Despite these clear conclusions, the Agency repeatedly extended the time for compliance apparently in an effort to keep the Agreement alive;442\n\n\u2022 Importantly, the Agency's lawyers also come to the conclusion that, even though the Agreement could not be terminated for breach of Article 5.3.4, the Buyer had in any event, \"undoubtedly\" corrected all irregularities for which the Agency had sent notices:\n\n\"Regarding violation of the obligation of the buyer stipulated by Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement, even though such violation does not result in termination of the agreement, we state the following: Based on submitted auditor's reports, it may be undoubtedly concluded that the buyer of capital (even though he was not obliged to) acted in line with the notices of the Privatization Agency even after the full payment of the sale and purchase price, that is, after the end of control-related authorizations of the Agency. The buyer primarily corrected all the irregularities observed in the control process, the correction of which was requested by the Agency. In the last auditor's report, it is stated that all encumbrances (pledges) were deleted from the subject's movable property (fixed assets). The only remaining one was the pledge on the real estate registered in the land registry sheet 3229 at the Cadastral Municipality of Ugrinovci, as a security instrument for loan obligation of 'Crveni Signal a.d.' from Belgrade, for the amount of 65,000,000.00 dinars, as per the Loan Agreement K-181/10-00 dated June 2, 2010. However, in 2012, the subject of privatization and 'Crveni Signal' signed the agreement on restructuring (reprogramming) of the loan, in which the company 'Crveni Signal', being guarantor, obliged itself to pay due liabilities of 'BD AGRO a.d.', through payment of 20% of the sale and purchase price of two immovable, of the assessed market value several times higher than the liabilities of the subject of privatization. Thus, 'Crveni Signal' gave significantly higher security instrument than the subject of privatization itself. In addition, this disposal of the subject of privatization cannot be considered as disposal of high value assets, having in mind its share in the total value of the fixed assets of the subject.\"443\n\n\u2022 Here again, despite their own lawyer's opinion, the Agency insisted that Mr. Obradovic had breached his obligations under Article 5.3.4 of the Agreement;444\n\n\u2022 By 2013 therefore*, i.e.* two years after the payment of the Purchase Price and more than a year after the Ministry's conclusion that there was no economic reason to terminate the agreement and the opinion of the Agency's lawyers that there was no legal basis for termination, the Agency still insisted that the so-called breaches of the Agreement be rectified, failing which the Agreement would be terminated;445\n\n\u2022 On 23 December 2013, the Ministry of Economy initiated a \"procedure for supervision of the work of the Privatization Agency\";446\n\n\u2022 On 7 April 2015, the Ministry of Economy changed its position and instructed the Agency to grant Mr. Obradovi\u0107 90 days to act in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.447 This instruction was effectively a reversal of the position taken by the Ministry in May 2012 when it found that there was no economic justification for the termination. The reversal was all the more so surprising taking into account that in June 2012 BD Agro had repaid the 2010 Loan that was alleged to breach Article 5.3.4;\n\n\u2022 In a meeting held on 23 April 2015, members of the Agency's Commission of Control repeatedly recognized that the pledge should have been released on full payment of the purchase price. The recording of the meeting also evidences the Commission's concern that Mr. Obradovi\u0107 may freely dispose of the shares once the price was paid and the pledge lifted:\n\n\"Female voice 2: [...] This is the first and the second is now the relation between the agreement and the proposal of a decision regarding these. pledge against shares, because, *in accordance with the agreement, the pledge should be deleted, practically, when [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] pays the purchase price which [he] did pay.* On the other hand we have an uncertainty - what will [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] do with the entire property since [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] would then be free to dispose of [his] shares. In that case there is no necessity in providing this term or anything, because [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] will do as [he] wants.\n\n[...]\n\nJulijana Vu\u010dkovi\u0107: Well because ... So, *the agreement prescribes that the pledge is deleted once [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] pays the purchase price,* and not when [he] fulfils its obligations.\n\n[...]\n\nJulijana Vu\u010dkovi\u0107: [...] if the Agency was to render a decision on deletion of pledge against shares to [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] registered to his benefit, [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] would be free to dispose of them, which would be certain bearing in mind [Mr. Obradovi\u0107's] request for assignment of the agreement. If the disposal of shares is permitted, and *[Mr. Obradovi\u0107] is, I repeat, entitled to this in accordance with the agreement,* generally *the Agency would no longer be in a* contractual relation with someone and you would no longer *be able to take measures against the contracting party*, when the legal ground had generally ceased with it, and [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] would be free to dispose of its shares.\n\n[...]\n\nJulijana Vu\u010dkovi\u0107: That is right, [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] violated one of the provisions of the agreement; and the *release of the pledge* is not tied to the fulfilment of contractual obligations, rather *it is tied only to the payment of the purchase price,* which was clearly done carelessly in the agreement. Now, the new law rectifies this somewhat and it prescribes that the certificate on deletion of the pledge and fulfilment of contractual obligations is issued once all obligations are fulfilled, and not only payment of the price. And that is it and we are now between a rock and a hard place because on the one hand we have an obligation in accordance with the agreement, and on the other hand the consequences of this is clear to you.\"448\n\n\u2022 Members of the Commission also observed that, despite the understanding that the Agency was contractually bound to lift the pledge, they would not do so, thereby compelling Mr. Obradovi\u0107 into suing them:\n\n\"Sa\u0161a Novakovi\u0107: And the agreement on purchase of capital, it stated that *[Mr. Obradovi\u0107] can dispose of the shares,* right? Freely?\n\nFemale voice 2: That it can *once it had paid the purchase price. Which it did.* But if we were to decide like this, at least in my opinion, I would not be inclined to; although I have a problem with the provision of the agreement such as it is, *if we were now to release this pledge [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] would be free to dispose of the shares freely,* but then it is a problem, so *I would rather advocate that we postpone deletion of pledge* until execution, that is until expiry of this deadline until which [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] had not fulfilled [his] contractual obligations we have ordered [him] to fulfil, that is, that is not us, but the minister ordered it. And we will confirm such decision [laugh].\n\n[...]\n\nSa\u0161a Novakovi\u0107: All right then, *we can decide not to give [the pledge release] to [Mr. Obradovi\u0107] and then we are forcing him* [...] *into suing us.* This is.may the court rule.\"449\n\n\u2022 At a subsequent meeting on 19 June 2015, the Commission discussed a request received from Mr. Obradovi\u0107's attorney to release the pledge. It stated that it has debated this issue previously, and expressed relief that it would not have to decide the issue as the attorney had not provided a valid power-of-attorney:\n\n\"Julijana Vu\u010dkovi\u0107: [...] I also have to mention that we received, on Wednesday, *a new request from [Mr. Obradovi\u0107\u2019s] attorney in which he requests from the Agency, in accordance with its contractual obligations, to issue a confirmation of release of pledge* against shares, because [he] completed the payment of the purchase price.\n\nLet me remind you, we have discussed on this request the previous time we gave that additional deadline, when it was said that, practically, *if we give this confirmation to release the pledge from shares, he will have absolute freedom to further sell its shares, whereby it did not fulfil obligations and we cannot request fulfilment of these obligations.* So we stated and rendered decision that we will decide on this issue after rendering the final decision on fulfilment of these obligations. *Fortunately, the attorney did not submit a valid power of attorney, so we will reply that we do not know who authorized him,* and so forth. I am hoping that by that time we will have an idea of what the buyer fulfilled and what it did not.\"450\n\n\u2022 The recordings of the 23 April 2015 and of the 19 June 2015 meetings show that the Agency's Commission for Control deliberately chose not to release the pledge on the BD Agro shares despite knowing that were obligated to do so.\n\n\u2022 On 28 September 2015, four years after the last instalment of the purchase price had been paid, and several years after the Agency's own determination that the pledge should have been released on full payment of the purchase price, the Agency's Commission for Control decided to terminate the Agreement based on an alleged violation of Article 5.3.4 alone,451 which was done on that date and was followed by the seizure of the shares.452\n\nSee, for instance, *Eco Oro,* where the tribunal in assessing whether there had been a breach of Article 805 (similar to Article 6 of the Canada-Serbia BIT) observed that it was \"necessary\" to consider all the facts and circumstances (*Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum (9 September 2021), \u00a7761). See also, Exh. RLA-118, *Gold Reserve Inc. v.

Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, \u00a7459.\n\nThe pledge over the Beneficially Owned Shares, could not cease to exist automatically. Under Serbian law, a confirmation issued by the Privatization Agency was required in order for the pledge to be deleted. See Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ER I, \u00a7130.\n\nExh.

After the payment of the sale and purchase price, socially owned capital of the subject of privatization was finally privatized and thus all contractual and legal control authorities of the Privatization Agency ended, regardless of the fact that after fulfillment of the agreement, the Agency was sending notices to the buyer about possible termination of the agreement, while setting additionally granted terms for fulfillment. We specifically emphasize this since the notices of the Agency referred to fulfillment of the buyer's obligation that could not be used as the basis for the termination of the agreement. The Agency is authorized to control fulfillment of contractual obligations until the date of execution of the contractual obligation with the longest deadline stipulated. In accordance with this, we believe that control activities taken by the Agency after April 8, 2011 were irrelevant, since it is impossible to terminate a completely fulfilled agreement.\").\n\nExh.

Expropriation of the Beneficially Owned Shares***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n624.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Serbia's termination of the Privatization Agreement and the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares are a \"textbook\" case of direct expropriation as they deprived the Claimants of both the legal title and the economic enjoyment of the shares,453 which the Respondent disputes on multiple counts. Even if the Tribunal were to sustain these claims, no additional damages would be payable to the Claimants in addition to those due for the breach of FET, which resulted in the investors being fully deprived of their investment. Therefore, for reasons of judicial economy, the Tribunal will dispense with addressing this claim.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7164 et seq.\n\n**D. General Exception**\n------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n625.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the General Exception under Article 18(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT is inapplicable in the present case.454 Serbia has simply failed to prove its position that the Agency's conduct was either \"designed\" or \"necessary\" to secure compliance with Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization.455 On the contrary, it is clear that the Agency's conduct was unlawful under Serbian law and unjustified.456\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71050-1063.\n\nReply, \u00a71055, referring to Exh. CLA-113, *Korea - Various Measures on Beef* (WTO Appellate Body Report), \u00a7157.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71056-1059.\n\n626.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimants argue that the Agency's conduct was a \"disguised restriction\" on the Claimants' investment.457 The reasons given for the Agency's conduct were only \"pretext\" and \"plainly not genuine.\"458\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71060-1062.\n\nReply, \u00a71062.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n627.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal concludes that the Agency's conduct was not commercial and can be attributed to the Respondent, the Respondent invokes the General Exception under Article 18(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.459 In particular, Serbia insists that the termination of the Agreement, the refusal to release the pledge over the shares, and the refusal to consent to the assignment of the Agreement were measures necessary to ensure compliance with Serbian law, i.e. Article 41a(1)(3) of the Law on Privatization, thereby falling within the ambit of Article 18(1)(a)(ii) of the Treaty.460\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7\u00a7624-630; Rej., \u00a7\u00a71155-1166.\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7627.\n\n628.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimants' position that the measures in question, in order to qualify for the General Exception, must be \"designed\" and \"necessary\" to ensure compliance with domestic law. According to Serbia, all that is needed is that the measures be \"capable\" of achieving the relevant goal, which they clearly were in this case.461\n\nRej., \u00a71158, referring, in particular, to Exh. RLA-143, *Indonesia -Measures Concerning the Importation of Chicken Meat and Chicken Products* (WTO Panel Report), \u00a77.248.\n\n629.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Agency's conduct represented a \"disguised restriction\" on the Claimants\u2019 investment.462 As already explained, the Agency\u2019s actions were in accordance with the Privatization Agreement and Serbian law.\n\nRej., \u00a71155.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n630.\n\nArticle 18(1) of the Serbia-Canada BIT provides:\n\n\"1. For the purpose of this Agreement:\n\n(a) a Party may adopt or enforce a measure necessary:\n\n(i) to protect human, animal or plant life or health,\n\n(ii) to ensure compliance with domestic law that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, or\n\n(i) applied in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors, or\n\n(ii) a disguised restriction on international trade or investment.\"\n\n631.\n\nFor Article 18(1) to apply in this case, Serbia must establish that the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares was \"necessary\" to comply with Article 41(a)(3) of the Privatization Law. It has failed to do so. Quite to the contrary, as observed above, the seizure of the Shares was contrary to the terms of the Privatization Agreement and Serbian law. In the circumstances, Serbia cannot rely on Article 18(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT to excuse its conduct.\n\n**E. Conclusion on Liability**\n------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal concludes that Serbia breached Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Tribunal having held that Serbia breached Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT, turns to examining the damages payable for this breach.\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Causation**\n----------------\n\n634.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, but for Serbia's unlawful conduct, \"BD Agro would have implemented the [...] reorganization plan and continued its operations [...]\" and that \"Serbia destroyed the agreement between BD Agro and its creditors and caused a collapse of the company.\"463 The Claimants also state that the loss of Mr. Rand's financial support was key to the collapse.464\n\nReply, \u00a71291.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71292-1293.\n\n635.\n\nThe Claimants reject Serbia's allegations that BD Agro's bankruptcy was caused by Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107's failure to comply with the decision of the Commercial Court ordering BD Agro to make certain amendments to the amended pre-pack reorganization plan. They contend that Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 was under an obligation to seek the approval of the Privatization Agency before submitting a new version of the pre-pack reorganization plan, and that such approval was not forthcoming. They further argue that the amended pre-pack reorganization plan envisaged additional financing from Mr. Rand, who was no longer willing to provide such financing. Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 therefore could not submit a new version of the pre-pack reorganization plan without obtaining information from the Privatization Agency as to how it intended to replace the funds that were to be provided by Mr. Rand.\n\n**2. Methodology**\n------------------\n\n***a. Dr. Hern\u2019s valuation***\n-----------------------------\n\n636.\n\nThe Claimants claim full reparation for Serbia's breaches of the Canada-Serbia BIT, i.e. Mr. Rand's share of the fair market value of BD Agro at the time of the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares on 21 October 2015 plus interest.465\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71296-1297.\n\n637.\n\nFor determining the fair market value of BD Agro on 21 October 2015, the Claimants rely on the Expert Report of Dr. Hern. Dr. Hern divides BD Agro's assets into two categories: (i) core assets required for BD Agro's dairy production business, such as agricultural land, farm buildings, equipment, herd and other current assets; and (ii) non-core assets, such as BD Agro's commercial and industrial land in Dobanovci. To value (i), he uses a combination of the Discount Cash Flow (\"DCF\") and Ajusted Book Value methods466 and to value (ii), he only uses the second method,467 adjusting the value of BD Agro's assets reported in its 2015 financial statements to their fair market value based on contemporaneous market evidence. Dr. Hern's valuation of core and non-core assets of BD Agro's amounts to EUR 121.2 million (pre-tax). Subtracting liabilities, the total equity value of BD Agro as of 21 October 2015 was EUR 78.2 million.\n\nSee, for instance, Opening Presentation of of the Claimants\u2019 expert, Dr. Hern, p.10 (\"I value the farm at [...] using discounted cash-flow (DCF) methodology. I also use an Adjusted Book Value approach.\").\n\nSee, for instance, Opening Presentation of the Claimants\u2019 expert, Dr. Hern, p.7 (\"I value Construction Land in Zone A, B and C using Adjusted Book Valuation method i.e. adjusting the book value of assets to their fair market value based on market evidence.\").\n\n638.\n\nTo calculate the value of Mr. Rand's individual interest in BD Agro's equity, the Claimants use the upper bound valuations provided by Dr. Hern, resulting in an equity value of EUR 81 million at the valuation date. For the Claimants, Mr. Rand's interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares is indirect, deriving from his shareholding in Sembi. Therefore, Mr. Rand's share in the value of the Beneficially Owned Shares is equal to his share in the value of Sembi. Together with interest to 27 September 2021 at the Serbian default interest rate, the value of Mr. Rand's indirect interest in BD Agro's equity (post-tax) equals to EUR 87.5 million.468\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00a7353(f).\n\n639.\n\nIn the course of his analysis, Dr. Hern divides BD Agro's land, *i.e.* its non-core assets into three categories: (i) Construction Land in Zones A, B and C in Dobanovci (the \"Construction Land\"); (ii) additional construction land in Dobanovci and Be\u010dmen (the \"Other Construction Land\"); and (iii) agricultural land in A\u0161anja, De\u010d, Ugrinovci and Dobanovci (the \"Agricultural Land\").\n\n640.\n\nThe Claimants stress that Dr. Hern's valuations of BD Agro's land resonate with the three contemporaneous valuations carried out between December 2014 and February 2016, according to which BD Agro was valued between EUR 56 million and EUR 71 million:469\n\ni. *The Mrgud Valuation of December 2014:* Mr. Mrgud's valuation of BD Agro as of 1 August 2014 was submitted to the Belgrade Commercial Court with the amended pre-pack reorganization plan on 6 March 2015 (\"Mrgud Valuation\").470 It appraises the value of the Construction Land. Taking the value of land calculated by Mr. Mrgud, the equity value of BD Agro, say the Claimants, was more than EUR 71 million. The Mrgud Valuation also finds support in the report of the Claimants\u2019 real estate valuation expert, Mr. Krzysztof Grzesik, who independently reviewed evidence from (i) comparable transactions; (ii) contemporaneous valuations by other valuators; (iii) contemporaneous valuations of tax authorities; and (iv) valuations prepared by Dr. Hern and Mr. Cowan, to value BD Agro\u2019s commercial and industrial land;\n\nii. *The First Confineks Valuation of 5 December 2015:* This valuation of BD Agro on 31 December 2014 (the \"First Confineks Valuation\")471 was prepared at the behest of the Privatization Agency\u2019s representative Ms. Radmila Kne\u017eevi\u0107, who was responsible for administering BD Agro after the seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares. BD Agro\u2019s fair market value, according to this valuation, calculated as the total value of its assets less the total value of its liabilities as of 31 December 2014, was EUR 57.2 million;\n\niii. *The Second Confineks Valuation of 4 February 2016:* Confineks was asked to update the First Confineks Valuation as of 31 December 2015. It did so on 4 February 2016 (the \"Second Confineks Valuation\"). According to this valuation, BD Agro\u2019s fair market value, calculated as the total value of its assets less the total value of its liabilities as of 31 December 2015, was EUR 56.3 million.472\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71298 and 1300.\n\nExh.

CE-172, Report on the valuation of assets, liabilities and capital of BD Agro Dobanovci, January 2016\n\n641.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the First and Second Confineks Valuations were accepted by Serbia because their preparation was directed by the Privatization Agency and they were used to draw up BD Agro\u2019s financial statements for 2015 and the following years. In addition, Ms. Kne\u017eevi\u0107, who administered BD Agro for the Agency after the seizure, expressly relied on the Second Confineks Valuation in her letter to the Ministry of Economy of 17 February 2016, showing that the Agency agreed with that valuation. Finally, when BD Agro submitted its 2016 pre-pack reorganization plan under the control of the Privatization Agency, the Agency once again relied on the First Confineks Valuation to value BD Agro's \"assets, liabilities and capital.\"\n\n642.\n\nThe Claimants recognize that there were other contemporaneous valuations of BD Agro, but none of them were endorsed by the Agency as was just described. For the Claimants, the valuation prepared by Jones Lang LaSalle d.o.o. (\"JLL\") in February 2015 (the \"JLL Valuation\") on which Serbia relies is \"fundamentally flawed.\" For instance, that valuation uses a price for BD Agro's land of 2 EUR/m2 for the construction land in Zone A and 1.5 EUR/m2 for the construction land in Zones B and C, which figures include a 50% discount. However, say the Claimants, there is no \"evidence from contemporaneous transactions that would justify a valuation of BD Agro's construction land as low as that presented in the [JLL Valuation].\"473 Mr. Grzesik also concludes that the JLL Valuation does not provide any proof for either its base price or the arbitrary 50% discount it applies to it.474 The JLL Valuation arrives at the lowest value of BD Agro's land amongst all the contemporaneous reports mentioned by Serbia.\n\nHern ER II, \u00a7103.\n\nGrzesik ER, \u00a7\u00a713.5-13.6.\n\n***b. Critique of Mr. Cowan\u2019s Valuations***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n643.\n\nDr. Hern criticizes the different valuation approaches taken by Serbia's expert Mr. Cowan on the following counts:475\n\ni. Mr. Cowan's \"maximum valuation\" is flawed because it applies downward adjustments to the value of assets mentioned in the Second Confineks Report to reflect a distressed sale of assets in his \"bankruptcy scenario.\" This approach is entirely inappropriate as fair market value, by definition, excludes a distressed sale. Further, as of the expropriation date, BD Agro was a going concern and not a bankrupt company. In any event, say the Claimants, \"the [bankruptcy] sale of BD Agro was conducted in a non- transparent and flawed manner that in no way could have led to BD Agro being sold for its true market value\";476\n\nii. Mr. Cowan's \"alternative\" valuations do not reflect the fair market value of BD Agro's equity either.477 Mr. Cowan's valuation of BD Agro based on the JLL Valuation must be dismissed as it does not refer to any relevant evidence to support its conclusions on the value of BD Agro. The stock market valuation, another alternative used by Mr. Cowan, deserves to be dismissed as well as the Serbian stock market is highly illiquid and any share trading information has to be treated with caution. Moreover, the share price to which Mr. Cowan refers from the 2015 accounts relates to the last trade of BD Agro's stock which occurred in 2012. It does not, therefore, accurately reflect the situation of the business on the date of expropriation.478\n\nHern ER II, \u00a7\u00a7166, 170-203.\n\nReply, \u00a71389.\n\nHern ER II, \u00a7205.\n\nHern ER II, \u00a7\u00a7207-219.\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimants and Dr. Hern also dispute the new valuations advanced by Mr. Cowan in Serbia's Rejoinder, not only because they disagree with the land valuations on which they are based, but also because Mr. Cowan improperly lowers BD Agro's valuation.\n\n**3. Size of the Construction Land**\n------------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimants assert that BD Agro's most valuable asset was its land. In her first report, the Respondent's real estate expert Ms. Ili\u0107 stated that the size of the Construction Land was 279 hectares, with which Dr. Hern agrees. However, on instruction, she reduced this surface to 169 hectares in her second report. For the Claimants, this reduction cannot be sustained for several reasons:\n\ni. The biggest part of the land area that was excluded represents land that was subject to a court dispute with [ZZ] Buducnost Dobanovci. The claim in that dispute was filed almost three years after the valuation date and it was rejected by the court on 21 December 2018. Therefore, this land should be considered in the valuation, which is further supported by the fact that, while excluded in the first bankruptcy sale, the bankruptcy trustee later included this land in the second sale that took place on 27 January 2021;\n\nii. No land should be excluded from BD Agro's valuation based on the court dispute between BD Agro and Serbia related to the land swapped between Serbia's Ministry of Agriculture and BD Agro pursuant to the \"Agreement on exchange of land between the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and BD Agro\" of 4 January 2010 (the \"Land Swap Agreement\").479 Court proceedings related to the land swap agreement are still pending;\n\niii. No land should be excluded from BD Agro's valuation based on the court dispute which Inter Kop Sabac initiated on 31 January 2018 in respect of the \"Real Estate Purchase Agreement\" of 30 April 2010 between the two entities (the \"Real Estate Agreement\").480 Like the dispute initiated by [ZZ] Buducnost Dobanovci, this dispute too commenced several years after the valuation date. Further, the Real Estate Agreement provided that the land would be paid by way of services that Inter Kop Sabac was to provide to BD Agro.481 The company did not provide any such services. It thus did not acquire any rights to BD Agro's land. This conclusion, say the Claimants, is confirmed by the fact that Inter Kop Sabac never registered its alleged ownership over the disputed land. In fact, it even voted in favor of the pre-pack reorganization plan that includes the disputed land as an asset of BD Agro;\n\niv. Land sold to Eko Elektrofrigo pursuant to the \"Real Estate Purchase Agreement\" of 27 October 2008 and its Annex of 10 April 2010 should not be excluded as doing so would effectively amount to double-counting. Indeed, Dr. Hern already excluded this land from the calculation of BD Agro's Construction Land, and there is no reason to exclude it again;\n\nv. No land should be excluded from BD Agro's valuation based on alleged restitution claims made in respect of certain land plots in Novi Be\u010dej, as the Serbian Restitution Agency expressly confirmed that no restitution was claimed with respect to BD Agro's land. In any event, even if there were any such claims, they could not lead to a restitution of BD Agro's land because, being a private entity, it was not obliged to restitute property;\n\nvi. No land should be excluded from BD Agro's valuation based on the \"Purchase Agreement between BD Agro DB Dobanovci and Hypo Park Dobanovci\" of 11 June 2008 (the \"Hypo Park Agreement\"). BD Agro owned the excluded land on the valuation date, which is confirmed by Ms. Ili\u0107's calculation of the total area of BD Agro's land contained in her first report;\n\nvii. Serbia has not furnished any good reasons for excluding other land parcels.\n\nExh. RE-396, Agreement on exchange of land between the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and BD Agro, 4 January 2010.\n\nExh. RE-589, Real Estate Purchase Agreement between BD Agro and Inter kop Sabac, 30 April 2010.\n\nExh. RE-589, Real Estate Purchase Agreement between BD Agro and Inter kop Sabac, 30 April 2010, Art. 3.\n\n646.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that Serbia's position is entirely based on the valuation report prepared by Mr. Bodolo in January 2019 for the purposes of the bankruptcy sale of BD Agro and a \"List of BD Agro's land which was not sold.\" Neither of these documents refer to any evidence showing that the excluded land was not owned by BD Agro or that its legal status was at that time controversial, let alone on the valuation date.\n\n**4. Price per m2**\n-------------------\n\n647.\n\nDr. Hern values the three categories of BD Agro's land using the following evidence:\n\ni. Construction Land: Dr. Hern analyzes (i) comparable transactions; (ii) property tax information; (iii) the First and Second Confineks Valuation; (iv) the Mrgud Valuation; and (v) other contemporaneous valuation reports.482 On this basis, Dr. Hern values the Construction Land between EUR 62.9 million and EUR 82.9 million;\n\nii. The Other Construction Land: Dr. Hern reviews evidence from comparable transactions and the First and Second Confineks Valuations, and estimates the value of this land between EUR 1.1 million and EUR 3.4 million;483\n\niii. The Agricultural Land: Dr. Hern again relies on data from comparable transactions and the First and Second Confineks Valuations. Using these inputs, he values the Agricultural Land between EUR 4 million and 15.5 million.484\n\nHern ER I, \u00a7\u00a762-87.\n\nHern ER I, \u00a7\u00a7102-103.\n\nHern ER I, \u00a7109.\n\n648.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 real estate expert Mr. Grzesik largely concurs with Dr. Hern's analysis. For the Construction Land, he arrives at the total value of EUR 85.3 million, slightly higher than the EUR 82.9 million upper range figure calculated by Dr. Hern. For the Other Construction Land, his figure is EUR 3.6 million, and for the Agricultural Land his estimate is EUR 10 million.\n\n649.\n\nDr. Hern rejects Mr. Cowan\u2019s criticism that BD Agro \"encountered difficulties when it tried to sell the land in the past.\" He points out that Mr. Cowan refers to a single example of an alleged sale of land below market value, *i.e.* the 2012 sale of agricultural land in Novi Be\u010dej. However, evidence shows that BD Agro made a profit on the sale.485 Further, the conversion rate applied by Mr. Cowan is incorrect.486 Dr. Hern equally rejects Ms. Ili\u0107's criticism of his report. All of the evidence on which he relies is consistent with the broad principles underpinning the valuation standards, which Ms. Ili\u0107 also uses.487\n\nHern ER II, \u00a7119.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a71369 et seq.\n\nHern ER III, \u00a7\u00a731 et seq.\n\n650.\n\nDr. Hern also disagrees with Serbia and Mr. Cowan\u2019s dismissal of the comparable land transactions in Batajnica, according to which in 2013 and 2016 Serbia expropriated that land for EUR 27/m2 (in 2013) and EUR 28/m2 to 37 (in 2016). The Batajnica land plots are comparable to land plots in the Construction Land because they \"are a similar distance from Belgrade and the Belgrade airport; are close to a railway; have a similar intended use; have a similar development potential; and have not been developed yet and are still used as arable land.\"488\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00a7297.\n\n**5. 30% Discount**\n-------------------\n\n651.\n\nDr. Hern also rejects Serbia and Ms. Ili\u0107's approach in making downward adjustments for the differences in size between the comparable transactions used by Ms. Ili\u0107 and BD Agro's land, as such discounts would contravene the purpose of determining fair market value. According to him, if a higher value can be extracted by selling a large land plot in a number of smaller pieces, that value should be reflected in the fair market valuation. There is no basis to apply a size discount, given that the land does not need to be sold as a whole.489 The Claimants also dismiss the other differences between Ms. Ili\u0107's comparable transactions and BD Agro's land to justify the 30% discount that she applies.\n\nHern ER III, \u00a7\u00a740 et seq.\n\n**6. Bankruptcy sale discount**\n-------------------------------\n\n652.\n\nIn Dr. Hern's opinion, Mr. Cowan is wrong in applying a 50% bankruptcy sale discount. BD Agro was not in bankruptcy on the valuation date of 21 October 2015. It was a going concern, and had initiated reorganization proceedings, which culminated in the submission and approval of the \"credible and feasible\" amended pre-pack reorganization plan. In addition, such a discount would be contrary to the definition of fair market value applicable in public international law.\n\n**7. Liabilities**\n------------------\n\n653.\n\nDr. Hern disagrees with Mr. Cowan's deduction of certain liabilities in BD Agro's valuation. First, Mr. Cowan overstates the BD Agro's liabilities. Second, he applies an unjustified conversion fee. Third, he deducts EUR 200,000 for pending court proceedings, without giving any reason. Fourth, he overstates the applicable capital gains tax as he did not make necessary deductions. In fact, Mr. Cowan admits that he had not calculated this tax correctly. Fifth, Mr. Cowan wrongly includes redundancy payments in BD Agro's liabilities. These should not be included as they represent a voluntary program adopted and financed by Serbia and thus have no place in a fair market valuation of BD Agro. Finally, Mr. Cowan inflates the bankruptcy costs by a significant margin of 1,400%.\n\n**8. Distress discount**\n------------------------\n\n654.\n\nDr. Hern also opines that Mr. Cowan is wrong in applying a 30% distress discount. As already mentioned, on the valuation date, BD Agro was a going concern and such a discount is contrary to the definition of fair market.\n\n**9. Interest**\n---------------\n\n655.\n\nThe Claimants argue that pursuant to the preservation of rights clauses in Article 10 of the Serbia-Cyprus BIT and Article 13(1) of the Qatar-Serbia BIT, which the Canadian Claimants invoke under the most favored nation clause in Article 5 of the Canada-Serbia BIT, the more favorable provisions of Serbian law prevail over the Treaties. The Claimants can thus claim the most favorable statutory interest rate under Serbian law, which is \"an annual rate [...] equal [to] the key interest rate of the European Central Bank for main refinancing operations plus eight percentage points.\" They thus claim interest at 6-month average EURIBOR + 2%, compounded semi-annually.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Causation**\n----------------\n\n656.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimants are seeking damages on the basis that the termination of the Privatization Agreement and the transfer of the Beneficially Owned Shares to the Agency were expropriatory. The Claimants have not stated that they suffered damage due to Serbia's other alleged violations of the BITs.\n\n657.\n\nSerbia also notes that the Claimants have not expressly alleged that the damages they claim were caused by the termination. Instead, they connect their damages claim with the bankruptcy of BD Agro,490 arguing that their shareholding lost all value due to the termination of the Privatization Agreement and seizure of BD Agro's shares which prevented the realization of the amended pre-pack reorganization plan and forced BD Agro into bankruptcy. However, the termination of the Privatization Agreement and transfer of the shares did not prevent the adoption of the pre-pack plan or the eventual bankruptcy of BD Agro. Indeed, the bankruptcy was caused by \"long-term continuous insolvency of BD Agro\" and Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107's failures to follow court orders, which led to the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings. In any event, the Claimants have failed to sufficiently establish that the reorganization plan would have worked.491\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a71418 and 1421.\n\nRej., \u00a71422.\n\n**2. Methodology**\n------------------\n\n***a. Mr. Cowan\u2019s Valuation***\n------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nSerbia relies on the reports of its expert Mr. Cowan to value BD Agro and to challenge Dr. Hern's valuation. Mr. Cowan values BD Agro adopting different approaches:\n\ni. An asset based approach based on the Second Confineks Valuation, to which he applies certain discounts and adjusts the book values to reflect the bankruptcy scenario. He estimates a \"maximum\" value of EUR 4.4 million. Since the Claimants had 79.77% shareholding in BD Agro, this means that the maximum value of their claim would be EUR 3.5 million plus pre-award interest;\n\nii. A valuation based on the value of BD Agro's land, taking into account the JLL valuation. The latter was prepared for the purposes of obtaining a bank loan, \"which implies it reflects the value that the bank could realistically extract from the land if it had to repossess and sell the business, *i.e.* if the business was in a bankruptcy situation.\"492 JLL valued the land at EUR 4.7 million. On the basis of JLL Valuation, BD Agro's value would be EUR nil, since the liabilities would significantly exceed the assets;\n\niii. An alternative valuation based on stock market data amounting to EUR 4.4 million;\n\niv. An alternative valuation based on the auction of BD Agro's assets in the bankruptcy proceedings, which yields a value of zero.\n\nCowan ER I, \u00a78.23.\n\n659.\n\nIn light of Serbia's later determination that over 40% of BD Agro's land was either not owned by it or that its ownership was in dispute and should, therefore, be excluded from the valuation, Mr. Cowan was asked to prepare further alternative valuations, taking into account the expert report of Serbia's real estate expert, Ms. Ili\u0107, as well as the report of Mr. Badolo prepared in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, Mr. Cowan provided the following alternative valuations:\n\ni. A valuation based on the value of all BD Agro's land under the bankruptcy scenario, applying a bankruptcy sales discount of 50% \"to represent the impact on value of undertaking a sales process of a distressed business\" and including bankruptcy costs at 20% of BD Agro's discounted asset value. On this basis, Mr. Cowan values BD Agro at nil;\n\nii. A valuation based on the value of some of BD Agro's land, taking into account the findings of the reports of Mr. Badolo and Ms. Ili\u0107 concerning the ownership over BD Agro's land and accounting thus for only 164 ha, under the bankruptcy scenario, which leads Mr. Cowan to a nil value;\n\niii. A valuation based on the value of all BD Agro's land, under the going concern scenario, applying an asset-based method, making a provisions for pending court proceedings, and applying a 30% distress discount. On this basis, Mr. Cowan values BD Agro at EUR 13.8 million;\n\niv. Two valuations based on the value of some of BD Agro's land taking into account the findings in the reports of Mr. Badolo and Ms. Ili\u0107 concerning the ownership over the land, and accounting thus for 164 hectares of land. In the bankruptcy scenario this results in BD Agro's valuation being nil and, in the going concern scenario, EUR 100,000.493\n\nRej. \u00a71471 citing Cowan ER II, \u00a72.8.\n\n660.\n\nThe Respondent clarifies that \"although these alternative calculations have been prepared for the benefit of the Tribunal, its position is that only a bankruptcy scenario taking into account the valuation of undisputed part of BD Agro's land is the proper basis for establishing the fair market value of the company.\"494\n\nRej., \u00a71416.\n\n***b. Critique of Dr. Hern\u2019s valuation***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nMr. Cowan identifies the following main flaws in Dr. Hern's approach:\n\ni. *Valuing BD Agro as a going concern:* Dr. Hern is wrong in valuing BD Agro as a going concern. Even if the Agency recognized that BD Agro was a going concern in 2015, what is relevant is whether BD Agro was a going concern on an objective basis. Objectively, BD Agro was not a going concern. Indeed, BD Agro had submitted the pre-pack reorganization plan as far back as November 2014. At the beginning of 2015, Banca Intesa requested opening of bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, it was clear that BD Agro was unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future. Moreover, BD Agro's auditor's report for 2013 emphasized that the company would not be able to continue operating as a going concern unless it obtained additional operating capital, which had not happened. Further, BD Agro's bank accounts were blocked since 8 March 2013 and remained so until the valuation date;\n\nii. *Applying the DCF method:* Dr. Hern valued BD Agro based on the Claimants' plans for the future of the business, not as the business stood on 21 October 2015. He ignored the business' past performance. His cash flow projections are thus unrealistic. On the valuation date, BD Agro was not turning a profit. Neither was it earning any net positive cash flows. Therefore, BD Agro should have been valued on an asset basis;\n\niii. *Using an incorrect basis for the DCF calculation:* Dr. Hern's DCF projection is based on a business plan that was similar to two previous plans (providing for an increase of cows and volume of milk produced) which did not succeed when implemented and turned out not to be profitable. Dr. Hern has not explained why the plan would be successful the third time;\n\niv. *Applying an incorrect discount rate*: Dr. Hern used an unreasonable discount rate that does not take into account the risk of investing in a small business in financial difficulty, with the result that he inflated BD Agro's value.\n\n662.\n\nSerbia submits that there were eight valuations of BD Agro's assets or land in the period between November 2014 and March 2017, which varied considerably. For example, the value of the Construction Land varied between EUR 4.7 million and EUR 87.1 million. The Claimants and Dr. Hern have relied on the highest value valuation reports and in particular have not mentioned the JLL Valuation that valued the Construction Land in February 2015 at the request of Banca Intesa at EUR 4.7 million. By contrast, the valuation prepared by Mr. Mrgud, used by the Claimants, assessed the value of this land at EUR 87.1 million on 31 August 2014.\n\n663.\n\nSerbia denies that it is \"estopped\" from contesting the First and Second Confineks Valuations as the Claimants suggest. The Privatization Agency is a separate legal entity from Respondent; its conduct cannot bind Serbia. Moreover, it would be absurd to consider a party bound by a third party's valuation merely because it commissioned the valuation. Further, for the Respondent, the alleged acceptance of a financial report at a shareholders' meeting cannot be viewed as an acceptance of all documents on which that financial report was based.\n\n**3. Size of the Construction Land**\n------------------------------------\n\n664.\n\nSerbia contends that, in his valuation, Dr. Hern has included land that should be excluded due to \"contentious ownership\":\n\ni. Although the land claim made by ZZ Buducnost Dobanovci was denied, it was not decided on its merits. Nothing prevents the company from bringing a new claim to establish its ownership rights;\n\nii. The Land Swap Agreement was found null and void by the Commercial Court in Belgrade on 14 September 2017. This decision was final. As a result, says Serbia \"BD Agro will almost certainly have to return the land it received from Serbia in the exchange to the land that it did not own and will not receive compensation in return.\"495 This land should thus not be considered for valuation purposes;\n\niii. In connection with the land claimed by Inter Kop Sabac, Serbia points out that the Real Estate Agreement was concluded before the valuation date, which \"represents sufficient ground for this land to be excluded from BD Agro's valuation.\"496 It also notes that Inter Kop Sabac and BD Agro signed a \"Declaration on set-off and an \"open item statement\" in respect of the former's services to BD Agro in exchange for the latter's land. Finally, even though Inter Kop did not register the disputed land in its name, it did continuously pay the related property taxes;\n\niv. Certain land plots in Novi Be\u010dej should be excluded because there was a possibility that restitution claims could be made in respect of those plots. Mr. Rand did not raise this issue in BD Agro's bankruptcy proceedings;\n\nv. Land sold to Hypo Park must be excluded as the Hypo Park Agreement predates the valuation date;\n\nvi. There are good reasons for the exclusion of other land parcels, including \"the land distributed to the employees of BD Agro prior to the privatization, land labeled as public roads and the land expropriated in 1991\"497 as well as \"the land conceded to the Municipality of Zemun and sold to Galenika.\"498.\n\nR-Submission on Quantum, \u00a732.\n\nR-Submission on Quantum, \u00a736.\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00a798.\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00a798.\n\n**4. Price per m2**\n-------------------\n\n665.\n\nSerbia notes that the \"major element\" in the Claimants' valuation is the value of the Construction Land, which Dr. Hern assumes could be sold at high prices. This assumption is unfounded:\n\ni. The actual sales of BD Agro's land were for amounts much lower than the land's estimated value. For example, in one transaction in 2012, land in Novi Becej was sold at 55% of its estimated value, *i.e.* at EUR 7.4 million out of an estimated EUR 13.5 million;\n\nii. Dr. Hern assumes too low a fee to convert of agricultural land to Construction Land. While he assumes a fee of 50% of the value of agricultural land, in fact the fee could be as high as 20% of the market value for Construction Land. This alone could increase the conversion fee to between EUR 7.7 million to EUR 10.6 million, in contrast to Dr. Hern's estimate of EUR 1.2 million to EUR 3.8 million. In addition, the conversion could take years.\n\n666.\n\nSerbia insists that the Batajnica transactions on which the Claimants rely are not an appropriate comparator. First, there is no evidence that those transactions were actual expropriations. Similarly, there is no evidence of the dates of the transactions or where a date is mentioned, it is in 2016, *i.e.* after the valuation date, rendering those valuations irrelevant. Further, the assessments on which the Claimants rely are based on recent decisions of the tax authorities, which do not reflect a market valuation according to international standards. Still further, the Batajnica land and the Construction Land are not comparable. For instance, the former is close to a railway while the latter is not, the former has direct access to roads while the latter does not. The Batajnica land was intended for development of a major infrastructure project supported by the EU while the Construction Land was to be developed for commercial purposes as a private initiative.\n\n**5. 30% Discount**\n-------------------\n\n667.\n\nSerbia contends that Ms. Ili\u0107 correctly applies a 30% discount to her estimated price of the Construction Land based on her experience with the Serbian real estate market. It stresses that the discount is also justified given the differences between the comparable transactions used by Ms. Ili\u0107 (such as size, the existence of infrastructure and access roads) and BD Agro's land. Mr. Cowan then imports this discounted price into his valuation of BD Agro.\n\n**6. Bankruptcy sale discount**\n-------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nIn his bankruptcy scenario, Mr. Cowan applies a bankruptcy sales discount of 50%, stating that \"it is typical to apply a discount to represent the impact on value of undertaking a sales process of a distressed business.\"499 He adds that the choice of 50% is supported by the actual discount applied to BD Agro's assets in the bankruptcy sale in 2019 as well as by the amended pre-pack reorganization plan.\n\nCowan ER II, \u00a72.5.2.\n\n**7. Liabilities**\n------------------\n\n669.\n\nMr. Cowan submits that to ascertain BD Agro's fair market value, liabilities must be deducted from assets. He thus first deducts, relying on the Second Confineks Valuation and his own assessment, total estimated liabilities, excluding deferred tax liabilities, of EUR 42.2m. Second, he then deducts, based on Ms. Ili\u0107's expert report, a conversion fee of EUR 1.8m. Third, he effects deductions for court expenses of EUR 200,000, capital gains tax of EUR 5.7m, and redundancy payments of EUR 700,000. Finally, in the bankruptcy scenario, he deducts bankruptcy costs.\n\n**8. Distress discount**\n------------------------\n\n670.\n\nMr. Cowan also provides for a distress discount. He and Serbia reject the Claimants' objection about this discount as fair market value means that both buyer and seller are reasonably informed about the characteristics of the asset being sold. A willing buyer would thus know that BD Agro was going into bankruptcy.\n\n**9. Interest**\n---------------\n\n671.\n\nSerbia disputes the Claimants' position that interest is to be calculated according to Serbian law, as the relevant treaty provisions only require the Tribunal to apply international law. Further and in any event, the MFN clause in the Canada-Serbia BIT is limited in scope and does not allow the importation of additional substantive standards like a preservation of rights clause from other BITs. Finally, preservation of rights clauses do not extend to compensation for treaty violations: the Claimants could ask for the 8% interest rate pursuant to Serbian law for a lawful expropriation, but cannot do so in cases of unlawful expropriation. Serbia contends that the appropriate interest rate would be a flat interbank rate (LIBOR/EURIBOR). The 2% increase which the Claimants' request should be rejected \"considering [...] revelations about BD Agro's mismanagement by Mr. Obradovic.\"500\n\nRej., \u00a7\u00a71477-1481.\n\n**C. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n672.\n\nIt is undisputed - and rightly so - that, in case of a breach, Serbia must fully repair the harm caused to the Claimants.501 As the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the seizure of BD Agro's shares breached Article 6 of the Serbia-Canada BIT, it must now assess damages. To this effect, it will first deal with causation ((1) below) and will then assess the proper valuation methodology ((2) below) and review the different valuation elements on which the Parties diverge ((3) to (9) below) before reaching its conclusion ((10) below).\n\nReply, \u00a71296; C-Mem., \u00a7764.\n\n**1. Causation**\n----------------\n\n673.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that \"payment of compensation presupposes a causal link between a treaty breach and the injury suffered for which compensation is sought.\"502 Serbia argues that no such link exists because BD Agro's bankruptcy was not caused by the Agency's termination of the Agreement and seizure of the Beneficially Owned Shares but rather by BD Agro's \"long-term\" insolvency and Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107's failure to comply with the relevant court procedures.\n\nReply, \u00a71288; C-Mem. \u00a7765, relying on Exh. CLA-24, ILC Articles, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, Article 31(2).\n\n674.\n\nTo assess the submissions, the Tribunal recalls the facts and chronology as they emerge from the record:\n\n\u2022 On 25 November 2014, BD Agro filed a pre-pack reorganization plan with the Commercial Court in Belgrade to improve the financial situation of the company.503 An amended plan was filed on 6 March 2015 (the \"Amended pre-pack reorganization plan\").504\n\n\u2022 On 6 January 2015, Banca Intesa requested the Commercial Court in Belgrade to open bankruptcy proceedings over BD Agro alleging its permanent insolvency.505 On 21 January 2015, the Commercial Court accepted Banca Intesa's request and initiated preliminary bankruptcy proceedings;506\n\n\u2022 On 25 June 2015, that court approved the amended pre-pack reorganization plan. The required majority of creditors, including Nova Agrobanka, BD Agro's largest creditor at the time, voted in favor of the plan.507 A minority of creditors, including Banca Intesa, however, filed appeals to the Commercial Appellate Court in Belgrade;508\n\n\u2022 On 6 August 2015, since BD Agro's reorganization was ongoing, the Commercial Court denied Banca Intesa's request for opening bankruptcy proceedings over BD Agro;509\n\n\u2022 On 30 September 2015, the Commercial Appellate Court allowed Banca Intesa's appeal, reversed the approval of the amended pre-pack reorganization plan, and remanded the case to the Commercial Court of Belgrade.510 In particular, the Appellate Court stated (i) that it was necessary to verify the data in the amended plan, as there were substantial differences between BD Agro's property valuations in the original and the amended plans and (ii) that BD Agro needed to submit an extraordinary audit report and an updated amended plan in accordance with that report;\n\n\u2022 On 1 October 2015, the Agency advised BD Agro of the termination of the Privatization Agreement on 28 September 2015;\n\n\u2022 On 7 October 2015, the Commercial Appellate Court revoked the Commercial Court's decision of 6 August 2015 denying Banca Intesa's request for opening bankruptcy proceedings over BD Agro;511\n\n\u2022 On 16 October 2015, the Commercial Court ordered BD Agro to amend the reorganization plan in accordance with the decision of the Appellate Court within 15 days;512\n\n\u2022 On 21 October 2015, the Agency seized the Beneficially Owned Shares;513\n\n\u2022 On 26 October 2015, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 on behalf of BD Agro wrote to the Privatization Agency, seeking instructions on how to proceed with the reorganization process. He explained that the Commercial Court had ordered BD Agro to act in accordance with directions of the Appellate Court within 15 days, failing which the Commercial Court would reject the amended pre-pack reorganization plan. Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 wrote this letter as he then was General Director of BD Agro, the Agency not having yet appointed a legal representative for the company after the Decision on Transfer of Capital;514\n\n\u2022 The Agency did not respond within that period;\n\n\u2022 On 8 December 2015, as BD Agro had not complied with the court's order of 16 October 2015, the Commercial Court dismissed BD Agro's proposal for conducting bankruptcy proceedings in accordance with the amended plan,515 which decision became final on 5 January 2016;516\n\n\u2022 On 30 August 2016, BD Agro was declared bankrupt.517\n\nExh.

The reorganization, which had the requisite support of BD Agro's creditors, and which would have revived BD Agro, failed, in turn, because Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 could not proceed without the Agency's approval, which was not forthcoming.\n\nExh.

RE-467, Print screen from the course of proceedings before Commercial Court in Belgrade, regarding bankruptcy proceedings no. St. 15/16, 20 January 2020, p. 2.\n\n676.\n\nSerbia argues that Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, and hence BD Agro, \"was neither obliged to request the Privatization Agency's approval, nor was the Privatization Agency authorized to give such approval.\"519\n\nC-Mem., \u00a7203, relying on Marki\u0107evi\u0107 WS II, \u00a7195.\n\n677.\n\nMr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107 sought instructions from the Privatization after the termination of the Agreement. The question is thus what his powers were during the period in which the Agreement had been terminated but no new management was in place yet. The answer is found in Article 47 of the 2014 Law on Privatization, which provides that, after the termination of a privatization agreement, the management of the privatized company is prevented from making certain decisions, including, in particular, decisions on the reorganization of the company and that decisions violating this prohibition are null and void:\n\n\"[Paragraphs 1 and 2]\n\nAfter termination of the agreement on sale of the capital, the management bodies of the subject of privatization cannot, prior to selection of new management bodies, render the decisions on the following:\n\n1) decrease or increase of the capital of the company;\n\n2) acquisition or disposal of real estate or the high value property;\n\n3) reorganization of the company;\n\n4) pledging assets, mortgaging, and applying other kinds of property encumbrance;\n\n5) renting or leasing property;\n\n6) settlement with creditors.\n\nThe decision rendered contrary to paragraph 3 of this Article shall be null and void.\"520\n\nExh. CE-223, Law on Privatization, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia no, 83/2014 and 46/2015, Art. 47.\n\n678.\n\nSerbia does not appear to dispute that the matters contained in the amended pre-pack reorganization fall within the ambit of Article 47 and are thus outside the remit of the management of the formerly privatized company. Indeed, the amended plan concerned the reorganization of the company and included provisions on both acquisition of high value property (new heifers) and disposal of high value property (sale of non-core assets), all items falling within the ambit of Articles 47(2) and 47(3). In addition, the purpose of the pre-pack reorganization plan was to reach a settlement with BD Agro's creditors, which falls within the scope of Article 47(6).\n\n679.\n\nSerbia objects that Article 47 of the 2014 Law on Privatization does not apply in this case as the decision to commence reorganization, as well as the decision to acquire and dispose of high value property were taken prior to the termination of the Agreement. Execution of those decisions, says Serbia, would not fall within the ambit of Article 47. This limitation of Article 47 does not arise from the legal text. Neither does Serbia offer any support by way of legal authorities or otherwise. In the Tribunal's view, the purpose of Article 47 is to restrict the pre-termination management of the company to the conduct of day to day business until a new management is in place, preventing it from making any decisions that may materially impact the business of the newly de-privatized/re-nationalized company. That seems a perfectly reasonable solution to handle the transition from the old to the new ownership. Hence, Mr. Marki\u0107evi\u0107, acting for the pre-termination management of BD Agro, had no choice but to seek instructions in respect of the reorganization from the Privatization Agency. The fact that the instructions were about amendments to a pre-existing plan as opposed to a new plan does not appear sufficient to make the rationale underlying Article 47 inapplicable. The Commercial Court had ordered BD Agro to amend the reorganization plan in accordance with the decision of the Appellate Court, including submitting a new extraordinary auditor report and adding accounting data. It is not evident that such a revised reorganization plan would fall within the ambit of BD Agro's 25 April 2014 (pre-termination) decision to commence its reorganization.521\n\nExh. RE-468, Decision of BD Agro's Shareholders Assembly, 25 April 2014.\n\n680.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that BD Agro was in a distressed situation at the time of the valuation. It had made no profits for several years, was in bankruptcy proceedings and had submitted a reorganization plan to overcome its operational and financial issues and restore its profitability. Its bank accounts were blocked since 8 March 2013.522 The Tribunal has accounted for these difficulties in valuing BD Agro (\u00a7701).\n\nExh. CE-511, Mr. Bodolo's Report, 24 January 2019, p. 6.\n\n**2. Methodology**\n------------------\n\n681.\n\nBoth Parties have each relied on experts to value damages, who in turn cite contemporaneous valuations in support of their conclusions.\n\n682.\n\nThe experts agree on the valuation date being 21 October 2015, i.e. the date of seizure of BD Agro's shares. The Tribunal concurs as this is indeed the date when the breach was perpetrated.\n\n683.\n\nThe Parties also agree to use Dr. Hern's terminology when valuing BD Agro's so-called \"core assets\" separately from its non-core assets. The Tribunal sees no reason not to follow this approach.\n\n684.\n\nWhere the experts differ is whether, on the valuation date, BD Agro's farm business should be considered as a going concern and valued on a DCF basis or whether it should be considered \"illiquid\" and valued on an asset basis. The Tribunal recalls that, as a general matter, assets need to qualify as a going concern having a proven track record of profitability in order to be valued in accordance with the DCF method.523 In *Vivendi,* for instance, the Tribunal observed that \"international tribunals have stated that an award based on future profits is not appropriate unless the relevant enterprise is profitable and has operated for a sufficient period to establish its performance record.\"524\n\nSee for instance, *Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v. The Republic of Tajikistan,* SCC Case No. V064/2008, Final Award, 8 June 2010, \u00a7\u00a771,75.\n\nExh. CLA-49, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00a78.3.3.\n\n685.\n\nInternational valuation standards define a going concern as \"a business enterprise that is expected to continue operations for the foreseeable future.\"525 While it is true that BD Agro was experiencing financial difficulties, on the valuation date, it was not in bankruptcy. Its Amended pre-pack reorganization plan had been adopted by a majority of creditors, including a number of companies experienced in the dairy business.526 By voting in favour of the reorganization, these companies expressed that they considered that BD Agro's business would continue to operate for the foreseeable future. The Agency too appears to have recognized this fact when it approved BD Agro's 2015 financial statements.527 The Tribunal thus finds that, on the valuation date, BD Agro was a going concern.\n\nExh. RE-485, IVSC Glossary.\n\nHern ER II, \u00a776.\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 8, 159:24-161:4 (Cowan) (\"Mr. Pekar: Would it be fair to say that the Privatization Agency agreed that BD Agro was a going concern at the end of 2015? Mr. Cowan: I believe it's more the preparation of the statements, that's probably fair to say, yes. I would agree with that. Mr. Pekar: I don't understand. I believe that the financial statements of a company need to be approved by the shareholders, is that your understanding? Mr. Cowan: Yes, prepared by management and approved by the shareholders. Mr. Pekar: If a shareholder does not believe that a company is a going concern, why would the shareholder approve the financial statements? Mr. Cowan: I agree.\").\n\n686.\n\nThis being so, BD Agro was making losses. It is not disputed that BD Agro was consistently loss-making from 2006-2014, *i.e.* during the years before the valuation date of 21 October 2015.528\n\nCowan ER II, \u00a73.15. See also Expert Presentation of Mr. Cowan, p. 9.\n\n687.\n\nIn the absence of demonstrated profitability, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to apply the DCF methodology to value BD Agro's farm business. While investment tribunals have applied the DCF methodology in the absence of a proven track record of profitability, they have only done so when there was sufficient evidence of future profitability. In *Rusoro Mining v. Venezuela,* for instance, the tribunal observed that the application of the DCF methodology was appropriate not just for the valuation of going concerns with profitability, but also for enterprises that were not going concerns, but had detailed business plans, available financing, records of financial performance, predictability of performance with other projects, foreseeability of costs, and certainty of the price and sale of their products and services.529 The Claimants have produced no evidence on any of these aspects that would allow the Tribunal to conclude that future profitability is sufficiently certain. In the circumstances, the Tribunal discards the DCF methodology.\n\nExh. RLA-196, *Rusoro Mining Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, \u00a7759. See also *Mohamed Abdel Raouf Bahgat v. Arab Republic of Egypt (I),* PCA Case No. 2012-07, Award, 23 December 2019, \u00a7434 referring to *Rusoro Mining,* and Exh. CLA-49, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00a78.3.3.\n\n688.\n\nIt follows that the appropriate valuation methodology to value all of BD Agro's assets, *i.e.* core and non-core assets, is the asset-based methodology.\n\n**3. Size of the Construction Land**\n------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nThe Parties differ on the size of BD Agro's land, particularly the size of the Construction Land.\n\n690.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, at the hearing, Dr. Hern and Mr. Grzesik agreed with Ms. Ili\u0107 that the size of the Construction Land was 279.4 ha.530 Serbia, however, insists that this figure is wrong as it is not based on the area of BD Agro's land included in BD Agro's bankruptcy sale of 9 April 2019. The Tribunal does not agree:\n\n\u2022 Serbia excludes certain lands subject to court disputes with [ZZ] Buducnost Dobanovci and Inter Kop. These court proceedings were initiated in 2018,531 almost three years after the valuation date. Serbia has not advanced a cogent reason why events occurring after the valuation date should be taken into account. Its own expert, Ms. Ili\u0107, testified that only reasons existing at the time of the valuation could present a potential reason for excluding land from valuation;532\n\n\u2022 Serbia also excludes certain land plots based on litigation between itself and BD Agro related to the Land Swap Agreement.533 The court action was brought to invalidate the swap and Serbia speculates that BD Agro would \"almost certainly\" have to return the land it had received from Serbia under the land swap agreement.534 It admits that court proceedings related to the land swap were pending on the valuation date.535 Thus, the Tribunal sees no reason to disregard the legal situation as it stood at the time of the valuation, being that the land in question was owned by BD Agro, not to speak of the fact that, if the swap were undone, another land asset would return into BD Agro's ownership or equivalent compensation at market value would become part of the valuation;\n\n\u2022 No land should be excluded based on alleged restitution claims with respect to land plots in Novi Be\u010dej Nos. 21842, 22062/2, 22062/5, 22414/2 and 2063/1.536 Serbia concedes that the claims are a mere \"possibility\"537 and that \"not much information is available\" concerning these claims.538 Moreover, the Serbian Restitution Agency confirmed that there were no restitution requests submitted with respect to BD Agro's land on the valuation date;539\n\n\u2022 Still for the same reason, Serbia's exclusion of land forming the subject-matter of the Hypo Park Agreement must be dismissed. On the date of valuation, BD Agro did own this land;540\n\n\u2022 While Serbia initially sought to exclude land sold to Eko Elektrofrigo, it later conceded that this land should not be excluded.541\n\n\u2022 The other exclusions sought by Serbia fail as well.542 In respect of \"the land distributed to the employees of BD Agro prior to the privatization\"543 Serbia has not established precisely which land plots were allegedly distributed to BD Agro's employees, when they were distributed or why these land plots were included in the other valuations of BD Agro's land. As far as the land plots \"labeled as public roads\"544 is concerned, Serbia has not furnished any convincing evidence that BD Agro did not own these plots at the valuation date. In respect of \"the land expropriated in 1991\"545, Serbia does not contest the Claimants' submission that BD Agro continues to use this land. Finally, at least some of \"the land conceded to the Municipality of Zemun\"546 was already excluded from BD Agro's valuation and should not be excluded again.\n\nMr. Grzesik's presentation, slide 4; Dr. Hern's presentation, slide 4; Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 57:8-12 (Grzesik); Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 8, 5:11-15 (Hern); Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 144:11-145:4 (Ili\u0107).\n\nExh.

Price per m2**\n-------------------\n\n692.\n\nThe experts agree on the general approach to be taken to value the Construction Land.548 They have different opinions, however, on the value of that land, Dr. Hern proposing a range between EUR 22-30/m2 and Mr. Cowan 14.7 EUR/m2, based on Ms. Ili\u0107's first report.\n\nCowan ER I \u00a72.17 (\"Dr. Hern's approach to the valuation of the land relies on contemporaneous transactions, contemporaneous valuations by the tax authority and contemporaneous valuations prepared by third parties. I do not disagree with Dr. Hern's approach.\").\n\n693.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Mr. Cowan's approach to be more reasonable:\n\n\u2022 Dr. Hern states that his lower bound price of 22 EUR/m2 \"reflects the valuation of BD Agro's as determined by Serbian tax authorities for calculating property taxes.\"549 However, according to Mr. Grzesik, the Claimants' real estate expert, this principal source of Dr. Hern's lower bound price falls into a category of \"mass appraisals\", which \"carry little evidentiary weight when valuing specific individual properties.\"550 Further, Dr. Hern states that his lower price \"is broadly consistent with the Dec 2015 Confineks report valuation of 24 EUR/m2.\"551 However, once again, Mr. Grzesik does not rely on the First Confineks Valuation and treats it as \"secondary evidence\" because it does not refer to evidence of comparable transactions.552 Finally, while Dr. Hern relies on BD Agro's transactions of 20 to 23 EUR/m2, Mr. Grzesik disregards them because they were too old and thus carried \"little evidentiary weight\";553\n\n\u2022 Dr. Hern states that his upper bound price of 30 EUR/m2 \"is based on weighted average price used in Mr. Mrgud's valuation.\"554 However, Mr. Grzesik opined that Mr. Mrgud's valuation, based on asking prices, was flawed, because it provided no information about the sources of these prices or when they were published;555\n\n\u2022 Dr. Hern relies on the value of the land in Batajnica as the main source of evidence for his upper bound price of 30 EUR/m2, finding that, by its characteristics, that land was comparable to the land in Zones A, B, and C. There are, however, major differences between the Batajnica land and Zones A, B, and C land that make the former an unsuitable comparator:\n\ni. The Batajnica transactions are based on value assessments by the tax administration for determining the tax on property transfer. They are thus different from property valuations based on international standards;556\n\nii. It is well accepted that the information used for valuation should originate on or before the valuation date. The Batajnica assessments, dating from March to August 2016, do not meet this requirement.557 Mr. Grzesik admitted that he was not sure when the assessments actually took place.558 It is likely that the Batajnica assessments were based on the tax administration\u2019s previous assessments that also took place in 2016, not in 2015, because the tax administration is required to base its assessments of the property value on its most recent tax decisions concerning real estate sales;559\n\niii. As far as location is concerned, Dr. Hern initially made a reservation about the comparability of the Batajnica land with Zones A, B, and C.560 There are, in fact, several differences. Importantly, the Batajnica land is close to the Batajnica settlement and to major traffic infrastructure (highway, roads, and railway).561 In contrast, Zones A, B, and C land is located some distance away from Dobanovci562 and has no access to any roads563 or railway.564\n\nHern ER I, \u00a789(A).\n\nGrzesik ER I, \u00a76.13, with reference to Hern ER I, \u00a7\u00a771-72; Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 73:19-75:10.\n\nHern ER I, \u00a789(A).\n\nGrzesik ER I, \u00a7\u00a76.6 & 8.1.\n\nGrzesik ER I, \u00a7\u00a76.5 & 6.8; see, also, Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 72:14-73:1.\n\nHern ER I, \u00a789(B).\n\nTr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 80:24-81:2 (\"if you are relying on asking prices, then as much information as possible is needed, because asking prices are the lowest level of evidence that you can use in a valuation.\")\n\nIli\u0107 ER II, \u00a7\u00a72.97-2.118.\n\nExh.

The Tribunal understands that Ms. Ili\u0107 has applied the same discount in other instances because of the differences in the size of the land of the comparables and BD Agro's land (see, for e.g., Ili\u0107 ER I, \u00a7\u00a79.48, \u00a79.61, and \u00a79.77), which the Claimants have not contested.\n\nIli\u0107 Presentation, p.11.\n\n696.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Ms. Ili\u0107's overall approach reasonable. She used asking prices in her analysis, first reducing them by 10% to account for likely price negotiations between buyer and seller, the usual practice in Serbia being to apply a 10-15% reduction between asking and actual price.568 She then applied a 30% discount to reflect differences between the comparables which she uses and BD Agro's land.\n\nIli\u0107 ER II, \u00a7 2.35 and 2.104. The Claimants do not appear to contest this.\n\n697.\n\nWhile the Claimants oppose this 30% discount, the Tribunal notes that the representative comparables chosen by Ms. Ili\u0107 and BD Agro's land were of a different size.569 Dr. Hern himself accepted that size does matter when commenting that, in one transaction, the large area of BD Agro's land on sale may have pushed the price down.570 That said, BD Agro may have been able to split its land in smaller parcels before selling it, making any discount on the sale of the land as a whole inapposite. However, even if it had done so, it remains that there were other important differences between the comparators chosen by Ms. Ili\u0107 and BD Agro's land. While the comparators had access to the roads and other infrastructure,571 this was not the case for BD Agro's land, which still needed to be developed.572 Moreover, although the Claimants argue that it is not possible to establish the exact location of the comparators and to determine the differences between the comparators chosen by Ms. Ili\u0107's and BD Agro's land,573 the descriptions of the comparators make clear that they were equipped with infrastructure and had access to roads.574 Ms. Ili\u0107's testimony that these differences justify a discount was not seriously rebutted.575 To the Tribunal, applying a discount appears reasonable as any buyer would incur costs and spend time in developing BD Agro's land and would factor the development costs and time into the price offered. Failing more precise indications in the record about the size of this deduction, it appears reasonable to the Tribunal to accept the 30% discount applied by Ms. Ili\u0107. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal stresses that this discount is already included in the 14.7 EUR/m2 price that Mr. Cowan used in his calculations and is thus reflected in the table below (\u00a7707).\n\nIli\u0107 ER I, \u00a79.1, p.115.\n\nSee Hern ER I, \u00a765 (\"the area sold was very large (around 102ha), which may have put a downward pressure on the price.\"); Hern ER III, \u00a737 (\"Ms Ili\u0107 discusses BD Agro\u2019s sale of 102ha land from 2008 at 15 EUR/m2, which I have not relied on in my valuation due to the large area which may have put a downward pressure on the sale price.\").\n\nSee Exh.

[...] A. I think what I can say is that Zones A, B and C were under the regulation plan -- that was land which was suitable for the development of industrial and business uses. However, in order to get to those uses, a lot more work needs to be done in terms of provision of infrastructure, in terms of provision of roads, in terms of the whole planning procedure, so any developer buying this site would be fully aware of the enormous amount of work that still needed to be done to enable these sites to be put in a situation where you could start development.\").\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00a7323.\n\nSee Exh.

Bankruptcy sale discount**\n-------------------------------\n\n698.\n\nIn his calculations, Mr. Cowan applied a bankruptcy sales discount of 50%. However, he accepted that such a discount would be inapplicable in case of a going concern.576 As discussed above (\u00a7685), at the time of valuation, BD Agro was a going concern. Hence, this discount is inapposite.\n\nSee, for instance, Cowan ER III, Table 4.8.\n\n**7. Liabilities**\n------------------\n\n699.\n\nIt is common ground that liabilities must be deducted from assets to get to the near asset value of BD Agro. The Parties' experts had different opinions, however, on a number of elements of BD Agro's liabilities and, consequently, on their total amount:\n\ni. *Total estimated liabilities (excluding deferred tax liabilities):* Relying on the figures included in the Second Confineks Valuation and his own analysis, Mr. Cowan submits that BD Agro's estimated liabilities were EUR 42.2 million. Dr. Hern reaches a lower figure of EUR 37.8 million. The Second Confineks Valuation determined that BD Agro's liabilities amounted to EUR 40.4 million. That amount was also used as the basis for liability values in BD Agro's 31 December 2015 Financial Statements. To that amount, Mr. Cowan added EUR 1.8 million because the principal amount of a Banca Intesa (later Agrounija) loan accounted for in the Second Confineks Valuation increased,577 resulting in an increase in the interest payable thereon (and thereby increasing BD Agro's liabilities by that amount).578 The Tribunal finds Mr. Cowan's approach reasonable;\n\nii. *Conversion fee:* The experts agree that, for a buyer to develop BD Agro's land it would need to convert it from agricultural land to industrial land and to pay a corresponding conversion fee. That fee would then have to be deducted from the value of the land. The experts disagree, however, on the amount of the conversion fee. The Law on Agricultural Land specifies that the conversion fee is based on 50% of the average price of agricultural land or 20% of average price of construction land. The experts agree on using the agricultural price as basis. In his expert report, Mr. Grzesik reaches an agricultural land price of EUR 1.85 million, to which he applies a conversion fee of EUR 1.5 million. By contrast, Ms. Ili\u0107 arrives at an agricultural land price of EUR 3.4 million to which she applies a conversion fee of EUR 3.1 million. In her first report579 and at the hearing, Ms. Ili\u0107 furnished a detailed explanation for her approach580 and explained why the fee must be calculated on the basis of the previous year's tax assessment.581 Mr. Cowan then used Ms. Ili\u0107's conversion fee amount in his expert report.582 The Tribunal finds Ms. Ili\u0107's reasons plausible. In the absence of any contrary indications provided by the Claimants, it adopts the conversion fee used by the Respondent's experts;\n\niii. *Payment to Canadian suppliers:* The experts agree that payments to Canadian suppliers amounting to EUR 2.2 million are to be deducted, which the Tribunal will follow;583\n\niv. *Court proceedings:* Mr. Cowan includes EUR 200,000 in BD Agro's liabilities. The Tribunal agrees, as the item was included in BD Agro's 2015 financial statements.584\n\nv. *Capital gains tax:* Dr. Hern and Mr. Cowan disagree on the applicable capital gains tax. Dr. Hern calculates capital gains tax by using the \"deferred tax liabilities\" in BD Agro's 2015 balance sheet as a proxy for the capital gains, based on the Claimants\u2019 instruction.585 By contrast, Mr. Cowan deducts the book value of BD Agro\u2019s tangible assets *(i.e.* BD Agro\u2019s land, plant, equipment and biological assets) as of 31 December 2013 as a proxy for the purchase price, from the value of land according to Ms. Ili\u0107 and applies a 15% capital gain tax rate.586 The Tribunal adopts Mr. Cowan\u2019s approach, which it finds objective and logical.\n\nvi. *Redundancy payments:* The experts disagree whether certain redundancy payments should be included in BD Agro\u2019s valuation. While the Claimants submit that the redundancy program was voluntary, they offer no authority in support. In any event, BD Agro was obliged to prepare a redundancy program in accordance with Annex 1 of the Privatisation Agreement.587 Further, BD Agro\u2019s 2015 financial statements also recognize redundancy payments as being obligatory.588 The Tribunal finds that these payments must be accounted for;\n\nvii. *Bankruptcy costs:* As discussed above in the context of the bankruptcy discount, BD Agro was a going concern on the valuation date. This reduction in liabilities is thus inapplicable. This finding is confirmed by the fact that Mr. Cowan did not deduct these costs in his going concern scenario.589\n\nExh.

This explanation also addresses Mr. Grzesik's concern as to why Ms. Illic adopts an agricultural value of EUR 1/m2 in her main valuation, but a value of EUR 3.4/m2 for determining the conversion fee (Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 58: 13-25). As she explains, the tax authorities provide an annual assessment each year based on which the conversion fee is to be calculated. See, in particular, Tr., Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 7, 177:22-178:09 (\"[T]he authority that has to do the assessment of this conversion fee is the Tax Authority. How do they do it? They take from the previous year the assessment they made for tax purposes, the annual taxation calculations, and of course, if I am to simulate this procedure and arrive at what the realistic figure would be, I would then go and check what tax was assessed. There is a table I would need to look at which shows the prices in individual zones that were determined by the Tax Authority for the previous year, so for 2014, the \u20ac3.4 is the price of agricultural land in the zone in which BD Agro land was located.\").\n\nCowan ER III, Table 4.4.\n\nSee, for instance, Cowan ER III, Table 4.8.\n\nSee Cowan ER III, \u00a7\u00a72.17-20 & 4.2 *et seq.* See also Exh.

Distress discount**\n------------------------\n\n700.\n\nContrary to the bankruptcy sale discount that Mr. Cowan did not apply in his going concern scenario, Mr. Cowan applied a 30% distress discount in that scenario. He considered this discount reasonable, representing the impact on the price of selling a distressed business. Dr. Hern disputed this discount.\n\n701.\n\nAs discussed above, the record shows that, at the time of the valuation, BD Agro was a going concern. That it had made no profits for several years does not change this position. Its creditors had approved a reorganization plan. They thereby showed that they expected the business to overcome its operational and financial issues and become profitable. Moreover, the majority of BD Agro's assets, as the table in paragraph 707 shows, were constituted of land, the value of which would in any event not be impacted by the prospects of the business (subject to a pre-bankruptcy \"fire sale\", which would not come into play here for a going concern with a reorganization plan in place). For these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that there is insufficient basis to apply Mr. Cowan's proposed 30% distress discount.\n\n**9. Interest**\n---------------\n\n702.\n\nThe Claimants invoke the most-favored nation provision contained in Article 5 of the Canada-Serbia BIT to argue that they are entitled to rely on the preservation of right clause in Article 10 of the Cyprus-Serbia BIT and Article 13(1) of the Qatar-Serbia BIT, with the result that they can claim interest according to the more favourable provisions in Serbian law.\n\n703.\n\nArticle 5 of the Canada-Serbia BIT contains a most favoured nation clause of the following content:\n\n\"ARTICLE 5\n\nMost-Favoured-Nation Treatment\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to an investor of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of an investment in its territory.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to a covered investment treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of investors of a non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of an investment in its territory.\n\n[...].\"\n\n704.\n\nAccordingly, investors of a Contracting Party and covered investments shall be treated no less favorably than investors or investments of investors of a non-Party in respect of the \"establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition\" of an investment. The Tribunal does not see how provisions on interest rates would fall within the ambit of this provision. Indeed, the interest rate prescribed by Serbian law is unrelated to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of an investment. Consequently, the claim for interest under Serbian law through the operation of the Canada-Serbia MFN provision must be dismissed.\n\n705.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimants seek interest at 6-month average EURIBOR + 2%, compounded semi-annually. Serbia agrees to pay interest on a flat interbank rate, but not with an increase of 2%, which it says should not be awarded \"considering [...] revelations about BD Agro's mismanagement by Mr. Obradovic.\"590\n\nRej., \u00a71481.\n\n706.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of full reparation, Mr. Rand is entitled to an interest rate calculated in a manner which \"best approximates\" the value lost.591 Mr. Obradovic's conduct is irrelevant in this context and Serbia has not substantiated its argument that it should play a role here. The Respondent recognizes that tribunals have awarded interest at the interbank interest rate plus 2 percentage points.592 Late interest on debts is intended to remedy the non-availability of funds due or, in other words, to pay for the time value of money. The time value of money can be compensated by taking into account the cost of borrowing funds to make up for the unpaid sums or the loss involved in not being able to invest those sums. Under both assumptions, the interest would exceed a rate applied between financial institutions exclusively. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to award interest at EURIBOR for 6 months deposits, plus 2% per annum, and to compound such interest semi-annually.\n\nExh.

Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n707.\n\nIt follows from the above that the Tribunal has made several adjustments to the valuations prepared by the Parties' experts, as a result of which the final amounts are as follows:593\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **At 21 October 2015 in EUR m** | **Value in EUR m** |\n| Dobanovci Development Land [Construction Land] | 41.9 |\n| Other Construction Land | 1.3 |\n| Novi Becej | 0.2 |\n| **Non-farm assets** | **43.4** |\n| Agricultural land | 6.4 |\n| Other fixed assets | 18.8 |\n| Current assets | 5.0 |\n| Deferred tax assets | 0.1 |\n| **Farm Assets** | 30.3 |\n| **Total assets** | **73.7** |\n| Total estimate liabilities | (42.2) |\n| Conversion fee | (3.1) |\n| Payment to Canadian suppliers | (2.2) |\n| Court proceedings | (0.2) |\n| Capital Gains Tax | (5.7) |\n| Redundancy payments | (0.7) |\n| **Total liabilities** | **54.1** |\n| **Net asset value of BD Agro at 21 October 2015 / Value of 100% shares in BD Agro at 21 October 2015** | **19.7** |\n\nThis table is based on the table in Cowan ER III, \u00a74.4, after adjusting it as necessary in light of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions above.\n\n708.\n\nAccounting for these adjustments, the value of 100% of the shares in BD Agro on 21 October 2015 was 19.7 million.594 Mr. Rand indirectly owned 75.87% of BD Agro's shares, through Rand Investments (in which he had a 100% shareholding) and Sembi (in which he held a 97.5% shareholding),595 resulting in a valuation of EUR 14,572,730. To this figure, interest should be added at 6-month average EURIBOR + 2%, compounded semi-annually until the date of payment (see above, \u00a7706).\n\nCowan ER III, Table 4.8.\n\nMem., \u00a754.\n\n**IX.

The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a statement of the case account in due course and will return to the Parties any unused amount in equal shares.\n\n**D. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n713.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award. \"\n\n714.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n715.\n\nThere are generally three approaches for awarding costs in ICSID arbitrations: (i) some tribunals apportion arbitration costs equally and rule that each party should bear its own costs; (ii) others apply the \"costs follow the event\" principle, under which the losing party bears all or part of the costs of the proceedings, including those of the prevailing party and (iii) still others follow a mixed approach in which they take into account the outcome of the claims as well as the conduct of the parties in the arbitration and other appropriate circumstances.\n\n716.\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal finds it appropriate that the Parties each bear half of the costs of the proceedings and bear their own legal and other costs. This approach seems fair and reasonable considering all the circumstances:\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction only over Mr. Rand\u2019s claims under the ICSID Convention and the Canada-Serbia BIT in respect of his interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares. It lacked jurisdiction over his claims in respect of his payments for the benefit of BD Agro and his indirect shareholding in BD Agro. It also lacked jurisdiction over the claims of the other Claimants under the Canada-Serbia BIT, and over Sembi under the Cyprus-Serbia BIT;\n\n\u2022 The issues involved were complicated because of Mr. Rand\u2019s unusual investment structure, which triggered objections and extensive debates;\n\n\u2022 Mr. Rand has been awarded less than 20% of the amount claimed, and that by majority;\n\n\u2022 While the Parties and their counsel conducted these proceedings in a professional, cooperative, and efficient manner incurring reasonable costs, there is a significant disparity between the Claimants\u2019 costs and those of the Respondent.\n\n**X.

It arises out of the Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Serbia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was signed on 1 September 2014 and entered into force on 27 April 2015 (the \"Canada-Serbia BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"), and the Agreement between Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Cyprus on Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was signed on 21 July 2005 and entered into force on 23 December 2005.\n\n2.\n\nThe claimants are Rand Investments Ltd., (\"Rand Investments\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Canada, Mr. William Archibald Rand (\"Mr. Rand\"), a natural person having the nationality of Canada, Ms. Kathleen Elizabeth Rand, a natural person having the nationality of Canada, Ms. Allison Ruth Rand, a natural person having the nationality of Canada, Mr. Robert Harry Leander Rand, a natural person having the nationality of Canada (together, the \"Canadian Claimants\"), and Sembi Investment Limited (\"Sembi\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Cyprus (together, the Canadian Claimants and Sembi are referred to as the \"Claimants\").\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Serbia (\"Serbia\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nBy an award dated 29 June 2023 (the \"Award\"), the Tribunal composed of Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (a Swiss national), Mr. Baiju S. Vasani (a British and U.S. national), and Prof. Marcelo G. Kohen (an Argentine national), decided by majority as follows:\n\n\"a. DECLARES that it has jurisdiction over Mr. Rand's claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT in respect of his interest in the Beneficially Owned Shares and that these claims are admissible;\n\nb. DENIES jurisdiction over all other claims under the Canada-Serbia BIT and the Cyprus-Serbia BIT;\n\nc. DECLARES that the Respondent has breached Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT;\n\nd. ORDERS the Respondent to pay EUR 14,572,730 to Mr. William Rand, together with interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, until the date of payment;\n\ne. ORDERS the Parties to each bear 50% of the Tribunal's fees and expenses and ICSID's fees as notified by ICSID;\n\nf. ORDERS the Parties to bear their own legal fees and other costs;\n\ng. DISMISSES all remaining claims and requests for relief\".1\n\nAward, \u00a7717.\n\n6.\n\nProf. Kohen issued a Dissenting Opinion in which he expressed his disagreement with the majority's conclusions on the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Mr. Rand, the admissibility of Mr. Rand's claims, the breach of Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT and, by way of consequence, the award of damages.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 August 2023, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants filed a Request for a Supplementary Decision on the Award, accompanied by Annexes 1 to 6 (the \"Request\"). On 14 August 2023, in accordance with Rule 49(2)(c) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), the Centre transmitted the Request to the Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, the Acting Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance with Rule 49(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Centre transmitted the Request to each member of the Tribunal on the same day.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 August 2023, in accordance with Rule 49(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its observations on the Request by 31 August 2023.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 August 2023, the Respondent submitted its Observations on the Claimants' Request, accompanied by Annexes 1 through 11 (the \"Respondent's Observations\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 September 2023, the Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to reply to the Respondent's Observations.\n\n12.\n\nOn 5 September 2023, the Tribunal invited (i) the Claimants to reply to the Respondent's Observations of 31 August 2023 by 14 September 2023; and (ii) the Respondent to respond to the Claimants' Reply by 24 September 2023.\n\n13.\n\nOn 14 September 2023, the Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent's Observations of 31 August 2023, together with Annexes 7 to 10 (the \"Reply\").\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 September 2023, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimants' Reply, together with Annex 12 (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n15.\n\nOn 11 October 2023, the Parties were invited to file their cost statements, which they did on 16 October 2023.\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 October 2023, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to Rule 46 and Rule 49(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants point out that in paragraph 717(d) of the Award, the Tribunal ordered Serbia to pay EUR 14,572,730 to Mr. Rand, together with interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, until the date of payment. While the Tribunal decided on the applicable interest rate and the date until which the interest was to be paid, it did not specify the date from which interest would accrue. In the Claimants' submission, it was evident from other paragraphs of the Award that interest would accrue from the date of breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT i.e. from 21 October 2015. However, this was not expressed in the operative part of the Award. As the Claimants would need to enforce the Award if the Respondent did not voluntarily pay the full Award with interest, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to supplement the operative part of the Award and state expressly that interest would accrue from the date of the breach, i.e. 21 October 2015.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants add that it is \"common ground\" in investment arbitration jurisprudence that interest on damages caused by a breach of fair and equitable treatment accrues from the date of such breach.2 Serbia did not dispute this position in the course of the arbitration, and its quantum expert, Mr. Cowan, calculated interest from the date of the breach i.e. 21 October 2015.\n\nRequest, \u00a75 et seq. relying *inter alia* on *Deutsche Telekom AG v. Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2014-10, Interim Award, 13 December 2017, \u00a7390, Annex-6 to the Request, and *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 11 June 2012, \u00a7\u00a7141-156, 1036, 1040, 1051, Annex-1 to the Request.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's arguments that interest accrues 120 days after the date of the Award, i.e. from 27 October 2023. They point out that, in paragraph 706 of the Award, the Tribunal recognized the time value of money, and that interest was meant to remedy the non-availability of funds. If the Tribunal now accepted Serbia's position, Mr. Rand would not be compensated for the loss of the time value of money between 21 October 2015 and 27 October 2023. Instead, Serbia would benefit from its breach of the Treaty as it would not suffer any adverse consequences during that time period. This would be contrary to the purpose of investment arbitration, which is to protect foreign investments.\n\n20.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants oppose the Respondent's assertion that they claimed interest from 27 September 2021 and not from 21 October 2015. They explain that throughout the arbitration, they always included the amount of interest accrued up to the date of their submission in the item labelled as the amount of compensation claimed. Interest accruing thereafter was claimed as a separate item. The Claimants stress that they also followed this practice in their First Post-Hearing Brief, where they included interest from the date of breach to 27 September 2021 in the amount of compensation claimed, and sought a separate award of interest from the date of the post-hearing brief until the date of payment.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Claimants sought the following relief in their Reply:\n\n\"Based on the above, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal:\n\na. SUPPLEMENT the operative part of the Award to expressly state that Serbia is ordered to pay 'interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, from 21 October 2015 until the date of payment'; and\n\nb. ORDER Serbia to reimburse Claimants for all their costs connected with the Request and its defense, including the USD 10,000 lodging fee and legal costs\".3\n\nReply, \u00a734.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Request should be denied. Interest on the principal sum awarded to Mr. Rand should accrue from 27 October 2023, i.e. 120 days after the date of issuance of the Award as it arises from the Award itself and the Canada-Serbia BIT. Serbia does not consider a supplementary ruling necessary, but \"does not oppose\" the Tribunal supplementing its Award mentioning that date if the Tribunal deems it necessary. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that, as the Claimants did not seek interest from the date of the breach in their prayers for relief, the Tribunal cannot make an order to this effect at this stage as otherwise it would rule beyond its mandate. \"At minimum\", the Tribunal should adopt the *dies a quo* stated in the Claimants' prayers for relief and award interest from 27 September 2021.\n\n23.\n\nSerbia points out that neither paragraphs 708 nor 717(d) of the Award cited by the Claimants assist the latter's case. In both paragraphs, a statement on the value of the investment is followed by a statement that interest is due. Neither paragraph identifies the date from which interest accrues. If paragraph 717(d) is supplemented, then it would be necessary to supplement paragraph 708 as well.\n\n24.\n\nSince the Award does not indicate the starting date for the interest calculation, the Respondent argues that, in accordance with Article 33(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT, the Tribunal must decide the issue in application of the terms of the BIT and of international law. The BIT is silent on the issue. Article 35(2) of the BIT merely allows the Tribunal to award \"monetary damages and any applicable interest\" without specifying the date from which interest accrues. By contrast, international law, including in particular Article 38(2) of the Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\") provides that interest should accrue from the date when the principal sum should have been paid. Here again, there is no precise indication in the Award when the principal awarded to Mr. Rand should be paid. However, the BIT does provide that a party can seek enforcement of an ICSID award 120 days after issuance. For Serbia, this entails that interest only starts running 120 days after the date of the Award i.e. from 27 October 2023.\n\n25.\n\nFinally, relying on several authorities, the Respondent insists that the Tribunal cannot \"go beyond\" the Claimants' requests for relief.4 In their last request for relief, the Claimants requested interest from 27 September 2021, not from the date of breach, which is 21 October 2015. The Tribunal should not permit the Claimants to use Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention to reformulate their request for relief and introduce a claim not pled in the arbitration.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00a722 et seq. relying *inter alia* on *Cyprus Popular Bank Public Co. Ltd. v. Hellenic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/16, Decision on Annulment, 28 November 2022, \u00a7300, Annex-8 to Respondent's Observations, and *\u0130\u00e7kale \u0130n\u015faat Ltd \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24, Decision on Claimant's Request for Supplementary Decision and Rectification of the Award, 4 October 2016, \u00a7114, Annex-9 to Respondent's Observations.\n\n**D. The Respondent's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Respondent sought the following relief in their Rejoinder:\n\n\"18. Bearing in mind the above, Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to deny the Claimants' Request. In the event that the Tribunal finds that it is necessary to supplement the Award, Respondent requests the Tribunal to amend the operative part of the Award ordering Respondent to pay\n\n- 'interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, from 27 October 2023 until the date of payment';\n\n- or, alternatively, 'interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, from 27 September 2021 until the date of payment';\n\n19. In any case, Respondent respectfully asks the Tribunal to order Claimants to pay costs of the proceedings initiated by their Request, including the cost incurred by Respondent in connection with the Request, to be specified at a later stage\".5\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a718-19.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n27.\n\nThe provisions governing requests for supplementary decisions by ICSID tribunals are contained in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. [\u2026]\".\n\nRule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n\"(1) Within 45 days of the date on which the award was rendered, either party may request, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention, a supplementary decision on, or rectification of, the award.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(3) The President of the Tribunal shall consult the members on whether it is necessary for the Tribunal to meet in order to consider the request. The Tribunal shall fix a time limit for the parties to file their observations on the request and shall determine the procedure for its consideration.\n\n(4) Rule 46-48 shall apply, *mutatis mutandis*, to any decision for the Tribunal pursuant to this Rule\".\n\n28.\n\nAccording to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal \"may\" decide a question that was omitted in the award. The Tribunal thus has discretion to make a supplementary decision or not.6 Further, the scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is limited to \"inadvertent omissions\" it is not to \"afford a substantive review or reconsideration of the decision\".7\n\nSee, e.g., *\u0130\u00e7kale \u0130n\u015faat Ltd \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24, Decision on Claimant's Request for Supplementary Decision and Rectification of the Award, 4 October 2016, \u00a7102, Annex-9 to Respondent's Observations; *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Claimant's Request for Supplementation and Rectification of Award, 18 January 2013, \u00a739.\n\n*\u0130\u00e7kale \u0130n\u015faat Ltd \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24, Decision on Claimant's Request for Supplementary Decision and Rectification of the Award, 4 October 2016, \u00a7\u00a7102-103, Annex-9 to Respondent's Observations, relying on Christoph Schreuer, with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY (Cambridge University Press, 2d ed. 2009), pp. 849-850.\n\n29.\n\nHere, the Claimants request that the Award be supplemented to state that interest accrues from the date of breach of Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT, i.e. 21 October 2015. The Respondent opposes this Request, stating that the Award is clear and that, if the Tribunal were to supplement the Award, it should do so by stating that interest accrues from 27 October 2023, which is 120 days after the date of the Award.\n\n30.\n\nThe relevant parts of the Award read as follows:\n\n\"706. In accordance with the principle of full reparation, Mr. Rand is entitled to an interest rate calculated in a manner which \"best approximates\" the value lost. Mr. Obradovic's conduct is irrelevant in this context and Serbia has not substantiated its argument that it should play a role here. The Respondent recognizes that tribunals have awarded interest at the interbank interest rate plus 2 percentage points. Late interest on debts is intended to remedy the non-availability of funds due or, in other words, to pay for the time value of money. The time value of money can be compensated by taking into account the cost of borrowing funds to make up for the unpaid sums or the loss involved in not being able to invest those sums. Under both assumptions, the interest would exceed a rate applied between financial institutions exclusively. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to award interest at EURIBOR for 6 months deposits, plus 2% per annum, and to compound such interest semi-annually.\n\n707. It follows from the above that the Tribunal has made several adjustments to the valuations prepared by the Parties' experts, as a result of which the final amounts are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **At 21 October 2015 in EUR m** | **Value in EUR m** |\n| Dobanovci Development Land [Construction Land] | 41.9 |\n| Other Construction Land | 1.3 |\n| Novi Becej | 0.2 |\n| **Non-farm assets** | **43.4** |\n| Agricultural land | 6.4 |\n| Other fixed assets | 1B.8 |\n| Current assets | 5.0 |\n| Deferred tax assets | 0.1 |\n| Farm Assets | 30.3 |\n| Total assets | 73.7 |\n| Total estimate liabilities | (42.2) |\n| Conversion fee | (3.1) |\n| Payment to Canadian suppliers | (2.2) |\n| Court proceedings | (0.2) |\n| Capital Gains Tax | (5.7) |\n| Redundancy payments | (0.7) |\n| **Total liabilities** | **54.1** |\n| **Net asset value of BD Agro at 21 October 2015 / Value of 100% shares in BD Agro at 21 October 2015** | **19.7** |\n\n708. Accounting for these adjustments, the value of 100% of the shares in BD Agro on 21 October 2015 was 19.7 million. Mr. Rand indirectly owned 75.87% of BD Agro's shares, through Rand Investments (in which he had a 100% shareholding) and Sembi (in which he held a 97.5% shareholding), resulting in a valuation of EUR 14,572,730. To this figure, interest should be added at 6-month average EURIBOR + 2%, compounded semi-annually until the date of payment (see above, \u00a7706).\n\n[\u2026]\n\n717. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n[\u2026]\n\nd. ORDERS the Respondent to pay EUR 14,572,730 to Mr. William Rand, together with interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, until the date of payment\".8\n\nAward, \u00a7\u00a7706-708, 717\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal thus applied the principle of full reparation to determine the damages payable to Mr. Rand as a result of Serbia's breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT. Pursuant to that principle, Serbia was to compensate Mr. Rand's loss caused by Serbia's breach as well as the \"time value of money\", i.e. interest on that amount.\n\n32.\n\nIt is clear from the description of the amounts owed to Mr. Rand that the Tribunal considered that interest would run from the date of the breach. Paragraph 707 contains a table that refers to the value of BD Agro \"[a]t 21 October 2015\", and later states that the \"[n]et asset value of BD Agro at 21 October 2015 / value of 100% shares in BD Agro at 21 October 2015\" after adjustments was EUR 19.7 million. Paragraph 708 then calculates the amounts owed to Mr. Rand for his shareholding in BD Agro, which is said to be EUR 14,572,730. The same paragraph continues with the words \"[t]o this figure, interest should be added (emphasis added)\" and thereafter specifies the applicable interest rate (\"6-month average EURIBOR + 2%, compounded semi-annually\") and the end date (\"until the date of payment\").\n\n33.\n\nThe statement that interest must be added to \"this figure\", which is the value on 21 October 2015, makes clear that interest was to accrue from the date of the breach, i.e. 21 October 2015. While there can be no doubt on the meaning of the Award, it is true that the Award does not express such meaning in so many words. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to supplement the Award by expressly stating that interest accrues from 21 October 2015.\n\n34.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal could dispense with addressing the other objections that the Respondent has raised against the issuance of a supplementary decision. For the sake of completeness, it will briefly examine these objections.\n\n35.\n\nSerbia argues that the Claimants did not seek interest from the date of breach in their submissions and that a decision granting interest from that date would extend beyond the Claimants' prayers for relief and thus be impermissible.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants and their quantum expert, Mr. Hern, consistently calculated interest from the date of breach, i.e. 21 October 2015,9 as did the Respondent's quantum expert, Mr. Cowan.10 It is true that, in the prayers for relief in their first post-hearing brief, the Claimants sought interest from 27 September 2021 and not from the date of breach.11 However, like in prior versions of the Claimants' requests for relief, the interest accrued up to the post-hearing brief was part of the amount of compensation claimed in that brief and only the interest for the time thereafter until payment was claimed as a separate item.12 In other words, the Claimants requested a damage award that covered interest from 21 October 2015 until payment. By contrast, to avoid granting interest on interest, the Award granted compensation without aggregating interest to the principal sum and awarded interest separately from the date of breach until payment. In sum, the Claimants have always computed interest from the date of the breach and by supplementing the Award as mentioned above, the Tribunal only grants relief sought by the Claimants.\n\nExpert Report of Dr. Richard Hern, 16 January 2019 (\"Hern ER I\"), \u00a7\u00a7170, 177; Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, 16 January 2019, \u00a7597; Second Expert Report of Richard Hern, 3 October 2019 (\"Hern ER II\"), \u00a741; Claimants' Reply, 4 October 2019, \u00a71450; Exh. CE-908, Hern's updated analysis.\n\nExpert Report of Sandy Cowan, 19 April 2019, Appendix 8, p. 77.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, 27 September 2021, \u00a7353(h), quoted at \u00a7181 of the Award.\n\nSee table 7.10 in Hern ER I and table 5.6 in Hern ER II. With their first post-hearing brief, the Claimants filed Exhibit C-908, which is an Excel sheet updating Mr. Hern's earlier damage calculations. That Excel sheet has a sub-file entitled \"[i]nterest\" which shows that interest included in Mr. Hern's updated damage figure runs until 27 September 2021.\n\n37.\n\nSerbia also argues that the Award's silence on the date from which interest runs, coupled with the provisions of the BIT and international law, should lead the Tribunal to hold that interest accrues 120 days after the issuance of the Award'\n\n38.\n\nThe foregoing discussion shows that the Award is not silent on the time when the interest starts running, as that time is implied in the Tribunal's analysis. In any event, even if the Award were silent on the date from which interest accrues (*quod non*), it held that Serbia was to provide full reparation to the Claimants for the loss caused by the breach of the Canada-Serbia BIT, including the \"time value of money\". As Mr. Rand was deprived of his asset at the time of the breach, the remediation of the loss linked to the time value of money can only be achieved if the interest computation commences when the breach occurred. Several investment tribunals have applied the principle of full reparation in the same fashion.13\n\nSee for e.g. *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, \u00a7440, Exh. CLA-39; *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 11 June 2012, \u00a7\u00a7141-156, 305, 1036, 1040, 1051, 1279, Annex-1 to the Request; *Deutsche Telekom AG v. The Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2014-10, Final Award, 27 May 2020, \u00a7\u00a7318, 357, Annex-2 to the Request; *Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6, Award, 27 August 2019, \u00a7\u00a71575, 1616, 1618, 1687(4), Exh. CLA-128 and other authorities cited by the Claimants (Reply, fn. 30).\n\n39.\n\nMoreover, even if the Tribunal had not referred to the principle of full reparation (*quod non*), neither the terms of the Canada-Serbia BIT nor international law support Serbia's argument that interest should accrue 120 days after the date of the Award. Article 33(1) of the BIT requires the Tribunal to decide the issues in dispute in accordance with the Treaty terms and international law. First, in respect of the Treaty terms, Article 35(2) of the BIT allows the Tribunal to award \"monetary damages and any applicable interest\". Article 36(2) provides that a disputing party must comply with an award \"without delay\" and Article 36(3) provides that an ICSID award can be enforced 120 days after its issuance. None of these or other provisions of the BIT specifies the date from which interest accrues. Second, turning to international law, Article 38(2) of the ILC Articles which the Respondent invokes, merely stipulates that \"interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled\", without giving any further indication.\n\n40.\n\nWhen arguing that interest should start to run 120 days after the Award was rendered, Serbia conflates the time for complying with an award and the time for enforcing it. With respect to the first, the BIT provides for compliance \"without delay\". By contrast, under the BIT, the enforcement of an award can start either 120 days after issuance for ICSID awards or 90 days for non-ICSID awards.14 If \u2013 as Serbia argues \u2013 the time for compliance and enforcement coincides, then one does not understand how the enforcement time can differ for ICSID and other awards, and the Respondent offers no explanation.\n\nArticle 36(3) of the Canada-Serbia BIT, CLA-1 (\"A disputing party may not seek enforcement of a final award until: (a) in the case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention: (i) 120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered [\u2026] (b) in the case of a final award under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: (i) 90 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered [\u2026]\".).\n\n41.\n\nMore importantly, Serbia's argument does not address the reparation of the loss caused by the non-availability of the money from the date of the breach to the date when the interest begins accruing. If Serbia's position were accepted, Mr. Rand would not be compensated for that loss, which would be contrary to the principle of full reparation.\n\n42.\n\nIn light of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal grants the Request and specifies that interest accrues from the date of breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 6(1) of the Canada-Serbia BIT, i.e. from 21 October 2015.\n\n43.\n\nWithout prejudice to his position concerning the Award, as it was set out in his dissenting opinion, Professor Kohen subscribes to the reasoning of the present decision.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n44.\n\nEach Party seeks an award of all costs incurred in connection with the Request.\n\n45.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions, and taking into account that the Award did not expressly state that interest would accrue from the date of breach and that both Parties benefit from the clarity brought by this decision, the Tribunal finds it fair and appropriate that each Party bear its own legal and other costs (including, for the Claimants, the USD 10,000 lodging fee) and 50% of the Tribunal's fees and expenses.\n\n46.\n\nThe costs incurred by the Tribunal in addressing the Request for a Supplementary Decision are as follows:15\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Tribunal's Fees and Expenses:** |\n| Gabrielle Kaufman-Kohler: | USD | 10,747.38 |\n| Baiju Vasani | USD | 5,000.00 |\n| Marcelo Kohen: | USD | 5,000.00 |\n| **Assistant's Fees and Expenses:** |  |  |\n| Rahul Donde: | USD | 4,025.00 |\n| **TOTAL:** | **USD** | **24,772.38** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement in due course.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n47.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\na. SUPPLEMENTS paragraph 717(d) of the Award to read as follows:\n\n\"ORDERS the Respondent to pay EUR 14,572,730 to Mr. William Rand, together with interest at the average EURIBOR for 6 months deposits plus 2% per annum, compounded semi-annually, *from 21 October 2015* until the date of payment;\"\n\nb. ORDERS the Parties to each bear 50% of the Tribunal's fees and expenses incurred in relation to this decision, as notified by ICSID;\n\nc. ORDERS that each Party shall bear its legal fees and other costs incurred in connection with this decision; and,\n\nd. DISMISSES all remaining claims and requests for relief."}]}
