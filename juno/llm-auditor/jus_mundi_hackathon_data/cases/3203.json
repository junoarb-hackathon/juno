PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 February 2019, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or \"**Centre**\") received a request for arbitration (\"**Request for Arbitration**\") from Enel Fortuna, S.A. (\"**Enel Fortuna**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), a company incorporated in Panama. Claimant asserts that it is controlled by Italian companies Enel S.p.A. and Enel Green Power S.p.A. The Request for Arbitration asserts claims against the Republic of Panama (\"**Panama**\" or \"**Respondent**\") on the basis of Article IX of the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Panama and the Government of the Italian Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, in force on 4 October 2010 (\"**Panama-Italy BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\"). The Request for Arbitration was accompanied by exhibits C-0001 through C-0020.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to in this Award as the \"**Parties**,\" and the term \"**Party**\" is used to refer to either the Claimant or the Respondent.\n\n3.\n\nOn 7 March 2019, ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration. The Parties subsequently agreed to suspend the proceedings on 29 March 2019 and 30 April 2019, until 15 May 2019.\n\n4.\n\nIn accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Mr. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a Spanish national, President, appointed by the co-arbitrators; Dr. Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez de Coss\u00edo, a Mexican national, appointed by the Claimant; and Dr. Gavan Griffith QC, an Australian national, appointed by the Respondent. On 1 April 2020, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), on 20 May 2020, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by videoconference. On 23 June 2020, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1** embodying the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters.\n\n7.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia*, that after consulting with the Parties, the Tribunal would issue a procedural order with specific instructions for document production. On 29 June 2020, the Tribunal circulated a draft procedural order on document production, seeking the Parties comments. The Parties submitted their comments on 9 July 2020, and the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2** on 22 July 2020.\n\n8.\n\nOn 17 September 2020, Claimant filed its Memorial, accompanied by: a witness statement from Mr. Maximilian Winter Bassett, an expert report by Mr. Abdul Escobar Guevara, Exhibits C-21 to C-88, and Legal Authorities CL-1 to CL-24.\n\n9.\n\nOn 19 October 2020, Respondent filed a Notice of Intended Objections and Request for Bifurcation, accompanied by: Exhibits R-0001 to R-0003 and Legal Authorities RL-0001 to\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 October 2020, the Parties notified the Tribunal of their intent to suspend the arbitral proceedings. The Parties subsequently notified the Tribunal of their intent to extend this suspension on 29 November 2020, 20 December 2020, 14 January 2021, 10 March 2021, 9 April 2021, 10 May 2021 and 14 June 2021, until 28 June 2021.\n\n**II. SETTLEMENT OF THE DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 25 June 2021, the Parties provided the Secretary General of ICSID and the Tribunal with a full and signed copy of the terms of the settlement agreement reached between the Parties (the \"**Settlement Agreement**\"). ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2) provides: \"If the parties file with the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their settlement and in writing request the Tribunal to embody such settlement in an award, the Tribunal may record the settlement in the form of its award.\" The Parties requested that the Tribunal embody the settlement in an Award, which will result in the formal and permanent discontinuance of the ICSID proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nOn 30 June 2021, the Parties jointly wrote to the Tribunal observing that they had identified that the sixth recital (\"Whereas\") of their Settlement Agreement contained a ministerial error. The Parties observed that the error was \"not substantive in nature\" but requested that the Tribunal's Award recorded that the correct recital should read as follows:\n\n[English] \"On 19 May 2020, the plenary Supreme Court dismissed the constitutionality claim, but left pending the administrative challenge to Cabinet Resolution No. 41 and the Compensation Agreement.\"\n\n[Spanish] \"Que el Pleno de la Corte Suprema de Justicia desestim\u00f3 la Acci\u00f3n de inconstitucionalidad mediante fallo de 19 de mayo de 2020, quedando pendiente de resoluci\u00f3n judicial la Acci\u00f3n Contenciosa Administrativa de Nulidad presentada por la Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, contra la Resoluci\u00f3n de Gabinete No. 41 y el Acuerdo Compensatorio.\"\n\n13.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(2), and as requested by the Parties, shall record the Settlement Agreement in the form of an Award.\n\n**III. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n14.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal unanimously decides that the Settlement Agreement constitutes an integral part of this Award, and it is hereby incorporated as **Annex A** (taking into account the Parties' clerical correction recorded *supra* paragraph 12).\n\n**SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA AND ENEL FORTUNA, S.A. IN ICSID CASE NO. ARB/19/5**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nThis Settlement Agreement **(\"Settlement Agreement\")** is made and entered into by the Republic of Panama **(\"Panama\"),** represented by Eli Whitney Debevoise II of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, duly authorized as a legal representative in ICSID Case No. ARB/19/5; and Enel Fortuna, S.A. **(\"Enel Fortuna\")** a company duly constituted under the laws of Panama, represented by Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Garcia Cueto of Clifford Chance LLP, duly authorized through a special power of attorney dated 22 June 2021 in ICSID Case No. ARB/19/5 \u2014 collectively referred to as the **\"Parties.\"**\n\n**WHEREAS**\n-----------\n\n[2].\n\nOn 31 March 2014, by means of Cabinet Resolution No. 41 of 31 March 2014, the Panamanian Cabinet authorized the execution of a compensation agreement with Enel Fortuna **(\"Compensation Agreement\");**\n\n[3].\n\nThe Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) signed the Compensation Agreement with Enel Fortuna on behalf of the State;\n\n[4].\n\nPayments were made to Enel Fortuna under the Compensation Agreement in the years 2014 and 2015; however, in 2015, the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic **(\"Comptroller\")** submitted a request for opinion to the Supreme Court of Justice **(\"Supreme Court\"),** challenging the constitutionality of Cabinet Resolution No. 41 of March 31, 2014 **(\"Cabinet Resolution No. 41\") ;** in 2017, the Comptroller lodged both constitutional and administrative complaints, requesting the nullification of Cabinet Resolution No. 41; and, in the wake of such challenges, the Panamanian State suspended payments to Enel Fortuna under the Compensation Agreement;\n\n[5].\n\nOn 21 February 2019, Enel Fortuna submitted a Request for Arbitration **(\"Request for Arbitration\")** to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"),** pursuant to the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Panama and the Government of the Italian Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments;\n\n[6].\n\nOn 7 March 2019, ICSID registered Enel Fortuna\u2019s Request for Arbitration, and indicated that the parties should constitute an Arbitral Tribunal;\n\n[7].\n\nOn 19 May 2019, the plenary Supreme Court dismissed the constitutionality claim, but left pending the administrative challenge to Cabinet Resolution No. 41 and the Compensation Agreement;\n\n[8].\n\nOn 1 April 2020, an ICSID tribunal was constituted, consisting of arbitrators Prof. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (President), Dr. Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez de Coss\u00edo (Co-Arbitrator), and Dr. Gavan Griffith, QC (Co-Arbitrator) (the **\"Tribunal\");**\n\n[9].\n\nOn 3 April 2020, ICSID requested that Enel Fortuna and Panama each make an advance payment to ICSID of USD 200,000.00;\n\n[10].\n\nOn 28 April 2020, Enel Fortuna made a payment to ICSID of USD 200,000.00;\n\n[11].\n\nOn 3 August 2020, Panama made a payment to ICSID of USD 199,000.00;\n\n[12].\n\nOn 17 September 2020, Enel Fortuna submitted to the Tribunal a Memorial in support of its claims **(\"Memorial\");**\n\n[13].\n\nOn 19 October 2020, Panama submitted a Notice of Intended Objections and Request for Bifurcation of the ICSID proceeding;\n\n[14].\n\nOn 30 October 2020 the Parties agreed to suspend the arbitration proceeding to engage in settlement discussions, and notified the Tribunal of the suspension;\n\n[15].\n\nThe Parties agreed, through their legal representatives \u2014 by means of written exchanges dated 29 November 2020, 20 December 2020, 14 January 2021, 10 March 2021, 9 April 2021, 10 May 2021, and 14 June 2021 \u2014 to extend the suspension through 28 June 2021;\n\n[16].\n\nThe possibility of the parties reaching a settlement agreement during the arbitration proceeding is contemplated by ICSID Arbitration Rule 43, and thus the consideration and conclusion of an amicable resolution is appropriate at this stage of the arbitration proceeding (resolution of a bifurcation request); the above-mentioned rule provides that if the Parties submit to the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their settlement, and request in writing that the Tribunal embody such settlement in an award, the Tribunal may do so for the purpose of conferring binding force on the settlement agreement as a final and definitive award under the terms of the ICSID Convention;\n\n[17].\n\nBy means of Cabinet Resolution No. 4 of 12 January 2021, authorization was granted to negotiate a settlement with Enel Fortuna, for the purposes of bringing the arbitration before ICSID to an end;\n\n[18].\n\nBy means of this same resolution, the MEF was authorized to carry out the steps needed to obtain the budgetary funds needed to fulfill this Settlement Agreement;\n\n[19].\n\nOn 18 May 2021, the Comptroller requested the withdrawal of the administrative challenge filed against Cabinet Resolution 41 and the Compensation Agreement;\n\n[20].\n\nOn 9 June 2021, the Attorney General of Panama issued a favorable opinion of the Settlement Agreement;\n\n[21].\n\nThe Parties wish to finally and irrevocably settle the dispute between them;\n\n[22].\n\n**NOW THEREFORE,** the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. Enel Fortuna hereby irrevocably and permanently withdraws its Request for Arbitration.\n\n2. Enel Fortuna hereby releases and forever discharges Panama from any claim based on the Compensation Agreement and from damages caused, up to the signature date of this Settlement Agreement, by the regulatory measures that form the basis of the claims contained in the Request for Arbitration and Memorial.\n\n3. Panama hereby releases and forever discharges Enel Fortuna and its shareholders from any claim based on the Compensation Agreement.\n\n4. In consideration of Enel Fortuna\u2019s withdrawal of its Request for Arbitration, Panama shall make a payment of US$ 15,500,000.00 to Enel Fortuna.\n\n5. Enel Fortuna and Panama shall each bear their own legal fees and expenses.\n\n6. US$ 1,000 of the funds remaining on deposit with ICSID shall first be returned to Enel Fortuna, in recognition of the Parties\u2019 unequal deposits. The remainder of the funds on deposit with ICSID shall be returned to the Parties on an equal basis.\n\n7. The Parties hereby acknowledge that this Settlement Agreement constitutes a final and complete settlement of the dispute for the purpose of mitigating the costs and burdens of further litigation, and that nothing in the present document in any way constitutes an acknowledgment or admission of liability.\n\n8. Within 5 working days of the entry into force of the present Settlement Agreement, the Parties agree to submit such Agreement to the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 43(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and to request that the Tribunal embody the Agreement in an award **(\"Award\"),** which will be final and definitive, binding and executable under the terms of the ICSID Convention. If this request is not submitted by common agreement within 5 days from the signing of this Settlement Agreement, either party may submit it to the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n9. Panama shall make full and final payment to Enel Fortuna no later than 6 months following the date of dispatch of the Award to the Parties. Panama shall pay the interest rate contemplated in Article 223 of the Panama Commercial Code, compounded semiannually, on any amount owed after 6 months from the date the Award is sent to the Parties.\n\n10. The Parties submit to the jurisdiction of ICSID for any dispute or controversy arising out of or related to this Settlement Agreement.\n\n11. This Settlement Agreement is made in Spanish and English, both versions being equally authentic."}]}
