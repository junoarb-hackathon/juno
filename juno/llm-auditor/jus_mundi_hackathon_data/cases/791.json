INTRODUCTION\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nThis dispute arises out of litigation brought against the first Claimant, the Loewen Group, Inc (\u2019TLGI\u2019) and Loewen Group International, Inc (\u2018LGII\u2019), its principal United States subsidiary, in Mississippi State Court by Jeremiah O'Keefe Sr., his son and various companies owned by the O\u2019Keefe family (collectively called \u2018O\u2019Keefe\u2019). The litigation arose out of a commercial dispute between O\u2019Keefe and the Loewen companies which are competitors in the funeral home and funeral insurance business in Mississippi. The dispute concerned three contracts between O\u2019Keefe and the Loewen companies said to be valued by O\u2019Keefe at $980,000 and an exchange of two O\u2019Keefe funeral homes said to be worth $2.5 million for a Loewen insurance company worth $4 million approximately.\n\n2.\n\nThe Mississippi jury awarded O\u2019Keefe $500 million damages, including $75 million damages for emotional distress and $400 million punitive damages: The verdict was the outcome of a seven-week trial in which, according to the Claimants, the trial judge repeatedly allowed O\u2019Keefe\u2019s attorneys to make extensive irrelevant and highly prejudicial references (i) to the Claimants\u2019 foreign nationality (which was contrasted to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Mississippi roots); (ii) race-based distinctions between O\u2019Keefe and the Loewen companies; and (iii) class-based distinctions between the Loewen companies (which were portrayed as large wealthy corporations) and O\u2019Keefe (who was portrayed as running family-owned businesses). Further, according to the Claimants, after permitting those references, the trial judge refused to give an instruction to the jury stating clearly that nationality-based, racial and class-based discrimination was impermissible.\n\n3.\n\nThe Loewen companies sought to appeal the $500 million verdict and judgment but were confronted with the application of an appellate bond requirement. Mississippi law requires an appeal bond for 125% of the judgment, but allows the bond to be reduced or dispensed with for \u2018good cause\u2019.\n\n4.\n\nDespite the Claimants\u2019 claim that there was good cause to reduce the appeal bond, the Mississippi Supreme Court refused to reduce the appeal bond at all and required the Loewen companies to post a $625 million bond within seven days in order to pursue its appeal without facing immediate execution of the judgment. According to the Claimants, that decision effectively foreclosed the Loewen companies\u2019 appeal rights.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Loewen companies were then forced to settle the case \u2018under extreme duress\u2019. Other alternatives to settlement were said to be catastrophic and/or unavailable. On January 29, 1996, with execution against their Mississippi assets scheduled to start the next day, the Loewen companies entered into a settlement with O'Keefe under which they agreed to pay $175 million.\n\n6.\n\nIn this claim the Claimants seek compensation for damage inflicted upon TLGI and LGII and for damage to the second Claimant\u2019s interests as a direct result of alleged violations of Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u2018NAFTA\u2019) committed primarily by the State of Mississippi in the course of the litigation.\n\nII. THE PARTIES\n---------------\n\n7.\n\nThe first Claimant TLGI is a Canadian corporation which carries on business in Canada and the United States. The second Claimant is Raymond Loewen, a Canadian citizen who was the founder of TLGI and its principal shareholder and chief executive officer.\n\n8.\n\nRaymond Loewen submits his claim as \u2018the investor of a party\u2019 on behalf of TLGI under NAFTA, Article 1117.\n\n9.\n\nIn these proceedings, until June 1, 1999 the Claimants were represented and from that date the first Claimant has been represented by:\n\nMr Christopher F. Dugan Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue   \nMr James A. Wilderotter Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue   \nMr Gregory A. Castanias Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue\n\nFrom June 21, 1999 the second Claimant has been represented by:\n\nMr John H. Lewis, Jr. Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent is the Government of the United States of America. It has been represented by:\n\nMr Kenneth L. Doroshow U.S. Department ot Justice   \nMr Mark A. Clodfelter U.S. Department of State   \nMr Barton Legum U.S. Department of State\n\n11.\n\nThe Government of Canada on September 7, 2000 and the Government of Mexico on September 7, 2000 gave written notice of their intention to attend the hearing on competence and jurisdiction.\n\n12.\n\nCanada has been represented by:\n\nMr Fulvio Fracassi, Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, Canada\n\n13.\n\nMexico has been represented by:\n\nMr Hugo Perezcano Diaz, Secretaria de Commercio y Fomento Industrial (SECOFI), Mexico City, Mexico\n\nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n-----------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn July 29, 1998 the Claimants delivered to the Respondent a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration in accordance with NAFTA, Article 1119. On October 30, 1999 the Claimants delivered to the Respondent a written consent and waiver in compliance with NAFTA, Article 1121(2)(a) and (b).\n\n15.\n\nOn July 29, 1998, and pursuant to NAFTA, Article 1120, the Claimants filed their Notice of Claim with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018ICSID\u2019) and requested the Secretary-General of ICSID to approve and register its application and to permit access to the ICSID Additional Facility.\n\n16.\n\nOn November 19, 1998, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that the requirements of Article 4(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules had been fulfilled and that the Claimants' access to the Additional Facility was approved. The Secretary-General of ICSID issued a Certificate of Registration of the Notice of Claim on the same day.\n\n17.\n\nOn March 17, 1999 the Tribunal was constituted. The Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that the Tribunal was \u2018deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun\u2019 on March 17.1999, and that Ms Margrete Stevens, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. All subsequent written communications between the Tribunal and the parties were made through the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n18.\n\nOn April 6, 1999, the Respondent filed an objection that the dispute is not within the competence of the Tribunal. The Respondent requested that the objection be dealt with by the Tribunal as a preliminary question and that the parties be given an opportunity to brief the issue in accordance with a separate schedule pursuant to Article 38 of the Additional Facility Rules.\n\n19.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held, with the parties\u2019 agreement, in Washington D.C. on May 18, 1999. In accordance with Article 21 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (\u2018the Rules\u2019), the Tribunal determined, with the agreement of the parties, that the place of arbitration would be Washington D.C.\n\n20.\n\nThe President noted the parties\u2019 agreement that the quorum for sittings of the Tribunal would be constituted by all three of its members. It was also noted that the Tribunal could take decisions by correspondence among its members, or by any other appropriate means of communication, provided that all members were consulted. Decisions of the Tribunal would be taken by the majority of its members.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal made the following orders:\n\n(1) The Claimants to file their memorial by Monday, July 19, 1999.\n\n(2) Respondent to file its memorial on competence and jurisdiction, if any, stating the grounds of its objection, by Wednesday, August 18.1999.\n\n(3) Following receipt of the Respondent\u2019s memorial on competence and jurisdiction, if any, the Tribunal will rule whether the objection to jurisdiction and competence will be determined as a preliminary matter or joined to the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal reserves the right to call for a written response from the Claimants before giving its decision on the question whether competence and jurisdiction will be determined as a preliminary matter or otherwise.\n\n(4) The Respondent to file its counter-memorial on the merits within 60 days after either the Respondent\u2019s not filing a memorial on competence and jurisdiction within the time limited or the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the objection to jurisdiction and competence shall be joined to the merits.\n\n(5) Having regard to the statement made by the Claimants\u2019 counsel the Respondent shall be entitled to reasonable discovery within the time limit for the filing of its counter-memorial but that entitlement shall be exercised only for the purpose of the Respondent formulating its memorial on jurisdiction and competence and its counter-memorial.\n\n22.\n\nOn 6 July 1999 the Tribunal confirmed that, by subsequent agreement *of* the parties,\n\n(1) the Claimants were to file their memorial by Monday, October 18.1999; and\n\n(2) the Respondent was to file its memorial on jurisdiction and competence, if any, by Friday, December 18.1999.\n\n23.\n\nEach Claimant through its attorneys has filed its own memorial, written submission and final submission on competence and jurisdiction, and has made its own submissions.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 26, 1999, the Respondent requested that all filings in this matter, not excluding the minutes of proceedings, be treated as open and available to the public. The Claimants agreed that the minutes and other filings should be publicly available but only after the matter is concluded.\n\n25.\n\nOn September 28, 1999, the Tribunal delivered its Decision on the Respondent\u2019s request for a ruling on disclosure. By its Decision the Tribunal noted that Article 44(2) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides that the minutes kept of all hearings pursuant to Article 44(1) \u2018shall not be published without the consent of the parties\u2019. The Tribunal pointed out that this prohibition is primarily directed to the Tribunal but was understood in the *Metalclad* Arbitration (ICSID Case ARB(AF)/97/1) Decision as being directed to the parties as well. The Tribunal went on to deny the Respondent's request to the extent that it sought to bring about a situation in which the Tribunal or the Secretariat makes available to the public all filings in this case.\n\n26.\n\nIn its Decision the Tribunal rejected the Claimants\u2019 submission that each party is under a general obligation of confidentiality in relation to the proceedings. The Tribunal stated that in an arbitration under NAFTA, it is not to be supposed that, in the absence of express provision, the Convention or the Rules and Regulations impose a general obligation on the parties, the effect of which would be to preclude a Government (or the other party) from discussing the case in public, thereby depriving the public of knowledge and information concerning government and public affairs. The Decision concluded by repeating the comment made by the Metalclad Tribunal, namely that it would be of advantage to the orderly unfolding of the arbitral process if during the proceedings the parties were to limit public discussion to what is considered necessary.\n\n27.\n\nOn November 1, 1999, the Respondent requested a further extension of time until February 18, 2000, within which to file its memorial on competence and jurisdiction. The request, which was opposed by the Claimants, was granted by the Tribunal on December 9, 1999. At the same time the Tribunal dealt with an application by the Respondent for further and better discovery. While rejecting the Respondent\u2019s submission that there had been a waiver by the Claimants of attorney-client privilege, the Tribunal ordered that the Respondent was entitled to discovery of the attorney-client communications of the Claimants or either of them relating directly to the issue of duress.\n\n28.\n\nOn February 14, 2000, the first Claimant sought clarification of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of September 28, 1999, relating to confidentiality. The request followed the release by the Respondent on January 10, 2000 of materials relating to the arbitration, including \u2018the minutes of the May 18, 1999 hearing before the Tribunal as well as the audio recording of that hearing\u2019. The Respondent interpreted the Decision as merely limiting the right *of the* Tribunal or the Secretariat to release information, not the right of the parties themselves to release information. On the other hand, the first Claimant interpreted the Decision as restricting the right of the parties to disclose minutes and related material. By its Decision on June 2, 2000 the Tribunal affirmed the correctness of the first Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the Decision on September 28, 1999, stating that the Convention and the Rules prohibit publication by the Tribunal and the parties of the minutes and a full record of the hearing and any order made by the Tribunal. However, the Decision of June 2, 2000 stated that neither it nor the earlier Decision was intended to affect or qualify, or could affect or qualify, any statute-imposed obligation of disclosure by which any party to the arbitration might be bound.\n\n29.\n\nBy its Decision of June 2, 2000, the Tribunal also dealt with an application by the Respondent for further and better discovery, in particular relating to documents and information reflecting the advice and conclusions of the Claimants and their advisers during the Mississippi proceedings concerning alternatives to settlement of the Mississippi litigation. The Tribunal ordered the Claimants to produce all information in the possession of the Claimants, their counsel or others who acted on their behalf that relates directly to the question whether Loewen had alternatives to entering into the Mississippi settlement. The Tribunal stated that information ordered to be produced should include commitments from lenders for financing the Loewen Group\u2019s ongoing operations in anticipation of the possible reorganization filing and draft petitions for the purpose of seeking possible relief from the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s bonding decision in the US federal courts and the Supreme Court. The documents were to be produced within twenty-one (21) days of June 2, 2000.\n\nIV. THE  NATURE OF  THE CLAIMANTS'  CLAIM\n-----------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case is that\n\n(i) the trial court, by admitting extensive anti-Canadian and pro-American testimony and prejudicial counsel comment, violated Article 1102 of NAFTA which bars discrimination against foreign investors and their investments;\n\n(ii) the discrimination tainted the inexplicably large verdict;\n\n(iii) the trial court, by permitting extensive nationality-based, racial and class-based testimony and counsel comments, violated Article 1105 of NAFTA which imposes a minimum standard of treatment for investments of foreign investors;\n\n(iv) the excessive verdict and judgment (even apart from the discrimination) violated Article 1105;\n\n(v) the Mississippi courts\u2019 arbitrary application of the bonding requirement violated Article 1105; and\n\n(vi) the discriminatory conduct, the excessive verdict, the denial of the Loewen companies\u2019 right to appeal and the coerced settlement violated Article 1110 of NAFTA, which bars the uncompensated appropriation of investments of foreign investors.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent is liable for Mississippi\u2019s NAFTA breaches under Article 105, which requires that the Parties to NAFTA shall ensure that all necessary measures are taken to give effect to the provisions of the Agreement, including their observance by State and provincial governments. The Claimants also allege that, by tolerating the misconduct which occurred during the O\u2019Keefe litigation, the Respondent directly breached Article 1105, which imposes affirmative duties on the Respondent to provide \u2018tuff protection and security\u2019 to investments of foreign investors, including \u2018full protection and security\u2019 against third-party misconduct.\n\nV. THE RESPONDENT'S OBJECTION TO COMPETENCE AND JURISDICTION\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBy its Memorial on Competence and Jurisdiction, the Respondent objected to the competence and jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the following grounds:\n\n(i) the claim is not arbitrable because the judgments of domestic courts in purely private disputes are not \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 within the scope of NAFTA Chapter II;\n\n(ii) the Mississippi court judgments complained of are not \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 and cannot give rise to a breach of Chapter Eleven as a matter of law because they were not final acts of the United States judicial system;\n\n(iii) a private agreement to settle a litigation matter out of court is not a government \u2018measure\u2019 within the scope of NAFTA Chapter II;\n\n(iv) the Mississippi trial court\u2019s alleged failure to protect against the alien-based, racial and class-based references cannot be a \u2018measure\u2019 because Loewen never objected to such references during the trial; and\n\n(v) Raymond Loewen\u2019s Article 1117 claims should be dismissed because he does not \u2018own or control\u2019 the enterprise at issue.\n\n33.\n\nEach of the Claimants filed submissions in answer to the Respondent\u2019s objections contesting each of the grounds of objection advanced by the Respondent. The Respondent filed its final submissions in reply. The Claimants then filed submissions in response.\n\n34.\n\nThe hearing on the Respondent\u2019s objection to competence and jurisdiction took place in Washington D.C. on September 20, 21 and 22, 2000.\n\n35.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the oral hearing, pursuant to an order made by the Tribunal, the Government of Mexico filed, on October 16, 2000, submissions concerning certain matters of interpretation of NAFTA which addressed the effect of Article 1121, the meaning of the word \u2018measure\u2019, the rights of an investor to advance a claim under Article 1117 and the decisions in *Azinian* v *United Mexican States* Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2; 14 ICSID Review-FILJ 538 and *Metalclad v United Mexican States* Case No. ARB(AF) 97/1 which were referred to in oral argument by the disputing parties.\n\n36.\n\nThe disputing parties responded to Mexico\u2019s submission by filing written submissions pursuant to the order made by the Tribunal at the conclusion of the oral hearing on September 22, 2000. It will be convenient to refer to Mexico\u2019s submissions when we consider the Respondent\u2019s grounds of objection.\n\n37.\n\nIn determining the Respondent's objection, it is proper to look at the Claimants\u2019 notice of claim for it is by the Notice of Claim itself and the request for arbitration that the Claimants submit their claim to arbitration under Articles 1116 and 1117 of NAFTA. It has not been suggested that there is in this case any material difference between the nature of the claim formulated in the Notice of Claim and that formulated in the Memorials filed by the Claimants.\n\n38.\n\nNo distinction has been drawn in the submissions of the disputing parties between the concepts of competence and jurisdiction. The ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules make specific provision for objections to \u2018competence\u2019 (Article 46) but make no such provision for objections to \u2018jurisdiction\u2019. Article 46 has been applied on the footing that it extends to objections which go to jurisdiction as well as objections going to the constitution and composition of the Tribunal.\n\nVI. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S FIRST GROUND OF OBJECTION: WHETHER JUDICIAL ACTS IN LITIGATION BETWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES ARE \u2018MEASURES\u2019 REGULATED BY NAFTA?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nArticle 1101 (1) of NAFTA provides:\n\n'This Chapter [Eleven] applies to measures adopted or maintained by a party' relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party;\n\n40.\n\nArticle 201 defines \u2018measure\u2019 as including \u2018any taw, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\u2019. The breadth of this inclusive definition, notably the references to \u2018law, procedure, requirement or practice\u2019, is inconsistent with the notion that judicial action is an exclusion from the generality of the expression \u2018measures\u2019. \u2018Law\u2019 comprehends judge-made as well as statute-based rules. \u2018Procedure\u2019 is apt to include judicial as well as legislative procedure. \u2018Requirement\u2019 is capable of covering a court order which requires a party to do an act or to pay a sum of money, while \u2018practice\u2019 is capable of denoting the practice of courts as well as the practice of other bodies.\n\n41.\n\nArticle 1019(1), which requires each Party to promptly publish any law, regulation, precedential judicial decision, administrative ruling of general application and any procedure... regarding government procurement\u2019 differs from the definition of \u2018measure\u2019 in Article 201, which contains no explicit reference to judicial decisions. While Article 1019(1) is directed only to the imposition of an obligation to publish rules of general application, it does not follow that this obligation should be regarded as co-extensive with the inclusive definition of \u2019measure\u2019 or as confining what the definition comprehends. Although Article 1019 clearly indicates that a precedential judicial decision is not only a \u2018measure\u2019 but also a measure \u2018adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019, the Article is consistent with the Respondent\u2019s submission that \u2018measures\u2019 does not extend to every judicial action.\n\n42.\n\nOther NAFTA provisions indicate that judicial action is not beyond the reach of the word \u2018measures\u2019. Article 1716, in requiring a NAFTA Party to provide \u2018that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order prompt and effective provisional measures\u2019 to prevent infringement of intellectual property rights, recognises that judicial orders may constitute \u2018measures\u2019. Article 1715 requires a Party to provide specified \u2018civil judicial procedures\u2019 for the enforcement of intellectual property rights. These \u2018procedures\u2019 extend to the making of a variety of judicial orders, including final judgments (Article 1715(2)). Article 1701(1) is concerned to ensure that \u2018measures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate trade\u2019. Plainly \u2019measures\u2019 there includes the judicial procedures in Article 1715 i.e. judicial orders. See also Article 1715(2)(f) (where the reference to \u2018measures... taken\u2019 must be understood as referring to judicial acts, including injunctions and other enforcement procedures).\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent concedes that when a government entity is involved in a domestic court proceeding, it may be that, in appropriate circumstances, a resulting court judgment constitutes a \u2018measure adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019. This concession is at odds with the argument that the failure to mention \u2018judicial order\u2019 or \u2018judgment\u2019 in Article 201 signifies an intention to confine \u2018measures\u2019 to legislative and executive actions. In general, where the meaning of \u2018measures\u2019 is so confined, the restricted meaning arises from an express limitation or an implied limitation arising from the context. No such limitation is to be found in Article 201.\n\n44.\n\nNor can \u2018measures\u2019 be confined to provisional or interim judicial acts as distinct from final judicial acts. Such a distinction finds support neither in Article 1701 nor Chapter 10 of NAFTA (which applies to \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to procurement\u2019). The reference in Article 1019(1) to 'precedential judicial decision\u2019 which is one instance of a measure \u2018adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019, is to a final decision as well as a provisional decision. See also Annex 1010.1 B paras 2 and 3.\n\n45.\n\nThe approach which this Tribunal takes to the interpretation of \u2018measures\u2019 accords with the interpretation given to the expression in international law where it has been understood to include judicial acts. In *Regina v Pierre Bouchereau,* Case 30 77 [1977] ECR 1999, the European Court of Justice rejected the argument that \u2018measure\u2019 excludes actions of the judiciary, holding that the word embraces \u2018any action which affects the rights of persons\u2019 coming within the application of the relevant treaty provision (at 11). In the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada),* No. 96 (ICJ 4 December 1998), the International Court of Justice stated that 'in its ordinary sense the word [\u2018measure\u2019] is wide enough to cover any act, step or proceeding, and imposes no particular limit on their material content or on the aim pursued thereby\u2019 (at 66). See also *Oil Fields of Texas Inc v NIOC,* 12 Iran-US Cr Trib Rep 308 (1986) at 318-319 (where the judicial acts in question were held to be expropriations within the expression \u2018expropriations or other measures affecting property rights', thus amounting to \u2018measures affecting property rights\u2019).\n\n46.\n\nThe significance for this case of the interpretation of \u2018measures\u2019 in the context of international law is that Article 102(2) of NAFTA requires the Parties to interpret and apply its provisions \u2018in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with applicable rules of international law\u2019. Further, an interpretation of \u2018measures\u2019 which extends to judicial acts conforms to the objectives of NAFTA as set out in Article 102(1), more particularly objectives (b), (c) and (e), namely to\n\n\u2018(b) promote conditions of fair competition in the free trade area;\n\n(c) increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties;\n\n(e) create effective procedures for the implementation and application of this Agreement, for its joint administration and for the resolution of disputes\u2019.\n\n47.\n\nSuch an interpretation of the word \u2018measures\u2019 accords with the general principle of State responsibility. The principle applies to the acts of judicial as well as legislative and administrative organs. (See draft Article 4 on State Responsibility adopted by the International Law Commission and later provisionally adopted by the United Nations General Assembly Drafting Committee on its second reading, Geneva, May 1-June 9, July 10-August 18, 2000, A/CN.4/L.600, August 21, 2000.) In *Azinian v United Mexican States* Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2.14 ICSID Review-FILJ 538, the Tribunal, in rejecting the claim that there were violations of NAFTA, quoted (at 567) with approval the comments made by the former President of the International Court of Justice who, after acknowledging the reluctance in some arbitral awards of the last century to admit that the State is responsible for judicial actions, stated:\n\n\u2018... in the present century State responsibility for judicial acts came to be recognized. Although independent of Government, the judiciary is not independent of the State: the judgment given by a judicial authority emanates from an organ of the State in just the same way as a law promulgated by the legislature or a decision taken by the executive.\u2019 (Eduardo Jimenez de Arechaga, \u2018International Law in the Past Third of a Century\u2019, 159-1 Recueil des Cours (General Course in Public International Law, The Hague, 1978).\n\nThe former President went on to say that State responsibility for acts of judicial authorities may result from three types of judicial decision, the first of which is a decision of a municipal court clearly incompatible with a rule of international law. The second type is what is known traditionally as a denial of justice. The Claimants assert that the NAFTA violations of which they complain fall within these categories of judicial decision.\n\n48.\n\nThe *Azinian* Tribunal pointed out (at 568) that State responsibility for judicial decisions does not entitle a claimant to a review of national court decisions as though the international jurisdiction seised has plenary appellate jurisdiction. This is neither true generally nor for NAFTA. As the Tribunal said,\n\n\u2018What must be shown is that the court decision itself constitutes a violation of the treaty\u2019 (at 568).\n\n49.\n\nThe views expressed by the *Azinian* Tribunal were not necessary for the decision in that case because it involved no challenge to the decisions of the Mexican courts. Subject to our later consideration of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies and the rule of judicial finality, the views are nonetheless persuasive and support our view that \u2018measures\u2019 in Chapter Eleven, according to its true interpretation, does not exclude judicial acts.\n\n50.\n\nA Tribunal established pursuant to NAFTA Chapter Eleven, Section B, must decide the issues in accordance with the provisions of NAFTA and applicable rules of international law (Article 1131(1)). Further, as already noted, Article 102(2) provides that the Agreement must be interpreted in the light of its stated objectives and in accordance with applicable rules of international law. These objectives include the promotion of conditions of fair competition in the free trade area, the increase of investment opportunities and the creation of effective procedures for the resolution of disputes (Article 102(1)(b), (c) and (e)).\n\n51.\n\nGuided by these objectives and principles, we do not accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that NAFTA is to be understood in accordance with the principle that treaties are to be interpreted in deference to the sovereignty of slates, in *AMCO Asia Corp v Republic of Indonesia* 1 ICSID Reports 377 (1983) the Tribunal rejected the suggested principle (at 394, 397). Whatever the status of this suggested principle may have been in earlier times, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is the primary guide to the interpretation of the provisions of NAFTA *(Ethyl Corporation v Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction, June 24, 1998, at 55-56, 38 ILM 708 (where a NAFTA Tribunal expressly rejected the argument that Section B of Chapter 11 is to be construed strictly). See also *Pope & Talbot v Canada,* Interim Award, June 26, 2000 (where a NAFTA Tribunal adopted a broad interpretation of the expression \u2018investment\u2019 in Article 1110). NAFTA is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose (Vienna Convention, Article 31(1)). The context includes the preamble and annexes (Vienna Convention, Article 31 (2)).\n\n52.\n\nWe agree with the Respondent that not every judicial act on the part of the courts of a Party constitutes a measure \u2018adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019. Mexico submits that, in order to constitute a \u2018measure\u2019, the judicial action under consideration must have a general application. Thus a judicial affirmation of a general principle might well constitute a measure, whereas a specific order requiring a defendant to pay a sum of money would not. The definition of \u2018measure\u2019 in Article 201 (which includes \u2018requirement\u2019) is by no means consistent with this argument.\n\n53.\n\nThe question then arises whether the words \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 should be understood, as the Respondent argues, to exclude judicial acts being the judgments of domestic courts in purely private matters. The purpose of Chapter Eleven, \u2018Section B - Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of Another Party' is to establish \u2018a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures both equal treatment among investors of the Parties in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due process before an arbitral tribunal\u2019. The text, context and purpose of Chapter Eleven combine to support a liberal rather than a restricted interpretation of the words \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019, that is, an interpretation which provides protection and security for the foreign investor and its investment: see *Ethyl Corporation v Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction, June 24, 1998, 38 ILM 708, (where the NAFTA Tribunal concluded that the object and purpose of Chapter Eleven is to \u2018create effective procedures... for the resolution of disputes\u2019 and to \u2018increase substantially investment opportunities\u2019 (at 83)).\n\n54.\n\nNeither in the text or context of NAFTA nor in international law is there to be found support for the Respondent\u2019s submission that measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019, in its application to judicial acts, excludes the judgments of domestic courts in purely private disputes. Neither the definition of \u2018measure\u2019 in Article 201 nor the provisions of Chapters 10 and 17 relating to \u2018measures\u2019 and \u2018procedures\u2019 contain any indication that, in its application to judicial acts, the existence of a measure depends upon the identity of the litigants or the characterisation of the dispute as public or private. An adequate mechanism for the settlement of disputes as contemplated by Chapter Eleven must extend to disputes, whether public or private, so long as the State Party is responsible for the judicial act which constitutes the \u2018measure\u2019 complained of, and that act constitutes a breach of a NAFTA obligation, as for example a discriminatory precedential judicial decision. The principle that a State is responsible for the decisions of its municipal courts (or at least its highest court) supports the wider interpretation of the expression \u2018measure adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 rather than the restricted interpretation advanced by the Respondent.\n\n55.\n\nGenerally speaking, litigation between private parties is less likely to generate a \u2018measure adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 but, in some circumstances, private litigation may do so. In this respect, we do not regard the discussion of private litigation in *Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 580 v Dolphin Delivery Ltd* [1986] 2 SCR 572, upon which the Respondent relies, as influential in the present context. The discussion relates to s. 32(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which applies Charter provisions to the legislative, executive and administrative branches (but not the judicial branch) of government.\n\n56.\n\nAs the Claimants submit, the Mississippi trial court\u2019s judgment ordering Loewen to pay O\u2019Keefe $500 million and the Mississippi Supreme Court requirement that Loewen post a $625 million bond were \u2018requirements\u2019 within the meaning of the definition of \u2018measure\u2019 in Article 201, subject to consideration of Article 1121, the principle of finality of judicial acts and the rule of exhaustion of local remedies.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the words \u2018adopted or maintained\u2019 in Article 1101 are indicative of an intent to limit Chapter 11 to those actions that involve ratification by government. This limitation, so the Respondent submits, accords with the \u2018act of state\u2019 doctrine. That doctrine is a doctrine of municipal rather than international law. See IV. *S. Kirkpatrick & Co inc v Environmental Tectonics Corporation International* 493 US 400 (1990) at 404 (where the Court acknowledged that it had \u2018once viewed the doctrine as an expression of international law\u2019 but had more recently described it \u2018as a consequence of domestic separation of powers, reflecting the strong sense of the Judicial Branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder the conduct of foreign affairs *(Banco Nacional de Cuba* v *Sabbatino* 376 US 398,423 (1964))\u2019. No authority and no materials have been placed before us which justify the conclusion that the act of State doctrine has been adopted by sufficient countries to be considered as a rule of international law pursuant to Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. In any event, the act of State doctrine is now expressed in terms of \u2018acts of a governmental character done by a foreign state within its own territory and applicable there\u2019 (Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Laws of the United States \u00a7443(1)), without differentiating between \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018private\u2019 litigation.\n\n58.\n\nWhatever the effect of the act of State doctrine may be, Article 1105, in requiring a Party to provide full protection and security\u2019 to investments of investors, must extend to the protection of foreign investors from private parties when they act through the judicial organs of the State.\n\n59.\n\nFurther, the award of punitive damages would satisfy the public element of the Respondent\u2019s public/private dichotomy. It is generally accepted that punitive damages awards are intended to serve the public interest (D.B. Dobbs, Dobbs Law of Remedies \u00a73.11(1) at 457 (2d ed 1993).\n\n60.\n\nWe reject therefore the Respondent\u2019s objection that the Mississippi Court judgments are not \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 because they resolved a dispute between private parties.\n\nVII. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S SECOND GROUND OF OBJECTION: THE MISSISSIPPI COURT-JUDGMENTS ARE NOT 'MEASURES ADOPTED OR MAINTAINED BY A PARTY' AND CANNOT GIVE RISE TO A BREACH OF CHAPTER 11 BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT FINAL ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES JUDICIAL SYSTEM\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the expression \u2018measures adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019 must be understood in the light of the principle of customary international law that, when a claim of injury is based upon judicial action in a particular case, State responsibility only arises when there is final action by the State\u2019s judicial system as a whole. This proposition is based on the notion that judicial action is a single action from beginning to end so that the State has not spoken untit all appeals have been exhausted. In other words, the State is not responsible for the errors of its courts when the decision has not been appealed to the court of last resort. The Respondent distinguishes this substantive requirement of customary international law for a final non-appealable judicial action, when an international claim is brought to challenge judicial action, from international law\u2019s procedural requirement of exhaustion of local remedies (\u2018the local remedies rule\u2019).\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is nothing to show that in Chapter Eleven the Parties intended to derogate from this substantive rule of international law when judicial action is the basis of the claim for violation of NAFTA. To the contrary, the Respondent argues that the terms of Article 1101, \u2018adopted or maintained by a Party\u2019, incorporate the substantive rule of international law and require finality of action. Only those judicial decisions that have been accepted or upheld by the judicial system as a whole, after all available appeals have been exhausted, so the argument runs, can be said to possess that degree of finality that justifies the description \u2018adopted or maintained\\*.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 response to this argument is that Article 1121 (1)(b) of NAFTA requires an arbitral claimant to waive its local remedies, not exhaust them. This Article authorizes the filing of a Chapter 11 claim only if\n\n\u2018the investor and the enterprise waive their right to indicate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116...\u2019.\n\nThe Claimants submit, first, that \u2018the Article eliminates the necessity to exhaust local remedies provided by the host country\u2019s administrative or judicial courts\u2019. (B. Sepulveda Amor, *International Law and International Sovereignty: The NAFTA and the Claims of Mexican Jurisdiction,* 19 Houston Journal of International Law 565 at 574 (1997)). The Claimants submit, secondly, that the so-called substantive principle of finality is no different from the local remedies rule and that international tribunals have reviewed the decisions of inferior municipal courts where the exhaustion requirement has been waived or is otherwise inapplicable.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 1121(2)(b) is not a waiver provision and that it does not waive the local remedies rule or for that matter the rule of judicial finality. The Respondent acknowledges, however, that the Article relaxes the local remedies rule to a partial but limited extent, without defining or otherwise indicating what that extent is or may be.\n\n65.\n\nObservations of the NAFTA Tribunals in both *Metalclad Corporation v United Mexican States* ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/97/1 (footnote 4) and in the **Azinian Case,** to which we have referred, support the Claimants\u2019 case to the extent that it is based on Article 1121 (2)(b). But Mexico, in its written submissions to this Tribunal, points out that the *Metalclad* Tribunal which, in the relevant passage, purported to state Mexico\u2019s position in that case, did not do so accurately. Mexico also points out that, in the **Azinian Case,** as there was no complaint of any violation of NAFTA based on a judicial act, the Tribunal\u2019s observations were not necessary for its decision. Other cases retied upon by the Claimants include *G.* W. *McNear inc v United Mexican States,* Docket No. 211, Opinions of the Commissioners 68 at 71, 72 (1928) and *The Texas Company Claim,* Decision 32-B, American-Mexican Cl Rep 142 (1948), but in these cases the relevant treaty waived exhaustion.\n\n66.\n\nThere is support for the view that no distinction should be drawn between the principle of finality and the local remedies rule. Indeed, Edwin M. Borchard, The Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad 198 (1915), upon which the Respondent relies, stated:\n\n\u2018It is a fundamental principle that the acts of inferior judges or courts do not render the state internationally liable when the claimant has failed to exhaust his local means of redress by judicial appeal or otherwise, for only the highest court to which a case is appealable may be considered an authority involving the responsibility of the state\u2019.\n\nIn the *Finnish Ships Arbitration* 3 RIAA 1497 (1937) it was pointed out that exhaustion of local remedies meant that there must be a final decision of a court which is the highest in a hierarchy of courts to which the claimant can resort in the host State. Borchard is not the only commentator who regards the principle of finality and the local remedies rule as different sides of the same coin (see C.F. Amerasinghe, Local Remedies in National Law 181 (1990)). And in the *Interhandel Case* (1959) ICJ 6, the claim was dismissed expressly on the ground that Switzerland \u2018has not exhausted the local remedies available to it\u2019 (at 11, 19, 26-27). Although the case was taken by Interhandel to the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court and proceedings were still pending in that court.\n\n67.\n\nWhile the content of the two rules is similar, if not the same, the rules were thought to serve different purposes. The local remedies rule (described as \u2018procedural\u2019) was designed to ensure that the State where violation of international law occurred should have the opportunity to address it by its own means, within the framework of its own domestic legal system *{Interhandel Case* (1959) ICJ Reports 6 at 27). Most, if not all legal systems, have a self-correcting capacity. In other words, the claimant was bound to take steps to ensure that the self-correcting mechanism of the State\u2019s judicial system is fully engaged as a condition precedent to recognition of the State\u2019s responsibility for breach of its international obligation. See the Report of the International Law Commission to the United Nations General Assembly, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1975, Vol. Il, 62. Now, compliance with the local remedies rule is seen as a condition precedent to invoking the responsibility of a State for breach of an international obligation. (See Article 45 of the draft articles on State responsibility, provisionally adopted by the Drafting Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on second reading, based on the draft previously adopted by the International Law Commission (A/CN.A/L.600, August 21.2000)).\n\n68.\n\nOn the other hand, the rule of judicial finality (often described as \u2018substantive\u2019) was thought to be directed to the responsibility of the State for judicial acts. As the statement by Borchard, already quoted, makes clear, it was considered that the State was not responsible for the acts of lower courts.\n\n69.\n\nAlthough it has been said that the responsibility of the State for a breach of international law constituted by an alleged judicial action arises only when there is final action by the State\u2019s judicial system considered as a whole, it is now recognised that the judiciary is an organ of the State and that judicial action which violates a rule of international law is attributable to the State (A.V. Freeman, *The International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice,* 31-33 (1970)). The rule of judicial finality was influenced by the principles of separation, independence of the judiciary and respect for the finality of judicial decisions. However, the judiciary, though independent of Government, is not independent of the State and the judgment of a court proceeds from an organ of the State as does a decision of the executive.\n\n70.\n\nThe modern view is that conduct of an organ of the State shall be considered as an act of the State under international law, whether the organ be legislative, executive or judicial, whatever position if holds in the organisation of the State. That, in effect, is the principle expressed in draft Article 4 on State Responsibility, provisionally adopted by the Drafting Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, based on the draft previously adopted by the International Law Commission (A/CN.A/L.6O0, August 21, 2000). Although the draft has not been finally approved, it is a highly persuasive statement of the law on State Responsibility as it presently stands. Draft Article 4 accords with the view expressed by Eduardo Jimenez de Arechaga, the former President of the International Court (\u2018International Law in the Past Third of a Century\u2019, 159-1 Recueil des Cours, (General Course in Public International Law, The Hague, 1978).1\n\nCited in *Azinian* v *United Mexican States* Case No, ARB/{AF)/97/2.14 ICSID Review-FILJ at 567.\n\n71.\n\nViewed in this light, the rule of judicial finality is no different from the local remedies rule. Its purpose is to ensure that the State where the violation occurred should have an opportunity to redress it by its own means, within the framework of its own domestic legal system.\n\n72.\n\nJust as it was said that the function of the local remedies rule was to establish whether the point had been reached at which the home State may raise the issue on the international level (G. Schwarzenberger, *International Law,* 604, (1957)), now it is the function of the rule to establish that State responsibility for a breach of an international obligation may be invoked.\n\n73.\n\nWe accept that an important principle of international law should not be held to have been tacitly dispensed with by an international agreement, in the absence of words making clear an intention to do so *(Elettronica Sicula SpA (Elsi) (United States v Italy)* (1989) ICJ 15 at 42). Such an intention may, however, be exhibited by express provisions which are at variance with the continued operation of the relevant principle of international law.\n\n74.\n\nHaving reached this point in our consideration of the arguments, we have concluded that this ground of objection should be dealt with at the hearing on the merits. Our reasons for reaching this conclusion relate partly to the arguments based on Article 1121(2)(b) and Chapter Eleven and partly to other arguments advanced by the Claimants in response to the Respondent\u2019s objection. We have already mentioned the lack of specificity in the Respondent\u2019s acknowledgment that the Article partially relaxes the local remedies rute. Consideration might be given by the Respondent to the possibility of presenting an argument that Article 1121(2)(b) does no more than curtail or restrict rights that a claimant would otherwise have but for the existence of Article 1121 (2)(b). The remarks of the International Court of Justice in *Headquarters Agreement* (Advisory Opinion) ICJ Reports 12 at 29, 42-43, a decision not cited in argument, may have a bearing on the operation of Article 1121 (2)(b) and also on the Claimants\u2019 submission that an agreement to arbitrate dispenses with any obligation to have recourse to municipal courts. Another argument of the Claimants, namely that the local remedies rule has no application to denial of justice cases, is one that can conveniently be dealt with at the hearing on the merits where the argument can be considered in the context of the particular allegations by the Claimants of denial of justice on which findings can then be made. Similarly put over is consideration of the Respondent\u2019s submissions that the Loewen companies failed to pursue various local remedies which, according the Respondent, were open to them and would, if successful, have resulted in an effective remedy under municipal law. The hearing of this ground of objection should therefore stand over to the hearing on the merits.\n\nVIII. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S THIRD GROUND OF OBJECTION: THAT A PRIVATE AGREEMENT TO SETTLE A MATTER OUT OF COURT IS NOT A GOVERNMENT 'MEASURE' WITHIN THE SCOPE OF NAFTA CHAPTER ELEVEN\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThis ground of objection was not strongly pressed. In this case much turns on the circumstances in which the Mississippi proceedings came to be settled and that is a matter which must be dealt with at a hearing on the merits.\n\nIX. THE RESPONDENT'S FOURTH GROUND OF OBJECTION: THAT THE MISSISSIPPI TRIAL COURT\u2019S ALLEGED FAILURE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE ALIEN-BASED, RACIAL AND CLASS-BASED REFERENCES CANNOT BE A \u2018MEASURE\u2019 BECAUSE LOEWEN NEVER OBJECTED TO SUCH REFERENCES DURING THE TRIAL\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThis ground of objection does not, in our view, go to competence or jurisdiction. If the Respondent\u2019s case on this point is made out, it could result in a dismissal of the claim. It is an issue which appropriately and conveniently should be heard and determined at a hearing on the merits.\n\nX. THE FIFTH GROUND OF OBJECTION: RAYMOND LOEWEN\u2019S ARTICLE 1117 CLAIM SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT OWN OR CONTROL THE ENTERPRISE AT ISSUE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe objection on this ground, if upheld, would not be dispositive of the second Claimant\u2019s entire claim which is partly based on Article 1116. Further, it is far from clear that the objection goes to jurisdiction and, in any event, it is an objection which can be dealt with at the hearing on the merits. For this reason we do not consider it appropriate to decide this question on an objection to competence and jurisdiction.\n\nORDERS\n------\n\nIn the result we make the following orders:\n\n1. Dismiss the Respondent\u2019s objection to competence and jurisdiction so far as it relates to the first ground of objection.\n\n2. Adjourn the further hearing of the Respondent's other grounds of objection to competence and jurisdiction and join that further hearing to the hearing on the merits.\n\n3. The Respondent to file its counter-memorial on the merits within 60 days of the date of this Decision.\n\n4. The Claimants to file their replies within 60 days of the time limited for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n5. The Respondent to file its rejoinder within 60 days of the time limited for the filing of the Claimants\u2019 replies.\n\n6. Fix October 15, 2001 as the date of the hearing on the merits."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis is an important and extremely difficult case. Ultimately it turns on a question of jurisdiction arising from (a) the NAFTA requirement of diversity of nationality as between a claimant and the respondent government, and (b) the assignment by the Loewen Group, Inc. of its NAFTA claims to a Canadian corporation owned and controlled by a United States corporation. This question was raised by Respondent's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction filed after the oral hearing on the merits. In this Award we uphold the motion and dismiss Claimants\u2019 NAFTA claims.\n\n2.\n\nAs our consideration of the merits of the case was well advanced when Respondent filed this motion to dismiss and as we reached the conclusion that Claimants\u2019 NAFTA claims should be dismissed on the merits, we include in this Award our reasons for this conclusion. As will appear, the conclusion rests on the Claimants\u2019 failure to show that Loewen had no reasonably available and adequate remedy under United States municipal law in respect of the matters of which it complains, being matters alleged to be violations of NAFTA.\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute arises out of litigation brought against first Claimant, the Loewen Group, Inc (\"TLGI\") and the Loewen Group International, Inc (\"LGII\") (collectively called \"Loewen\"), its principal United States subsidiary, in Mississippi State Court by Jeremiah O\u2019Keefe Sr. (Jerry O\u2019Keefe), his son and various companies owned by the O\u2019Keefe family (collectively called \"O\u2019Keefe\"). The litigation arose out of a commercial dispute between O\u2019Keefe and Loewen which were competitors in the funeral home and funeral insurance business in Mississippi. The dispute concerned three contracts between O\u2019Keefe and Loewen said to be valued by O\u2019Keefe at $980,000 and an exchange of two O\u2019Keefe funeral homes said to be worth $2.5 million for a Loewen insurance company worth $4 million approximately. The action was heard by Judge Graves (an African-American judge) and a jury. Of the twelve jurors, eight were African-American.\n\n4.\n\nThe Mississippi jury awarded O\u2019Keefe $500 million damages, including $75 million damages for emotional distress and $400 million punitive damages. The verdict was the outcome of a seven-week trial in which, according to Claimants, the trial judge repeatedly allowed O\u2019Keefe\u2019s attorneys to make extensive irrelevant and highly prejudicial references (i) to Claimants\u2019 foreign nationality (which was contrasted to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Mississippi roots); (ii) race-based distinctions between O\u2019Keefe and Loewen; and (iii) class-based distinctions between Loewen (which O\u2019Keefe counsel portrayed as large wealthy corporations) and O\u2019Keefe (who was portrayed as running family-owned businesses). Further, according to Claimants, after permitting those references, the trial judge refused to give an instruction to the jury stating clearly that nationality-based, racial and class-based discrimination was impermissible.\n\n5.\n\nLoewen sought to appeal the $500 million verdict and judgment but were confronted with the application of an appellate bond requirement. Mississippi law requires an appeal bond for 125% of the judgment as a condition of staying execution on the judgment, but allows the bond to be reduced or dispensed with for \"good cause\".\n\n6.\n\nDespite Claimants\u2019 claim that there was good cause to reduce the appeal bond, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme Court refused to reduce the appeal bond at all and required Loewen to post a $625 million bond within seven days in order to pursue its appeal without facing immediate execution of the judgment. According to Claimants, that decision effectively foreclosed Loewen\u2019s appeal rights.\n\n7.\n\nClaimants allege that Loewen was then forced to settle the case \"under extreme duress\". Other alternatives to settlement were said to be catastrophic and/or unavailable. On January 29, 1996, with execution against their Mississippi assets scheduled to start the next day, Loewen entered into a settlement with O\u2019Keefe under which they agreed to pay $175 million.\n\n8.\n\nIn this claim Claimants seek compensation for damage inflicted upon TLGI and LGII and for damage to second Claimant\u2019s interests as a direct result of alleged violations of Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") committed primarily by the State of Mississippi in the course of the litigation.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n9.\n\nFirst Claimant TLGI is a Canadian corporation which carries on business in Canada and the United States. Second Claimant is Raymond Loewen, a Canadian citizen who was the founder of TLGI and its principal shareholder and chief executive officer. TLGI submits claims as \"investor of a Party\" on its own behalf under NAFTA, Article 1116 and on behalf of LGII under Article 1117. Likewise, Raymond Loewen submits claims as \"the investor of a party\" on behalf of TLGI under NAFTA, Article 1117.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent is the Federal Government of the United States of America.\n\n**III. HISTORY OF PROCEEDINGS IN THIS ARBITRATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThere is no occasion to set out the procedural history of this arbitration before the Tribunal delivered its Decision dated January 5, 2001, on Respondent\u2019s objection to competence and jurisdiction. The Decision fully recites that history. It will, however, be necessary to refer later to the grounds of that objection because they were not fully determined by the Decision. The Decision is attached to this Award.\n\n12.\n\nBy that Decision dated January 5, 2001, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent\u2019s objection to competence and jurisdiction so far as it related to the first ground of objection1 and adjourned the further hearing of Respondent\u2019s other grounds of objection and joined that further hearing to the hearing on the merits which was fixed for October 15, 2001. The Tribunal made orders -\n\n1. Respondent to file its counter-memorial on the merits within 60 days of the date of this Decision.\n\n2. Claimants to file their replies within 60 days of the time limited for the filing of Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n3. Respondent to file its rejoinder within 60 days of the time limited for the filing of Claimants\u2019 replies.\n\nSir Robert Jennings in his Third Opinion misstates the Tribunal\u2019s Decision when he says that the Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that the decisions of the Mississippi courts were not \"measures\u2019 because they were not \"final\u2019 acts of the United States court system.\n\n**IV.

HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS SINCE THE DECISION ON COMPETENCE AND JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial was filed on March 30, 2001, pursuant to an extension of time granted on January 31, 2001.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Joint Reply was filed on June 8, 2001, pursuant to an extension of time granted on May 15, 2001.\n\n20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder was filed on August 27, 2001, pursuant to an extension of time granted on August 17, 2001.\n\n21.\n\nOn August 9, 2001, Respondent filed a motion for the disqualification of Yves Fortier, QC as a member of the Tribunal in circumstances arising out of the proposed merger of Mr Fortier\u2019s firm with a firm which had previously acted for Claimants in connection with their bankruptcy reorganisation under Chapter Eleven of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\n\n22.\n\nOn September 10, 2001, Mr Fortier resigned from his office as a member of the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nOn September 13, 2001, Sir Anthony Mason and Judge Mikva, pursuant to Article 15(3) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules consented to Mr Fortier\u2019s resignation.\n\n24.\n\nOn September 14, 2001, Lord Mustill was duly appointed by Claimants as a member of the Tribunal in place of Mr Fortier.\n\n25.\n\nThe oral hearing on the merits, incorporating the joined unresolved objections to competence and jurisdiction, took place in Washington DC on October 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19, 2001.\n\n26.\n\nAt the conclusion of the oral hearing, the Tribunal made orders granting leave to Canada and Mexico to file written submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 and to the Parties to file written submissions in reply.\n\n27.\n\nOn November 9, 2001, Canada and Mexico filed written submissions.\n\n28.\n\nOn December 7, 2001, Claimants filed a joint reply and Respondent filed a response to the written submissions of Canada and Mexico.\n\n29.\n\nSubsequently, on January 25, 2002 Respondent filed the motion to dismiss Claimants' NAFTA claims for lack of jurisdiction, based on the reorganization of TLGI under Chapter Eleven of the United States Bankruptcy Code. An element in that reorganization was the assignment by TLGI of its NAFTA claims to a newly created Canadian corporation, Nafcanco, which was owned and controlled by LGII (re-named \"Alderwoods, Inc\", a United States corporation).\n\n**VI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO CLAIMANTS\u2019 CLAIM**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe dispute which gave rise to the litigation in Mississippi State Court related to three contracts between O\u2019Keefe and the Loewen companies and a settlement agreement made on August 19, 1991 whereby Loewen agreed to sell an insurance company and a related trust fund to O\u2019Keefe and to provide O\u2019Keefe with the exclusive right to provide certain insurance policies sold through Loewen funeral homes. By the settlement agreement, for its part O\u2019Keefe agreed to dismiss an action it had brought against Loewen relating to the three contracts, to sell to Loewen two O\u2019Keefe funeral homes, and to assign to Loewen an option which O\u2019Keefe held on a cemetery tract north of Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n31.\n\nThe origin of the dispute lay in competition between two funeral companies in the Gulf Coast region of Mississippi. In the Gulfport area, the Riemann brothers owned and operated funeral homes and funeral insurance companies. In the Biloxi area, O\u2019Keefe owned and operated funeral homes and funeral insurance companies. Gulf National Life Insurance Company (\"Gulf\u2019) was one such funeral insurance company owned and operated by O\u2019Keefe.\n\n32.\n\nLoewen, which had embarked on a grand strategy of acquiring funeral homes across North America, purchased the Riemann businesses in January, 1990. The Riemann businesses were restructured into a holding company known as \"Riemann Holdings, Inc.\", of which LGII became owner as to 90%, the Riemann interests holding the remaining 10%. Loewen retained the previous owners and managers as salaried employees of Loewen. Despite the change in ownership, Riemann continued to advertise itself as locally owned - \"we haven\u2019t sold out: we just have a new partner, The Loewen Group International\". O\u2019Keefe challenged Riemann\u2019s claim that it was locally owned. O\u2019Keefe published advertisements in the Gulf Coast community, asserting that Riemann was really owned by Loewen which was a Canadian company financed by an Asian Bank. This was part of an advertising campaign designed to encourage support for the O\u2019Keefe local business as against foreign-owned and foreign financed competition.\n\n33.\n\nLoewen extended its Mississippi interests to Jackson, the largest metropolitan area in the State, by purchasing the Wright & Ferguson Funeral Home, the largest funeral home in Jackson. Wright & Ferguson had an association with O\u2019Keefe dating back to 1974, when O\u2019Keefe purchased the exclusive right to sell Gulf funeral insurance through the Wright & Ferguson Funeral Home.\n\n34.\n\nLoewen began to sell insurance through Wright & Ferguson Funeral Homes, despite Gulfs exclusive right under the 1974 contract. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s complaints about this breach of the contract, along with financial difficulties that O\u2019Keefe was experiencing, led to negotiations between O\u2019Keefe and Loewen which failed to result in any agreement. Subsequently O\u2019Keefe began a lawsuit in connection with the breach of contract.\n\n35.\n\nIt was then that the settlement agreement of August 19, 1991 was reached. The agreement provided for completion within 120 days, time being of the essence. Prompt completion was important to O\u2019Keefe because O\u2019Keefe was under review by the state regulatory authority. There was evidence that Loewen was aware of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s difficulties with the regulatory authority and of the adverse consequences for O\u2019Keefe if the agreement were not completed in the 120 days. Moreover, the Riemanns objected strongly to the agreement, so much so that Loewen told them that the deal would not close without their approval.\n\n36.\n\nThere was a dispute over the 1991 agreement and its legal effect. While the parties were negotiating about that agreement the US Federal Bureau of Investigation seized the Mississippi Insurance Commissioner\u2019s records relating to the O\u2019Keefe insurance companies.\n\n37.\n\nAfter the negotiations broke down, O\u2019Keefe filed an amended complaint alleging breach of the 1991 agreement and fresh claims of common law fraud and violations of Mississippi anti-trust law. That complaint sought actual damages of $5 million.\n\n38.\n\nIn May 1992, the Mississippi Insurance Commissioner placed Gulf under administrative supervision. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s complaint was further amended to include claims for consequential damages allegedly suffered as a result of administrative supervision.\n\n**VII. THE NATURE OF CLAIMANT\u2019S CLAIM**\n---------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case is that the verdict for $500,000,000 and the decisions refusing to relax the bonding requirements are \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party\" relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) within the meaning of NAFTA, Article 1101.1.\n\nClaimants argue that\n\n(1) the trial court, by admitting extensive anti-Canadian and pro-American testimony and prejudicial counsel comment, violated Article 1102 of NAFTA which bars discrimination against foreign investors and their investments;\n\n(2) the discrimination tainted the inexplicably large verdict;\n\n(3) the trial court, by the way in which it conducted the trial, in particular by its conduct of the *voir dire* and its irregular reformation of the initial jury verdict for $260,000,000, by permitting extensive nationality-based, racial and class-based testimony and counsel comments, violated Article 1105 of NAFTA which imposes a minimum standard of treatment for investments of foreign investors, including a duty of \"full protection and security\" and a right to \"fair and equitable treatment\" of foreign investors;\n\n(4) the excessive verdict and judgment (even apart from the discrimination) violated Article 1105;\n\n(5) the Mississippi courts\u2019 arbitrary application of the bonding requirement violated Article 1105; and\n\n(6) the discriminatory conduct, the excessive verdict, the denial of Loewen\u2019s right to appeal and the coerced settlement violated Article 1110 of NAFTA, which bars the uncompensated appropriation of investments of foreign investors.\n\n40.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent is liable for Mississippi\u2019s NAFTA breaches under Article 105, which requires that the Parties to NAFTA shall ensure that all necessary measures are taken to give effect to the provisions of the Agreement, including their observance by State and provincial governments. Claimants also allege that, by tolerating the misconduct which occurred during the O\u2019Keefe litigation, Respondent directly breached Article 1105, which imposes affirmative duties on Respondent to provide \"full protection and security\" to investments of foreign investors, including \"full protection and security\" against third-party misconduct.\n\n**VIII. THE GROUNDS OF RESPONDENT\u2019S OBJECTION TO COMPETENCE AND JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nBy its Memorial on Competence and Jurisdiction, Respondent objected to the competence and jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the following grounds:\n\n(1) the claim is not arbitrable because the judgments of domestic courts in purely private disputes are not \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party\" within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven;\n\n(2) the Mississippi court judgments complained of are not \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party\" and cannot give rise to a breach of Chapter Eleven as a matter of law because they were not final acts of the United States judicial system;\n\n(3) a private agreement to settle a litigation matter out of court is not a government \"measure\" within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven;\n\n(4) the Mississippi trial court\u2019s alleged failure to protect against the alien-based, racial and class-based references cannot be a \"measure\" because Loewen never objected to such references during the trial; and\n\n(5) Raymond Loewen\u2019s Article 1117 claims should be dismissed because he does not \"own or control\" the enterprise at issue.\n\n**IX. THE ISSUES**\n------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn stating the issues and in dealing with them, we have addressed the sectional and particular arguments presented by counsel. Without in any way criticizing the presentation of the arguments in that form, we emphasise that those particular arguments are designed to elucidate the one substantial question, namely whether the judgment and orders made by the Mississippi Courts against Loewen amounted to violations of NAFTA for which Respondent is liable.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent maintains grounds (2) to (4) inclusive of its grounds of objection to competence and jurisdiction. As Respondent\u2019s substantive submissions on the merits cover much of the subject matter dealt with by the unresolved grounds of objection, we shall direct our attention in the first instance to the substantive issues.\n\n**(a) Issues concerning the Trial**\n-----------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIssues of fact and issues of law arise in connection with the trial of the action in Mississippi State Court before Judge Graves and a jury. According to Claimants, the trial resulted in a grossly excessive verdict, brought about by conduct of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel, notably Mr Gary, which was allowed by the trial judge. Claimants contend that the conduct of the trial, for which Respondent is responsible under NAFTA, involved violations of NAFTA Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that Claimants\u2019 complaints about the trial are grossly exaggerated and that they do not constitute NAFTA violations. Respondent relies upon grounds (2), (3) and (4) of its objection to competence and jurisdiction as substantive defences to the claim. Respondent argues also that Claimants are not entitled to rely on the conduct constituting the alleged NAFTA violations because they did not object to that conduct at the trial. Respondent further contends that flawed decisions taken at trial by Loewen, not NAFTA violations, were the cause of the verdict.\n\n45.\n\nThe issues of fact which arise for determination, in the light of the cases presented by the Parties, may be expressed as follows:\n\n(1) Did the trial court allow O\u2019Keefe to engage in a strategy of exciting anti-Canadian, pro-Mississippi animus?\n\n(2) Did the trial court allow O\u2019Keefe to engage in a strategy of racial antagonism?\n\n(3) Did the trial court allow O\u2019Keefe to engage in class-based animus?\n\n(4) Does the conduct of the trial court give rise to an inference of bias against Loewen?\n\n(5) Was the trial flawed by other major irregularities of a kind that could result in manifest injustice?\n\n(6) What steps, if any, did Loewen take at the trial to object to conduct of the kind described in (1), (2) and (3) above, or to protect themselves from it?\n\n46.\n\n(1) The next question is whether the conduct of which Claimants, if established, complain tainted the verdict and whether that conduct contributed to an excessive verdict. These questions calls for consideration of the decisions taken at the trial by Loewen and for an examination of the amounts awarded for\n\n(a) punitive damages;\n\n(b) economic damages;\n\n(c) emotional damages.\n\n(2) A separate question is whether there was any legal or evidentiary basis for O\u2019Keefe\u2019s antitrust and oppression claims.\n\n47.\n\nUltimately, so far as the conduct of the trial is concerned, the following questions of law arise for determination:\n\n(1) Was the conduct of the trial so flawed as to violate NAFTA Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110 or any of them, assuming the verdict and judgment of Mississippi State Court to be a \"measure adopted or maintained by a Party within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven\"?\n\n(2) Did Claimants\u2019 failure to object at the trial to conduct constituting NAFTA violations disentitle Claimants from relying upon them?\n\n**(b) Issues concerning the supersedeas bonding requirement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nOther issues concern the supersedeas bonding requirement and the refusal of the Mississippi courts to relax the requirement. Claimants make no challenge to the bonding requirement itself. Claimants argue that the refusals to relax the bonding requirement constituted independent violations of NAFTA provisions. Claimants also argue that the refusal to relax the bonding requirement effectively deprived Loewen of the prospect of appealing the verdict entered by the trial court. In this respect Claimants assert that the deprivation of the prospect of appeal satisfied the principle of finality, if such a principle is applicable to a claim under NAFTA based on the decision of a trial court. Claimants also contend that the decisions not to relax the bonding requirement in a situation in which Loewen was exposed to immediate execution on its assets subjected Loewen to economic duress. The claim of economic duress, if soundly based, would lead to a challenge to set aside the settlement agreement under which Loewen agreed to pay to O\u2019Keefe $175 million. Yet there is no suggestion that Loewen seeks to rescind or set aside that agreement. The claim of economic duress may, however, be relevant in establishing that entry into the agreement was consequential upon violation of one or more of the NAFTA articles.\n\n49.\n\nThe issues of fact in relation to the decisions of the Mississippi courts refusing relaxation of the bonding requirement and Loewen\u2019s entry into the settlement agreement are:\n\n(1) Were the refusals to relax the bonding requirement the result of an institutional or other bias on the part of the Mississippi judiciary against Loewen by virtue of Loewen\u2019s nationality?\n\n(2) Did the refusals to relax the bonding requirement effectively foreclose the options otherwise available to Loewen to challenge by way of appeal or otherwise the verdict entered by the trial court?\n\n(3) Was Loewen\u2019s decision to enter into the settlement agreement a business judgment or decision on the part of Loewen?\n\n50.\n\nThe principal questions of law which arise in consequence of the refusals to relax the bonding requirement and the entry into the settlement agreement are:\n\n(1) Did the refusals constitute a violation of the NAFTA articles on its own or in combination with the jury\u2019s verdict?\n\n(2) Did the refusals satisfy the principle of finality, thereby enabling Claimants to hold Respondent responsible for NAFTA violations at the trial?\n\n(3) If entry into the settlement agreement was the result of a business decision by Loewen, does that preclude Claimants from relying on NAFTA violations?\n\n51.\n\nThe claim before the Tribunal is a claim under international law for violations of NAFTA. It is for the Tribunal to decide the issues in dispute in accordance with NAFTA and applicable rules of international law. NAFTA Article 1131.1. The Tribunal is concerned with domestic law only to the extent that it throws light on the issues in dispute and provides domestic avenues of redress for matters of which Claimants complain. The Tribunal cannot under the guise of a NAFTA claim entertain what is in substance an appeal from a domestic judgment.\n\n52.\n\nThe claim before the Tribunal relates to the conduct of the Mississippi trial court and the Mississippi Supreme Court for whose acts, if they constitute a violation of NAFTA, Respondent is responsible (NAFTA Article 105). Respondent is not responsible under NAFTA for the conduct of O\u2019Keefe and its counsel in the Mississippi litigation, unless responsibility for that conduct can be attributed to the Mississippi courts.\n\n53.\n\nAs will appear hereafter, Judge Graves failed in his duty to take control of the trial by permitting the jury to be exposed to persistent and flagrant appeals to prejudice on the part of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel and witnesses. Respondent is responsible for any failure on the part of the trial judge in failing to take control of the trial so as to ensure that it was fairly conducted in this respect.\n\n**X. THE TRIAL**\n----------------\n\n54.\n\nHaving read the transcript and having considered the submissions of the parties with respect to the conduct of the trial, we have reached the firm conclusion that the conduct of the trial by the trial judge was so flawed that it constituted a miscarriage of justice amounting to a manifest injustice as that expression is understood in international law. Whether this conclusion results in a violation of Article 1105 depends upon the resolution of Respondent\u2019s submissions still to be considered, in particular the submission that State responsibility arises only when final action is taken by the State\u2019s judicial system as a whole.\n\n55.\n\nIn the succeeding paragraphs we set out the reasons for the conclusion stated in para. 54 above as well as the reasons why we conclude that, in other respects, Claimants\u2019 case must be rejected.\n\n**(a) O\u2019Keefe\u2019s nationality strategy**\n--------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s case at trial was conducted from beginning to end on the basis that Jerry O\u2019Keefe, a war hero and \"fighter for his country\", who epitomised local business interests, was the victim of a ruthless foreign (Canadian) corporate predator. There were many references on the part of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel and witnesses to the Canadian nationality of Loewen (\"Ray Loewen and his group from Canada\"). Likewise, O\u2019Keefe witnesses said that Loewen was financed by Asian money, these statements being based on the fact that Loewen was partly financed by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, an English and Hong Kong bank which was erroneously described by Jerry O\u2019Keefe in evidence as the \"Shanghai Bank\". Indeed, Jerry O\u2019Keefe, endeavouring to justify an earlier advertising campaign in which O\u2019Keefe had depicted its business under American and Mississippi flags and Loewen under Canadian and Japanese flags, stated that the Japanese may well control both the \"Shanghai Bank\" and Loewen but he did not know that. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s strategy of presenting the case in this way was linked to Jerry O\u2019Keefe\u2019s fighting for his country against the Japanese and the exhortation in the closing address of Mr Gary (lead counsel for O\u2019Keefe) to the jury to do their duty as Americans and Mississippians. This strategy was calculated to appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathy for local home-town interests as against the wealthy and powerful foreign competitor.\n\n57.\n\nSeveral additional examples will serve to illustrate this strategy. In the **voir dire** and opening statements, Mr Gary stated that he had \"teamed up\" with Mississippi lawyers \"to represent one of your own, Jerry O\u2019Keefe and his family\". Mr Gary also stated \"The Loewen Group, Ray Loewen, Ray Loewen is not here to-day. The Loewen Group is from Canada. He\u2019s not here to-day. Do you think that every person should be responsible and should step up to the plate and face their own actions? Let me see a show of hands if you feel that everybody in America should have the responsibility to do that\". Whilst the conduct of the **voir dire** may not in itself have been conspicuously out of line with practice in Mississippi State courts, the skilful use by counsel for Claimants of the opportunity to implant inflammatory and prejudicial materials in the minds of the jury set the tone for the trial when it actually began.\n\n58.\n\nIn the *voir dire* O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel sought an assurance from potential jurors that they would be willing to award heavy damages. Once again, in their opening statements, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel urged the jury to exercise \"the power of the people of Mississippi\" to award massive damages. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel drew a contrast between O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Mississippi antecedents and Loewen\u2019s \"descent on the State of Mississippi\".\n\n59.\n\nEmphasis was constantly given to the Mississippi antecedents and connections of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s witnesses. By way of contrast Mr Gary, in cross-examination of Raymond Loewen, repeatedly referred to his Canadian nationality, noted that he had not \"spent time\" in Mississippi and questioned him about foreign and local funeral home ownership. Jerry O\u2019Keefe, in his evidence, pointed out that Loewen was a foreign corporation, its \"payroll checks come out of Canada\" and \"their invoices are printed in Canada\".\n\n60.\n\nAn extreme example of appeals to anti-Canadian prejudice was evidence given by Mr Espy, former United States Secretary of State for Agriculture who, called to give evidence of the good character of Jerry O\u2019Keefe, spoke of his (Espy\u2019s) experience in protecting \"the American market\" from Canadian wheat farmers who exported low priced wheat into the American market with which American producers could not compete and later, having secured a market, then jacked up the price. The tactic of thrusting prejudicial comment on to the cross-examiner was not confined to Mr Espy. It was a feature of Jerry O\u2019Keefe\u2019s answers in cross-examination.\n\n61.\n\nThe strategy of emphasizing O\u2019Keefe\u2019s American nationality as against Loewen\u2019s Canadian origins reached a peak in Mr Gary\u2019s closing address. He likened Jerry O\u2019Keefe\u2019s struggle against Loewen with his war-time exploits against the Japanese, asserting that he was motivated by \"pride in America\" and \"love for your country\". By way of contrast, Mr Gary characterized Loewen\u2019s case as \"Excuse me, I\u2019m from Canada\". Indeed, Mr Gary commenced his closing address by emphasizing nationalism:\n\n\"[Y]our service on this case is higher than any honor that a citizen of this country can have, short of going to war and dying for your country.\" (Transcript at 5539).\n\nHe described the American jury system as one that O\u2019Keefe\n\n\"fought for and some died for\" (Transcript at 5540-41).\n\nMr Gary said\n\n\"they [Loewen] didn\u2019t know that this man didn\u2019t come home just as an ace who fought for his country - he\u2019s a fighter... He\u2019ll stand up for America and he has\" (Transcript at 5544).\n\n62.\n\nMr Gary returned to the same theme at the end of his closing address:\n\n\" [O\u2019Keefe] fought and some died for the laws of this nation, and they\u2019re [Loewen] going to put him down for being American\" (Transcript at 5588).\n\nMr Gary reminded the jury that many of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s witnesses were Mississippians (Transcript at 5576.5578, 5589, 5591). On the other hand, Mr Gary characterized Loewen as a foreign invader who \"came to town like gang busters. Ray came sweeping through...\" (Transcript at 5548). Mr Gary even repeated the prejudicial evidence given by Mr Espy about the Canadian wheat farmers. Mr Gary likened Loewen to the Canadian wheat farmers. Loewen would \"come in\" and purchase a funeral home and \"no sooner than they got it, they jacked up the prices down here in Mississippi\" (Transcript at 5588). Mr Gary continued on a similar theme when he urged the jury to award substantial damages in doing their duty as Americans and Mississippians.\n\n63.\n\nRespondent argues that the vast majority of references to nationality during the trial were made in a context in which O\u2019Keefe was seeking to identify the location of disputed events. This argument is without substance. The references to nationality were an element in a strategy calculated to appeal to the jury\u2019s sentiment in favour of local interests. In conformity with this strategy, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel went out of their way to make it clear that they had no quarrel with Mr John Wright and David Riemann who were Mississippians, notwithstanding that Wright and Ferguson was a defendant in the action, Mr Wright was a director of LGII and the Riemanns held 10% of the share capital of the Riemann companies.\n\n64.\n\nRespondent also argues that the introduction of evidence with an anti-Canadian basis was caused by Loewen\u2019s plan to portray O\u2019Keefe as \"a biased and unfair competitor who had engaged in an anti-foreigner advertising campaign\" with a view to taking business away from Riemann Holdings. Respondent is correct in saying that Loewen pursued that plan. It misfired. The jury appears not to have been concerned by O\u2019Keefe\u2019s advertising campaign. But the answer to Respondent\u2019s argument is that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel in the *voir dire* and in their opening statement had already embarked on their nationality strategy before Loewen\u2019s counsel made any reference to the advertising campaign in their opening statements. In any event, the persistent pursuit by O\u2019Keefe of the nationality strategy went far beyond a response to Loewen\u2019s plan based on the advertising campaign.\n\n**(b) O\u2019Keefe\u2019s racial politics strategy**\n------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case that O\u2019Keefe engaged in a strategy of racial politics is largely based on the efforts of O\u2019Keefe to suggest that O\u2019Keefe did business with black and white people alike whereas Loewen did business with white people. This aspect of Claimants\u2019 case must be seen in a context in which both parties were endeavoring to ingratiate themselves with the African-American jurors. Both parties added to their legal teams prominent African-American lawyers. The lead counsel on each side was a prominent African-American lawyer, Mr Gary for O\u2019Keefe, Mr Sinkfield for Loewen. Two of the remaining four Loewen lawyers were well-known African-American members of the Mississippi state legislature. Two other O\u2019Keefe lawyers were African-American lawyers. After the midway point of the trial had been reached, Judge Graves observed that \"the race card has already been played\". Significantly, Judge Graves remarked \"and I know that the jury knows what\u2019s going on\". In allowing an O\u2019Keefe witness to give racially based evidence, Judge Graves acknowledged that Loewen did not start this strategy and \"was going to bring up the rear\" in that contest.\n\n66.\n\nLoewen sought to counter this strategy by showing that it also did business with the black community. Loewen called evidence of its contract with the National Baptist Convention in order to show that Loewen was contributing to the economic development of the black community. O\u2019Keefe countered by claiming that Loewen was racially exploiting the National Baptist Convention and the many black people who were members of the Convention.\n\n67.\n\nRespondent seeks to justify O\u2019Keefe\u2019s racial politics strategy by arguing that it was relevant to the O\u2019Keefe anti-trust case. Respondent argues that, in order to define Loewen\u2019s market power, it was necessary to establish that the relevant markets for comparison included white funeral homes owed by Loewen and excluded African-American funeral homes with which they did not compete. Yet O\u2019Keefe\u2019s anti-trust case was that O\u2019Keefe and Loewen competed only in predominantly white markets. In any event, the O\u2019Keefe racial politics strategy went well beyond defining relevant markets.\n\n**(c) O\u2019Keefe\u2019s appeal to class-based prejudice**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nClaimants further complain that Mr Gary repeatedly portrayed Loewen as a large, wealthy foreign corporation and contrasted Jerry O\u2019Keefe as a small, local, family businessman. There were a number of references by O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel emphasizing this contrast. These references culminated in Mr Gary\u2019s closing address in which he incited the jury to put a stop to Loewen\u2019s activities. Speaking of Jerry O\u2019Keefe, Mr Gary said:\n\n\"He doesn\u2019t have the money that they have nor the power, but he has heart and character, and he refused to let them shoot him down.\"\n\n\"You know your job as jurors gives you a lot of power... You have the power to bring major corporations to their knees when they are wrong. You can see wrong, make it right. Suffering and stop it.\"\n\n\"Ray comes down here, he\u2019s got his yacht up there, he can go to cocktail parties and all that, but do you know how he\u2019s financing that? By 80 and 90 year old people who go to get to a funeral, who go to pay their life savings, goes into this here, and it doesn\u2019t mean anything to him. Now, they\u2019ve got to be stopped... Do it, stop them so in years to come anybody should mention your service for some 50 odd days on this trial, you can say \u2018Yes, I was there\u2019, and you can talk proud about it.\"\n\n\"1 billion dollars, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You\u2019ve got to put your foot down, and you may never get this chance again. And you\u2019re not just helping the people of Mississippi but you\u2019re helping poor people, grieving families everywhere. I urge you to put your foot down. Don\u2019t let them get away with it. Thank you, and may God bless you all.\"\n\n69.\n\nRespondent seeks to justify these tactics on the basis that O\u2019Keefe complained that Loewen exploited \"its unequal financial means to oppress the Plaintiffs\". The rhetoric of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel went well beyond any legitimate exercise in ventilating O\u2019Keefe\u2019s oppression claim which, as will appear, was not submitted by Judge Graves to the jury.\n\n70.\n\nIt is artificial to split the O\u2019Keefe strategy into three segments of nationality-based, race and class-based strategies. When the trial is viewed as a whole right through from the *voir dire* to counsel\u2019s closing address, it can be seen that the O\u2019Keefe case was presented by counsel against an appeal to home-town sentiment, favouring the local party against an outsider. To that appeal was added the element of the powerful foreign multi-national corporation seeking to crush the small independent competitor who had fought for his country in World War II. Describing \u2018Loewen\u2019 as a Canadian was simply to identify Loewen as an outsider. The fact that an investor from another state, say New York, would or might receive the same treatment in a Mississippi court as Loewen received is no answer to a claim that the O\u2019Keefe case as presented invited the jury to discriminate against Loewen as an outsider.\n\n**XI. LOEWEN\u2019S FAILURE TO OBJECT TO O\u2019KEEFE\u2019S PREJUDICIAL CONDUCT AT THE TRIAL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nRespondent also argues that Loewen\u2019s counsel were at fault in failing to object to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s nationality and racial politics strategy and appeals to class prejudice. The point of this argument is to avoid attributing to the trial judge any part of the responsibility for allowing O\u2019Keefe to engage in these strategies and appeals. If Loewen\u2019s counsel did not object, then, so the argument runs, there was no error on the part of the trial judge in failing to intervene of his own motion. For Claimants to succeed in their claim, they must establish that the trial judge permitted or failed to take steps (which he should have taken) to prevent the alleged conduct of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel and witnesses. Respondent is only responsible in international law for the conduct of the Mississippi courts.\n\n72.\n\nThe transcript discloses many occasions when Loewen\u2019s counsel did not object to comments or evidence on these matters when they could have done so. Likewise, there were occasions when they might have moved to have witness\u2019 comments deleted from the record on the ground that they were non-responsive. Mr Espy\u2019s reference to Canadian wheat farmers was an example.\n\n73.\n\nIn a jury trial, however, counsel are naturally reluctant to create the impression, by continuously objecting, that they are seeking to suppress relevant evidence or that they are relying on technicalities. So it is not to be expected that Loewen\u2019s counsel would object on every occasion when objectionable comment was made or inadmissible evidence was given. The question is whether Loewen\u2019s counsel sufficiently brought their objections to the attention of the trial judge and whether the trial judge was aware of the problem and should have taken action himself.\n\n74.\n\nA reading of the transcript reveals that Loewen\u2019s counsel at the trial did not make any objections to evidence or comments on the ground that they were calculated to foment prejudice on the grounds of nationality, race or class. Claimants have been unable to point to any such objection. The silence of Loewen\u2019s counsel on these matters is a matter that calls for consideration in the light of the claims now pursued by Claimants.\n\n75.\n\nWith respect to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s nationality strategy, the explanation for the absence of objection is obscure. Loewen\u2019s counsel may have considered that the risk of a verdict reflecting local favouritism was inherent in the litigation and that the best way of handling the problem was to nail O\u2019Keefe with his unfair and misleading advertising campaign and rely on an instruction to the jury eliminating local favouritism. As it happened, Judge Graves did not give the jury the instruction sought by Loewen, a matter to which we shall come shortly. Loewen\u2019s counsel were certainly aware of the risk of local favouritism. They explored that risk with potential jurors in the *voir dire.* It may well be that the trial judge\u2019s unfavourable, dismissive, abrupt responses to their objections during the *voir dire,* reinforced by similar responses during the trial, led them to make the judgment that objections would be rejected and would result in prejudice to Loewen in the eyes of the jury.\n\n76.\n\nWith respect to the issue of race, the explanation for the absence of any objection may well be that Loewen\u2019s counsel, conscious of their own efforts to ingratiate themselves with the predominantly African-American jury, considered that the making of objections to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s conduct would appear inconsistent and hypocritical.\n\n77.\n\nThe probable explanation for the absence of objection to class-based appeals to the jury is that Loewen\u2019s counsel regarded the problem as inherent in the litigation. Further, the making of an objection would only serve to highlight the advantage which Loewen enjoyed over O\u2019Keefe in both wealth and power. So the giving of an appropriate jury instruction would be the best answer to the difficulty.\n\n**XII. STEPS TAKEN BY LOEWEN TO PROTECT ITS POSITION**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nIn pre-trial proceedings, Loewen moved to dismiss the anti-trust, unfair competition and oppression claims on the ground that they were frivolous. These claims generated at the trial many of the appeals to prejudice. Judge Graves peremptorily dismissed this motion. Loewen also moved pre-trial to exclude evidence of special damages, including the emotional distress claim. This motion was also dismissed by Judge Graves.\n\n79.\n\nClaimants now submit that the denial of the two motions effectively preserved the issues that prejudicial error was committed at trial by allowing evidence and arguments of counsel based on these claims. It does not follow, however, that the filing of these motions preserved Loewen\u2019s position in so far as their claim is based on prejudicial conduct and evidence.\n\n80.\n\nIn the *voir dire,* Loewen\u2019s counsel objected to Mr Gary seeking commitments from the jury panel in relation to their treatment of Loewen which he had described as \"Ray Loewen and his group from Canada\". The objection was overruled. Mr Gary then asked whether potential jurors would be willing \"to render a verdict against Ray Loewen and his group and render a verdict for over $600 million?\" An objection to that question was overruled.\n\n81.\n\nOn the first day of the trial, Judge Graves ruled in response to two obj ections by Loewen\u2019s counsel that character evidence would be admitted generally. Loewen counsel stated that the purpose of such evidence was to attract \"sympathy and favor\" from the jury. At the end of the trial, Judge Graves dismissed two motions for mistrial based on the character evidence. And, prior to the opening statements, the trial judge overruled objections to the placing before the jury panel an enlarged picture of all the members of the O\u2019Keefe family and pictures of Jerry O\u2019Keefe\u2019s military service.\n\n82.\n\nJudge Graves, at the conclusion of the trial, rejected a jury instruction proposed by Loewen\u2019s counsel. The proposed instruction told the jury that they were not to be swayed by bias, prejudice, favour or other improper motive. This instruction was refused on the basis that it duplicated standard instruction \"C-l\". Judge Graves began his instructions to the jury with instruction \"C-l\", which is given in every case and addresses such general topics as the role of the jury, the court, the evidence and counsel\u2019s argument. Included in \"C-l\" was a short one-sentence warning against bias in general, which made no reference to nationality-based or racial bias in particular. The warning was in these terms:\n\n\"You should not be influenced by bias, sympathy or prejudice.\"\n\n83.\n\nWhen Judge Graves asked if there were any objections to the instructions (including C-l) which he had prepared, Loewen counsel sought a more elaborate direction on the topic. Although Judge Graves summarily rejected this objection when counsel acknowledged that there was nothing wrong with the Judge\u2019s proposed direction, it was clear that Claimant\u2019s counsel was seeking an expanded direction to fit the particular circumstances of the case.\n\n84.\n\nLater Loewen\u2019s counsel submitted a specific instruction to address the risk of nationality-based, racial and class bias. The proposed instruction provided (App. at A2231-32):\n\n\"The law is a respecter of no persons. All are equal in the eyes of the law without regard to race, ethnicity, national origin, wealth or social status.\n\nIn deciding the issues presented in this case, you must not be swayed by bias or prejudice or favor or any other improper motive. The parties, the court and the public expect that you will carefully and impartially consider all of the evidence in the case, follow the law as stated by the court, and reach a just verdict based on these two things alone, regardless of the consequences.\n\nThis case should be considered and decided by you as a matter between parties of equal standing in the community, between persons or businesses of equal standing and holding the same or similar stations in life. A corporation or other business entity is entitled to the same fair trial at your hands as a private individual.\n\nThe Loewen Group, Inc. is a corporation organized and having its principal place of business in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Loewen Group International, Inc. is a corporation having its principal place of business in Covington, Kentucky, just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati. These parties are entitled to the same fair trial at your hands as are other parties who are residents of Mississippi such as the O\u2019Keefes and the eight separate O\u2019Keefe corporations that are Plaintiffs in this case. All persons and parties stand equal before the law and are to be dealt with as equals in this court of justice.\"\n\n85.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel objected to this instruction as \"cumulative\" of the one-sentence warning. This objection was summarily upheld by Judge Graves, notwithstanding that the proposed instruction went far beyond the one-sentence warning in C-l which was, in the light of the circumstances of this case, inadequate to counter the prejudice created by the way in which O\u2019Keefe\u2019s case had been presented.\n\n86.\n\nLoewen\u2019s counsel did not object to the prejudicial and extravagant appeals in Mr Gary\u2019s closing address to the jury. In the light of the trial judge\u2019s refusal of the jury instruction that had been sought, they may well have concluded that no purpose would be served by objecting.\n\n87.\n\nHaving regard to the history of the trial, and the way in which it was conducted by Judge Graves, we do not consider that failures to object on the part of Loewen\u2019s counsel amounted to a waiver of the grounds on which Claimants now contend that the conduct of the trial constituted a violation of NAFTA. There was a gross failure on the part of the trial judge to afford the due process due to Loewen in protecting it from the tactics employed by O\u2019Keefe and its counsel. It defies common sense to suggest that Loewen\u2019s counsel by their conduct made an election not to pursue their objections to those tactics and that Loewen waived its objections to the lack of due process and to the grounds on which it now complains. Although \"a State cannot base the charges made before an international court or tribunal... on objections or grounds, which were not previously raised before the municipal courts\" (Judge Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga, \"International Law in the Past Third of a Century\" 159 \"Recueil des Cours\" (1978) at p 282), Claimants\u2019 grounds were sufficiently raised at trial.\n\n**XIII. THE REFORM OF THE INITIAL JURY VERDICT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn punitive damages cases, Mississippi law requires a bifurcated trial procedure. At the first stage, the jury determines liability and compensatory damages; at the second stage, the jury considers whether to award punitive damages. The jury cannot consider liability and punitive damages at the same time. Miss. Code Ann. \u00a711-1-65(b-c).\n\n89.\n\nIn conformity with this provision, Judge Graves instructed the jury only on liability and compensatory damages issues. The parties did not adduce evidence or present argument on punitive damages in the first stage of the trial. Nor did Judge Graves give the jury any instructions about punitive damages.\n\n90.\n\nIn the jury *voir dire,* however, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel informed the panel of potential jurors that there was a claim for punitive damages. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel asked the panel whether they would have any hesitation in awarding a verdict for over $600 million damages if the plaintiffs\u2019 case was proved according to law. Loewen\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection that this question amounted to seeking a commitment from the jury was overruled. In the early stages of the trial, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel made reference to the claim for punitive damages. Loewen\u2019s counsel objected but the trial judge gave no instruction to the jury in response to the objection.\n\n91.\n\nThe matters mentioned in paras. 89 and 90 may well have induced the jury to understand that they were to award both compensatory and punitive damages together if they found for O\u2019Keefe on liability.\n\n92.\n\nOn November 1, 1995, the jury returned a verdict for O\u2019Keefe of $260,000,000.\n\nThis amount was said to be made up as follows (App. at A651-658):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **(Wright and Ferguson contracts)** |  |\n| Breach of three of the Wright and Ferguson contracts | 31,200,000 |\n| Tortious interference with one or more of the three Wright and Ferguson contracts | 7,800,000 |\n| Tortious (wilful, intentional) breach of a Wright and Ferguson contract | 23,400,000 |\n| Breach of implied covenants of good faith and Fair dealing in a Wright and Ferguson contract | 15,600,000 |\n| **(1991 Agreement)** |  |\n| Wilful and malicious breach of the 1991 Agreement | 54,600,000 |  |\n| Tortious (wilful and intentional) breach of the 1991 Agreement | 54,600,000 |  |\n| Breach of an implied covenant of good faith and Fair dealing in the 1991 Agreement | 36,400,000 |\n| **State anti-monopoly law breaches** | 18,200,000 |  |\n| **Common law fraud** | 18,200,000 |  |\n| $ | 300,000,000 |\n\n93.\n\nThe individual amounts listed in the previous paragraph total $260,000,000 (the verdict brought in by the jury) not $300,000,000. There was no allocation in the individual amounts or in the total amount of the verdict as between compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n94.\n\nA note written by the jury foreman to Judge Graves, after the verdict was announced, stated that the $260 million covered both compensatory damages of $100 million and punitive damages of $160 million, and that the $260,000,000 was a \"negotiated compromise\" between a low of $100,000,000 and a high of $300,000,000 (App. at A659).\n\n95.\n\nHow, in the light of the way the amount of $260,000,000 was calculated, the verdict was divided into $100,000,000 compensatory damages and $160,000,000 punitive damages remains a complete mystery. The way in which the verdict was constructed, including, as it did, compensatory and punitive damages, demonstrates that there was a failure adequately to instruct the jury to limit their initial award to compensatory damages.\n\n96.\n\nImmediately after announcement of the verdict, Loewen moved for a mistrial, contending that the verdict was biased, excessive and procedurally defective because it covered punitive damages. Judge Graves denied the motion without discussion (Transcript at 5739). Judge Graves purported to reform the verdict. He informed the jury that he accepted the verdict of $100,000,000 compensatory damages but did not accept the award of $160,000,000 punitive damages. The jury may well have interpreted the rejection of this award as an indication that it was inadequate.\n\n**XIV. THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES HEARING AND VERDICT**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nJudge Graves then directed that the trial enter the punitive damages stage. It took place on November 2, 1995. Bernard Pettingill, an O\u2019Keefe witness, testified that the net worth of Loewen was almost $3.2 billion, though he conceded that its market capitalization, based on the current value of its shares, was less than $1.8 billion. He explained the difference by saying that the market had failed to take into account the \"future value\" of Loewen\u2019s contract with the National Baptist Convention (Transcript at 5762).\n\n98.\n\nOn the other hand Loewen presented expert evidence that its entire net worth, as reflected in filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission was between $600 and $700 million (Transcript at 5771-5772) and that its market value was approximately $1.7 billion (Transcript at 5777).\n\n99.\n\nIn his closing address, Mr Gary returned to his earlier themes: \"Ray Loewen is not here to-day. He\u2019s not here and I think that\u2019s the ultimate arrogance... That\u2019s the ultimate arrogance for him to think that he can do what he\u2019s doing to people like Jerry O\u2019Keefe... and to the consumers of this stage, and he can deal with it in this fashion\" (Transcript at 5794-5795). Mr Gary claimed that Loewen officials were \"smiling when they charge grieving families in Corinth, Mississippi\"(Transcript at 5796).\n\n100.\n\nAs he had done in his earlier closing address, Mr Gary asserted that Loewen would make \"over $7.9 billion\" off the National Baptist Convention Contract, an assertion unsupported by evidence. He further asserted that this profit would be made from \"just selling vaults\" because Loewen would not admit black people to Loewen funeral homes for burial. Again this assertion was unsupported by evidence. The closing address concluded with the exhortation:\n\n\"1 billion dollars, 1 billion dollars... You\u2019ve got to put your foot down, and you may not ever get this chance again. And you\u2019re not just helping people of Mississippi, but you\u2019re helping... families everywhere.\u2019\u2019(Transcript at 5809).\n\n101.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict for $400,000,000 punitive damages. On November 6, 1995, judgment for a total verdict of $500,000,000 was entered.\n\n102.\n\nOn that day Loewen filed a motion to reduce the punitive damages on the grounds of bias and excessiveness (App. at A1196). On November 15, 1995, Loewen filed another motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or for a new trial, or for remittitur (App. at A660) on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict exhibited bias, passion and prejudice against Loewen and on the ground that each element in the damage\u2019s award was excessive.\n\n103.\n\nOn November 20, 1995, Judge Graves denied Loewen\u2019s post trial motions.\n\n**XV. THE CLAIM THAT THE $500 MILLION VERDICT WAS EXCESSIVE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe total damages award of $500 million was by far the largest ever awarded in Mississippi.\n\n105.\n\nClaimants had a very strong case for arguing that the damages awarded, both compensatory and punitive, were excessive, and that the amounts were so inflated as to invite the inference that the jury was swayed by prejudice, passion or sympathy. The initial award of punitive damages, despite the trial judge\u2019s instruction that the jury was then to confine itself to issues of liability and compensatory damages, indicates that the jury was minded to award punitive damages against Loewen without instructions from the trial judge and without evidence to support the amount of an award. Further, the initial award of damages included amounts for anti-trust oppression breaches and the fraud claim, although Mr Gary, in his closing address, had not asked for damages on those claims. The award of $100,000,000 compensatory damages was very close to the total amount of $105,852,000 which was the amount sought by Mr Gary from the jury for all claims, though it was calculated by reference to the contract and tort claims.\n\n106.\n\nThe award on the breach of the Wright and Ferguson contracts greatly exceeds the value placed on those contracts in evidence by the O\u2019Keefe witness, $980,000 (Transcript at 2367), which was the amount sought from the jury by Mr Gary (Transcript at 5711-5712). The total amount initially awarded in respect of the various claims made in relation to these contracts, $78,000,000, allowing for what was at that stage of the case an impermissible punitive component, bore no relationship to the apparent value of the contracts. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there was a multiplication of damages on claims which overlapped.\n\n107.\n\nLikewise, the damages awarded in relation to the 1991 settlement agreement appear to be grossly excessive. In his closing address, Mr Gary sought a total of $104,852,000 for the claims based on the 1991 agreement, made up of $74,500,000 for emotional distress and the remainder in economic damages, yet in the O\u2019Keefe \"Amended and Supplemental Complaint\" sought $625,000 only in emotional damages for Jerry O\u2019Keefe and his son (App. at A202). This amount was mentioned by O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel in the opening statement. The only evidence of emotional distress was given by Jerry O\u2019Keefe and his daughter Susan. They spoke of his sleepless nights, worry and stress. There was no expert evidence, no evidence of medical or psychiatric treatment, medication, physical manifestation of distress and no evidence whatsoever relating to the son.\n\n108.\n\nMr Gary sought from the jury, at least by implication, an amount of $30 to $35 million in economic damages (Transcript at 5713-5715), resulting from breach of the 1991 agreement. Yet, allowing for an impermissible element of punitive damages, the jury initially awarded $145,600,000 damages for the claims on the 1991 agreement. The amount of $30 to $35 million sought by Mr Gary included $20 million in lost \"future revenue\" from the Family Care Company (Transcript at 4848-4864), $6 million in lost \"future revenue\" from Riemann Trust Funds (Transcript at 1400-1401) and $4.5 million in lost \"future revenue\" from the Family Care Trust Rollover (Transcript at 2366, 5566-5568). Under Mississippi law, lost future profits are recoverable as damages but lost future revenue is not recoverable *(Fred\u2019s Stores of Mississippi v M & H Drugs Inc.* 725 So. 2d 902, 914-915 (1998)).\n\n109.\n\nThe duplication of awards on the Wright and Ferguson contracts and the 1991 agreement is an obvious problem. That agreement extinguished all claims arising out of the then existing litigation between O\u2019Keefe and Loewen. The pending lawsuit included claims for breach of the Wright and Ferguson contracts. If the 1991 agreement was enforceable, claims for breaches of the Wright and Ferguson contracts could not be maintained.\n\n110.\n\nAgain, Claimants had a strong ground for claiming that the fraud damages were excessive. As already noted, Mr Gary did not ask for these damages. The only fraud claim involved alleged misstatements about the 1991 agreement and its performance. Why the fraud claim would result in damages additional to the damages awarded on the other claims made in respect of the 1991 agreement is by no means apparent.\n\n111.\n\nClaimants\u2019 challenge to the award on the anti-trust claims appears to misconceive the nature of the claim. It was not, as Claimants seem to suggest, confined to a claim based on loss sustained as a result of impermissible pricing below cost. The O\u2019Keefe case was mainly based on the unfair means by which Loewen attempted to attain its monopoly power. It was O\u2019Keefe\u2019s case that Loewen violated the anti-monopoly laws by manipulating the 1991 agreement in bad faith in order to drive O\u2019Keefe out of funeral home markets, thereby enabling Loewen to raise prices without fear of competition. It was also O\u2019Keefe\u2019s case that Loewen\u2019s treatment of O\u2019Keefe was part of a broader practice of destroying or excluding smaller competitors by unfair means. There is expert evidence before us in the form of a declaration by Mr Jack Dunbar that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s allegations were more than sufficient to state a claim for a violation of Mississippi anti-monopoly laws. And evidence was presented at the trial to substantiate the monopolization claims. That evidence included the testimony of a credible expert Mr Dale Espich whose testimony dealt in detail with Loewen\u2019s monopolistic practices. He described Loewen\u2019s domination of various Mississippi markets, its persistent practice in raising prices, particularly in dominated markets (Transcript at 1837-1840), its tendency to cluster its purchases of funeral homes to dominate markets (Transcript at 1845-1846) and Loewen\u2019s success in excluding O\u2019Keefe from the largest Mississippi market - Jackson. (Transcript at 1867). This testimony was not challenged in cross-examination. So Claimants\u2019 argument that there was no legal basis for the anti-trust claim appears to be without substance.\n\n112.\n\nThere is no occasion to deal with the so-called \"oppression\" claim. No such claim was submitted by Judge Graves to the jury and no verdict was rendered on such a claim. That O\u2019Keefe pleaded \"oppression\" as a separate count is therefore immaterial.\n\n113.\n\nThe total award (even the award of compensatory damages) appears to be grossly disproportionate to the damage suffered by O\u2019Keefe. The dispute involved three contracts valued at $980,000 and an exchange of two funeral homes worth approximately $2.5 million for a Loewen funeral insurance company valued at approximately $4 million. The jury foreman said \"May be O\u2019Keefe lost $1 million dollars. $6 million to $8 million I\u2019d say was right...\" (App. at A3079). Respondent seeks to justify the award of $500 million not by reference to the substance of the dispute but by reference to Loewen\u2019s \"monopolization of funeral home markets and overcharging of grief-stricken consumers of funeral services\". Granted that a substantial award of damages on this claim might well be justified, Claimants had very strong grounds for arguing that verdict of $500,000,000 was excessive.\n\n114.\n\nNotwithstanding the viability of the anti-trust claim, Claimants had very strong prospects of successfully appealing the damages awarded on the ground that they were excessive.\n\n**XVI. RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE THAT EXCESSIVE VERDICT WAS CAUSED BY LOEWEN\u2019S FLAWED TRIAL STRATEGY**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nRespondent argues that the excessive verdict was not caused by inadmissible appeals to prejudice and local favouritism but by Loewen\u2019s flawed trial strategy. First, it is said that because the foreman of the jury was formerly a Canadian, it would be wrong to impute anti-Canadian bias to the jury. This argument is based very largely on posttrial interviews with the jurors, including the foreman. We do not regard these interviews as establishing that the verdict was uninfluenced by appeals to local sentiment, racial or class-based prejudice. These influences may well have played a part in the verdict, even if there was an absence of actual bias on the part of the jurors themselves. The magnitude of the verdict suggests that the verdict was influenced by bias, prejudice, passion or sympathy.\n\n116.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument on this point is based on the Opinion of Professor Stephan Landsmann who has pointed to a number of strategical or tactical decisions taken by Loewen\u2019s counsel during the course of the trial, particularly in relation to the punitive damages stage of the trial. There is much to be said for the view that a number of decisions taken by Loewen\u2019s counsel, viewed with the advantage of hindsight, were unwise. Further, four individuals who had been employed by Loewen gave evidence which was very critical of Loewen\u2019s business practices. One of them testified to a policy of constant and aggressive price increases for funeral services (Transcript at 1228.1240). The same witness described communications in which O\u2019Keefe was given misleading information or in which material information was withheld in evident breach of contract (Transcript at 1217-1223). The Riemann brothers wrote letters to Loewen complaining about the business methods of Loewen.\n\n117.\n\nProfessor Landsmann points also to four matters which would have strengthened the O\u2019Keefe charges against Loewen. They were:\n\n(1) the belated disclosure and production of the Riemann letters (already mentioned) which appear to support a number of significant O\u2019Keefe allegations;\n\n(2) the striking by the Court of the testimony of a Loewen witness, Ellis, after it was revealed that Loewen\u2019s counsel had not complied with the court\u2019s sequestration order with respect to his pre-trial preparation;\n\n(3) frequent claims of memory failure by Raymond Loewen in direct and cross-examination, a matter commented upon by Judge Graves; and\n\n(4) the contradiction by Loewen witnesses and by documents of Loewen\u2019s counsel\u2019s statements about the net worth of Loewen during the punitive damages stage of the trial.\n\n118.\n\nThe matters referred to in the two preceding paragraphs unquestionably strengthened the O\u2019Keefe case against Loewen and highlighted Loewen\u2019s predatory and aggressive conduct. But these matters do not erase the prejudicial conduct at trial on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s part or eliminate the influence it was calculated to have on the jury.\n\n**XVII. EVALUATION OF THE TRIAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nBy any standard of measurement, the trial involving O\u2019Keefe and Loewen was a disgrace. By any standard of review, the tactics of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s lawyers, particularly Mr Gary, were impermissible. By any standard of evaluation, the trial judge failed to afford Loewen the process that was due.\n\n120.\n\nThe trial before Judge Graves lasted some 50 days. During such a protracted period of adversarial behavior, mistakes and errors will occur; even the most even-handed judge will not be able to entirely preclude appeals to the jury\u2019s passions. Appellate courts in the United States, and indeed, in most countries in the world, have recognized that \"perfect trials\" are not to be expected. Doctrines of harmless error, invited error, and waiver of the right to object to prejudicial conduct are commonly invoked to sustain the results of less than perfect trials. Clearly, an arbitral tribunal applying the provisions of a treaty and of international law is even more constrained to avoid nitpicking a trial record and the rulings of a trial judge. Even when all of those limitations are applied most rigorously, the trial and its $500,000,000 verdict cannot be countenanced.\n\n121.\n\nRespondent obviously could not defend some of the lawyer conduct and trial judge inadequacy previously referred to. Instead it argued that some of the appellate doctrines mentioned above precluded the tribunal from relying on specific flaws that were the most egregious. We need not resolve the domestic procedural disputes which arose at the trial such as the question whether Loewen was entitled to the particular instruction which it sought as to bias. The question is whether the whole trial, and its resultant verdict, satisfied minimum standards of international law, or the \"fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\" that the Contracting States pledged in Article 1105 of NAFTA. This question is addressed in paras. 124-137.\n\n122.\n\nIf a single instance of the unfair treatment that was accorded Loewen at the trial level need be cited, it would be the manner in which the large and excessive verdict was constructed by the judge and the jury. As has previously been detailed, the jury originally came in with a verdict of $260,000,000, which the foreman indicated included compensatory damages of $100,000,000 and punitive damages of $160,000,000. Since Mississippi law required a separate prove up of punitive damages (which had not occurred), the judge accepted the $100,000,000 compensatory damages portion of the verdict, but conducted a further, and minimal, hearing of evidence on the punitive damages question. The jury subsequently came back with the much enhanced punitive damages award of $400,000,000, making the total verdict of $500,000,000 the largest in Mississippi history. Whether the jury interpreted Judge Graves\u2019 procedure as an invitation to increase the verdict or not, the results compounded the excessiveness of the original verdict. The methods employed by the jury and countenanced by the judge were the antithesis of due process. But we repeat this is only one instance of many.\n\n123.\n\nIn reaching the conclusion stated in the previous paragraph, we take it to be the responsibility of the State under international law and, consequently, of the courts of a State, to provide a fair trial of a case to which a foreign investor is a party. It is the responsibility of the courts of a State to ensure that litigation is free from discrimination against a foreign litigant and that the foreign litigant should not become the victim of sectional or local prejudice. In the United States and in other jurisdictions, advocacy which tends to create an atmosphere of hostility to a party because it appeals to sectional or local prejudice, has been consistently condemned and is a ground for holding that there has been a mistrial, at least where the conduct amounts to an irreparable injustice *(New York Central R.R. Co. v Johnson* 279 US 310, 319 (1929); *Le Blanc v American Honda Motor Co. Inc.* 688 A 2d 556, 559). In *Walt Disney World Co. v Blalock* 640So 2d 1156.1158, a new trial was ordered where closing argument was pervaded with inflammatory comment and personal opinion of counsel, although the offensive comments were not objected to. See also *Whiteheadv Food Max of Mississippi Inc.* 163 F 3d 265, 276-278 (where a new trial was ordered on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel repeatedly \"reminded the jury that [defendant] Kmart is a national... corporation... [and] contrasted that with\" his and his client\u2019s status as a Mississippi resident, despite the fact that most of the objectionable comments were not objected to); *Norma v Gloria Farms Inc.* 668 So 2d 1016.1021,1023 (new trial ordered where defense counsel in closing remarks appealed to jurors\u2019 self-interest, despite plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object). In such circumstances the trial judge comes under an affirmative duty to prevent improper tactics which will result in an unfair trial *(Pappas v Middle Earth Condominium Association* 963 F 2d 534 539, 540; *Koufakis v Carvel* 425 F 2d 892, 900).\n\n**XVIII. NAFTA ARTICLE 1105**\n-----------------------------\n\n124.\n\nArticle 1105 which is headed \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\" provides:\n\n\" 1. Each party shall accord to investments of investors of another party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\"\n\nThe precise content of this provision, particularly the meaning of the reference to \"international law\" and the effect of the inclusory clause has been the subject of controversy.\n\n125.\n\nOn July 31, 2001, the Free Trade Commission adopted an interpretation of Article 1105(1). The Commission\u2019s interpretation is in these terms:\n\n**\"Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law**\n\n(1) Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n(2) The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n(3) A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).\"\n\n126.\n\nAn interpretation issued by the Commission is binding on the Tribunal by virtue of Article 1131(2).\n\n127.\n\nAlthough Claimants, in their written materials, submitted that the Commission\u2019s interpretation adopted on July 31, 2001 went beyond interpretation and amounted to an unauthorized amendment to NAFTA, Claimants did not maintain that submission at the oral hearing. The oral argument presented by Mr Cowper QC on behalf of Claimants was consistent with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Article 1105(1). Mr Cowper QC submitted that, accepting that Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of an investor of another Party, the treatment of Loewen by the Mississippi courts violated that minimum standard.\n\n128.\n\nThe effect of the Commission\u2019s interpretation is that \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" are not free-standing obligations. They constitute obligations only to the extent that they are recognized by customary international law. Likewise, a breach of Article 1105(1) is not established by a breach of another provision of NAFTA. To the extent, if at all, that NAFTA Tribunals *\\n Metalclad Corp v United Mexican States* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1 (Aug 30, 2000), *S.D. Myers, Inc. v Government of Canada* (Nov 13, 2000) and *Pope & Talbot, Inc. v* *Canada,* Award on the Merits, Phase 2, (Apr 10, 2001) may have expressed contrary views, those views must be disregarded.\n\n129.\n\nIt is not in dispute between the parties that customary international law is concerned with denials of justice in litigation between private parties. Indeed, Respondent\u2019s expert, Professor Greenwood QC, acknowledges that customary international law imposes on States an obligation \"to maintain and make available to aliens, a fair and effective system of justice\" (Second Opinion, para. 79).\n\n130.\n\nRespondent submits that, in conformity with the accepted standards of customary international law, it is for Loewen to establish that the decisions of the Mississippi courts constituted a manifest injustice. Professor Greenwood states in his Second Opinion:\n\n\"the awards and texts make clear that error on the part of the national court is not enough, what is required is \"manifest injustice\" or \"gross unfairness\" (Gamer, \"International Responsibility of States for Judgments of Courts and Verdicts of Juries amounting to Denial of Justice\", 10 BYIL (1929), p 181 at p 183), \"flagrant and inexcusable violation\" (Arechaga, [\"International Law in the Past Third of a Century\", 159 \"Recueil des Cours\" (1978) at p 282]) or \"palpable violation\" in which \"bad faith not judicial error seems to be the heart of the matter\" (O\u2019Connell, International Law, 2nd ed, 1970) p 498). As Baxter and Sohn put it (in the Commentary to their Draft Convention on the Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens) \"the alien must sustain a heavy burden of proving that there was an undoubted mistake of substantive or procedural law operating to his prejudice\".\n\n131.\n\nIn *Pope & Talbot Inc. v Canada,* Award in respect of damages, May 31, 2002 a NAFTA Tribunal considered the effect of the Interpretation of July 31, 2001. The Tribunal concluded (para. 62 of its Award) that the content of custom in international law is now represented by more than 1800 bilateral investment treaties which have been negotiated. Nevertheless the Tribunal did not find it necessary to go beyond the formulation by the International Court of Justice in *Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI)* *United States v Italy* (1989) ICJ 15 at 76:\n\n\"Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law... It is wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety.\"\n\n132.\n\nNeither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of international justice. Manifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety is enough, even if one applies the Interpretation according to its terms.\n\n133.\n\nIn the words of the NAFTA Tribunal in *Mondev International Ltd v United States of* *America* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/99/2, Award dated October 11, 2002,\n\n\"the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to \u2018unfair and inequitable treatment\u2019.\"\n\n134.\n\nIf that question be answered in the affirmative, then a breach of Article 1105 is established. Whether the conduct of the trial amounted to a breach of municipal law as well as international law is not for us to determine. A NAFTA claim cannot be converted into an appeal against the decisions of municipal courts.\n\n135.\n\nInternational law does, however, attach special importance to discriminatory violations of municipal law (Harvard Law School, Research in International Law, Draft Convention on the Law of Responsibility of States for Damage Done in Their Territory to the Persons or Property of Foreigners (\"1929 Draft Convention\") 23 American Journal of International Law 133, 174 (Special Supp. 1929) (\"a judgment [which] is manifestly unjust, especially if it has been inspired by ill-will towards foreigners as such or as citizens of a particular states\"); Adede, A Fresh Look at the Meaning of Denial of Justice under International Law, XIV Can YB International Law 91 (\"a... decision which is clearly at variance with the law and discriminatory cannot be allowed to establish legal obligations for the alien litigant\"). A decision which is in breach of municipal law and is discriminatory against the foreign litigant amounts to manifest injustice according to international law.\n\n136.\n\nIn the present case, the trial court permitted the jury to be influenced by persistent appeals to local favouritism as against a foreign litigant.\n\n137.\n\nIn the light of the conclusions reached in paras. 119-123 (inclusive) and 136, the whole trial and its resultant verdict were clearly improper and discreditable and cannot be squared with minimum standards of international law and fair and equitable treatment. However, because the trial court proceedings are only part of the judicial process that is available to the parties, the rest of the process, and its availability to Loewen, must be examined before a violation of Article 1105 is established. We address this question in paras. 142-157 (inclusive), 165-171 (inclusive) and 207-217 (inclusive).\n\n**XIX. THE CLAIM OF BIAS**\n--------------------------\n\n138.\n\nClaimants\u2019 argument that Judge Graves and the jury were actually biased against Loewen is not made out. There is no direct evidence of bias on the part of Judge Graves or the jury. Nor do the jury interviews demonstrate that the jury was biased. The interviews reveal that the jury took an adverse view of Loewen\u2019s conduct based on evidence which included testimony of Loewen employees and former employees. Nor does the evidence warrant the drawing of an inference of bias against the jury, though there is strong reason for thinking that the jury were affected by the persistent and extravagant O\u2019Keefe appeals to prejudice. Although the trial judge\u2019s conduct of the trial is explicable by reference to bias, the evidence does not support a finding that he was biased against Loewen. We take the view that the judge, for reasons which do not clearly appear, failed to discharge his paramount duty to ensure that Loewen received a fair trial.\n\n**XX. NAFTA ARTICLE 1102**\n--------------------------\n\n139.\n\nArticle 1102 bars discrimination against foreign investors and their investments. Article 1102(1) and (2) requires each Party to accord investors and investments of another Party \"treatment no less favorable than it accords in like circumstances to its own investors\" or their investments. With respect to a state or province Article 1102(3) requires\n\n\"treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that state or province to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms part.\"\n\nThe effect of these provisions, as Respondent\u2019s expert Professor Bilder states, is that a Mississippi court shall not conduct itself less favourably to Loewen, by reason of its Canadian nationality, than it would to an investor involved in similar activities and in a similar lawsuit from another state in the United States or from another location in Mississippi itself. We agree also with Professor Bilder when he says that Article 1102 is direct only to nationality-based discrimination and that it proscribes only demonstrable and significant indications of bias and prejudice on the basis of nationality, of a nature and consequence likely to have affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n140.\n\nA critical problem in the application of Article 1102 to the facts of this case is that we do not have an example of \"the most favorable treatment accorded, in like circumstances\" by a Mississippi court to investors and investments of the United States. Claimants submit that the treatment accorded O\u2019Keefe is an appropriate comparator, that Loewen and O\u2019Keefe were \"in like circumstances\" because they were litigants in the same case. But their circumstances as litigants were very different and it is not possible to apply Article 1102(3) by reference to the treatment accorded to O\u2019Keefe. What Article 1102(3) requires is a comparison between the standard of treatment accorded to a claimant and the most favourable standard of treatment accorded to a person in like situation to that claimant. There are no materials before us which enable such a comparison to be made.\n\n**XXI. NAFTA ARTICLE 1110**\n---------------------------\n\n141.\n\nClaimants\u2019 reliance on Article 1110 adds nothing to the claim based on Article 1105. In the circumstances of this case, a claim alleging an appropriation in violation of Article 1110 can succeed only if Loewen establishes a denial of justice under Article 1105.\n\n**XXII. THE NECESSITY FOR FINALITY OF ACTION ON THE PART OF THE STATE\u2019S LEGAL SYSTEM**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that the trial and the verdict were improper and cannot be squared with minimum standards of fair international law and fair and equitable treatment, we must now consider the question whether, in the light of subsequent proceedings, the trial and the verdict alone or in combination with the subsequent proceedings amounted to an international wrong. We take up at this point the Respondent\u2019s second ground of objection to competence and jurisdiction which covers much of the same ground and was not resolved in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 5 January 2001.\n\n143.\n\nRespondent argues that the expression \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party\" must be understood in the light of the principle of customary international law that, when a claim of injury is based upon judicial action in a particular case, State responsibility only arises when there is final action by the State\u2019s judicial system as a whole. This proposition is based on the notion that judicial action is a single action from beginning to end so that the State has not spoken until all appeals have been exhausted. In other words, the State is not responsible for the errors of its courts when the decision has not been appealed to the court of last resort. Respondent distinguishes this substantive requirement of customary international law for a final non-appealable judicial action, when an international claim is brought to challenge judicial action as a breach of international law, from international law\u2019s procedural requirement of exhaustion of local remedies (\"the local remedies rule\").\n\n144.\n\nRespondent submits that there is nothing to show that in Chapter Eleven the Parties intended to derogate from this substantive rule of international law when judicial action is the basis of the claim for violation of NAFTA. Respondent argues that the terms of Article 1101, \"adopted or maintained by a Party\", incorporate the substantive rule of international law and require finality of action. Only those judicial decisions that have been accepted or upheld by the judicial system as a whole, after all available appeals have been exhausted, so the argument runs, can be said to possess that degree of finality that justifies the description \"adopted or maintained\".\n\n145.\n\nClaimants\u2019 response to this argument is that Article 1121(1)(b) of NAFTA requires an arbitral claimant to waive its local remedies, not exhaust them. This Article authorizes the filing of a Chapter Eleven claim only if\n\n\"the investor and the enterprise waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116...\".\n\nClaimants submit, first, that \"the Article eliminates the necessity to exhaust local remedies provided by the host country\u2019s administrative or judicial courts\". (B. Sepulveda Amor, *International Law and International Sovereignty: The NAFTA and the Claims of Mexican Jurisdiction,* 19 Houston Journal of International Law 565 at 574 (1997)). Claimants submit, secondly, that the so-called substantive principle of finality is no different from the local remedies rule and that international tribunals have reviewed the decisions of inferior municipal courts where the exhaustion requirement has been waived or is otherwise inapplicable.\n\n146.\n\nRespondent argues that Article 1121 (2)(b) is not a waiver provision and that it does not waive the local remedies rule or for that matter the requirement that the judicial process be pursued to the highest court where a judicial act constitutes the breach of international law. Respondent appears to acknowledge, however, that the Article relaxes the local remedies rule to a partial but limited extent, without defining or otherwise indicating what that extent is or may be.\n\n147.\n\nAs Professor Greenwood points out in his First Opinion, usually there are three separate issues to be considered:\n\n(a) whether there is an act which is imputable to the respondent State;\n\n(b) whether that act is contrary to international law; and\n\n(c) whether the respondent State can be held responsible for that act in international proceedings until local remedies have been exhausted.\n\n148.\n\nIn this case, we are not concerned with the question whether there is an act which is imputable to Respondent. A decision of a court of a State is imputable to the State because the court is an organ of the State. This proposition was acknowledged in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of January 5, 2001. We are, of course, concerned with the question whether the relevant decisions of the Mississippi courts constitute violations of international law because this is not a case where the alleged violation of international law is constituted by a non-judicial act or decision.\n\n149.\n\nThe local remedies rule which requires a party complaining of a breach of international law by a State to exhaust the local remedies in that State before the party can raise the complaint at the level of international law is procedural in character. Article 44 of the latest International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on State Responsibility demonstrates that the local remedies rule deals with the admissibility of a claim in international law, not whether the claim arises from a violation or breach of international law (Text provisionally adopted on 31 May, 2001, UN Doc. A/CN 4/L 602. Article 44 is identical to Article 45 of the 2000 draft referred to in the Decision of January 5, 2001, para. 67). Article 22 of the earlier draft, which had been prepared in 1975, embodied a substantive approach which was strongly criticized by governments (most notably the United Kingdom) and was not followed in *Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) United States v Italy* (1989) ICJ 15 at para. 50. See Second Opinion of Professor Greenwood, paras 52-54).\n\n150.\n\nAlthough Loewen submits, in accordance with an Opinion of Sir Robert Jennings, that the local remedies rule is essentially confined to cases of diplomatic protection, that view does not coincide with that of other commentators. See Garcia-Amador, Sohn and Baxter, Recent Codification of the Law of State Responsibility for Injuries to Aliens (1974) pp 143, 129-132; see also Garc\u00eda-Amador\u2019s Draft Articles on State Responsibility prepared in 1960 for the International Law Commission, noting his comment at p. 79:\n\n\"Article 21 of the draft sets forth the basis of a procedure which would enable the alien himself, once local remedies have been exhausted, to submit an international claim to obtain reparation for injury suffered by him.\"\n\nSee also OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property, 1967, Article 7(b) and Commentary (OECD Publication No. 23081 (1967) pp 36-41. Professor James Crawford SC, rapporteur on State Responsibility of the ILC has stated \"the exhaustion of local remedies rule is not limited to diplomatic protection\" (UN Doe. A/CN 4/517, p 33).\n\n151.\n\nProfessor Greenwood in his First Opinion refers to \"the principle that a court decision which can be challenged through the judicial process does not amount to a denial of justice\". The principle is supported by a number of decisions of the United States- Mexican Claims Tribunal *(Jennings, Laughland & Co vMexico* (Case No. 374, 3 Moore, *International Arbitrations* (1898) p 3135); *Green v Mexico* (ibid, at p 3139); *Burn v Mexico* (ibid at 3140); *The Ada* (ibid at 3143); *Smith v Mexico* (ibid at 3146); *Blumhardt v Mexico* (ibid at 3146); *The Mechanic (Corwin v Venezuela)* (ibid 3210 at 3218). In the first of these decisions, Umpire Thornton observed (at p 3136):\n\n\"The Umpire does not conceive that any government can thus be made responsible for the conduct of a judicial officer when no attempt has been made to obtain justice from a higher court.\"\n\n152.\n\nText writers also give support to the principle (Oppenheim\u2019s International Law, 9th ed, 1992, vol I, pp 543-545; Freeman, *International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice,* (1938) pp 291-292, 311-312), although Freeman regards the rule as linked to the local remedies rule (at p 415).\n\n153.\n\nThe principle that a court decision which can be challenged through the judicial process does not amount to a denial of justice at the international level has been linked to the duty imposed upon a State by international law to provide a fair and efficient system of justice. Professor James Crawford SC, rapporteur to the ILC, has stated:\n\n\"There are also cases where the obligation is to have a system of a certain kind, e.g. the obligation to provide a fair and efficient system of justice. There systematic considerations enter into the question of breach, and an aberrant decision by an official lower in the hierarchy, which is capable of being reconsidered, does not of itself amount to an unlawful act\".\n\n(UN Doe. A/CN 4/498, para. 75). Judge Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga took the same view of the State\u2019s responsibility, stating that it was an essential condition of a State being held responsible for a judicial decision in breach of municipal law that the decision must be a decision of a court of last resort, all remedies having been exhausted (\"International Law in the Past Third of a Century\", 159 Recueil des Cours (1978) at p 282, where the judge expressed the reason for the requirement as being that States provide remedies to correct the natural fallibility of their judges). He considered that a corollary of the requirement is that \"a State cannot base the charges made before an international court or tribunal... on objections or grounds which were not previously raised before the municipal courts\"\n\n154.\n\nNo instance has been drawn to our attention in which an international tribunal has held a State responsible for a breach of international law constituted by a lower court decision when there was available an effective and adequate appeal within the State\u2019s legal system.\n\n155.\n\nThat there is a difference in the purposes served by this principle was recognized by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in *Oil Fields of Texas* 12 Iran-US CTR 308 at 318-319. The question there was whether a judicial decision could amount to a measure of appropriation. The decision was that of the Islamic Court of Ahwaz, which appears to have been a lower court. The Tribunal held that the order of the Court amounted to a permanent deprivation of use. The Tribunal said (at p 319):\n\n\"In these circumstances, and taking into account the Claimant\u2019s impossibility to challenge the Court order in Iran, there was a taking of the three blowout preventers for which the Government is responsible\" (p 319).\n\n156.\n\nThe purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower court be challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a breach of international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the State the opportunity of redressing through its legal system the inchoate breach of international law occasioned by the lower court decision. The requirement has application to breaches of Articles 1102 and 1110 as well as Article 1105.\n\n157.\n\nThe questions whether there was an adequate and effective municipal remedy available to Loewen and whether Loewen took sufficient steps to pursue such a remedy are questions which remain to be considered. It is convenient, first, however, to deal with Article 1121 and the problem of waiver.\n\n**XXIII. ARTICLE 1121 AND WAIVER**\n----------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nIn para. 71 of the Decision of January 5, 2001, the Tribunal expressed the view that \"the rule of judicial finality is no different from the local remedies rule. Its purpose is to ensure that the State where the violation occurred should have an opportunity to redress it by its own means, within the framework of its own judicial system\".\n\n159.\n\nThis statement requires qualification in light of the preceding discussion of Article 1105, denial of justice and the local remedies rule. The requirement that a decision of a lower court be challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a breach of international law constituted by judicial decision means that this requirement and the local remedies rule, though they may be similar in content, serve two different purposes.\n\n160.\n\nAn important principle of international law should not be held to have been tacitly dispensed with by international agreement, in the absence of words making clear an intention to do so *(Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) United States v Italy* (1989) ICJ 15 at 42). Such an intention may be exhibited by express provisions which are at variance with the continued operation of the relevant principle of international law.\n\n161.\n\nAlthough the precise purpose of NAFTA Article 1121 is not altogether clear, it requires a waiver of domestic proceedings as a condition of making a claim to a NAFTA tribunal. Professor Greenwood and Sir Robert Jennings agree that Article 1121 \"is not about the local remedies rule\". One thing is, however, reasonably clear about Article 1121 and that is that it says nothing expressly about the requirement that, in the context of a judicial violation of international law, the judicial process be continued to the highest level.\n\n162.\n\nNor is there any basis for implying any dispensation of that requirement. It would be strange indeed if sub silentio the international rule were to be swept away. And it would be very strange if a State were to be confronted with liability for a breach of international law committed by its magistrate or low-ranking judicial officer when domestic avenues of appeal are not pursued, let alone exhausted. If Article 1121 were to have that effect, it would encourage resort to NAFTA tribunals rather than resort to the appellate courts and review processes of the host State, an outcome which would seem surprising, having regard to the sophisticated legal systems of the NAFTA Parties. Such an outcome would have the effect of making a State potentially liable for NAFTA violations when domestic appeal or review, if pursued, might have avoided any liability on the part of the State. Further, it is unlikely that the Parties to NAFTA would have wished to encourage recourse to NAFTA arbitration at the expense of domestic appeal or review when, in the general run of cases, domestic appeal or review would offer more wide-ranging review as they are not confined to breaches of international law.\n\n163.\n\nArticle 1121 may have consequences where a claimant complains of a violation of international law not constituted by a judicial act. That is not a matter which arises here.\n\n164.\n\nFor the reasons given, Article 1121 involves no waiver of the duty to pursue local remedies in its application to a breach of international law constituted by a judicial act.\n\n**XXIV. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE OBLIGATION TO PURSUE LOCAL REMEDIES**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe question then is as to the scope and content of the obligation to pursue local remedies in a case in which the alleged violation of international law is founded upon a judicial act. In such a case the pursuit of local remedies plays a part in creating the ground of complaint that there has been a breach of international law. There is a body of opinion which supports the view that the complainant is bound to exhaust any remedy which is adequate and effective *(The Finnish Ships Arbitration Award,* May 9, 1934, 3 RIAA, 1480 at 1495; *Nielsen v Denmark* [1958-1959] Yearbook of the European Commission on Human Rights, 412 at 436, 438, 440, 444) so long as the remedy is not \"obviously futile\" *(The Finnish Ships Arbitration Award* at 1503-1505).\n\n166.\n\nOn the other hand, the requirement has been described as one \"which is not a purely technical or rigid rule\" and one \"which international tribunals have applied with a considerable degree of elasticity\" *(Norwegian Loans Case* (1957) ICJR 9 at 39 per Lauterpacht J). In conformity with this approach, one commentator has suggested that the result in any particular case will depend upon a balancing of factors. So in a case where it is highly unlikely that resort to further remedies will be favourable to a claimant, the correct conclusion may be that local remedies have been exhausted \"if the cost involved in the proceeding further considerably outweighs the possibility of any satisfaction resulting\"' (Mummery, \"The Content of the Duty to Exhaust Local Remedies\" (1964) 58 Am. Jo. Inti. Law 389 at 401). The same commentator favours formulation of the issue in terms of whether the local remedy \"may reasonably be regarded as incapable of producing satisfactory reparation\" (ibid). Although this formulation appears to be directed to a case in which the claim is based on an antecedent breach of international law, the formulation is equally appropriate to obtaining redress as to producing reparation.\n\n167.\n\nHere, however, the question concerns the availability of the remedy rather than its adequacy or even its effectiveness. At least that is true of the appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. It was an adequate and fully effective appeal. The obligation of the claimant, who complains that a judicial act is a violation of international law, to afford the host State the opportunity of remedying the default in the court below, by taking the matter to a higher court, is subject to reasonable practical limitations. Thus, Sohn and Baxter, \"Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens\", 12th Draft (1961) 168 in their commentary on Article 19, sub-paragraph 2(b), state:\n\n\"The subparagraph is intended to preclude a respondent State from maintaining that a local remedy exists when in fact resort to that remedy is a practical impossibility and to permit a claimant to introduce evidence of the practical workings of justice, as distinct from the theoretical state of the law as reflected in code, statute, decision and learned writing. (...) It may be that an alien in fact finds it difficult to employ an existing local remedy by reason of the existence of some other procedural barrier in the law, such as a requirement of posting excessive security for costs, or where the law leaves to the discretion of a court official the amount of security for costs to be posted, an order for the posting of a prohibitive amount (...). Since the purpose of the Article as a whole is to require exhaustion of a remedy only if it is reasonably available, it is important to provide not only for the case where a remedy is unavailable as a matter of law, but also for the case where a theoretically available remedy cannot in fact be utilized.\"\n\n168.\n\nThis passage, in our view, correctly expresses the scope and content of the principle relating to exhaustion of local remedies. It is an obligation to exhaust remedies which are effective and adequate and are reasonably available to the complainant in the circumstances in which it is situated.\n\n169.\n\nAvailability is not a standard to be determined or applied in the abstract. It means reasonably available to the complainant in the light of its situation, including its financial and economic circumstances as a foreign investor, as they are affected by any conditions relating to the exercise of any local remedy.\n\n170.\n\nIf a State attaches conditions to a right of appeal which render exercise of the right impractical, the exercise of the right is neither available nor effective nor adequate. Likewise, if a State burdens the exercise of the right directly or indirectly so as to expose the complainant to severe financial consequences, it may well be that the State has by its own actions disabled the complainant from affording the State the opportunity of redressing the matter of complaint. The scope of the need to exhaust local remedies must be considered in the light of these considerations.\n\n171.\n\nWhether it has been satisfied in this case depends upon an examination of events subsequent to the trial, events to which we now turn.\n\n**XXV. LOEWEN\u2019S APPEAL, THE COURT DECISIONS ON THE BONDING REQUIREMENT AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nOn November 5, 1995, Loewen\u2019s counsel set out a timetable for future procedures. They proposed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Mississippi which was expected to take six months to two years before it was finalized. Loewen\u2019s counsel contemplated an appeal to the United States District Court, if necessary.\n\n173.\n\nOn November 6, 1995, final judgment was entered in favour of O\u2019Keefe. On that day, Marsh & McLellan, a firm experienced in placing supersedeas bonds in appeals in civil lawsuits, began to assemble a package of parties willing to furnish a bond. By November 22, 1995, it was arranged that surety companies would underwrite a total of $625,000,000, this being the amount of the bond required by Miss. R. App. P.8(a). By posting a bond in that amount, Loewen would have prevented O\u2019Keefe from enforcing the judgment while Loewen\u2019s appeal was pending.\n\n174.\n\nBy about November 20, 1995, it became clear that the sureties would all require that 100% of their risk be supported by collateral in the form of bank letters of credit and that Loewen\u2019s bankers would not promise such letters. On November 25, Loewen filed an affidavit stating that it was unable to provide an appeal bond with supersedeas in the amount, form and conditions required by the Mississippi Supreme Court and the surety companies.\n\n175.\n\nMeantime, immediately after judgment was entered, O\u2019Keefe began to enrol it within the counties of Mississippi, enrolment being a condition precedent to execution.\n\n176.\n\nOn November 15, 1995, Loewen moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and/or for a new trial and for remittitur. In these motions Loewen advanced numerous grounds, including grounds discussed in this Award, for challenging the verdict both as to liability and as to the damages awarded (compensatory and punitive). On the following day Loewen filed motions seeking a reduction of the compensatory and punitive damages awarded.\n\n177.\n\nOn November 20, 1995, the motions came on for hearing before Judge Graves. The court announced that each side would be given fifteen minutes for argument and Loewen would be allowed a further ten minutes for rebuttal. After argument, the court denied all six Loewen motions, without giving reasons.\n\n178.\n\nOn the same day, Mr Gary was reported as saying \"They have ten days to post the cash bond. If they don\u2019t, my client will proceed to take over their assets. That\u2019s every funeral home they own, every insurance company, every cemetery, their corporate jet and their yacht\". On November 21, 1995, Loewen\u2019s lawyers sought an assurance from O\u2019Keefe\u2019s lawyers that they would not seek enforcement during the thirty day period for perfecting the appeal. The assurance was not forthcoming.\n\n179.\n\nOn November 27, 1995, Loewen filed an appeal of the trial court judgment with the Mississippi Supreme Court. Under Mississippi law, a party may pursue such an appeal without posting a bond.\n\n180.\n\nOn November 28, 1995, Loewen filed a motion asking the trial court to stay enforcement of its judgment on Loewen filing a conventional supersedeas bond in the penal sum of $125,000,000 and providing covenants that Loewen would maintain its financial strength and net worth. By this motion Loewen asked the trial court to reduce the bond to $125,000,000 - 125 per cent of the compensatory damages component of the judgment. The Mississippi Court Rules empower the court, for \"good cause shown\" and in an \"appropriate\" case, to grant a stay of enforcement upon a bond or upon conditions less than or other than a bond in an amount of 125 per cent of the judgment (Miss. R. App. P. Rule 8(b)). Loewen argued that security for the compensatory damages component was all that O\u2019Keefe was entitled to, that Loewen was unable to provide more than a bond for $125,000,000 at the time, (though claiming it had the financial ability to satisfy the judgment to make for punitive damages), that its net worth was sufficient to make the judgment fully collectible. Loewen also argued that denial of the stay would cause it and innocent third parties irreparable harm and deprive it of appellate review. Loewen further argued that the appeal had strong prospects of success, in particular that the damages were grossly excessive. Loewen also stated that its major credit agreements all had cross-default clauses and agreed that an uncured default in any of their long term credit agreements would operate to vacate the stay.\n\n181.\n\nOn the same day, Loewen filed a motion in seeking a stay pending consideration by the court of the motion for a stay.\n\n182.\n\nOn November 29, 1995, the motions for a stay came on for hearing before Judge Graves in the trial court. The hearing began with Judge Graves again fixing fifteen minutes for oral argument on each side with ten minutes for rebuttal. In doing so, he exhibited resentment at statements made by Loewen\u2019s counsel in their brief that they were \"stunned\" by the time limits fixed for argument on the earlier motion and about the \"error-infested\" trial. A reading of the transcript, however, reveals that Judge Graves applied himself to the issues. He questioned O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel about the problem that would arise if execution on the judgment was not stayed and execution followed, yet on appeal the judgment was set aside or reduced. He asked whether it might not be more prudent to maintain the status quo. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel responded that there was no assurance that the status quo could be maintained, that there were other lawsuits pending against Loewen and the judgments might be bigger than the O\u2019Keefe judgment. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel also said \"they would go into Chapter Eleven [of the Bankruptcy Code] and in the meantime pursue us\" and \"[t]hey can appeal without supersedeas\". Loewen made no response on the Chapter Eleven argument even though it had that option under consideration. In argument, Judge Graves discussed other alternatives with Loewen\u2019s counsel and finally asked whether security could be given in an amount between $125,000,000 and $625,000,000. Nothing came of this after some discussion between the parties.\n\n183.\n\nJudge Graves then delivered judgment on the motions, dismissing them. He accepted that the court had a discretion under Rule 8(b) to reduce the amount of the bond for \"good cause shown\", an expression which was not defined. However, Judge Graves considered, in the light of the Mississippi Supreme Court decision in *In re Estate of Taylor* 539 So 2d 1029, that the general purpose of a supersedeas bond was to give absolute security to the party affected by the appeal and that the security was to cover the entire verdict, including the amount of punitive damages. Judge Graves concluded that, although it was arguable that a stay would not result in harm to O\u2019Keefe,\n\n\"the Court has no reason to believe that there are assets [of Loewen] in this case which would not dissipate or that the same assets which are subject to levy right now would still be there and subject to levy a year from now or eighteen months from now if there were an appeal allowed without the bond\".\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, Judge Graves referred to matters relied upon by O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel - the financial inability of Loewen to obtain the bond, the pendency of other lawsuits, that investors were looking to get out and that the price of the shares had plummeted. The critical finding in the judgment was:\n\n\"The Court... finds that there exists no viable alternative for securing this Plaintiff\u2019s interest absent the requirement of a [$625 million] bond pursuant to Rule 8.\"\n\n184.\n\nJudge Graves stressed that the Rule required that the amount of the bond was to give absolute security to the party affected by the appeal. If one accepts this interpretation of the Rules, and Judge Graves was bound by the interpretation, his decision did not reflect an error in principle. Further he took into consideration the various factors relied upon by the parties and, after weighing them, came up with a decision in favour of O\u2019Keefe.\n\n185.\n\nIt is not a decision which we would have reached on the materials before Judge Graves. That is because we would not read the Rules as having the purpose of securing absolute security for the verdict awarded, more particularly when (a) there was a strong case for regarding the verdict as excessive and one which should be set aside, (b) the provision of absolute security was beyond the capacity of the appellant and (c) the prosecution of an appeal without a stay would work an injustice and in all probability foreclose the possibility of an appeal, eventualities rendered the more likely by the sheer size of the bond stipulated by Rule 8(a).\n\n186.\n\nWe repeat what we said earlier, that Claimants make no challenge to the bonding requirement in Rule 8(a) notwithstanding the potential harshness of its operation. That operation constitutes a very good reason for interpreting the discretion conferred by Rule 8(b) more liberally than it was construed by the Mississippi courts.\n\n187.\n\nAfter this case, the Mississippi Supreme Court made changes to its Rules, in particular Rule 8, which would preclude what happened before Judge Graves, and later what happened on appeal. The changes acknowledge that Rule 8,could operate in an extreme way so as to produce an unjust result. But the challenge here is not to Rule 8,a); it is to the way Rule 8,was applied.\n\n188.\n\nIt was common ground between the parties that there is no principle of international law which requires a State to provide a right of appeal from a decision of its courts. Here the refusal to relax the bonding requirement was not a denial of the appeal. Loewen, at least in theory, could proceed with its appeal, albeit subject to the risk of execution, if it did not pursue the Chapter Eleven Bankruptcy option.\n\n189.\n\nClaimants submit that the decisions refusing to relax the bonding requirements were a violation of Article 1105, because there was a procedural denial of justice, there was a denial of fair and equitable treatment and a denial of full protection and security. Notwithstanding the criticisms already made of Judge Graves\u2019 decision, that decision does not transgress the minimum standard of treatment mandated by Article 1105. It was at worst an erroneous or mistaken decision.\n\n190.\n\nOn November 30, 1995, the Supreme Court of Mississippi granted an interim stay of execution on the judgment, conditional on the posting of a bond in the sum of $125,000,000. On December 20, 1995, the Supreme Court extended the stay indefinitely, pending further order of the court.\n\n191.\n\nAt this time Loewen was considering raising further capital by way of equity and debt. Loewen\u2019s lawyers were examining the effect of an equity, raising on the court\u2019s appreciation of its ability to post a $625,000,000 bond.\n\n192.\n\nOn December 12, 1995, Loewen filed in the Mississippi Supreme Court an addendum to their motion for a stay, informing the court of their intention to file a preliminary prospectus for an offering of preferred securities to the public in Canada. The proceeds of the offering would be deposited with a trustee for the funding of acquisitions of funeral homes, cemeteries and related businesses. Although not available to fund a supersedeas bond, the use of the funds for acquisitions would benefit O\u2019Keefe by increasing Loewen\u2019s underlying value.\n\n193.\n\nWhile the appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court was pending Loewen issued new stock in the Canadian equity market to fund new acquisitions and was preparing to raise an additional $200 million in a debt offering.\n\n194.\n\nOn December 17, 1995, Raymond Loewen and others conducted a conference call with financial institutions in Canada concerning an offer of some $200 million convertible preferred shares. In response to questions, Raymond Loewen stated that\n\n\"... the Supreme Court in Mississippi has already given us one stay, and we are now waiting for the permanent stay, and the permanent reduction of the bond, and there is every reason to believe that in fact we will get that. In addition to that, our company we believe is - we are quite confident that with our banks and with our investment bankers we will be able to deal with the very worst case scenario\".\n\nAnd, in response to a question about the punitive damages owed Raymond Loewen said:\n\n\"Obviously, we don\u2019t think that a 500 million liquidity thing will ever come, but being a responsible corporation we have the contingency plan for every possible contingency, and we\u2019ve looked at that, discussed it with our bankers, and we have a plan which we believe would address that without any major long-term harm on liquidity after a brief to adjust that.\"\n\n195.\n\nOn January 23, 1996, Loewen\u2019s lawyers pointed out the tactical dangers of raising money to fund the existing acquisition obligations, but not the bond. They noted that Loewen\u2019s Mississippi counsel thought that this course would result in loss of credibility and could result in loss of the stay. The current settlement strategy advised by the lawyers was to get Loewen to the point where it could post the $625 million, ask the Court to be relieved of that burden and point out to O\u2019Keefe the need for them to settle before the court acted or the bond was posted.\n\n196.\n\nOn January 24, 1996, the Supreme Court of Mississippi with two dissentients dismissed defendants\u2019 motion for stay of execution, and ordered that the interim stay entered on November 30 and extended on December 20, 1995 be dissolved with effect from 1200 pm on January 31, 1996. The Court did not give reasons for its decision. The Court\u2019s formal order simply recited:\n\n\"The Court finds that the question before it is whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to lower the amount of the supersedeas bond at Appellants\u2019 request. The Court finds no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to lower the amount of the supersedeas bond, and that the trial court properly followed M.R.A.P.8.\"\n\n197.\n\nWhether the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on this point was appropriate or not, it stands in the same position as Judge Graves\u2019 decision under appeal. The Supreme Court's ruling did not transgress the minimum standard of treatment under Article 1105.\n\n198.\n\nOn January 25, 1996, a memorandum was circulated within the Loewen Group reporting the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and informing readers that the Group was currently pursuing three alternative avenues:\n\n(1) securing funds to finance the bond;\n\n(2) negotiating a reasonable settlement;\n\n(3) filing for Chapter Eleven Bankruptcy protection without posting a bond. Chapter Eleven was considered to be by far the least desirable but would be utilised if absolutely necessary.\n\n199.\n\nOn January 25, 1996, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers wrote to defendants\u2019 lawyers advising that they would start execution on all Loewen\u2019s property in Mississippi and other states at noon on January 31, adding:\n\n\"... we are willing to give you a second chance to resolve this case and avoid bankruptcy. However, I am renewing my offer to resolve this case for four hundred and seventy-five million dollars\".\n\nRespondent suggests that Loewen would have discounted O\u2019Keefe\u2019s threats to levy execution on the judgment because O\u2019Keefe would have been deterred by the potential liability for damages it would face if, ultimately, the judgment was set aside. In our view, Loewen was entitled to treat the threat of prompt execution on some of its assets in Mississippi as real and as having adverse consequences for market perceptions of Loewen.\n\n200.\n\nOn January 27 and 28, 1996, Loewen\u2019s lawyers were drafting and redrafting an application to the Hon Justice Scalia, as Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit, for a stay of execution pending the filing of a petition for writ of *certiorari.* The petition invited the court to take up a question unresolved in *Pennzoil v Texaco, Inc.* 481 U.S. 1 (1987) whether it comports with due process of law to condition a stay on execution on the posting of a bond that serves no purpose where the defendant cannot obtain such a bond, and where the defendant\u2019s inability to post the bond could result in severe, irreparable harm before the defendant has the chance to obtain appellate review.\n\n201.\n\nDuring the night of January 27/28, 1996, an informal agreement was reached and recorded, in a handwritten document, which was not signed formally until February 1, 1996. On January 29, 1996, Loewen announced the settlement in a press release:\n\n\"We are confident of a successful appeal, but it would have meant several years of financial uncertainty at significant cost to the Company... After analysing the financial and other alternatives we determined that, at this time, a settlement is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\"\n\n202.\n\nOn February 1, 1996, the formal settlement agreement was executed. On the same day the parties executed an Absolute Release with Indemnity Agreement and Covenants.\n\n203.\n\nOn February 2, 1996, on the joint motion of all parties, the Supreme Court of Mississippi dismissed Loewen\u2019s appeal with prejudice, revesting the Circuit Court with jurisdiction to consummate a release, settlement and dismissal of the suit on the terms described in the parties\u2019 joint motion to dismiss. The order of January 24, 1996 was vacated and dissolved, *nunc pro tunc,* so that the amount of the required bond reverted to $125 million. The order was conditional on the performance of the monetary part of the agreed settlement.\n\n204.\n\nOn February 2, 1996, Judge Graves ordered:\n\n(i) that the bond be released and discharged; and\n\n(ii) that (subject to performance of the settlement agreement) the judgment of 6 November 1996 was satisfied and cancelled.\n\n**XXVI. DOES THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OPERATE TO RELEASE ALL CLAIMS AGAINST RESPONDENT?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nIt is convenient to deal here with an argument based on a release of claims provided for by the settlement agreement. Respondent submitted that, on its true construction, the settlement agreement operated to release all claims by Loewen, including the NAFTA claims in issue in this arbitration, against Respondent, notwithstanding that Respondent is not a party to the agreement. The argument is based on the release executed by Loewen which forms part and is exhibited as \"Exhibit C\" to the settlement agreement. The release is a release by Loewen of all claims whatsoever that Loewen may have against the O\u2019Keefe interests and persons affiliated with the O\u2019Keefe interests. The release incorporates the accord and satisfaction of \"all claims and causes of action as against the Releases and all other persons, firms, and/or corporations having any liability in the premises\". The instrument further provides that the release extends and applies to future claims. The release is expressed to be governed by the law of Mississippi.\n\n206.\n\nRespondent relies on the \"intent\" rule of construction in force in Mississippi. Respondent\u2019s argument is that, according to this rule in determining whether a person falls within the class of persons intended to take the benefit of a release, a relevant factor to be taken into account is that the person is not a stranger to the agreement and has given consideration. Respondent submits that the State of Mississippi was not a stranger and gave consideration in that it dismissed the appeal and made judicial orders as requested by the parties. The answer to Respondent\u2019s submission is that when the settlement agreement and the release are read in their entirety and in context, we do not regard them as releasing Loewen\u2019s NAFTA claims. They lie outside the ambit of the claims dealt with.\n\n**XXVII. DID LOEWEN PURSUE AVAILABLE LOCAL REMEDIES?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nIn the light of the conclusions reached in para 156, the next question is whether the appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court was an available remedy which Loewen should have pursued before it could establish that the verdict and judgment at trial constituted a measure \"adopted or maintained\" by Respondent amounting to a violation of Art. 1105. Respondent argues that confronted with the adverse bonding decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court, Loewen should have (i) pursued its appeal despite the risk of execution on its assets; or (ii) sought protection under Chapter Eleven of the Bankruptcy Code which would have resulted in a stay of execution against Loewen\u2019s assets; or (iii) filed a petition for *certiorari* and sought a stay of execution in the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n208.\n\nThe first alternative suggested by Respondent raises the question whether the appeal is \"a reasonably available remedy\", having regard to the risk of execution against Loewen\u2019s assets if the bond was not posted. Here, the bonding requirement is attached, not to the right of appeal, but to the stay of execution. Granted the distinction, the practical impact of the requirement had severe consequences for Loewen\u2019s right of appeal. Without posting the bond, Loewen\u2019s right of appeal could be exercised only at the risk of sustaining immediate execution on Loewen\u2019s assets in Mississippi, to be followed by execution against Loewen\u2019s assets in other States, with the inevitable consequence that Loewen\u2019s share price would collapse. In this respect, we reject Respondent\u2019s contention that the risk of execution was remote and theoretical. It is possible that O\u2019Keefe may have exercised some restraint in relation to execution lest it might ultimately lose the appeal and suffer financial consequences by reason of executions which could not be justified. But this possibility does not persuade us that the risk of immediate execution was other than real. In these circumstances, if exercising the right of appeal, at the risk of immediate execution on Loewen\u2019s Mississippi assets, was the only alternative available to Loewen, it would not have been, \"a reasonably available remedy\" to Loewen.\n\n209.\n\nFiling under Chapter Eleven of the Bankruptcy Code would have resulted in a stay of execution. In this respect, Chapter Eleven would have enabled Loewen\u2019s appeal to proceed without generating all the consequences that would have flowed from execution. Chapter Eleven results in re-organization not in liquidation, so that a company can continue to conduct its business under Court supervision. Although Court supervision would not necessarily bring to an end Loewen\u2019s acquisitions program, Court supervision could be expected to restrict and moderate the program. Quite apart from that consequence, a Chapter Eleven filing may have had an effect on the public market perception of Loewen with a detrimental impact on its share price. The question then is whether, in these circumstances, the need to pursue local remedies extends to requiring a claimant to file under Chapter Eleven in order to ensure that a right of appeal remains effective and reasonably available. No doubt there are some situations in which it would be reasonable to expect an impecunious claimant to file under Chapter Eleven in order to exercise an available right of appeal. Whether it was reasonable to expect Loewen to file under Chapter Eleven depends at least in part on the reasons why Loewen elected to enter into the settlement agreement in preference to exercising other options, a matter examined in paras. 214-216 (inclusive).\n\n210.\n\nThe third alternative is the petition for *certiorari* coupled with the application for a stay. There is a conflict of opinion about the prospects of success of such an application between Professor Drew S. Days III (former United States Solicitor-General) and Professor Tribe. Professor Days is of the opinion that Loewen would have had \"a reasonable opportunity\" of obtaining review by the Supreme Court of the United States of the application of the Mississippi bonding requirement on the ground that it prevented, inconsistently with due process, appellate review of the Mississippi trial court judgment. Professor Tribe is of a contrary opinion. He bases his opinion on a number of grounds. First, the case was fact-intensive and the Court is very unlikely to review a fact-intensive case. Secondly, there was a dispute between the parties as to whether the bonding requirement precluded judicial review of the judgment. The Mississippi Supreme Court did not make such a finding and did not adopt Loewen\u2019s version of the facts. Thirdly, the presence of a substantial punitive damages award was irrelevant to the issues which the Supreme Court would have been called upon to decide.\n\n211.\n\nThis Tribunal is not in a position to decide whether the opinion of Professor Days or that of Professor Tribe is to be preferred. Nor is the Tribunal in a position to decide which of their conflicting opinions is to be preferred on a related question, namely whether collateral review was available in the Federal District Court. But the Tribunal notes that Professor Days does not assert that either the Supreme Court or the Federal Court would grant the relief suggested. It is fair to say that, on his view, there was a prospect, at most a reasonable prospect or possibility, of such relief being granted.\n\n212.\n\nThe decision not to relax the bonding requirement, an act for which Respondent is responsible in international law, generated the risk of immediate execution with its attendant detrimental consequences for Loewen. In this situation, was either the *certiorari* petition or the collateral review option a reasonably available and adequate remedy? The pursuit of either remedy, more particularly the Supreme Court remedy, if it resulted in a failure to obtain a stay, would worsen Loewen\u2019s position and reinforce adverse market perceptions about Loewen. So, the absence of any certainty about the outcome of either option is a significant consideration in deciding whether either option involved an adequate remedy which was reasonably available to Loewen.\n\n213.\n\nEntry into the settlement agreement no doubt reflected a business judgment by Loewen that, of the various options then open, settlement was the most attractive, in all probability because it provided certainty. Other alternatives involved financial consequences which would not have been easy to predict.\n\n214.\n\nRespondent argues that, because entry into the settlement agreement was a matter of business judgment, Loewen voluntarily decided not to pursue its local remedies. That submission does not dispose of the point. The question is whether the remedies in question were reasonably available and adequate. If they were not, it is not to the point that Loewen entered into the settlement, even as a matter of business judgment. It may be that the business judgment was inevitable or the natural outcome of adverse consequences generated by the impugned court decision.\n\n215.\n\nHere we encounter the central difficulty in Loewen\u2019s case. Loewen failed to present evidence disclosing its reasons for entering into the settlement agreement in preference to pursuing other options, in particular the Supreme Court option which it had under active consideration and preparation until the settlement agreement was reached. It is a matter on which the onus of proof rested with Loewen. It is, however, not just a matter of onus of proof. If, in all the circumstances, entry into the settlement agreement was the only course which Loewen could reasonably be expected to take, that would be enough to justify an inference or conclusion that Loewen had no reasonably available and adequate remedy.\n\n216.\n\nAlthough entry into the settlement agreement may well have been a reasonable course for Loewen to take, we are simply left to speculate on the reasons which led to the decision to adopt that course rather than to pursue other options. It is not a case in which it can be said that it was the only course which Loewen could reasonably be expected to take.\n\n217.\n\nAccordingly, our conclusion is that Loewen failed to pursue its domestic remedies, notably the Supreme Court option and that, in consequence, Loewen has not shown a violation of customary international law and a violation of NAFTA for which Respondent is responsible.\n\n**XXVIII. A PRIVATE AGREEMENT IS NOT A GOVERNMENT MEASURE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF NAFTA CHAPTER ELEVEN**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nRespondent argues that a private agreement to settle litigation out of court is not a \"government measure\" within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven (ground 3 of Respondent\u2019s objection to competence and jurisdiction). The argument may well be correct as a general proposition. But the Claimants\u2019 case rests on the judgment and judicial orders made by the Mississippi trial court and the Mississippi Supreme Court. Claimants\u2019 case is that these judicial acts are the relevant government measures within NAFTA Chapter Eleven, not that the settlement is such a measure. This ground of objection is overruled.\n\n**XXIX. THE JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION TO MR RAYMOND LOEWEN\u2019S CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThis objection is dealt with together with the Respondent\u2019s additional objection to competence and jurisdiction.\n\n**XXX. RESPONDENT\u2019S ADDITIONAL OBJECTION TO COMPETENCE AND JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nSubsequent to the October 2001 hearings on the merits, events occurred which raised questions about TLGI\u2019s capacity to pursue its NAFTA claims and gave rise to Respondent filing a further objection to competence and jurisdiction on January 25, 2002. TLGI had filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and a reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy courts of the United States and Canada. Under that plan, TLGI ceased to exist as a business entity. All of its business operations were reorganized as a United States corporation. In apparent recognition of the obvious problem that would be caused by a United States entity pursuing a claim against the United States under NAFTA, TLGI, immediately prior to its going out of business, assigned all of its right, title and interest to the NAFTA claim to a newly created corporation (discreetly called Nafcanco - a play on the words NAFTA and Canada). It would appear that the NAFTA claim is the only asset of Nafcanco, and the pursuit of the claim its only business.\n\n221.\n\nFollowing the filing of Respondent\u2019s objection, appropriate pleadings were filed by both sides and on June 6, 2002, the Tribunal held a hearing on the objection. Canada and Mexico again submitted their views on the issues that were raised at the hearing.\n\n222.\n\nNAFTA is a treaty intending to promote trade and investment between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Since most international investment occurs in the private sector, investment treaties frequently seek to provide some kind of protection for persons engaging in such investment. Until fairly recently, such protection was implemented and pursued by the States themselves. When Mexico expropriated the investment of some American oil companies many years ago, the claims of the American companies were pursued by American diplomatic authorities. When the United States seized the assets of Iranian nationals during the hostage crisis of the 1970s, Iran and the United States worked out a settlement as sovereign nations.\n\n223.\n\nChapter Eleven of NAFTA represents a progressive development in international law whereby the individual investor may make a claim on its own behalf and submit the claim to international arbitration, as TLGI has done in the instant case. The format of NAFTA is clearly intended to protect the investors of one Contracting Party against unfair practices occurring in one of the other Contracting Parties. It was not intended to and could not affect the rights of American investors in relation to practices of the United States that adversely affect such American investors. Claims of that nature can only be pursued under domestic law and it is inconceivable that sovereign nations would negotiate treaties to supplement or modify domestic law as it applies to their own residents. Such a collateral effect on the domestic laws of the NAFTA Parties was clearly not within their contemplation when the treaty was negotiated.\n\n224.\n\nIf NAFTA could be used to assert the rights of an American investor in the instant case, it would in effect create a collateral appeal from the decision of the Mississippi courts, by definition a unit of the United States government. As was pointed out earlier, the object of NAFTA is to protect outsiders who do not have access to the political or other avenues by which to seek relief from nefarious practices of governmental units.\n\n225.\n\nClaimant TLGI urges that since it had the requisite nationality at the time the claim arose, and, antedate the time that the claim was submitted, it is of no consequence that the present real party in interest - the beneficiary of the claim - is an American citizen. Both as a matter of historical and current international precedent, this argument must fail. In international law parlance, there must be continuous national identity from the date of the events giving rise to the claim, which date is known as the *dies a quo,* through the date of the resolution of the claim, which date is known as the *dies ad quem.*\n\n226.\n\nClaimants\u2019 first argument strand is that NAFTA itself, in Articles 1116 and 1117, require nationality only to the date of submission. However, those articles deal only with nationality requirements at the *dies a quo,* the beginning date of the claim. There is no language in those articles, or anywhere else in the treaty, which deals with the question of whether nationality must continue to the time of resolution of the claim. It is that silence in the Treaty that requires the application of customary international law to resolve the question of the need for continuous national identity.\n\n227.\n\nNor does the recent arbitral decision in the *Mondev case* help Claimants in any way. In that case, the Tribunal dealt with the issue of whether the investment itself had to remain of the claimant\u2019s identity. Significantly, the reasoning of the Tribunal implicated other sections of NAFTA, namely Articles 1105 and 1110. The investment in *Mondev,* some Boston real estate, had been foreclosed on by an American mortgage holder. Even though it denied Mondev\u2019s claim on the merits, the Tribunal appropriately found that the loss of the investment through foreclosure of the mortgage could not be the basis for denying Mondev\u2019s right to pursue its remedies under NAFTA. It pointed out that such a set of events could occur quite often to indenters and that the whole purpose of NAFTA\u2019s protection would be frustrated if such disputes could not be pursued. It said:\n\n\"Secondly the Tribunal would again observe that Article 1105, and even more so Article 1110, will frequently have to be applied after the investment in question has failed. In most cases, the dispute submitted to arbitration will concern precisely the question of responsibility for that failure. To require the claimant to maintain a continuing status as an investor under the law of the host State at the time the arbitration is commenced would tend to frustrate the very purpose of Chapter 11, which is to provide protection to investors against wrongful conduct including uncompensated expropriation of their investment and to do so throughout the lifetime of an investment up to the moment of its \"sale or other disposition\" (Article 1101(2)). On that basis, the Tribunal concludes that NAFTA should be interpreted broadly to cover any legal claims arising out of the treatment of an investment as defined in Article 1139, whether or not the investment subsists as such at the time of the treatment which is complained of. Otherwise issues of the effective protection of investment at the international level will be overshadowed by technical questions of the application of local property laws and the classification of local property interests affected by foreclosure or other action subsequent to the failure of the investment.\"\n\n228.\n\nIn sum, neither the language of the Treaty, nor any of the cases decided under it answers the question as to whether continuous nationality is required until the resolution of the claim. Respondent correctly contends that Article 1131 requires the Tribunal to decide the issues in dispute in accordance with \"applicable rules of international law\".\n\n229.\n\nThere is only limited dispute as to the history of the requirement of continuous nationality to the end of any international proceeding. When investment claims were negotiated and resolved only at a governmental level, any change in nationality of the claimant defeated the only reason for the negotiations to continue. The claiming government no longer had a citizen to protect. This history has changed as the nature of the claim process has changed. As claimants have been allowed to prosecute claims in their own right more often, provision has been made for amelioration of the strict requirement of continuous nationality. But those provisions have been specifically spelled out in the various treaties that TLGI cites as proof that international law has changed. Thus, in the claims settlement agreement between Iran and the United States arising out of the hostage crisis, the requirement of continuous nationality was specifically altered in the agreement. Many of the bilateral investment treaties, the so-called \"BITs\", contain specific modifications of the requirement. But such specific provisions in other treaties and agreements only hinder TLGI\u2019s contentions, since NAFTA has no such specific provision.\n\n230.\n\nAs with most hoary international rules of law, the requirement of continuous nationality was grounded in comity. It was not normally the business of one nation to be interfering into the manner in which another nation handled its internal commerce. Such interference would be justified only to protect the interests of one of its own nationals. If that tie were ended, so was the justification. As international law relaxed to allow aggrieved parties to pursue remedies directly, rather than through diplomatic channels, the need for a rigid rule of *dies ad quem* also was relaxed. But as was previously noted, such relaxations came about specifically in the language of the treaties. There is no such language in the NAFTA document and there are substantial reasons why the Tribunal should not stretch the existing language to affect such a change.\n\n231.\n\nWe address at this stage an aspect of the problem which might well puzzle a private lawyer. Such a lawyer would of course be familiar with the inhibitions which can stand in the way of the enforcement of liabilities when changes in corporate status, or in the proprietorship of the claims, intervene after the proceedings to enforce the claim have commenced. Insolvency or judicial administration or a moratorium may affect one of the parties so that under the relevant domestic law the liability ceases to be enforceable for a while, or is compulsorily transferred to a third party, or entirely changes its juristic character, or may become a right to share in the proceedings of a winding up. Equally, the lawyer would recognise the potential for difficulties in enforcing a liability after a voluntary transfer to a third party, when the right to pursue the complaint may be enforceable only by the transferee, or only in the name of the transferor for the benefit of the transferee; and he could well foresee that particular difficulties could arise when, under an arbitration agreement between A and B, the former begins an arbitration, and afterwards transfers the right to C, a stranger to the arbitration agreement. These are no more than examples. These procedural difficulties are of a kind which many domestic systems of law have confronted.\n\n232.\n\nThe same lawyer might well, however, have much more difficulty in visualising the outcome in the quite different situation where, through subsequent events of the kind indicated above, a vested claim, already the subject of valid proceedings, simply ceases to exist, together with the breach of obligation or delict which have brought it into being. True, it is possible to imagine that a change of identity with a consequent change of nationality by the enforcing party might deprive a tribunal of territorial jurisdiction under its domestic rules of procedure. This is not the present case. If the submissions of the United States are right, the fatal objection to success by the Claimants is that a NAFTA claim cannot exist or cannot any longer exist, once the diversity of nationality has come to an end, so that the Tribunal cannot continue with the resolution of the original dispute, there being no dispute left to resolve. The private lawyer might well exclaim that the uncovenanted benefit to the defendant would produce a result so unjust that it could be sustained only by irrefutable logic or compelling precedent, and neither exists. The spontaneous disappearance of a vested cause of action must be the rarest of incidents, and no warrant has been shown for it in the present context.\n\n233.\n\nSuch a reaction, though understandable, in our opinion, would be, wholly misplaced. Rights of action under private law arise from personal obligations (albeit they may be owed by or to a State) brought into existence by domestic law and enforceable through domestic tribunals and courts. NAFTA claims have a quite different character, stemming from a corner of public international law in which, by treaty, the power of States under that law to take international measures for the correction of wrongs done to its nationals has been replaced by an ad hoc definition of certain kinds of wrong, coupled with specialist means of compensation. These means are both distinct from and exclusive of the remedies for wrongful acts under private law: see Articles 1121, 1131, 2021 and 2022. It is true that some aspects of the resolution of disputes arising in relation to private international commerce are imported into the NAFTA system via Article 1120.1(c), and that the handling of disputes within that system by professionals experienced in the handling of major international arbitrations has tended in practice to make a NAFTA arbitration look like the more familiar kind of process. But this apparent resemblance is misleading. The two forms of process, and the rights which they enforce, have nothing in common. There is no warrant for transferring rules derived from private law into a field of international law where claimants are permitted for convenience to enforce what are in origin the rights of Party states. If the effects of a change of ownership are to be ascertained we must do so, not by inapt analogies with private law rules, but from the words of Chapter Eleven, read in the context of the Treaty as a whole, and of the purpose which it sets out to achieve.\n\n234.\n\nTLGI urges some equitable consideration be given because it was the underlying Mississippi litigation which brought about the need for it to file bankruptcy in the first place. We have already rehearsed our view of the inequities that befell TLGI in that litigation, and a chancery court would certainly take such claims into account in assessing damages. But this is an international tribunal whose jurisdiction stems from and is limited to the words of the NAFTA treaty. Whatever the reasons for TLGI\u2019s decision to follow the bankruptcy route it chose, the consequences broke the chain of nationality that the Treaty requires.\n\n235.\n\nClaimants also seek to rely on provisions of the Convention establishing the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It claims that under ICSID, there are different nationality rules that should be applied in this case. First, it must be noted that neither Canada nor Mexico are signatories of ICSID and it would be most strange to apply provisions of that Convention to a NAFTA dispute. The only relevance of ICSID to this proceeding is that the Parties have elected to function under its structure. That election cannot be used to change or supplement the substance of the Treaty that the three nations have entered into. Whatever specificity ICSID has on the requirement of continuous nationality through the resolution of the dispute only points up the absence of such provisions in NAFTA. Claimants have not shown that international law has evolved to the position where continuous nationality to the time of resolution is no longer required.\n\n236.\n\nTLGI further contends that the International Law Commission issued a report which proposed eliminating the continuous nationality rule even in cases of diplomatic protection, a field that would seem more nationality oriented than the protection of investors. The report itself met with criticism in many quarters and from many points of view. In any event, the ILC is far from approving any recodification based on the report.\n\n237.\n\nArticle 1109 fully authorizes transfers of property by an investor. TLGI contends that such provision for free assignment somehow strengthens its position. The assignment from TLGI to Nafcanco is not being challenged, except as to what is being assigned. By the terms of the assignment, the only item being assigned was this NAFTA claim. All of the assets and business of TLGI have been reorganized under the mantle of an American corporation. All of the benefits of any award would clearly inure to the American corporation. Such a naked entity as Nafcanco, even with its catchy name, cannot qualify as a continuing national for the purposes of this proceeding. Claimants also urge that TLGI remains in existence, since its charter remains in existence. The Tribunal is being asked to look at form rather than substance to resolve a complicated claim under an international treaty. Even if TLGI has some kind of ethereal existence, it sought to place any remaining NAFTA marbles in the Nafcanco ring. Claimants insist that Respondent is asking the Tribunal to \"pierce\" the corporate veil of Nafcanco and point out the legal complications involved in such a piercing. The Tribunal sees no need to enter into that thicket. The question is whether there is any remaining Canadian entity capable of pursuing the NAFTA claim.\n\n238.\n\nClaimants state that there were good and sufficient business reasons for reorganizing under an American corporate character including pressure from TLGI\u2019s creditors. The Tribunal has no reasons to doubt the legitimacy of those reasons but the choices made clearly had consequences under the Treaty. There might have been equally compelling reasons for the Loewen interests to choose a United States mantle when it first commenced doing business. NAFTA does not recognize such business choices as a substitute for its jurisdictional requirements under its provisions and under international law.\n\n239.\n\nRaymond Loewen argues that his claims under NAFTA survive the reorganization. Respondent originally objected to Raymond Loewen\u2019s claims on the ground that he no longer had control over his stock at the commencement of the proceeding. The Tribunal allowed Raymond Loewen to continue in the proceeding to determine whether he in fact continued any stock holding in the company. No evidence was adduced to establish his interest and he certainly was not a party in interest at the time of the reorganization of TLGI.\n\n240.\n\nIn regard to the question of costs the Tribunal is of the view that the dispute raised difficult and novel questions of far-reaching importance for each party, and the Tribunal therefore makes no award of costs.\n\n**ORDERS**\n----------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Tribunal unanimously decides -\n\n(1) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine TLGI\u2019s claims under NAFTA concerning the decisions of United States courts in consequence of TLGI\u2019s assignment of those claims to a Canadian corporation owned and controlled by a United States corporation.\n\n(2) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine Raymond L. Loewen\u2019s claims under NAFTA concerning decisions of the United States courts on the ground that it was not shown that he owned or controlled directly or indirectly TLGI when the claims were submitted to arbitration or after TLGI was reorganized under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\n\n(3) TLGI\u2019s claims and Raymond L. Loewen\u2019s are hereby dismissed in their entirety.\n\n(4) That each party shall bear its own costs, and shall bear equally the expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretariat.\n\n**XXXI. CONCLUSION**\n--------------------\n\n241.\n\nWe think it right to add one final word. A reader following our account of the injustices which were suffered by Loewen and Mr. Raymond Loewen in the Courts of Mississippi could well be troubled to find that they emerge from the present long and costly proceedings with no remedy at all. After all, we have held that judicial wrongs may in principle be brought home to the State Party under Chapter Eleven, and have criticised the Mississippi proceedings in the strongest terms. There was unfairness here towards the foreign investor. Why not use the weapons at hand to put it right? What clearer case than the present could there be for the ideals of NAFTA to be given some teeth?\n\n242.\n\nThis human reaction has been present in our minds throughout but we must be on guard against allowing it to control our decision. Far from fulfilling the purposes of NAFTA, an intervention on our part would compromise them by obscuring the crucial separation between the international obligations of the State under NAFTA, of which the fair treatment of foreign investors in the judicial sphere is but one aspect, and the much broader domestic responsibilities of every nation towards litigants of whatever origin who appear before its national courts. Subject to explicit international agreement permitting external control or review, these latter responsibilities are for each individual state to regulate according to its own chosen appreciation of the ends of justice. As we have sought to make clear, we find nothing in NAFTA to justify the exercise by this Tribunal of an appellate function parallel to that which belongs to the courts of the host nation. In the last resort, a failure by that nation to provide adequate means of remedy may amount to an international wrong but only in the last resort. The line may be hard to draw, but it is real. Too great a readiness to step from outside into the domestic arena, attributing the shape of an international wrong to what is really a local error (however serious), will damage both the integrity of the domestic judicial system and the viability of NAFTA itself. The natural instinct, when someone observes a miscarriage of justice, is to step in and try to put it right, but the interests of the international investing community demand that we must observe the principles which we have been appointed to apply, and stay our hands."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2004-09-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 26,2003, the Tribunal delivered its Award on Respondent's motion of January 2002, including its decision on the merits.\n\n2.\n\nBy its Award on Respondent's motion, the Tribunal decided unanimously:\n\n\"(1) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine TLGI's claims under NAFTA concerning the decisions of United States courts in consequence of TLGI's assignment of those claims to a Canadian corporation owned and controlled by a United States corporation.\n\n(2) That it lacks jurisdiction to determine Raymond L. Loewen's claims under NAFTA concerning decisions of the United States courts on the ground that it was not shown that he owned or controlled directly or indirectly TLGI when the claims were submitted to arbitration or after TLGI was reorganized under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\n\n(3) TLGI's claims and Raymond L. Loewen's are hereby dismissed in their entirety.\n\n(4) That each party shall bear its own costs, and shall bear equally the expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretariat.\"\n\n3.\n\nIn its decision on the merits, the Tribunal concluded, again unanimously\n\n\"that Loewen failed to pursue its domestic remedies, notably the Supreme Court option and that, in consequence, Loewen has not shown a violation of customary international law and a violation of NAFTA for which Respondent is responsible\"\n\nand that\n\n\"the claims of Loewen and Mr Raymond Loewen should be dismissed in their entirety\".\n\n4.\n\nMaterial to the Tribunal's conclusions recited in the preceding paragraph were the following paragraphs in the Decision:\n\n\"213. Entry into the settlement agreement no doubt reflected a business judgment by Loewen that, of the various options then open, settlement was the most attractive, in all probability because it provided certainty. Other alternatives involved financial consequences which would not have been easy to predict.\n\n214. Respondent argues that, because entry into the settlement\u00a0agreement was a matter of business judgment, Loewen\u00a0voluntarily decided not to pursue its local remedies. That\u00a0submission does not dispose of the point. The question is\u00a0whether the remedies in question were reasonably available and\u00a0adequate. If they were not, it is not to the point that Loewen\u00a0entered into the settlement, even as a matter of business\u00a0judgment. It may be that the business judgment was inevitable\u00a0or the natural outcome of adverse consequences generated by\u00a0the impugned court decision.\n\n215. Here we encounter the central difficulty in Loewen's case.\u00a0Loewen failed to present evidence disclosing its reasons for\u00a0entering into the settlement agreement in preference to pursuing\u00a0other options, in particular the Supreme Court option which it\u00a0had under active consideration and preparation until the\u00a0settlement agreement was reached. It is a matter on which the\u00a0onus of proof rested with Loewen. It is, however, not just a\u00a0matter of onus of proof. If, in all the circumstances, entry into\u00a0the settlement agreement was the only course which Loewen\u00a0could reasonably be expected to take, that would be enough to\u00a0justify an inference or conclusion that Loewen had no\u00a0reasonably available and adequate remedy.\n\n216. Although entry into the settlement agreement may well have\u00a0been a reasonable course for Loewen to take, we are simply left\u00a0to speculate on the reasons which led to the decision to adopt that course rather than to pursue other options. It is not a case in which it can be said that it was the only course which Loewen\u00a0could reasonably be expected to take.\"\n\n5.\n\nOn August 11, 2003, Respondent filed a request for a Supplementary Decision pursuant to art. 58 of the ICSID (Additional Facility) Rules. By the its request, Respondent sought a supplementary decision clarifying the Tribunal's disposition of Raymond Loewen's claims under art. 1116 of NAFTA.\n\n**PROCEDURE**\n-------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal, by letter dated August 22, 2003, invited Claimants to submit observations on Respondent's Request on or before September 19, 2003.\n\n7.\n\nLoewen, by letter dated September 17,2003, informed the Tribunal that it did not intend to submit comments on Respondent's Request.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 19, 2003, Mr John R. Lewis Jr and Ms Christina Arangiosa of Montgomery, McCracken Walker & Rhodes LLP and Mr D. Geoffrey Cowper QC of Fasken Martineau Du Moulin LLP filed submissions as to Raymond Loewen's art. 1116 claim.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated November 27,2003 the Tribunal informed the parties that it would proceed to deal with Respondent's request for a supplementary decision. The Tribunal directed Respondent to file a reply no later than December 19, 2003 and Raymond Loewen to file a rejoinder no later than January 9, 2004.\n\n10.\n\nBy that letter the Tribunal stated that it was then of the view that an oral hearing would be unnecessary but reserved Its position on that question until it received the reply and rejoinder.\n\n11.\n\nOn December 19, 2003, the Attorneys for Respondent, Mr Mark A. Clodfelter, Mr Barton Legum, Ms Andrea Menaker and Ms Jennifer Toole (U.S. Department of State) and Messrs Joseph Hunt. Vincent M. Garvey and Ronald V. Wiltsie Jnr (U.S. Department of Justice) filed Respondent's reply.\n\n12.\n\nOn January 9, 2003, Raymond Loewen's rejoinder was filed.\n\n13.\n\nOn the submissions presented by the parties, the question arises whether an oral hearing is necessary. Respondent submits that an oral hearing is unnecessary. We agree with Respondent on this point. The issue raised by Respondent's request is clear and is to be resolved by reference to the materials before the Tribunal, including the transcript of the oral hearing on the merits, the Award, the request and the submissions which have been filed. Nothing would be gained by a further oral hearing.\n\n**ARTICLE 58(1)**\n-----------------\n\n14.\n\nArticle 58(1) provides:\n\n\"Within 45 days after the date of the award either party, with notice to the other party may request the Tribunal, through the Secretary-General, to decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award.\"\n\n15.\n\nArticle 58(1) reflects art. 49(2) of the ICSID Convention which provides:\n\n\"[t]he Tribunal upon the request of a party... may decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award.\"\n\n**RESPONDENTS CASE**\n--------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent contends that, although the Award explicitly stated that ail claims (including Raymond Loewen's claims) were dismissed on the merits, it did not state expressly that his art. 1116 claims were dismissed on the merits. Respondent concedes that the Award was not \"silent\" as to the question but argues that further explication would resolve a minor ambiguity and that art. 58(1) extends to such a case.\n\n**RAYMOND LOEWEN'S CASE**\n-------------------------\n\n17.\n\nRaymond Loewen contends that the Tribunal omitted to decide his art. 1116 claim in the Award and that it is obligated to render a supplementary decision under art. 58. Raymond Loewen submits that the Tribunal overlooked the claim and that,in the course of determining it now, the Tribunal should consider whether its \"obiter dicta\" as to the merits require correction, as Raymond Loewen argues.\n\n18.\n\nCentral to the submission is the argument that paras 215-217 of the Award are in error and that the Tribunal overlooked the declarations of Mr Wynne S. Carvill and the Rt Hon John N. Turner. These declarations were before the Tribunal and were relied upon by Claimants at the oral hearings.\n\n**DISCUSSION**\n--------------\n\n19.\n\nWe agree that, apart from the dismissal In the Award of June 26, 2003 of all the claims \"in their entirety\", there is no distinct reference In the Award to a discussion of Raymond Loewen's claim under art. 1116. We agree also that, as there was no jurisdictional objection to his claim under art. 1116, that claim fell to be determined by the decision on the merits.\n\n20.\n\nBut the dismissal of all the claims \"in their entirety\" following the examination of the merits was necessarily a resolution of the art. 1116 claim. That dismissal was a consequence of the reasoning expressed in paras 213216. We therefore reject the argument that the Award did not deal with the art. 1116 claim.\n\n21.\n\nIt follows that Respondent is correct when it argues that Raymond Loewen is asking the Tribunal to reconsider its decision to dismiss that claim and to reconsider the reasoning (described by Raymond Loewen as \"obiter dicta\") which led the Tribunal to dismiss the claim. In the context of the dismissal of Loewen's claims, that reasoning was not merely \"obiter dicta\". It was the reasoning on which that part of the Award was based and it is not open to the Tribunal to reconsider It. There is no logical basis on which the Tribunal can draw a distinction between the relationship of that reasoning to the dismissal of the Loewen claims on the one hand and to the Raymond Loewen claim under art. 1116 on the other hand.\n\n22.\n\nWhile the Cargill and Turner declarations were relied upon to support a view contrary to that reached in paras 215-216 of the Award, they did not satisfy us, in all the circumstances, that the settlement agreement was the only course for Loewen to take. The declarations did not purport to present a comprehensive record or account of TLGI's Board's consideration of the option which it should pursue. Nor did the declarations record or identify the information presented to the Board on which it arrived at its conclusion that it should pursue the settlement option. The declarations did not ground an inference that the settlement option was the only available alternative or that certiorari petition and the bankruptcy petition were not available remedies.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n--------------\n\n23.\n\nThe request should not be granted because Raymond Loewen's art. 1106 claim was dealt with.\n\n**ORDERS**\n----------\n\n1. The request is refused.\n\n2. That each party shall bear its own costs and shall bear equally the\u00a0expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretariat."}]}
