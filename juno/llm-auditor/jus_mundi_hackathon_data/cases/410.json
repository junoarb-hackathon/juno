Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 11 October 2011 the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\"), dated the same, from Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. (\"Tulip\" or \"Claimant\"), a company constituted in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands, against the Republic of Turkey (\"Respondent\"). On 12 October 2011, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy to the Republic of Turkey.\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute is brought under the Agreement on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Turkey dated 27 March 1986 (the \"BIT\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID, registered the Request and notified the Parties, pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"Convention\") and in accordance with Institution Rules 6 and 7. The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28. In the same letter the Secretary-General invited the Parties to inform the Centre of any agreed provisions as to the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment as soon as possible.\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 November 2011, Respondent proposed, pursuant to Rule 2(1)(b) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"Rules\"), a procedure for constituting the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nOn 1 December 2011, Claimant appointed Michael Evan Jaffe, a national of the United States, as arbitrator in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 1 December 2011, the Centre informed the Parties that it understood that no agreement had been reached on the method of constituting the Arbitral Tribunal and that it would act on the appointment as soon as the method was established.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 27 December 2011, Claimant informed ICSID that it opted for the formula provided for in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention for the constitution of the Tribunal: that it consist of three arbitrators, with each party appointing an arbitrator, and the third, the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n8.\n\nOn 28 December 2011, ICSID's Secretary-General informed the Parties that, in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention and Rule 2(3) of the Rules, the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the parties. The Secretary-General also invited Claimant, in accordance with Rules 3(1)(a)(i) and (ii) to propose the name of a person who shall be the President of the Tribunal and invited Respondent to concur in this proposal or to propose another person as the President, and to appoint another arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nOn 10 January 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Michael Evan Jaffe accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, Respondent appointed Professor Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany, and informed the Centre that the Parties were cooperating to agree upon the President of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 January 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Professor Rolf Knieper accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n12.\n\nOn 23 March 2012, the Respondent informed ICSID that the Parties had reached an agreement on the appointment of Dr. Gavan Griffith, QC, a national of Australia, as the President of the Tribunal. On 26 March 2012, the Claimant confirmed that the Parties agreed to appoint Dr. Gavan Griffith, QC as President of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, ICSID's Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention and under Rule 6 of the Rules. The Tribunal is thus composed by (i) Michael Evan Jaffe (appointed by the Claimant), (ii) Professor Rolf Knieper (appointed by the Respondent) and (iii) Dr. Gavan Griffith (appointed by agreement of the Parties). The Centre also informed the Parties and the Tribunal that Ms. Martina Polasek, ICSID, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held the first session in Paris, France.\n\n15.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, after consultation with the Parties, Procedural Order No. 1 was issued by the President of the Tribunal, recording the parties' agreement and the Tribunal's decisions on a number of procedural matters. Among other things, it was agreed that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be the Rules in force as of April 2006 and that the place of proceedings would be Paris, France.\n\n16.\n\nOn 15 August 2012, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages together with three witness statements and one expert report.\n\n17.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation (the \"Application\") in accordance with the timetable established in Procedural Order No. 1, para. 13.\n\n18.\n\nOn 16 October 2012, the Tribunal invited Claimant to provide its observations to the Application by 26 October 2012.\n\n19.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, the Claimant filed its Reply to the Application (\"C Reply\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 1 November 2012, the Respondent's Counsel wrote to the Tribunal, protesting against the manner in which Respondent's position was characterised in C Reply and asserting that no factual inquiry is required for the Tribunal to decide Respondent's preliminary objection.\n\n**II. Claimant's Pleaded Case**\n-------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal summarises below Claimant's written case, as currently pleaded, to the extent it is relevant for the purposes of the Application. Some of the facts of the pleaded case are contested between the Parties and the summary does not constitute a finding as to the facts.\n\n22.\n\nClaimant's claims arise out of investments it made in several residential and commercial construction projects in Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey and in particular, the Ispartakule III project in Istanbul. The Ispartakule III project was promoted to foreign investors by Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi A.S. (\"Emlak\"), a company 100% controlled by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (\"TOKI\"). Claimant was the first foreign investor to do business directly with TOKI, which is part of Turkey's Prime Ministry.\n\n23.\n\nClaimant conducted its investments in Turkey by way of several special investment vehicles, including companies referred to as \"Tulip I,\" \"Tulip II\" and \"Tulip JV.\" Emlak and Tulip JV signed the Contract for Revenue-Sharing in Exchange for Sale of Parcels for the Ispartakule III Project (the \"Contract\") on 3 August 2006, and Tulip I took possession of the land from Emlak on behalf of Tulip JV a few days later.\n\n24.\n\nIt is claimed that actions taken by Respondent deprived Claimant of the entire value of its real estate development projects throughout Turkey and constitute breaches of the BIT and applicable international law; namely it is claimed:\n\na. Respondent failed to disclose pending zoning litigation in tender documents presented by Emlak and TOKI to Claimant, which resulted in a delay of two years until the commencement of construction, in September 2008, while Tulip JV waited for a construction permit.\n\nb. In January 2007, the government official who was head of both TOKI and Emlak informed Claimant's investors that he would terminate the Contract if the investors did not throw out the Turkish professionals who were part of Tulip JV and effectively hand over control of the project to a Turkish national recommended by the government official.\n\nc. Once construction commenced, Respondent's agencies Emlak and TOKI harassed Claimant by, *inter alia*, delaying approvals which should have been mere formalities; denying time extensions to cover delays for approvals which should have been mere formalities; denying time extensions to cover delays for which Emlak and TOKI themselves were responsible and threatening to terminate the Contract for vague and unjustifiable reasons.\n\nd. Respondent terminated the Contract in May 2010 - calling it a \"termination for delay\" - as a pretext for Respondent to take the project away from Claimant and seize all its assets associated with the Ispartakule III project as the delay could only be attributed to Respondent.\n\ne. Respondent forcibly seized the construction site with the aid of police and private security forces and summarily seized the performance bond that had been posted by Claimant.\n\nf. Respondent re-tendered the project while Claimant's court actions to nullify the termination of the Contract were still pending and the award of the new contract for the project was on less favourable terms to Respondent than under the contract with Claimant.\n\n25.\n\nClaimant argues that the above actions of the Respondent constitute breaches of the BIT and international law, including:\n\na. Respondent's obligation to ensure the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") of Claimant's investment (Article 3(1) of the BIT);\n\nb. Respondent's obligation to provide treatment that is not arbitrary or discriminatory;\n\nc. Respondent's obligation to accord at all times to Claimant's investment full protection and security (Article 3(2) of the BIT);\n\nd. Respondent's obligation to observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments (Article 3(2) of the BIT);\n\ne. Respondent's obligation to refrain from unlawful expropriation without compensation (Article 5 of the BIT); and\n\nf. Respondent's affirmative obligation to protect foreign investors.\n\n**III. Respondent's Application**\n---------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn its Application the Respondent requested the bifurcation of its preliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility from the merits of the case. [Application, paras. 6, 16, 52 and 66]. Respondent did not identify under which provision of the Rules it is making its objections.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent identified the objections for which it seeks bifurcation as follows [Application, para. 66]:\n\n1) **Claimant's claims are contract claims not treaty claims:** That Claimant's claims fail to establish *prima facie* treaty breaches because its claims are in reality allegations that Emlak breached the Contract for which the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts has been agreed and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction (\"Objection 1\").\n\n2) **It is premature to decide any treaty claims and they are therefore inadmissible:** Alternatively, even if Claimant's claims may relate to rights under the BIT, they are currently inadmissible as they cannot be determined before the underlying contractual dispute has been resolved by the Turkish courts (\"Objection 2\").\n\n3) **The mandatory negotiation period was not respected:** That Claimant has failed to respect the mandatory negotiation period set out in Article 8 of the BIT, taking the dispute outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction or making it inadmissible (\"Objection 3\").\n\n28.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant's claims must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, or, in any event, are inadmissible as being premature [Application, para. 4]. It is argued that \"efficiency of these proceedings requires that these objections be bifurcated from the rest of the case as they can be heard as a separate matter, avoiding pleading the complex contractual dispute that underlies the present one\" [Application, para. 17]. If successful, Respondent submits that Objection 1 would either dispose of Claimant's case, or at the very least reduce its scope and Objection 2 would terminate or suspend any possible remaining claims. It is therefore argued that bifurcation of these objections promises to lead to significant savings in time and costs. In respect of Objection 3, Respondent submits that this should be dealt with in an initial phase of the proceedings as it could potentially result in the dismissal of the whole case [Application, para. 52].\n\n**IV. The Applicable Standard**\n-------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\n30.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal has the power to bifurcate these proceedings in its discretion [Application para. 8, C Reply para. 8]. Three considerations have been identified as relevant to the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion. These are: (i) whether it is desirable to bifurcate for reasons of procedural economy; and (ii) whether the preliminary objection is intimately linked to the merits; and (iii) whether a determination of the preliminary objection is capable of resulting either in the dismissal of the entire case or reducing significantly its scope and complexity.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided by these considerations in the exercise of its discretion whether to grant Respondent's Application for bifurcation. The Tribunal now moves to consider each of Respondent's objections and whether to order bifurcation.\n\n**V. Objection 1: Claimant's claims are contract claims not treaty claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nRespondent says that the relevant test for establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the present circumstances is whether Claimant can establish that, *prima facie*, its claims can give rise to the alleged breaches of the BIT if proven [Application, para. 181; *see also,* letter from Respondent's Counsel dated 01 November 2012]. Respondent argues that Claimant's claims fail to establish a *prima facie* case of treaty breaches because its claims are in reality contractual claims [Application, para. 16]. Claimant agrees with Respondent that the jurisdictional test for bifurcation is a *prima facie* analysis of Claimant's claims, but argues that this test has been met [C Reply, para. 17]. Claimant says that the test calls on the Tribunal to assess the possibility of the facts as alleged by the Claimant to generate a proper jurisdictional basis for a treaty claim, as well as a violation of the BIT [C Reply, para. 19].2\n\nReferring to *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, at para. 197.\n\nReferring to *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Iran v. U.S.), 1996 I.C.J. (12 Dec.) (separate opinion of Judge Higgins), para. 32.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that this is the legal test to be applied when establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n34.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's pleaded case involves allegations of many wrongs, practically all of which relate directly or indirectly to Emlak's contractual, and in some cases, pre-contractual obligations [Application, para. 21]. It is averred that Claimant's damages claim arises exclusively from the termination of the Contract. Claimant argues that no separate claim for damage is made for any other act, and therefore it is submitted the termination of the Contract is the act on which the Tribunal should focus in determining whether Claimant has made a case that could amount to a breach of the BIT [Application, para. 22].\n\n35.\n\nClaimant argues that its case is not simply contractual in nature, but \"concerns how the highest officials and agencies of the Republic of Turkey - via TOKI, the Prime Minister's Supreme Audit Board, and other entities - used its *imperium* to influence and control Emlak's conduct towards Claimant's investments, and to otherwise frustrate and destroy those investments in Turkey\" [C Reply para. 15]. It is claimed that these actions are evidence of violations of the BIT.\n\n36.\n\nThe current task of the Tribunal is to consider whether to grant Respondent's Application for bifurcation of this jurisdictional objection, not decide the objection to jurisdiction itself. Taking into account the considerations enumerated above at IV, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Objection 1 is not intimately linked to the merits. The Tribunal's attention has been drawn to decisions of previous tribunals that have been reluctant to launch into the merits to decide a jurisdictional question [C Reply, para. 24]. Reference has been made to the award in *Generation Ukraine*, where the tribunal indicated that it had:\n\n*...elected to join issues of jurisdiction and admissibility to the merits because of the close relationship between the Respondent's primary jurisdictional objection, based on the alleged absence of any relevant investment by the Claimant, and the factual evidence pertaining to the complete history of the Claimant's activities in Ukraine.3*\n\n*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9 (Award dispatched 16 September 2003), para. 4.24,\n\n37.\n\nIn the present case, it is apparent to the Tribunal that, *prima facie,* the issues that will need to be considered in determining Respondent's Objection 1 are intimately linked to the merits. On the evidence before the Tribunal, and without prejudging the merits, there appears to be a close relationship between Respondent's Objection 1 and the factual evidence presented by Claimant pertaining to the alleged representations and conduct of Respondent, TOKI and Emlak.\n\n38.\n\nIn light of the above finding, it is unlikely a determination of Objection 1 is capable of reducing significantly the scope and complexity of this case. Similarly, the Tribunal does not consider that bifurcating Objection 1 would serve procedural economy. For these reasons, and in its discretion, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's application to bifurcate the proceeding to hear Objection 1.\n\n**VI. Objection 2: It is premature to decide any treaty claims and they are therefore inadmissible**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIn the alternative, Respondent submits that even if any treaty claims do arise in connection with the contractual claims, they are nevertheless inadmissible as they depend upon a determination of the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. It is argued that this Tribunal is not the proper forum to adjudicate the Claimant's contractual grievances as the Contract provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Istanbul Courts [Application, para. 37]. Respondent says that there is an agreed forum open to the Claimant or its subsidiaries to bring their claims for alleged breaches of the Contract.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant's Turkish subsidiary has seized the Turkish courts with a number of actions, both civil and criminal, in relation to the Contract and the alleged wrongdoings of Emlak [Application, para 41]. In particular, Respondent refers to a currently pending proceeding before the Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance (Case No. 2010/1654) that it says, concerns essentially the same claims as those before this Tribunal. It is argued that since Claimant does not raise any claims for denial of justice, there is no justification for Claimant to seize now, in addition to the courts of Turkey, an international arbitral tribunal under the BIT.\n\n41.\n\nIn response, Claimant argues that the pending Turkish court action before the Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance is against Emlak, not Respondent and is brought by Tulip JV (a Turkish entity), not Claimant. Further, Claimant argues that the claim in the Turkish court seeks a court order that would grant return of the project, by declaring the termination invalid under Turkish law, and damages arising from the delay to the Project. In contrast, the matter before the Tribunal seeks damages for the total destruction of the Claimant's investments in Turkey as a result of the actions of Respondent and its related entities, including Emlak, TOKI and the Prime Minister's Office.\n\n42.\n\nIf the Tribunal understands Respondent's argument in relation to Objection 2 correctly, its position is that any legitimate treaty claims asserted by Claimant in this arbitration can only be determined once cases concerning Claimant's contractual claims, pending before the Turkish courts, have been decided. Therefore, any treaty claims are premature and must be dismissed as inadmissible.\n\n43.\n\nIn light of the decision to deny Respondent's Application to bifurcate Objection 1, it follows that the Tribunal must deny Respondent's Application to bifurcate Objection 2. This is because Objection 2 only arises if the Claimant's claims have been found to relate to rights under the BIT and this determination of the preliminary objection is to be joined to the merits.\n\n44.\n\nIn any event, even if it were possible for the Tribunal to consider Objection 2 independently of its decision in relation to Objection 1, it is of the view that the issues raised by Objection 2 are intimately linked with the merits. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there is procedural economy in hearing this objection separately from the merits.\n\n**VII. Objection 3: The mandatory negotiation period was not respected**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has failed to respect the mandatory negotiation period set out in Article 8 of the BIT, depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear this case. It is argued that this objection could result in the dismissal of the whole case and therefore should be dealt with in an initial phase of the proceeding before the merits are addressed.\n\n46.\n\nArticle 8(2) of the BIT provides\n\n*In the event of an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith.... If the dispute cannot be resolved through the foregoing procedures the investor concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") for settlement by arbitration, at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose provided that in case the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Contracting Country that is a party to the dispute, and there has not been rendered a final award.*\n\n47.\n\nRespondent says that Article 8(2) of the BIT contains wording which amount to an obligation to \"initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith\" and this obligation has not been fulfilled. Accordingly, it is argued that failing to fulfill this obligation either defeats the Tribunal's jurisdiction or makes the Claimant's claims inadmissible [Application, para. 54].\n\n48.\n\nRespondent submits that it was never aware of the Claimant's treaty claims before the present arbitration was commenced [Application, para. 60]. It is argued that in no communications with Respondent by or on behalf of Claimant was reference made to treaty claims.\n\n49.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that the date upon which the present dispute arose for the purpose of Article 8(2) of the BIT was 11 October 2011, the date of filing of the Request for Arbitration. The Respondent submits that the Claimant has therefore not complied with the obligations in Article 8(2) of the BIT, rendering the claims inadmissible or resulting in them falling outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n50.\n\nRespondent says that Objection 3 is entirely factually discrete from the underlying dispute. It is said that it is incumbent upon Claimant to demonstrate that it has notified its treaty claims to Respondent and that it has attempted to negotiate with Respondent for at least a year prior to launching the present proceedings. Respondent argues that if Objection 3 were successful, it would result in the dismissal of Claimant's entire case and therefore procedural economy dictates that it be bifurcated and heard as a preliminary matter [Application, paras. 64-65].\n\n51.\n\nClaimant accepts that the BIT requires an investor to seek to resolve its disputes regarding breach of rights acquired by the BIT before bringing claims in arbitration [C Reply, para. 36]. Claimant submits that this was done. It is argued that the Contract was terminated by Emlak's Board on 18 May 2010, after which time Claimant and its representatives sought good faith consultations and negotiations with the Turkish authorities. It is submitted that, in accordance with Article 8(2) of the BIT, after the completion of a year, and noticing that its endeavors for a good faith negotiation were fruitless, Claimant submitted its case to ICSID.\n\n52.\n\nClaimant says that Respondent has not demonstrated that the alleged \"mandatory negotiation period\" was a jurisdictional requirement that Claimant had to comply with or that there was no compliance with such a requirement. It is argued that Respondent fails to explain how Claimant's actions or inactions violated the requirements of the BIT.\n\n53.\n\nClaimant further argues that Respondent is incorrect by asserting that a formalistic prearbitration negotiation is \"mandatory\". It argues, referencing *Alps v Slovak Republic* and *Bayindir*, that the weight of previous decisions favors avoiding the formalistic conclusions that certain \"pre-arbitration procedures\" must be complied with before an investor can seek arbitration.\n\n54.\n\nAt this stage it is not for the Tribunal to determine whether the requirements of Article 8(2) of the BIT have been complied with; merely, whether this objection should be dealt with as a preliminary question or joined to the merits. Article 8(2) of the BIT clearly provides for a period during which the parties shall seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. Respondent asserts that this is a mandatory negotiation period that has not been complied with. Claimant asserts that Article 8(2) does not require a formalistic pre-arbitration negotiation and it has sought to resolve the BIT dispute in compliance with the provision.\n\n55.\n\nTaking into account the considerations expressed above at IV, the Tribunal is satisfied that:\n\na. Objection 3 is not intimately linked to the merits and is capable of preliminary determination;\n\nb. if Objection 3 were successful, it could have the effect of disrupting the entire case either by (i) taking the dispute outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction or making the dispute inadmissible (at least until the requirements of Article 8(2) have been satisfied) or (ii) requiring a suspension of the proceeding while the Parties engage in consultations and negotiations in good faith; and\n\nc. procedural economy would be served by dealing this objection prior to the merits, avoiding the possibility that the entire case is heard and the Tribunal then finding that a pre-condition to arbitration was not satisfied.\n\n56.\n\nAccordingly, in the Tribunal's discretion, it finds that Objection 3 is to be dealt with as a preliminary question. In the interest of procedural economy, taking into account the relatively uncomplicated nature of the objection and the arguments already presented on this point, the Tribunal decides at the same time not to suspend the proceedings on the merits.\n\n**VIII. Decision and Orders**\n-----------------------------\n\n**In the light of the foregoing and for reasons set out above, the Tribunal:**\n\n**1. Rejects Respondent's Application in relation to Objection 1 and Objection 2;**\n\n**2. Determines to deal with Objection 3 as a preliminary question and makes the following procedural directions:**\n\n**a. Claimant will submit a Memorial with respect to compliance with Article 8(2) of the BIT (with witness statements, factual exhibits and legal authorities) by 23 November 2012;**\n\n**b. Respondent will submit a Counter-Memorial with respect to compliance with Article 8(2) of the BIT (with witness statements, factual exhibits and legal authorities) by 14 December 2012;**\n\n**c. Claimant will submit its Reply with respect to compliance with Article 8(2) of the BIT (with response witness statements, factual exhibits and legal authorities) by 28 December 2012;**\n\n**3. Directs that unless by 21 November a Party requests a hearing (in which event the Tribunal will issue further procedural directions), Objection 3 shall be determined by the Tribunal upon the papers;**\n\n**4. Rejects Respondent's application to suspend the proceedings on the merits;**\n\n**5. Confirms that the Schedule of Submission of Pleadings set out in paragraph 13 of Procedural Order No. 1 remains unchanged;**\n\n**6.** **Reserves all the other issues to a further order, decision or award, including the question of costs.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2013-03-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1) Parties**\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimant is Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V.

On 12 October 2011, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy to Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nThe dispute is brought under the Agreement on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Turkey dated 27 March 1986 (the \"BIT\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request and notified the Parties, pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"Convention\") and in accordance with Institution Rules 6 and 7. The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28. In the same letter the Secretary-General invited the Parties to inform the Centre of any agreed provisions as to the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment as soon as possible.\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 November 2011, Respondent proposed, pursuant to Rule 2(1)(b) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, a procedure for constituting the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 December 2011, Claimant appointed Michael Evan Jaffe, a national of the United States, as arbitrator in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 1 December 2011, the Centre informed the Parties that it understood that no agreement had been reached on the method of constituting the Arbitral Tribunal and that it would act on the appointment as soon as the method was established.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 27 December 2011, Claimant informed ICSID that it opted for the formula provided for in Article 37(2)(b) for the constitution of the Tribunal: that it consist of three arbitrators, with each party appointing an arbitrator, and the third, the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 December 2011, ICSID\u2019s Secretary-General informed the Parties that, in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) and Rule 2(3) of the Rules, the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties. The Secretary-General also invited Claimant, in accordance with Rules 3(1)(a)(i) and (ii), to propose the name of a person who shall be the President of the Tribunal and invited Respondent to concur in this proposal or to propose another person as the President, and to appoint another arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 January 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Michael Evan Jaffe accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, Respondent appointed Professor Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany, and informed the Centre that the Parties were cooperating to agree upon the President of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 30 January 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Professor Rolf Knieper accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n16.\n\nOn 23 March 2012, Respondent informed ICSID that the Parties had reached an agreement on the appointment of Dr. Gavan Griffith, QC, a national of Australia, as the President of the Tribunal. On 26 March 2012, Claimant confirmed that the Parties agreed to appoint Dr. Griffith as President of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, ICSID\u2019s Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) and under Rule 6. The Tribunal is thus composed by (i) Michael Evan Jaffe (appointed by Claimant), (ii) Professor Rolf Knieper (appointed by Respondent) and (iii) Dr. Gavan Griffith (appointed by agreement of the Parties). The Centre also informed the Parties and the Tribunal that Ms. Martina Polasek, ICSID, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held the first session in Paris, France.\n\n19.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, after consultation with the Parties, Procedural Order No. 1 was issued by the President of the Tribunal, recording the Parties\u2019 agreement and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on a number of procedural matters. Among other things, it was agreed that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be the Rules in force as of April 2006 and that the place of proceedings would be Paris, France.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 August 2012, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages together with witness statements of Mr. Meyer Benitah (\"Benitah 1st W/S\"), Mr. Erik Esveld (\"Esveld W/S\") and Mr. Huseyin Burak Erten (\"Erten W/S\") and an expert report of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Alberro (\"Alberro E/R\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation in accordance with the timetable established in Procedural Order No. 1, para 13. In its Bifurcation Application, Respondent applied to have three objections to jurisdiction heard as preliminary questions, namely:\n\n(1) Claimant\u2019s claims are contract claims not treaty claims;\n\n(2) It is premature to decide any treaty claims and they are therefore inadmissible; and\n\n(3) The mandatory negotiation period set out in Article 8(2) of the BIT was not respected, taking the dispute outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or making it inadmissible.1\n\nBifurcation Application, para. 66.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 October 2012, the Tribunal invited Claimant to provide its observations to the Bifurcation Application by 26 October 2012.\n\n23.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, Claimant filed its Reply to the Bifurcation Application.\n\n24.\n\nOn 2 November 2012, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention which determined to deal only with Respondent\u2019s third objection, concerning compliance with Article 8(2) as a preliminary question. The Tribunal also rejected Respondent\u2019s application to suspend the proceedings on the merits and made procedural directions for the disposition of the bifurcated issue.\n\n25.\n\nOn 21 November 2012, Claimant filed its Memorial on Article 8(2) (\"C Memorial\"), together with a witness statement of Mr. Meyer Benitah dated 19 November 2012 and an expert opinion of Prof Rudolf Dolzer dated 20 November 2012.\n\n26.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Compliance with Article 8(2) of the BIT.\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 December 2012, Claimant filed its Reply on Compliance with Article 8(2).\n\n28.\n\nOn 31 December 2012, the Tribunal alerted the Parties of the recent Decision on Jurisdiction dated 21 December 2012 made by the Tribunal in *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1) and invited the Parties to address this decision at the hearing to be held in Paris.\n\n29.\n\nOn 4 January 2013, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, identifying the issues that it considered to be ripe for determination by the Tribunal and suggesting that no further evidence was required. Respondent also informed the Tribunal that it did not request to cross-examine Mr. Benitah or Prof Dolzer.\n\n30.\n\nOn 10 January 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the hearing and proposed a preliminary timetable for oral arguments leading to the hearing in Paris on 28 January 2013.\n\n31.\n\nIn attendance on behalf of Claimant were: Mr. Stuart Newberger, Mr. John Laird and Ms. Meriam Alrashid of Crowell and Moring LLP. Attending as Claimant\u2019s representatives were Mr. Meyer Benitah and Mr. Burak Erten.\n\n32.\n\nIn attendance on behalf of the Respondent were: Mr. M. Rasim Kuseyri and Ms. Simge Sertoglu Akyuz of Kuseyri Law Office; Mr. Robert C. Sentner and Mr. Craig R. Tractenberg of Nixon Peabody LLP and Mr. Michael E. Schneider, Mr. Joachim Knoll, Ms. Laura Halonen, Mr. Cristophe Guibert de Bruet and Mr. Alptug Tokeser of Lalive. Attending as Respondent\u2019s representatives were: Mr. Sami Arslan Askin (Head Legal Counsel of Prime Ministry) and Mr. Guray Ozsu (Legal Counsel of Prime Ministry).\n\n**3) Facts Relevant to Decision on the Article 8(2) Jurisdictional Issue**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n33.\n\nFor the purposes of this Decision on the Article 8(2) Jurisdictional Issue, the Tribunal will limit itself to summarising the facts pertinent to this jurisdictional phase as currently pleaded. This summary is not to be taken as prejudging in any way the issues of fact or law to be resolved at a subsequent phase of this arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nThis dispute arises out of investments of Claimant in several residential and commercial construction projects in Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey, in particular, the Ispartakule III project in Istanbul. The Ispartakule III project was allegedly promoted to foreign investors by Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi A.S. (\"Emlak\"). Turkey\u2019s Housing Development Administration (\"TOKI\"), which is part of Turkey\u2019s Prime Ministry, and, at the times material to this decision, held a significant shareholding in Emlak. The exact percentage of this shareholding appears to have evolved since the commencement of the Ispartakule III project. It is unclear to the Tribunal the exact percentage of TOKI\u2019s current shareholding in Emlak, although it is common ground that TOKI is the majority or controlling shareholder in Emlak.2 It is equally uncontested that at the time when the dispute arose both Emlak and TOKI were directed by the same person, Mr. Erdogan Bayraktar.\n\nRespondent says that it currently stands at 75% (Transcript, 74:5-6). Other evidence indicates the shareholding at various times has been 39%, 50% and 99%.\n\n35.\n\nClaimant conducted its investments in Turkey by way of several special investment vehicles, including companies referred to as \"Tulip I,\" \"Tulip II\" and \"Tulip JV.\" Emlak and Tulip JV signed the Contract for Revenue-Sharing in Exchange for Sale of Parcels for the Ispartakule III Project on 3 August 2006, and Tulip I took possession of the land from Emlak on behalf of Tulip JV a few days later.\n\n**(2) The Dispute**\n-------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe dispute concerns allegations by Claimant that actions taken by Respondent deprived Claimant of the entire value of its real estate development projects. In summary, it is claimed -\n\n(1) Respondent failed to disclose pending zoning litigation in tender documents presented by Emlak and TOKI to Claimant, which litigation resulted in a delay of two years, i.e., to September 2008, in the commencement of construction, while Tulip JV waited for a construction permit.\n\n(2) In January 2007, the government official who was head of both TOKI and Emlak informed Claimant\u2019s investors that he would terminate the Contract if the investors did not oust the Turkish professionals who were part of Tulip JV and effectively hand over control of the project to a Turkish national recommended by the government official.\n\n(3) Once construction commenced, Respondent\u2019s agencies Emlak and TOKI harassed Claimant by, *inter alia,* delaying approvals, which should have been mere formalities; denying time extensions to cover delays for approvals, which should have been mere formalities; denying time extensions to cover delays for which Emlak and TOKI themselves were responsible; and, threatening to terminate the Contract for vague and unjustifiable reasons.\n\n(4) Respondent terminated the Contract in May 2010 - calling it a \"termination for delay\" - as a pretext for Respondent to take the project away from Claimant and seize all its assets associated with the Ispartakule III project as the delay could only be attributed to Respondent.\n\n(5) Respondent forcibly seized the construction site with the aid of police and private security forces and summarily seized the performance bond that had been posted by Claimant.\n\n(6) Respondent re-tendered the project while Claimant\u2019s court actions to nullify the termination of the Contract were still pending. What is more, according to Claimant, the award of the new contract for the project was on less favourable terms to Respondent than under the contract with Claimant.\n\n37.\n\nClaimant argues that these constitute breaches by Respondent of its obligations under the BIT, including -\n\n(1) to ensure the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") of Claimant\u2019s investment (Article 3(1));\n\n(2) to provide treatment that is not arbitrary or discriminatory;\n\n(3) to accord at all times to Claimant\u2019s investment full protection and security (Article 3(2));\n\n(4) to observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments (Article 3(2));\n\n(5) to refrain from unlawful expropriation without compensation (Article 5); and\n\n(6) to protect foreign investors.\n\n**4) Scope of this Decision**\n-----------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAs noted above, in its Decision on Bifurcation, the Tribunal determined to hear as a preliminary question only Respondent\u2019s third objection to jurisdiction, namely that Claimant has failed to respect the mandatory negotiation period set out in the Article 8(2) objection and otherwise directed Respondent\u2019s first and second objections to be heard with the merits in a subsequent phase.\n\n**5) Preliminary Matters to Analysis**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it convenient to begin its analysis by reciting the relevant rules governing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and provisions of the BIT (section 2); considering the relevance of previous decisions (section 3); identifying the onus of establishing jurisdiction (section 4) and dealing with non-contentious matters (section 5).\n\n**(2) The rules governing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction arises under the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n41.\n\nThe relevant provision of the ICSID Convention is Article 25(1) -\n\n*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n42.\n\nThe relevant provision of the BIT that provides for ICSID arbitration is Article 8 -\n\n*1) For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving:*\n\n*(a) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by a Contracting Party's foreign investment authority to an investor of the other Contracting Party; or*\n\n*(b) a breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment.*\n\n*2) In the event of an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. If such consultations or negotiations are unsuccessful, the dispute may be settled through the use of non-binding, third party procedures upon which such investor and the Contracting Party mutually agree. If the dispute cannot be resolved through the foregoing procedures the investor concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018Centre) for settlement by arbitration, at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose provided that in case the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Contracting Country that is a party to the dispute, and there has not been rendered a final award.*\n\n*3) (a) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an Investment dispute to the Centre for settlement by arbitration.*\n\n*(b) Arbitration of such disputes shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States and the Arbitration Rules\u2019 of the Centre.*\n\n43.\n\nIn the ordinary course, the principles for construction of relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT are as provided under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\"). Although Turkey has not acceded to the Vienna Convention, the Parties nonetheless agreed that the Tribunal may proceed on the basis that the principles stated in the Vienna Convention may be applied in construing the BIT, either as a matter of consent, or, in any event, as reflecting the accepted principles of customary international law. Although it may not be for the Parties to so agree, as it here appears to the Tribunal that issues of possible differences between that treaty and of customary international law do not lead to material differences of construction in interpreting and enforcing the BIT, the Tribunal has regard to the terms of the Vienna Convention, particularly Articles 31 and 32.\n\n44.\n\nOne further background matter that the Tribunal refers to is that consent is the cornerstone of all international treaty commitments and that here the provisions of the BIT qualify the state sovereignty of Turkey. Here, Article 8 is a specific and qualified derogation to Turkey\u2019s sovereign immunity and the Tribunal accepts that in its interpretation and application there is an inertia against too expansive a construction of the reach of the BIT.\n\n**(3) The relevance of previous ICSID and ICJ decisions or awards**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nEach Party refers the Tribunal to previous ICSID and investment treaty awards, and statements made in ICJ judgments. Although not bound by such citations, the Tribunal accepts that, as a matter of comity, it should have regard to earlier decisions of courts (particularly the ICJ) and of other international dispute tribunals engaged in the interpretation of the terms of a BIT.3\n\nSee e.g., *AES Corporation v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on Jurisdiction of 13 July 2005, paras. 30-32; *Saipem S.p.A v. the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures of 21 March 2007, para. 67.\n\n46.\n\nAt the hearings, the issue of the \"hierarchy\" of authority that should be attached to decisions of particular international courts and tribunals was raised: Respondent submits that the judgments of the ICJ are at the apex;4 whilst Claimant submits that decisions of previous ICSID tribunals are more relevant as they specifically concern investment treaty law, and the construction of BITs, as compared to general principles of international law.5\n\nTranscript, 21:16-17.\n\nTranscript, 119:21-24.\n\n47.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to engage in an hierarchical analysis of precedent. On one hand, the Tribunal accords deference to relevant statements by the ICJ of general principles as to the construction of the terms of a treaty as those principles may apply to the construction of the BIT. On the other hand, as there is no precedential order in regard to previous decisions on the construction of bilateral investment treaties, the relevant enquiry remains for the Tribunal to interpret and apply the terms of the BIT itself. Prior decisions may inform that enquiry, but it is for this Tribunal to make its own interpretation of Article 8(2), informed by the rigor and persuasiveness of relevant analysis and statements by decisions of earlier tribunals.\n\n**(4) The onus of establishing jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nAs a party bears the burden of proving the facts it asserts, it is for Claimant to satisfy the burden of proof required at the jurisdictional phase.6 Here, the Parties agree that whilst the Article 8(2) Objection was raised by Respondent, the onus remains on Claimant to establish that the requirements of Article 8(2) have been satisfied, and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction.7\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of 22 April 2005, para. 79; *Saipem S.p.A v. People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures of 21 March 2007, para. 83.\n\nTranscript, 3:5-23.\n\n**(5) Non-contentious matters for the purposes of this Decision**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nFor the purposes of this phase of the arbitration only, it is assumed that Claimant has made an investment in Turkey and that the claims advanced by Claimant in its Request are an \"investment dispute\" within the BIT.8\n\nTranscript, 49:24-25; 51:15-16; Transcript, 6:1-22.\n\n**6) Position of the Parties on Article 8(2)**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe following summarizes the Parties\u2019 positions with respect to the Article 8(2) Objection.\n\n***(1) Claimant\u2019s position***\n-----------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Claimant has put forward the following arguments -\n\n(1) Claimant and its representatives provided ample notice of the dispute and engaged in repeated good faith efforts to resolve the dispute with Turkish authorities well over a year prior to seeking arbitration.9\n\n(2) Article 8(2) of the BIT does not create a jurisdictional hurdle to filing an ICSID claim, nor does it impact the admissibility of a claim. It is argued that the weight of previous arbitral decisions favors avoiding the formalistic conclusion that certain \"pre-arbitration procedures\" must be complied with before an investor can seek arbitration, particularly where negotiation would be futile.10\n\n(3) The fact that the timeframe of Article 8(2) has already passed in this case since the filing of the Request can give the Tribunal comfort in deciding that Article 8(2) does not create a jurisdictional hurdle.\n\n(4) Respondent has in any case waived its chance to rely on Article 8(2) as its own behavior and attitude demonstrates that it had no interest in settling the dispute.11\n\n(5) Respondent has waived its chance to rely on Article 8(2) by waiting until its submission of its Request for Bifurcation, over a year into the present proceedings.12\n\n(6) Respondent\u2019s objection does not support procedural economy.\n\nC Memorial, para. 33.\n\nC Memorial, para. 44.\n\nC Memorial paras 62-63. As examples of Respondent\u2019s behavior, Claimant refers to Respondent\u2019s alleged actions of Emlak forcefully and illegally entering the project site, occupying Tulip\u2019s offices, announcing a new tender on the project and signing a new contract with another company.\n\nC Memorial para. 66.\n\n52.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal determines that -\n\n(1) Claimant has complied with Article 8(2);\n\n(2) Claimant\u2019s claims under the BIT are admissible pursuant to Article 8(2);\n\n(3) Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections with respect to Article 8(2) be dismissed;\n\n(4) The procedural timetable set forth in its First Procedural Order, and reiterated in its Decision on Bifurcation, be confirmed; and\n\n(5) Claimant be awarded its legal fees and costs incurred in the preparation of its Memorial on Article 8(2).13\n\nC Memorial para. 73.\n\n***(2) Respondent\u2019s position***\n-------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn summary, Respondent\u2019s contentions in answer are -\n\n(1) Article 8(2) is a binding obligation and not merely a \"procedural device.\" Article 8(2) provides for a mandatory negotiation period as a condition for Respondent\u2019s consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.14\n\n(2) Claimant did not notify Respondent about the investment dispute or seek to engage in negotiations with respect to that dispute before filing its Request. Respondent only first became aware of Claimant\u2019s treaty claims upon the commencement of the present arbitration. It is argued that in no communications with Respondent by or on behalf of Claimant was reference made to treaty claims.15\n\n(3) In the absence of a notified BIT dispute and settlement efforts there is no consent and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.16\n\n(4) The requirements of Article 8(2) cannot be dispensed with on grounds of \"procedural economy\" or \"futility\".17\n\n(5) An invitation to negotiations once arbitration has been commenced does not comply with the requirements of Article 8(2).18\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 15.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, paras. 57-60; 70-163.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, paras. 164-168.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, paras. 169-181.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, paras. 182-190\n\n54.\n\nRespondent requests orders to dismiss the entire claims for lack of jurisdiction or as inadmissible, together with the award of costs.19\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 193.\n\n**7) Analysis**\n---------------\n\n55.\n\nIn its plain meaning, Article 8(1) relevantly defines an investment dispute as a dispute involving a breach of any right conferred or created by the BIT with respect to an investment. Article 8(2) provides that the parties to an \"investment dispute\" shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. If the dispute cannot be resolved, the investor may submit the dispute to arbitration at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose.20\n\nArticle 8(2) is extracted in full at para. 42.\n\n**(1) Nature of Article 8(2)**\n------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nA requirement for prior notice of a dispute to be given and negotiations to follow for a period before filing a claim along the lines of Article 8(2) is not an uncommon provision in investment treaties.\n\n57.\n\nIn this context, it is clear enough that there is no overriding *jurisprudence constante* concerning the construction and application of such provisions.21 Indeed, the jurisprudence is very much *non constante.* Lines of decisions that have decided that such consultation and negotiation provisions are not of a jurisdictional nature, and do not have to be strictly followed,22 are matched by a lesser number of decisions that have held that compliance with such requirements for notice and negotiation enure as a pre-condition to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and must be strictly complied with.23 Additionally, there is a body of decisional authority that examines, with contrary conclusions, whether non-compliance may be ignored where negotiations would be futile or where there is no realistic likelihood of meaningful negotiation.24\n\nThis was acknowledged by Respondent.

Ecuador* and *Murphy v. Ecuador* as the only two principal decisions that go against the grain of arbitral precedent.26 Claimant also relies on the \"expert opinion\" of Prof Dolzer, confirming published statements by himself and also by Prof Christoph Schreuer to support his conclusions that a \"review of the jurisprudence by all investment tribunals speaks in favor of the more flexible approach.\"27 Prof Dolzer was not called for examination upon his report and the hearings proceeded upon the basis that the report was received as submission in legal argument made by Claimant.\n\nC Memorial, para. 36.\n\nDolzer E/O, para. 22.\n\n60.\n\nRespondent\u2019s answer is that Article 8(2) is mandatory and equivalent to a requirement, in common law terminology, of a *condition precedent* with the consequences that in the absence of compliance there is no consent by Turkey to arbitration.28\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 1.\n\n*Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n---------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation)29* the ICJ addressed the function of a \u2018compromissory\u2019 provision of this sort in terms -\n\n*[I]t is not unusual in compromissory clauses conferring jurisdiction on the Court and other international jurisdictions to refer to resort to negotiations. Such resort fulfills three distinct functions. In the first place, it gives notice to the respondent State that a dispute exists and delimits the scope of the dispute and its subject-matter... In the second place, it encourages the Parties to attempt to settle their dispute by mutual agreement, thus avoiding recourse to binding third-party adjudication. In the third place, prior resort to negotiations or other methods of peaceful dispute settlement performs an important function in indicating the limit of consent given by States.*\n\nICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation),* Decision on Preliminary Objections, Judgment, ICJ reports 2011.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal adds a fourth aspect, namely, that it sees that such a requirement also fulfils the policy function of conferring upon the State Party an opportunity to address a potential claimant\u2019s complaint before it becomes a respondent in an international investment dispute.\n\n63.\n\n*Armed Activities (DRC v. Rwanda)* the ICJ also said -30\n\n*[The Court\u2019s] jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted by them... When that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon.*\n\n*ICJ,* *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002), (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda),* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, ICJ Reports 2006, at para. 88.\n\n64.\n\nStatements to the like effect are made in other investment tribunal decisions interpreting a BIT in similar terms.\n\n65.\n\nIn *Enron v. Argentine Republic,31* after finding that the six-month negotiation period had been complied with, the tribunal stated:\n\n*The Tribunal wishes to note in this matter, however, that the conclusion reached is not because the six-month negotiation period could be a procedural and not a jurisdictional requirement as has been argued by the Claimants and affirmed by other tribunals. Such requirement is in the view of the Tribunal very much a jurisdictional one. A failure to comply with that requirement would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction.*\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, (14 Jan 2004), para. 88.\n\n66.\n\nLikewise, the tribunal *in Murphy v. Ecuador32* found that the six-month waiting period in the relevant Treaty between the Republic of Ecuador and the United States of America had not been complied with and made the following findings:\n\n*The Tribunal also does not accept the consequences Claimant seeks to derive between \"procedural\" and \"jurisdictional\" requirements. According to [Claimant], \"procedural requirements\" are of an inferior category than the \"jurisdictional requirements\" and, consequently, its non-compliance has no legal consequences. It is evident that in legal practice this does not occur, and that non-compliance with a purely procedural requirement, such as, for example, the time to appeal a judgment, can have serious consequences for the defaulting party.33*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article VI of the BIT simply ignores the existence of provisions mandating the parties to have consultations and negotiations to resolve their disputes (paragraph 2) and preventing them from resorting to ICSID before six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose (paragraph* 3).34\n\n\u2026\n\n*It is contrary to the fundamental rules of interpretation to state that while [Article VI] constitutes a \"procedural rule that must be satisfied by the claimant\", non-compliance does not have any consequence whatsoever. Such a way of interpreting the obligation simply ignores the \"object and the purpose\" of the rule, which is contrary to Article 31(1) of the aforementioned Vienna Convention.*\n\n*Similarly, the SGS v. Pakistan tribunal held that \"Tribunals have generally tended to treat consultation periods as directory and procedural rather than as mandatory and jurisdictional in nature. \" This Tribunal cannot agree with that statement which implies that, even though there is an explicit treaty requirement, the investor may decide whether or not to comply with it as it deems fit. [footnote omitted]*\n\n*This Tribunal finds the requirement that the parties should seek to resolve their dispute through consultation and negotiation for a six-month period does not constitute, as Claimant and some arbitral tribunals have stated, \"a procedural rule \" or a directory and procedural\" rule which can or cannot be satisfied by the concerned party. To the contrary, it constitutes a fundamental requirement that Claimant must comply with, compulsorily, before submitting a request for arbitration under the ICSID rules.35*\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company Int\u2019I v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4 (Award on Jurisdiction dated 15 December 2010), paras 140 -156.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company Int\u2019I v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4 (Award on Jurisdiction dated 15 December 2010), para 142.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company Int\u2019I v.

Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4 (Award on Jurisdiction dated 15 December 2010), paras 147-149.\n\n67.\n\nIn *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador36* the tribunal found that the claimant\u2019s full protection and security claim was inadmissible in accordance with Article VI [the six-month waiting provision] of relevant Treaty between the Republic of Ecuador and the United States of America and made the following findings:\n\n*Article VI does not require the investor to spell out its legal case in detail during the initial negotiation process; Article VI does not even require the investor to invoke specific Treaty provisions at that stage. Rather, Article VI simply requires the investor to inform the host State that it faces allegations of Treaty breach which could eventually engage the host State's international responsibility before an international tribunal. In other words, it requires the investor to apprize the host State of the likely consequences that would follow should the negotiation process break down.37*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Burlington's full protection and security claim for Block 23 is inadmissible in accordance with Article VI of the Treaty. It adds that in ICSID arbitration the inadmissibility of claims has the same consequence as the failure to meet the requirements for jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or the BIT, such consequence being that the Tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over the dispute.38*\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 2 June 2010), para. 340.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 2 June 2010), para. 338.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 2 June 2010), para. 340.\n\n68.\n\nLastly, in the recent decision of the tribunal in *Teinver v. Argentine Republic,39* the Tribunal held that:\n\n*The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that Article X(1) can fairly be interpreted as a general \"best efforts \" obligation for the parties to attempt to amicably settle their dispute. However, it would be an overly literal interpretation of Article X(2)\u2019s \"cannot be settled within six months\" language to read it as simply requiring that the Parties wait for six months after the dispute began before they proceed to the next step in the dispute settlement process. The natural reading of Articles X(1) and (2) together is that the Parties are obligated to make their best efforts to amicably settle their dispute, and that they are required to do so for six months before proceeding to the next step.*\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas SA. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1 (Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 December 2012), para. 108.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with each of these statements of principle.\n\n70.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion the ordinary meaning of the terms in Article 8(2) is clear. It provides in plain language that the parties shall -\n\n(1) First seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith; and\n\n(2) Second, if these procedures are unsuccessful, then, at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose, the investor may choose to submit the dispute to arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nThe language is mandatory in form. The explicit requirements that the parties must seek to engage in consultations and negotiations with respect to the dispute as arising under the BIT and that there be a one-year waiting period from the date the dispute arose are accepted by the Tribunal as pre-conditions to submitting the dispute to arbitration. In this regard, the date the dispute arises is the date of first notification of a claim arising under the BIT by one party to the other. In the opinion of the Tribunal, this interpretation accords with the plain object and purpose of the provision.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n72.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s contention that Article 8(2) is merely procedural. The explicit requirements to give notice of the dispute as arising under the BIT and to seek consultations and negotiations until one year has elapsed from the date of notification of the dispute is not to be watered down to a mere statement of aspiration. The Tribunal finds compliance is an essential element of Turkey\u2019s prospective consent to qualify its sovereignty to permit unknown future investors of the other contracting State to claim relief under the terms of the BIT against it in an international forum. The Tribunal finds that the fulfillment of the requirements in Article 8(2) is a pre-condition to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n**(2) Requirements of Article 8(2)**\n------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to consider compliance in this dispute with the three requirements in Article 8(2), namely -\n\n(a) That there be an \"investment dispute\" under the BIT that Claimant must have provided notice to Respondent;\n\n(b) That efforts to engage in consultation and negotiation to resolve the dispute have been undertaken; and\n\n(c) That proceedings may not be commenced until one year after notification of a dispute.\n\n**(a) The Dispute and Notice Requirement**\n------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant did not notify Respondent of the existence of an investment dispute under the BIT until it filed the Request.40 Respondent says that Article 8(2) requires that a dispute be identified as an \"investment dispute\" under Article 8(1), and that this dispute be notified to Respondent 12 months prior to the Request.41 It contends that it is of particular importance that the notification of a dispute be clear and unambiguous, particularly where, as here, the investor was engaged in two disputes, with one against Emlak pending before the courts of Turkey in relation to the Ispartakule III project (the \"Contract Dispute\") and the other dispute arising under the BIT.42\n\nTranscript, 238:23-239:9.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 2.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 32.\n\n75.\n\nClaimant argues that the investment dispute was notified to Turkey at the latest 15 months and potentially as early as 16 January 2007, when a meeting took place with representatives of TOKI prior to the filing of the Request, and at the latest, when it sent a letter to the President of Turkey dated 8 July 2010.43 Claimant submits that numerous correspondences and communications between it and Respondent also made it clear to Turkey that an investment dispute existed well before a year prior to when the Request was filed.44\n\nC Memorial, para. 5.\n\nC Memorial, para. 5.\n\n76.\n\nAs to form of notice, Claimant contends that the BIT contains no requirement as to the form and that there are no \"magic words\" that a claimant must employ to notify the State of the dispute and that it wishes to begin settlement negotiations regarding an investment dispute.45\n\nC Reply, para. 21.\n\n77.\n\nClaimant invokes the statements of the tribunal in *Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spaing46* where it said \"[w]hile a dispute may have emerged, it does not necessarily have to coincide with the presentation of a formal claim.\"47 Claimant argues that the *Maffezini* tribunal held that the fact that the legal instrument of consent to international arbitration has not been specifically invoked does not mean that a dispute covered by the terms of that treaty has not arisen.\n\n*Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 25 January 2000).\n\n*Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 25 January 2000), para. 97.\n\n78.\n\nClaimant also cites the tribunal in *Link-Trading v. Department for Customs Control of Republic of Moldova)48* where it stated that the \"formal complaint... represented the culmination, not the inception, of [a] dispute\"49 and also the tribunal in *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador,* extracted at para 67 above.50\n\n*Link-Trading v. Department for Customs Control of Republic of Moldova,* UNCITRAL (Award on Jurisdiction dated 16 February 2001).\n\n*Link-Trading v. Department for Customs Control of Republic of Moldova,* UNCITRAL (Award on Jurisdiction dated 16 February 2001), para. 8.6.3.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 2 June 2010), para. 338.\n\n79.\n\nIn response, Respondent refers to statements of the ICJ in the *Headquarters Agreement Advisory Opinion,51* that -\n\n*[W]here one party to a treaty protests against the behaviour or a decision of another party, and claims that such behaviour or decision constitutes a breach of the treaty, the mere fact that the party accused does not advance any argument to justify its conduct under international law does not prevent the opposing attitudes of the parties from giving rise to a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the treaty.52*\n\nICJ, Applicability of the Obligation to Arbitrate under Section 21 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of 26 June 1947, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1988.\n\nICJ, Applicability of the Obligation to Arbitrate under Section 21 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of 26 June 1947, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1988, at para. 38,\n\n80.\n\nRespondent also relies on statements by the tribunal in *Murphy v. Ecuador* where it held that \"without the prior allegation of a Treaty breach, it is not possible for a dispute to arise which could then be submitted to arbitration under Article VI of the BIT.\"53\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, (Award on Jurisdiction dated 15 December 2010), para. 104.\n\n81.\n\nRespondent further cites the decision on jurisdiction in *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador54* where the tribunal said:\n\n*...as long as no allegation of Treaty breach is made, no dispute will have arisen giving access to arbitration under Article VI. This requirement makes sense as it gives the state an opportunity to remedy a possible Treaty breach and thereby avoid arbitration proceedings under BIT, which would not be possible without knowledge of an allegation of Treaty breach. Because a dispute under Article VI(3)(a) only arises once an allegation of Treaty breach is made, the six-month waiting period only begins to run at that point in time.55*\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 2 June 2010.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 2 June 2010, paras. 335-336.\n\n82.\n\nOn this issue of form of notice, it is apparent to the Tribunal that the Parties generally agreed on the standard to be applied. At the hearing, Claimant submitted that the Tribunal should apply a test that it is the subject matter that determines when the dispute arose.56 Similarly, Respondent submitted that the form of notice is:\n\n*... not a question of specific wording; it is a question of the substance of the complaint that is being made. If it's being made clear that what is complained about here, and what therefore is brought into existence, is the investment dispute, as defined as a breach of a right conferred or created by this BIT, then that\u2019s fine...57*\n\nTranscript, 125:9-11.\n\nTranscript, 27:21-28:2.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that Article 8(2) does not impose a formal notice requirement, and finds that the applicable legal standard is as stated by the tribunal in *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador.* In this regard, Article 8(2) does not require the investor to spell out its legal case in detail during the initial negotiation process. Nor does Article 8(2) require the investor, on the giving of notice of a dispute arising, to invoke specific BIT provisions at that stage. Rather, what Article 8(2) requires is that the investor sufficiently informs the State party of allegations of breaches of the treaty made by a national of the other Contracting State that may later be invoked to engage the host State's international responsibility before an international tribunal.\n\n**(b) Consultation and Negotiation Requirement**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe second requirement in Article 8(2) is that the parties seek to engage in consultations and negotiations in good faith. Respondent relies on decisions by the ICJ in *Armed Activities (DRC v. Rwanda) case58* and *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation)59* to emphasize that negotiations must be referable to the treaty dispute. In the latter case, the ICJ said:\n\n*... to meet the precondition of negotiation in the compromissory clause of a treaty, these negotiations must relate to the subject-matter of the treaty containing the compromissory clause. In other words, the subject-matter of the negotiations must relate to the subject-matter of the dispute which, in turn, must concern the substantive obligations contained in the treaty in question.60*\n\n*ICJ,* *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002), (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda),* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, ICJ Reports 2006, at para. 80.\n\nICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation),* Decision on Preliminary Objections, Judgment, ICJ reports 2011.\n\nICJ, *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v Russian Federation),* Decision on Preliminary Objections, Judgment, ICJ reports 2011, at para. 161,\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Claimant essentially agrees with Respondent\u2019s position that the relevant enquiry is to consider whether the subject matter of the negotiations concerned the same subject matter as the eventual treaty claim.\n\n86.\n\nClaimant also says that if the Tribunal follows this subject matter approach, as compared to what Claimant calls the \"strict formalities\" approach, then the subject matter of this \"ICSID proceeding was exactly what was being presented by the Dutch investor to the Government of Turkey in the summer of 2010.\"61 This is to identify the controversy as to characterization for determination by the Tribunal.\n\nTranscript, 127:12-17.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the above statement of the ICJ and considers that the subject matter of the consultations and negotiations to be engaged must relate to the subject matter of the investment dispute brought before this Tribunal under the BIT. It is not necessary for the parties to make express reference to the treaty in their consultations or negotiations.\n\n**(c) One-year Requirement**\n----------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s position is that the one-year waiting period under Article 8(2) starts running once notice is provided to Respondent that an investment dispute exists within the meaning of Article 8(1).\n\n**(d) Satisfaction of Article 8(2) requirements after filing the Request**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nClaimant also argues that, in any event, as of October 2011, when the Request was filed, an investment dispute existed and that more than a year has since passed without the dispute being resolved. In these circumstances, it is intended that any procedural requirements in Article 8(2) should be regarded as abrogated, or compliance unnecessary, either through what Claimant has called the application of the \"futility doctrine\" or for some other reason.62\n\nTranscript, 230:12-25; C Memorial, para. 60.\n\n90.\n\nIn reply, Respondent maintains that the several requirements of Article 8(2) are specific pre-conditions to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and they must be completely complied with before the Request is filed.63\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para 40.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with Respondent\u2019s position. It would be to rewrite the BIT and to confound its plain meaning to accept that a party may file its Request without notice and then perfect the breach after the arbitration commenced. In the absence of a waiver (and, possibly, circumstances giving rise to estoppel), which do not arise here, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction if the notice requirements are not satisfied before the arbitration is commenced. Absent a waiver, actions, or inactions, of the Parties after the commencement of arbitration will not perfect a defective commencement.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that under Article 8(2) Claimant must first prove that it provided such notice to Respondent that can be reasonably be characterized as notice to the recipient of a claim arising under the BIT. The investor does not have to spell out its case beyond informing the host State that it contends that the alleged conduct constitutes a violation of a treaty. The subject matter of the negotiations that Claimant must seek to engage in must relate to the subject matter of the dispute, namely a claim arising under substantive obligations contained in the BIT, and at least one year must have elapsed since notice of the dispute was given to Respondent before a dispute may be submitted to arbitration.\n\n**(3) Compliance with Article 8(2)**\n------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal moves to analyse evidence presented by Claimant and to determine whether Claimant has satisfied the requirements of Article 8(2) to this legal standard. It considers whether and when Claimant provided adequate notice of the investment dispute and negotiations with Respondent for at least one year from the date of first notification before the Request was filed.\n\n**(b) Did Claimant provide adequate notice of the investment dispute?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe first, and here decisive, question for the Tribunal\u2019s determination is whether Claimant provided adequate notice to Respondent that an investment dispute had arisen concerning alleged breaches of the terms of the BIT.\n\n**(i) Does notice to Emlak constitute notice to Respondent?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal first considers whether notice provided to Emlak constitutes notice to Respondent for the purposes of this Decision. Claimant relies on a number of documents and conversations between Tulip I (the Turkish incorporated company) and Emlak. Claimant contends that for current purposes Emlak was Respondent,64 and argues that any correspondence addressed to Emlak should be ascribed as notice to TOKI and therefore the Republic of Turkey as TOKI is part of the Turkish Prime Ministry.\n\nTranscript. 153:4-154:17.\n\n96.\n\nClaimant refers the Tribunal to the following evidence in this regard:\n\n(1) Emlak, at different times describes itself as \"Subsidiary of Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Housing Development Administration of Turkey,\"65 \"A partnership of the Housing Development Administration, Prime Ministry of the Republic of Turkey\"66 and \"Emlak Konut, with its controlling shareholder TOKI, is the largest REIC in Turkey by market value...;\"67\n\n(2) Mr. Bayraktar was both the Chairman of Emlak and TOKI;\n\n(3) Emlak was a majority-owned subsidiary of TOKI; and\n\n(4) Mr. Benitah statements that he and the Dutch Investor understood that partnering with Emlak was effectively partnering with the Turkish Government.68\n\nCE-73.\n\nCE-219.\n\nCE-214.\n\nBenitah 1st W/S, paras. 22-30.\n\n97.\n\nIn reply, Respondent identifies Emlak as a private law entity, distinct from the Government of Turkey,69 as the party to the Contract under Turkish law. Hence it follows that communications addressed to Emlak do not constitute communications to Respondent.\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 140.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n98.\n\nAs an issue to be canvassed on the merits, Claimant does not claim that Emlak constitutes the State, but rather that its acts are attributable to Respondent within Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. That remains a live controversy, including as the subject matter of Claimant's requests for production of documents and the question whether information known to Emlak, and actions taken by Emlak, can be attributed to the Respondent. On the evidence currently before it, the Tribunal is not sufficiently satisfied that Emlak is to be equated to the State. Whilst not constituting a decision on the merits of the issue, the Tribunal concludes that for the purposes of this application, it has not been established that acts by or notice to Emlak are attributable to the State.\n\n99.\n\nThat being said, and given all of Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s dual responsibilities and the acknowledged close relationship between Emlak and TOKI and the fact that TOKI is part of the Republic of Turkey, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that Mr. Bayraktar was both the Chairman of Emlak and TOKI and that TOKI was the controlling shareholder of Emlak. As a background issue, it is not unreasonable to infer that, at the least, Respondent, as a State party to the BIT, should have been aware of the circumstances of the on-going disagreement between Tulip I and Emlak with respect to the Ispartakule III. Especially is that so as the on-going disagreement was discussed in January 2007 at a meeting between representatives of TOKI and Claimant. To this extent, prior knowledge of Mr. Bayraktar himself may be a relevant to the assessment of later evidence pointing to requisite notice of the dispute having been given to the Government itself as distinct from notice to Mr. Bayraktar.\n\n**(ii) Key pieces of evidence produced**\n----------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\n*Meeting of 16 January 2007 between TOKI and Claimant:* Claimant says that a meeting took place on 16 January 2007 in Ankara, where Mr. Bayraktar spoke on behalf of TOKI, and Mr. Benitah spoke on behalf of the Claimant. Claimant relies on the evidence of Mr. Benitah who describes this meeting as \"...clearly a meeting between a Turkish government official and foreign investors to discuss a dispute regarding our investment...\"70 Claimant argues that this is evidence of notice to Respondent of a dispute with Dutch investors and an attempt to find reasonable solutions through negotiations directly with high-ranking officials of the Turkish State.71\n\nBenitah 2nd W/S, para 10.\n\nC Memorial, para 12.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent does not deny this meeting took place or refute the statements of Mr. Benitah. Respondent\u2019s position is that negotiations prior to the termination of the Contract in May 2010 concerned the then on-going Ispartakule III Project and not any claim for damages for breaches of international law made in this arbitration.72 Respondent refers to Claimant\u2019s statement that \"[t]he dispute between Tulip and the Government of Turkey arose when the Contract was purportedly terminated as of 18 May 2010.\"\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para 77.\n\n102.\n\n*Dutch Consul Letter to Emlak dated 3 August 2009:* By letter dated 3 August 2009, Paul Korff de Gidts, Deputy Consul General of the Netherlands and Head of Commercial and Economic Department in Istanbul wrote to Dr. Feyzullah Yetgin, General Manager of Emlak.73 This letter, sent on behalf of Tulip I representatives, made a number of points. First, Mr. Korff de Gidts noted Tulip I\u2019s representatives request for \"fair treatment as an internationally owned corporation. A discrepancy in treatment was observed compared with other local companies.\" Second, it summarized Tulip I\u2019s requests made in previous correspondence to Emlak. Third, it states: \"[a]s it is the duty of the Netherlands economic missions worldwide to assist Dutch origin companies in solving their trade and *investment related disputes,* I kindly bring Tulip REIC\u2019s position on this incident to your attention...\" (emphasis added).\n\nCE-225.\n\n103.\n\n*Post-termination communications and meetings between Tulip and Emlak:* Claimant contends that after the May 2010 termination of the Contract, numerous letters were sent and a number of meetings occurred on behalf of Claimant with Mr. Haluk Sur (a member of the Board of Emlak), and other officials representing the Turkish State.74 It is argued that during these meetings further efforts to communicate the grounds for a complaint and a desire to resolve the matter through negotiation were expressed.\n\nC Memorial, para 17; Benitah 1st W/S, para.99; Benitah 2nd W/S, para. 16.\n\n104.\n\n*Dutch Consul letter to Emlak dated 27 May 2010:* Paul Korff de Gidts wrote another letter, dated 27 May 2010, this time to Mr. Murat Kurum, General Manager of Emlak.75 This letter, sent on behalf of Tulip representatives, makes a number of additional points. First, Mr. Korff de Gidts notes that the letter is sent by Tulip REIC in coordination with their Dutch partners Van Herk Groep, Panagro B.V. Second, it advises that Tulip REIC would like to continue the project and proposes options for its continuation. Third, it reiterates that \"[a]s it is the duty of the Netherlands economic missions worldwide to assist Dutch origin companies in solving their trade and *investment related disputes,* I kindly bring Tulip REIC\u2019s position on this incident to your attention...\" (emphasis added).\n\nCE-224.\n\n105.\n\n*Tulip I letter to Emlak dated 1 June 2010:* By letter dated 1 June 2010, Tulip I wrote to Emlak regarding \"Notice of Annulment.\"76 In that letter Tulip I explains in detail why it thinks the grounds for annulment are unjust and a violation of the Law. At paragraph 3.4.2 Tulip I says \"Due to the Fact that Our Company Has Foreign Partners, the Annulment Will Inevitably Have Negative National and International Consequences:\"...\"It is manifestly evident that *the Van HERK Group will pursue the matter* in national and *international courts* as well as with political offices.\" (emphasis added).\n\nCE-222.\n\n106.\n\n*Tulip I letter to Prime Minister\u2019s Office dated 25 June 2010:* By letter dated 25 June 2010, Tulip I wrote to the Republic of Turkey, Prime Ministry.77 In this letter Tulip I notes that it is a company with a foreign partner. It then goes on to detail the conduct of Emlak stating that \"[w]e are certain that the Prime Minister, knowing the situation, would not condone this type of illegal behavior, and that is why we are bringing this matter to your attention.\"\n\nCE-200.\n\n107.\n\n*Tulip I letter to President of the Republic of Turkey dated 8 July 2010:* By letter dated 8 July 2010, Tulip I wrote to The Honorable Abdullah G\u00fcl, President of the Republic of Turkey.78 In this letter Tulip I notes that it is a company in a partnership with foreign capital investors. It goes on to list the alleged illegal actions taken against Tulip I and makes a number of assertions and pleas. The relevant paragraphs of the letter for the present purpose are extracted below. At paragraph 11, the letter states:\n\n*We are now in the process of drawing up our complaints with regard to the practices of the EMLAK GYO management over the course of the project,... The absurd attitudes of EMLAK GYO is forcing us to take even more serious legal precautions. This situation was explained to them through a letter written to the company last year in July 2009 by the Consulate-General of the Netherlands, in which it was requested that the company \u2018refrain from actions perpetuating unfair competition\u2019.*\n\nCE-226.\n\n108.\n\nAt paragraph 15 it states:\n\n*The gravity of the matter in terms of foreign capital investors, and particularly the fact that the Netherlands Embassy is engaged in the affair, is boundless. Moreover, the application of the Van Herk Group to the ICSID in France is a lawsuit that is almost sure to be won because of EMLAK GYO\u2019s unquestionably unfair actions.*\n\n109.\n\nClaimant asserts that the language of this letter could not be clearer. Claimant says that this letter was from a Dutch investor, well known to Respondent, notifying the Head of State that an international investment dispute has arisen with the Turkish Government. It is said that for the avoidance of doubt, ICSID was specifically cited in the written notice as the potential forum for vindicating Claimant\u2019s investment rights as a Dutch company.79\n\nC Memorial, para. 23.\n\n110.\n\nAs noted in para 121(4) below, this contention of clarity is somewhat clouded by the fact that para 16 commences, \"We have no requests in the name of Foreign Capital interests.\"\n\n111.\n\nRespondent contends that the entire letter contains a long list of complaints against only Emlak, not TOKI or the Government. Respondent says that this is a different dispute from the BIT dispute before the Tribunal. It is material that the letter was not written by the Dutch investor, but a Turkish company and does not notify the President of a possible investment dispute under the BIT.80\n\nR Counter-Memorial, paras. 108-114.\n\n112.\n\n*Tulip I letter to Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey dated 23 July 2010:* By letter dated 23 July 2010, Mr. Adrianus van Herk of Tulip Real Estate and Development BV and CEO of Van Herk Groep wrote to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, with the letter sent through the Embassy of Turkey in The Hague.81 In that letter, Mr. van Herk asks for the attention of the Prime Minister to be directed to Tulip\u2019s complaints as \"TOKI, as 99% shareholder of Emlak Konut GYO, are directly under the Prime Minister Office.\" In relevant part, the letter states:\n\n*That is the reason of forwarding attached letter for your kind attention through the Embassy of Turkey in The Hague due to the fact that we are Dutch investors domiciled in the Netherlands and main shareholder and financier of TULIP.*\n\n*We are very frustrated commercially, facing serious reputational consequences, as well very substantial profit losses to all parties involved due to breach of laws of Turkey by TOKI and Emlak Konut GYO with the full consent of the president of TOKI, Mr. Erdogan Bayaktar, and the Chairman of Emlak Konut GYO. This behavior is very shocking to us as they should be an example of respecting the laws of Turkey and not breaching them. We are treated illegally, unfairly and improperly in accordance to any ethical and decent way of conducting our business.*\n\nCE-213.\n\n113.\n\n*Letter from Turkish Presidency to Murat Mertoglu dated 6 September 2010:* By letter dated 6 September 2010, the General Secretariat of the Turkish Presidency wrote to Mr. Murat Mertoglu, Vice-Chairman of a Tulip entity and co-signatory of the letter to the Prime Minister, and delivered it to Tulip\u2019s Ankara office.82 Respondent says that this letter was a reply to the letters to the President of 8 July 2010 and to the Prime Minister of 25 June 2010 and called for a reply for Claimant in refutation. The letter states that the General Secretariat of the Presidency does not conduct the type of investigations that the Turkish company had requested; such requests are, if necessary, relayed to the authorities concerned. The letter then continues:\n\n*However, since it was understood that your referenced letter (a) is delivered to the concerned authorities in the form of distributed letter and Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakltgt Anonim Sirketi is a corporation subject to private law provisions, there are no procedures that can be implemented by the Presidency regarding their transactions and the practices specified in your letters.*\n\nRE-2.\n\n114.\n\nRespondent says that this response confirms that the letters sent to the Government by Tulip I were not understood as raising any claims against the Government, but merely complain and make requests for action against Emlak. Respondent argues that if Claimant or its Turkish subsidiary had intended to notify the Prime Minister and the President of an investment dispute, seeking consultations and negotiations, they must have concluded from the reply of the Presidency that they were misunderstood: Claimant\u2019s reaction should have been to write to the Presidency explaining that the true objective of their letters was not, as the Presidency had understood, investigation and assistance; but that they or their group sought the resolution of a BIT dispute.83\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para. 125.\n\n115.\n\nRespondent presented evidence that the letter was received and signed for at one of Tulip\u2019s Turkish addresses. In his witness statement, Mr. Benitah says that the letter to the President did not receive a response.84 At the hearing, Claimant maintained that the letter of 6 September 2010 was unknown to Claimant until it received Respondent\u2019s CounterMemorial.85\n\nBenitah 2nd W/S, para. 28.\n\nTranscript, 142:9-14.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the letter of 6 September 2010 was sent by the Presidency and received and signed for by Mr. Hayri Hisarciklioglu at Tulip's Ankara offices.86 However, it also accepts that Claimant itself was unaware of this letter until raised in Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial. Unfortunate as it is, it appears that Claimant was not aware of Respondent\u2019s apparent misunderstanding of Tulip I\u2019s letters to the Prime Minister and Presidency, and because of that, this apparent misunderstanding went uncorrected.\n\nTranscript, 206:15-18; RE-3.\n\n**(iii) When was notice provided that there was an investment dispute?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nAs articulated above, the finding of the Tribunal is that Article 8(2) requires the investor to inform the host State that it faces allegations of treaty breaches that could eventually engage the host State's international responsibility before an international tribunal. It requires the investor to apprize the host State of the likely consequence of Treaty claims being filed should the negotiation process break down.\n\n118.\n\nAs the Tribunal enquires whether, on the evidence presented, Claimant satisfied this requirement of providing notice of the dispute to Respondent, on any view, the language used in the correspondence relied upon by Claimant is imperfect.\n\n119.\n\nIt is barely tenable to suggest that correspondence sent by the Dutch Consular or Tulip I to Emlak informed Respondent itself of the existence of a dispute arising under the BIT. These letters are addressed to Emlak, and only indirectly refer to possible consequences arising under the BIT. Nevertheless, these letters did inform the Chairman of Emlak, who was also the Chairman of TOKI, of the deteriorating relationship between Tulip I (which had foreign investors) and Emlak and the 27 May 2010 letter advises that the Dutch government was involved to assist Dutch origin companies in solving \"... *investment related disputes*...\" (emphasis added).\n\n120.\n\nOf a stronger characterization is the 8 July 2010 letter to the President of Turkey. Whilst somewhat obscure in its drafting (which may, in part, be due to it being translated from Turkish) the letter makes a number of significant points -\n\n(1) First, it informs the President that the \"attitudes of EMLAK GYO\" are forcing Tulip I to take \"even more serious legal precautions.\" It is unclear what the \"more serious legal precautions\" entail, but some light may be shed by reference to the following sentence, which refers to the letter from 2009 of the Consulate-General of the Netherlands. The Tribunal assumes the reference to July 2009 actually refers to the 3 August 2009 letter considered above. In this regard, by reference to \"fair treatment as an internationally owned corporation,\" the Tribunal considers that the Consul\u2019s 3 August 2009 letter invoke a provision of the BIT, namely Article 3. Therefore, the \"more serious legal precautions\" quite possibly refers to claims in an international forum for alleged violations of the BIT, although, this, on its own, is inconclusive.\n\n(2) Second, it refers to foreign capital investors and the fact that the Netherlands\u2019 Embassy is engaged. The Tribunal considers that these statements put the recipient on notice that this is no longer merely a domestic matter.\n\n(3) Third, reference is made to the application of the \"Van Herk Group to the ICSID in France.\"\n\n(4) Fourth, and as noted above, somewhat in derogation of the first 3 points, the letter says that Tulip I has \"No requests in the name of Foreign Capital interests.\" The meaning of this sentence is not entirely clear to the Tribunal. It seems to detract from the preceding threat of the potential for ICSID proceedings. An alternative interpretation is that Tulip I is merely saying there are no requests in the name of foreign capital interests at present, but should the matter not be resolved, the ICSID proceedings on behalf of foreign interests may follow.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n121.\n\nDoing the best it can with these confusing correspondences, the Tribunal concludes that, as a whole, following as it did the prior communications, and also in the context of the deteriorating relationship between Tulip I and Emlak, this letter of 8 July 2010 to the Head of State of Turkey supports the finding that Claimant just satisfies the requirement of providing notice of the dispute arising under the BIT to Respondent. Claimant clearly did not employ the most perfect forms when it notified Respondent of the dispute. However, what is required by Article 8(2) is to apprize the host State of the dispute as arising under the BIT and that the likely consequences if negotiation processes break down are proceedings before an international tribunal pursuant to the BIT.\n\n122.\n\nIn all the circumstances, the Tribunal accepts, albeit with difficulty and hesitation, that no later than 8 July 2010 Claimant informed Respondent it faced allegations of breaches of the terms of the BIT that could eventually engage its international responsibility before an ICSID tribunal. In the result, Claimant overcomes, but only just, the very powerful case to the contrary made by Respondent.\n\n123.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that no later than 8 July 2010 notice of the dispute arising under the BIT was given in compliance with Article 8(2).\n\n**(c) Did Claimant seek to engage in consultations and negotiations with Respondent?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nArticle 8(2) secondly requires that the parties seek to resolve the investment dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. It establishes a best effort standard and does not require a result.\n\n125.\n\nAs the Tribunal has determined that the investment dispute arose, at the latest, by 8 July 2010, the enquiry is whether from that date negotiations were sought with Turkey on the subject matter of the investment dispute.\n\n126.\n\nThe letter from the Dutch Consul General in Istanbul, 27 May 2010 reads, \"...Tulip REIC would like to continue the project as the pilot partner under the same contract or alternatively, purchase the land by the contract value and proceed with the project independently.\" While the proposal may not have been acceptable, indeed even realistic, there can be little doubt that it is an effort to seek an amicable resolution. In that sense it evidences an interest in engaging in consultations and negotiations in general to resolve disputes concerning the Ispartakule III Project.\n\n127.\n\nIn the last paragraph of the 8 July 2010 letter from Tulip I to the President of Turkey, Tulip I makes numerous requests to the President to intervene in the dispute. In the context of the preceding paragraphs, which loosely indicate that ICSID proceedings may be commenced if the dispute is not resolved, the Tribunal accepts that this letter seeks to engage with the President to resolve the dispute arising under the BIT. Based on the findings of this Tribunal above, these overtures concern the subject matter of the investment dispute brought before this Tribunal under the BIT.\n\n128.\n\nFurther, in the letter dated 23 July 2010 from Mr. Adrianus van Herk to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, after bringing circumstances of the dispute to the attention of the Prime Minister, Mr. van Herk offers Mr. Murat Mertoglu to be at the disposition of the Prime Minister, \"any time, any day, to provide full disclosure on the issue and all legal facts.\"87\n\nCE-213.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n129.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal finds that after giving notice of the dispute arising, Claimant sufficiently sought amicably to resolve the investment dispute through consultations and negotiations. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that this negotiation requirement of Article 8(2) is satisfied.\n\n**(d) Had one year elapsed from the date the dispute arose and the commencement of these proceedings?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nAs the Tribunal has determined that notice of the investment dispute was given by no later than 8 July 2010, one year is found to have elapsed when the Request was filed on 11 October 2011.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n131.\n\nBased on the determinations above, the Tribunal finds that Article 8(2) of the BIT has been complied with and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to proceed to hear the next phase of this arbitration.\n\n**8) Futility, Waiver and Procedural Economy**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nClaimant submits that even if Article 8(2) was not strictly complied with, this Tribunal maintains jurisdiction either because -\n\n(1) The provision could be dispensed with on the basis of its futility in the circumstance of the case;\n\n(2) Respondent waived compliance with Article 8(2); or\n\n(3) By reason of procedural economy.88\n\nC Memorial, para 72.\n\n133.\n\nRespondent contends that none of these arguments or alleged principles may override the requirements of Article 8(2), which concerns the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.89\n\nR Counter-Memorial, para 169 *et seq.*\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that there are differing views with respect to the existence and operation of principles of futility and procedural efficiency. As has been noted, there are no grounds in this case to contend for waiver.\n\n135.\n\nAs a matter of approach, the Tribunal notes again that jurisdiction under a BIT constitutes a qualified waiver of State sovereignty. As such, a State is entitled to stipulate conditions for compliance before claims may be issued as arising under a BIT. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, explicit provisions for notice and negotiations, as in Article 8(2), are required strictly to be complied with and not to be ignored. Nonetheless, as the decision here is that the notice and negotiation requirements were met, it becomes unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine the alternative constructions canvassed by the Claimant noted in para 132 above.90\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the bar to the acceptance of a permissive approach embraced by some tribunals to overcome situations of non-compliance with treaty requirements expressed as a condition, is that, no more than for the ICJ, this Tribunal is without capacity to dispense with inconvenient terms of a treaty. Neither the Vienna Convention nor principles of customary international law enable the terms of State consent to jurisdiction to be redefined as merely directory or subject to unexpressed qualifications.\n\n**9) Costs**\n------------\n\n136.\n\nEach Party has requested to be awarded its full professional costs, expenses and disbursements in relation to this part of the proceedings.\n\n137.\n\nClaimant contended that Respondent\u2019s Article 8(2) Objection was frivolous and was pursued in bad faith.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. The requirements for notice and other steps under Article 8(2) were plain enough and Claimant well had it within its means to make the application now addressed in this decision entirely avoidable.\n\n139.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the ambiguity inherent in the evidence presented by Claimant to support a finding of compliance with Article 8(2) effectively invited the Rule 41(1) application. Respondent was entirely reasonable to call Claimant to its proofs.\n\n140.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal remains at a loss to understand why explicit notice was not given, especially as Claimant was advised that it should delay proceedings until the expiry of the one-year period under Article 8(2).\n\n141.\n\nRespondent's filed submissions in reply ably express how close to the margin Claimant sailed: in nautical metaphor, the Tribunal finds the notice given complies at a level of satisfaction to be just above the Plimsoll Line. It recalls the Duke of Wellington\u2019s comment after Waterloo, that it was \"a damned near-run thing.\"\n\n142.\n\nIn the particular circumstances, the Tribunal regards it as appropriate to determine that in any ultimate costs orders, Claimant should not have its costs of this application. As regards Respondent\u2019s request for costs, the Tribunal reserves leave to Respondent to contend upon finality that, although unsuccessful on this application, Respondent should have its costs of this application.\n\n**Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal declares that:**\n\n**1 Respondent's Rule 41 (1) application is rejected.**\n\n**2 Costs issues reserved to final costs orders.**\n\n**The extant procedural directions are confirmed.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2014-03-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of Michael Evan Jaffe on the Question of Attribution Under Art 8, ILC Articles (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2014-03-07T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Separate Opinion of Michael Evan Jaffe on the Question of Attribution Under Art 8, ILC Articles (Award)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this separate opinion, I write to express my views on the attribution issue under Art 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility (\"ILC Articles\"), noting that my separate views do not affect the outcome of the proceedings. Rather, I write to clarify that the evidence taken as a whole can be read as demonstrating that Emlak was not only under the control of the State - here TOKI - as a *de jure* matter; but, as a practical matter, took the decision to terminate the Ispartakule III Contract at the direction of TOKI, It is for that reason that I do not join the majority\u2019s decision that Emlak\u2019s conduct in terminating the Ispartakule III Contract cannot be attributed to the Turkish State.\n\n1.\n\nAs my colleagues in the majority observe, for the purposes of Art 8, ILC Articles, the question is whether Emlak acted *\u2018on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of [the State] in carrying out the conduct'* which forms the subject of the Claimant\u2019s complaints under the BIT. And, I join them as well in their observation that the words \u2018direction\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 in Art 8 are to be read disjunctively. Therefore, if cither element is satisfied, there is a basis for attribution under Art 8.\n\n2.\n\nFurther, I join my colleagues in the majority in accepting the Respondent\u2019s submission that the relevant test for determining whether Emlak acted under the control of TOKI is \u2018effective control.\u2019 From that proposition, the question can be stated as whether any aspect of the administration and termination of the Contract was performed under the instructions or direction of TOKI. And, I accept as correct the majority\u2019s view that it is insufficient for the purposes of attribution under Art 8 to establish merely that Emlak was majority-owned by TOKI.\n\n3.\n\nHere, the evidence establishes that TOKI was not only capable of exerting effective control over Emlak through its control over the voting shares and through its representation on the Board of Emlak; but, that through Mr, Bayraktar, the head of Emlak and the Chairman of TOKI, Emlak was all but read out of the decision-making equation as regards termination of the Ispartakule III Contract,\n\n4.\n\nIn addition to the discussion in the majority\u2019s opinion of TOKI\u2019s connection to the decision to terminate the Ispartakule III Contract based on the *Milliyet* newspaper article dated 2 June 2010, Mr Bayraktar\u2019s testimony at the hearing showed that as a practical matter the lines of separateness between TOKI and Emlak were all but non-existent as regards the termination decision.\n\n5.\n\nNotably, the majority acknowledges that the Emlak Board was made up primarily of TOKI employees, that Mr. Bayraktar was their superior as the Chairman of TOKI, that the Emlak Articles of Association, at Art 8.9, state that TOKI\u2019s shares \"constitute dominancy in management,\" and that \"Emlak was subject to the control of TOKI and, therefore, the Turkish State.\" (Majority Award at \u00b6J307). Moreover the majority observes that \"TOKI was certainly capable of also exerting sovereign control over Emlak.\" (Majority Award at \u00b6308) And, the majority goes so far as to conclude \"To the extent that TOKI exercised such governmental control in particular instances in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of Emlak would have been attributable to the State.\" (Majority Award, *Id.)*\n\n6.\n\nSignificantly, however, the majority all but ignores the very evidence that they say would be probative, namely the evidence found in the testimony of Erdogan Bayraktar. At a time when he was called to testify on the topic of the independence of Emlak, Mr. Bayraktar showed that control and direction were more than mere possibilities. In his testimony, when discussing the Tulip investment and the termination of the Ispartakule III Contract, and without being asked to address TOKI\u2019s interest or purpose, Mr. Bayraktar spoke not about Emlak\u2019s interest and purpose, but, about TOKI\u2019s. Mr. Bayraktar testified:\n\nAnd allow me to make a couple of clarifications, please. I would definitely like to ensure that the distinguished arbitrators understand our sincere intentions. We were very delighted to see Tulip and its foreign capital enter the Turkish market, and we were more than willing to help them out, obviously in compliance with the laws.\n\nThat's exactly the working principle of TOKI. TOKI would like to attract more and more bidders into their tenders, and we are always delighted to have foreign capital in our tender process. And we also ensure that we facilitate the way contractors work. That's our main working principle. Had that not been our main principle, we would not have been able to build half a million units in eight years, and we did that without getting a single cent from the Treasury,\n\nUntil the last moment we never wanted to terminate. We never want to terminate any contract in TOKI. Maybe you also know that we have in Turkey about 200,000 contractors. We have an inflation of contractors; we are very strong. In Germany, that has an 82 million population, they have about 600 or 700 contractors. But we have an inflation of contractors. That's why we really had to take everything very seriously. That's why we really had to make sure that the contracts work.\n\nBut there is a contract in front of us. I implemented 30,000 tenders, tender documents, some big, some small. Yes, I had two hats on my head. Here I was president of TOKI; on the other hand, I was the president of the board of directors of the other institution, of Emlak. But that was natural. And I am repeating, I am repeating over and over again: when 1 saw Mr Meyer, he was a European, he was a Dutch citizen, he was the owner of this project, and when I saw him, I said: now the project is safe, and we shall be showing this project as a reference to other European investors. On the one hand, we want to increase our foreign investments; on the other hand, we would like to join the European Union, so we would like to cooperate with European companies. So we really spent an extraordinary effort in order to conclude this project positively.\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at (25:8-13, 25:22-26:12, 34:10-18, 52:12-53:3).\n\n7.\n\nRevealingly, it was not, according to the Respondent, TOKI that did the tender for the Ispartakule III Project;1 it was not TOKI that was to facilitate the way contractors work; and it was not TOKI that terminated the Ispartakule III Contract. Yet, at each measure, Mr. Bayraktar addressed the issue as a principle, achievement, and action of TOKI, not Emlak.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Damages at \u00b6138. In fact the tender announcement is captioned \"ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE JOB OF REVENUE SHARING IN EXCHANGE FOR SALE OF PARCELS\" promulgated by \"EMLAK RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP INC., A Partnership of TOKI under the Turkish Prime Minister\u2019s Office,\" (Exhibit CE-202)\n\n8.\n\nThe formal separateness urged by the Respondent notwithstanding, Mr Bayraktar\u2019s testimony shows that TOKI\u2019s sovereign interests drove the termination. On this record, it would be difficult to conclude that the decision to terminate the Ispartakule III Contract was not guided - if not fully directed - by the sovereign\u2019s hand.\n\n9.\n\nThe majority reaches the conclusion that there is no basis for attributing the acts of Emlak to the State because there were commercially viable grounds for the termination, (Majority Award at \u00b6 324-326). That approach answers the first question (whether the acts of Emlak are to be attributed to the State) by answering the second question (whether the decision to terminate was based on commercially viable grounds).\n\n10.\n\nHowever, the answer to the second question does not necessarily foretell the answer to the first. For example, if the President of TOKI were not on the Emlak Board; but, if she called the Chairman of Emlak and said that as a matter of public policy, the government was no longer interested in tolerating non-performance by foreign investors and, accordingly, Emlak was directed to terminate the Ispartakule III Contract, there would be no question that TOKI - a State organ - directed the termination. That conclusion, however, does not answer the second question, namely: whether the termination violated the BIT.\n\n11.\n\nIt is because  the questions are separate and because there is at least a credible basis for finding that Emlak\u2019s termination decision was taken under the direction and control of TOKI, an organ of the Turkish State, I would treat the attribution question under Art 8 as provisionally addressed in favor of attribution and focus on the question of whether there was state action amounting to a violation of the BIT. On that question, I join my colleagues in concluding that the proof offered was not sufficient to find a violation of the BIT."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 11 October 2011, the Claimant submitted a Request for Arbitration (the **Request)** against the Respondent to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes **(ICSID** or the **Centre).** The Claimant sought resolution of the dispute with the Respondent under the Agreement on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Turkey dated 27 March 1986 (the **BIT).2**\n\nBIT (Exhibit C-l).\n\n6.\n\nOn 12 October 2011, pursuant to Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the **Institution Rules),** the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Respondent.\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID (the **Secretary-General)** registered the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration pursuant to Art 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **ICSID Convention)** as Case No. ARB/11/28.

FACTS OF THE DISPUTE**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n56.\n\nThis dispute concerns allegations by the Claimant that the Respondent violated the BIT in its treatment of alleged investments made by the Claimant in connection with the construction of a mixed-use residential and commercial real estate development project in Istanbul, known as Ispartakule III.\n\n57.\n\nThe Ispartakule III development was to be carried out by an unincorporated joint venture known as Tulip JV, which was awarded a tender to complete the project by a Turkish real estate investment trust, Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi A.S. **(Emlak)** in 2006.\n\n58.\n\nThe \"lead\" partner in Tulip JV, a Turkish company known as Tulip Gayrimenkul Gelistirme ve Yatirim Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. **(Tulip I),** was established as a local investment vehicle by the Van Herk Group and Mr Meyer Benitah, a national of the Netherlands and a long-standing business partner of Mr Van Herk, in advance of bidding for the Ispartakule III project.3 Following the award of the tender for the Ispartakule III project to Tulip JV, Tulip I and the other joint venture partners entered into a \"Revenue- Sharing in Exchange for the Sale of Parcels\" Contract with Emlak (the **Contract).4**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 52; Articles of Association of Tulip I dated 23 May 2006 and the amendment to the Articles (Exhibit CE-58).\n\nContract (Exhibit C-2).\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant, a company within the Van Herk Group, was incorporated on 10 July 20075 and, on 14 August 2008, acquired a 65% shareholding in Tulip I and, correspondingly, an interest in Tulip JV.6\n\nArticles of Association of Tulip Netherlands B.V. dated 10 July 2007 (Exhibit CE-38).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 98; Tulip I Board of Directors Resolution dated 14 August 2008 (Exhibit CE-239).\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent, acting through various alleged state actors and/or entities operating under State control, engaged in a pattern of conduct that interfered with the construction of Ispartakule III in breach of the BIT and ultimately terminated the Contract in a manner that amounts to wrongful expropriation that deprived the Claimant and Mr Benitah of the entire value of their real estate development projects throughout Turkey.7\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 3.\n\n**B. Pre-Contractual Background**\n---------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in or around 2005, Mr Adrianus Van Herk, and Mr Meyer Benitah (referred to by the Claimant jointly as the \"Dutch Investors\"), decided that there was considerable opportunity in the Turkish real estate market and began exploring avenues for entering that market.8\n\nBenitah Witness Statement, paras. 13-15.\n\n62.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Mr Van Herk and Mr Benitah made several trips to Turkey to learn more about potential investment opportunities in Turkey.9 There is some dispute about the nature of the representations made to Messrs Van Herk and Mr Benitah by individuals they met during their preliminary visits to Turkey.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 15.\n\n63.\n\nIn the spring of 2006, Mr Van Herk and Mr Benitah learnt that there would be a tender for the construction of a mixed-use real estate project in western Istanbul, called Ispartakule III.10 The tender would be conducted by Emlak, a real estate investment trust11 that was, at the time, 39% owned by TOKI,12 Turkey\u2019s Housing Development Organisation (a state organ responsible for Turkey\u2019s public housing and operating under the auspices of the Prime Ministry of Turkey).13\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 22.\n\nEmlak Articles of Association (Exhibit IK-1).\n\nKeskin Witness Statement, para. 10.

At the beginning of 2010, an indictment was issued following a complaint by Mr Sagdic against Messrs Ozer and Mertoglu and others in connection with the conflict between FMS and Tulip JV.66 Further, the injunction granted by an Istanbul court to Tulip JV to allow it to take action without FMS was lifted in February 2010.67 Subsequently, FMS again wrote to Emlak to argue that it ought to cease and desist from accepting submissions made by Tulip JV without consent from FMS.68\n\nNo. 2010/497, Office Indictment from the Sisli Criminal Court of First Instance (Exhibit RE-33).\n\nSee, *e.g.,* Letter from FMS to Emlak dated 8 February 2010 (Exhibit RE-89).\n\nLetter from FMS to Tulip I, Tulip JV and Turk Barter dated 24 February 2010 (Exhibit RE-34).\n\nMertkan\u2019s Financial Problems\n----------------------------\n\n102.\n\nEmlak wrote to Tulip JV at the start of December 2006 and notified it that it had received a \"First Seizure Notice\" with respect to Mertkan\u2019s rights and receivables from Emlak and requested \"removal of this seizure\" within 30 days to avoid termination of the Contract pursuant to Art 31.69 Tulip JV responded on 26 December 2006, stating that Mertkan\u2019s financial issues were close to being resolved and requesting additional time to address them.70\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV and Mertkan dated 4 December 2008 (Exhibit RE-35).\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 26 December 2006 (Exhibit CE-172).\n\n103.\n\nFollowing additional correspondence between Emlak and Tulip JV regarding this issue (as well as steps to transfer Mertkan\u2019s interest in the joint venture to another company, with Emlak\u2019s permission), Mertkan wrote to Emlak on 17 November 2008 and requested to withdraw from Tulip JV.71\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 210; Letter from Mertkan to Emlak dated 17 November 2008 (Exhibit CE-172).\n\n104.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, the 7th Commercial Court of First Instance of Ankara decreed Mertkan bankrupt.72 On 26 October 2009, one of Tulip JV\u2019s subcontractors, YPU Yapi Proje Uygu. Insaat. Taah. Nak. Ltd. Sti., warned Tulip JV about an enforcement action against the joint venture for USD 70,000 owed on work at Ispartakule III and asserted that the joint venture should have been dissolved under Turkish law because of the Mertkan bankruptcy.73 On 30 October 2009, Emlak issued a warning to Tulip JV advising that the joint venture had to secure a new partner that possessed the requisite Business Experience Certificate (which Mertkan was described as having in the tender documents) within thirty days and that, otherwise, Emlak would terminate the Contract and cash in the performance bond.74\n\nNo. 2007/616, Ankara 7th Commercial Court of First Instance Decree of Bankruptcy of Mertkan, dated 19 March 2009 (Exhibit RE-10).\n\nLetter from YPU to Tulip I dated 26 October 2009

Time*\n------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nOn 2 May 2007, after the 270-day deadline prescribed by the Contract,76 Tulip JV submitted its preliminary drawings to Emlak.77 On the same day, Tulip JV submitted its application for a construction permit for Tulip Turkuaz to the Avcilar Municipality.78 Tulip JV was then required to make some revisions to comply with the zoning requirements and resubmitted its application to the Avcilar Municipality in August 2007.79\n\nContract, Art 6.2 (Exhibit C-2).\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 2 May 2007 (Exhibit

construction permit to the Avcilar Municipality, Tulip JV learnt that there was a dispute pending with respect to the zoning plan for the Bahcesehir Ispartakule III district (the area where Ispartakule III was located).80 The dispute centred on the question of whether TOKI rather than the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, the government body that had approved the relevant zoning plan, should have prepared the zoning plan.\n\nBenitah Witness Statement, para. 47.\n\n108.\n\nOn 24 May 2007, the Danistay, Turkey\u2019s highest administrative court, issued an order suspending all development on the Ispartakule III parcels.81 The order also required that TOKI prepare a new zoning plan.\n\nCouncil of State, Appeal No. 2007/210, Stay of Execution (Exhibit BE-8).\n\n109.\n\nIn the period following the Danistay order and the publication of the new zoning plan by TOKI, Tulip JV requested that the new plan take into account Tulip JV\u2019s approved construction plans.82 Emlak also wrote to TOKI to request that the new zoning accommodate Tulip JV\u2019s existing plans.83\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 24 October 2007 (Exhibit CE-86).\n\nLetter from Emlak to TOKI dated 16 November 2007 (Exhibit CE-245).\n\n110.\n\nOn 7 December 2007, the new zoning plan prepared by TOKI in respect to the area encompassing Ispartakule III was made publicly available.84 The new plan introduced certain changes to the zoning requirements that affected Tulip JV\u2019s plans with respect to the construction of the residential parcel of Ispartakule III.85\n\nImplementation Zoning Plan (Exhibit RE-49)\n\nConstruction Control Department Report dated 4 February 2010 (Exhibit RE-75).\n\n111.\n\nOn 7 January 2008, Tulip JV wrote to the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and requested that the new zoning plan prepared by TOKI be revised so as to accommodate Tulip JV\u2019s existing plans.86\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Instanbul Metropolitan Municipality dated 7 January 2008 (Exhibit BE-9).\n\n112.\n\nOn 11 January 2008, TOKI wrote to Emlak and stated that, given the existence of the new zoning plan, Tulip JV would have to revise its plans to accord with the zoning requirements.87\n\nConstruction Control Department Report dated 4 February 2010 (Exhibit RE-75).\n\n113.\n\nOn 23 January 2008, Emlak and Tulip JV entered into Supplementary Protocol No. 1 to the

grant it a 655-day extension of time to complete the Contract work to account for the zoning-related delay in the period from 17 August 2006 until 2 June 2008.93 Tulip JV stated in its request that the delay was an event of \"force majeure\" pursuant to Art 33.1 of the Contract.94\n\nTulip\u2019s letter per zoning problems and extension dated 17 October 2008 (Exhibit

JV*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFunding and Sales\n-----------------\n\n118.\n\nIn October 2006, Moore Stephens carried out a feasibility study for the Ispartakule III project and estimated that the total cost of the project would be approximately USD 234 million.98 Moore Stephens also concluded that:\n\nThe required initial investment amount (including the working capital requirements) of **43 M USD** is composed of **13 M USD** equity funds and **30 M USD** of loans. Furthermore, performance bonds amounting up to approximately **12 M USD** will be arranged by TULIP partners. The remaining costs of the project will be financed by funds to be produced by project itself.99 (original emphasis)\n\nMoore Stephens, Ispartakule III Project Feasibility Study dated 5 October 2006, p. 7 (Exhibit C-7).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n119.\n\nWhile the new zoning plan was still pending, on 10 July 2007, the Van Herk Group incorporated the Claimant.100 Then, in September 2007, Tulip Gayrimenkul Yatirim A.S. **(Tulip II)** was incorporated under Turkish law, using a similar shareholding structure to Tulip I.101 In October 2007, Tulip JV entered into a Construction Agreement with Tulip II whereby it purported to assign the obligations under the Contract to Tulip II in return for 90% of the revenue from the Ispartakule III project.102\n\nArticles of Association of Tulip Netherlands B.V. dated 10 July 2007 (Exhibit CE-38).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 63.\n\nConstruction Commitment Contract dated 2007 (Exhibit CE-62).\n\n120.\n\nOn 1 March 2008, the Claimant and Tulip II executed a Subordinated Loan Facility Agreement for EUR 20 million (the **First Loan Facility).103** Art 2 of the First Loan Facility provided that:\n\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, the Loan Facility may only be used by Borrower to finance the development and construction of the Project, in compliance with the TOKI Contract and The Construction Agreement.104\n\nSubordinated Loan Facility Agreement between Tulip II and Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV (Exhibit CE-63).\n\n*Ibid., Ait 2.*\n\n121.\n\nThe First Loan Facility specified at Art 4.4 that \"at least \u20ac 1,951,134.16\" had already been extended in loans by two other Van Herk entities, OGBBA Van Herk BV and Van Herk Real Estate Participations BV to Tulip II.105 These amounts were included in the overall sum of EUR 20 million available under the First Loan Facility.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art 4.4.\n\n122.\n\nOn 25 February 2009, the Claimant and Tulip I executed a Subordinated Loan Facility Agreement for EUR 2 million (the **Second Loan Facility).106** It was stated in the Second Loan Facility that, as at 28 November 2008, the full EUR 20 million had been drawn down from the First Loan Facility.107\n\nSubordinated Loan Facility Agreements between Tulip I and Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands (Exhibit CE-64).\n\n*Ibid.,* Recital E.\n\n123.\n\nThe Second Loan Facility relevantly provided:\n\n1.4 The Loan Facility of EUR 2,000,000 under this Agreement will be used to finance open bills of Borrower, TULIP2 and TULIP JV, overhead and salaries of these respective companies for the period until 31 May 2009 and expenditures and investments relating to marketing/sales and start of construction of the Project, in line with the head line allocation budget below (Table l).108\n\n*Ibid.,* Cl. 1.4.\n\n124.\n\nThe Second Loan Facility then provided that certain parts of the EUR 2 million would be used to cover existing bills and expenses, among other things, and that only EUR 800,000 would be available for construction of the Ispartakule III project.109\n\n*Ibid.,* Cl. 1.4, Table 1.\n\n125.\n\nRelevantly, the Second Loan Facility also provided:\n\n1.5 The worldwide financial crisis and macro economic uncertainties in Turkey may create uncertainties for the sale of the Project. Therefore, the period until 31 May 2009 will be used to make a full start in sales of the Project, as a test of the market.\n\n1.6 In case sales until 31 May 2009 will not be sufficient to finance construction of the first 3 blocks of the Project, being TULIP Turquaz, block 11a, 10a, 9b, TULIP JV will discuss with Emlak Konut GYO extension of the Project under clause 33 of the TOKI Contract or otherwise renegotiate more favourable terms and conditions. A possible sale of apartment of the Project to companies affiliated to Lender is not included in this respect.\n\n1.7 After providing by Lender the EUR 20m Facility Agreement, the YTL 16.6m performance bond for the Project and the EUR 2m Loan Facility under this Agreement, all parties understand that Lender will not provide additional financing to the Project. Therefore the priority will be to find a new partner who will buy out Lender's position in full, meaning all it's [sic] shares in Borrower and TULIP2, full repayment of all the (converted) loans invested into the companies/ project with the accrued interest and the return of the performance bond to Lender. In case such a new partner is not found, Borrower and Lender will arrange for other solutions to acquire new finance to the company with various alternatives including partial share sales to a new partner. In case such a new partner would request for it, all Board Members and shareholders of Borrower and TULIP2 are open to discuss to leave/hand over all management responsibilities and all external representation rights (c.q. signature circular) to new management of the new partner, provided profit shares of existing shareholders are protected.

The Work Program provided that all aspects of the project (including both the residential and commercial construction) would be complete by 19 May 2010.116 The schedule included specific milestones that were required to be achieved by Tulip JV at particular intervals before the completion date.\n\nDecember 2008 Program (Exhibit RE-54).\n\n129.\n\nPursuant to the agreed Work Program, Tulip I was required to complete 11.17% of the Ispartakule III project by the end of January 2009.117 On 20 January 2009, Emlak wrote to Tulip JV and stated that the required level of progress had not been achieved with respect to construction and that, as at December 2008, the physical progress remained at 1%.118 Emlak referred to Art 9 of the Contract (referred to in paragraph 81 above) and stated that Tulip JV was required to comply with the agreed work schedule.119 Tulip JV responded to Emlak by letter dated 29 January 2009, stating that it would accelerate the work in February and March 2009 to make up for the delay.120 The letter from Tulip JV to Emlak relevantly stated:\n\nFollowing the two years of delay due to the works on the change of zoning plan by TOKI and various other reasons, in spite of the great financial crisis breaking out simultaneously with obtaining construction licence and sales permit, our Partnership has begun the construction work with its own resources and completed the preparations for sales campaign to a great extent. Although there is not a substantial delay in the schedule, we need to work on reconsidering our selection of construction subcontractors-materials due to changing financial and economical market conditions, and we hope that you will understand the consequent small deviations in program targets. In any case, the necessary measures will be taken with accelerated pace in February-March term to ensure that the minimal failure pointed out in physical realization will catch up with program targets.121\n\nDecember 2008 Program (Exhibit RE-54).\n\nEmlak Letter to Tulip JV dated 20 January 2009 (Exhibit RE-60).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 29 January 2009 (Exhibit CE-119).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n130.\n\nOn 10 April 2009, Tulip JV requested that Emlak grant it a 470-day extension of time for delays said to be associated with the global economic crisis in terms:\n\n[w]ith reference to TulipTurkuaz project in the extent of the \u2018\u2019Work for Sharing Revenue Against Selling Land Lots in 3rd Region of Istanbul Bahqe\u00a7ehir Ispartakule\" under our commitment with on-going construction; global economical crisis started in August 2009 and in Turkey accordingly, showed an continuously increasing trend, and made all sectors, mainly the construction sector to come to a halting point.\n\nAs the economical crisis also affected the housing sales, the sales were generally stopped and the prices were declined. Thus, we could not start the sales in our project. It is definite that the global economical crisis flared with the failure of Lehman Brothers Bank on September 15, 2008, will continue until the end of the 2009.122\n\nTulip\u2019s letter to Emlak requesting 470-day extension dated 10 April 2009 (Exhibit CE-120).\n\n131.\n\nBy letter dated 16 April 2009, Emlak notified Tulip JV that:\n\nYour demand for additional period extension for 470 days to work period in your reference letter, was not assessed by considering current situation of the work. However, after acceleration of productions, reaching to the level, determined in the work program and continuation of this reached level continuously, your demand for additional period shall be able to be assessed.123\n\nEmlak also stated that it required Tulip JV to accelerate construction on the site and to have the requisite number of personnel on site for that purpose in order to comply with its contractual obligations, and indicated that in the absence of such compliance, Emlak would terminate the Contract.124\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV dated 16 April 2009 (Exhibit CE-189).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n132.\n\nIn May 2009, Turkey\u2019s Supreme Audit Board evaluated the Ispartakule III project and concluded:\n\nGiven that sufficient progress has not been made in the construction work in 2009 in accordance with the recommendations stated in the YDK report for 2008, it is recommended that the termination of the job be considered.125\n\nSupreme Audit Board Annual Reports 2007-2010 (excerpts) (Exhibit CE-265).\n\n133.\n\nThis recommendation was subsequently noted, but not acted upon, in Emlak\u2019s annual report.126\n\nEmlak 2008 Annual Report (RE-74).\n\n134.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, Tulip JV and Emlak prepared their first Progress Report with respect to Ispartakule III.127 Representatives of Tulip JV and Emlak met on site and agreed together on the amount of progress at the site. According to the Progress Report, they agreed that, as at that date, construction on site was less than 1% complete.128 However, other sources of factual information indicate that construction works had taken place at the end of 2008 and early 2009.129\n\nConstruction Progress Status Assessment Report dated 29 June 2009 (Exhibit RE-18).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nPreliminary Report on Construction Delay to the Project by Accuracy, para. 104 referring to Emlak\u2019s daily site diaries recording construction commencing on 05 September 2008 and continuing throughout 2008 and 2009.\n\n135.\n\nBetween June and August 2009, Tulip JV and Emlak exchanged correspondence whereby Tulip JV indicated that it would accelerate construction and Emlak again notified Tulip JV that there was insufficient progress on Ispartakule III.130\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV (undated) (Exhibit RE-64); Letter from Emlak to Tulip JV dated 24 August 2009 (Exhibit RE-65); Letter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 31 August 2009 (Exhibit CE-116).\n\n136.\n\nOn 10 July 2009, Tulip JV requested a 250-day extension for the completion of construction on the basis of the economic crisis.131 The letter sent by Tulip JV to Emlak stated that Mr Van Herk had, due to ill health, transferred to all authority with respect to the Ispartakule III project to Mr Benitah.132 On 24 August 2009, Emlak responded and stated:\n\nWith regard to your demand in the 8.a line of your notice, our Company has provided the ordinary partnership with the required support and will continue to do so. Your other demands will be taken into consideration subsequent to the realization of the issues mentioned in the letter of warning sent by our Company to the ordinary partnership as well as the repetition of these demands by the ordinary partnership.133\n\nLetter from Tulip I to Emlak dated 10 July 2009 (Exhibit CE-123).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV dated 24 August 2009 (Exhibit RE-65).\n\n137.\n\nIn August 2009, Tulip JV described to Emlak the efforts it was undertaking to increase construction progress,134 including having contracted with Yeni Dogus Insaat and having also added Gas Metas Is Ortakhgi to its team of subcontractors.135\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 31 August 2009 (Exhibit CE-116).\n\nContract between Tulip I and Yeni Dogus (Exhibit RE-59).\n\n138.\n\nOn 16 September 2009, Tulip JV submitted to Emlak its preliminary architectural plans for the Tulip Towers.136 Emlak approved those plans the next day, 17 September 2009.137 On 5 November 2009, Tulip JV submitted geotechnical reports with respect to Tulip Towers to Emlak for its approval.138\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 16 September 2009 (Exhibit CE-83).\n\n646 Tulip Towers approval of architectural plans (Exhibit BRG-87).\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 5 November 2009 (Exhibit CE-101).\n\n139.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, Tulip JV made another request for an extension of time to complete the Ispartakule III project.139 Tulip JV requested additional days for the zoning dispute, 350 days of extension due to economic crisis, and 200 days due to formwork construction changes, amounting to a total of approximately 550 days.\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 4 December 2009 (Exhibit CE-124).\n\n140.\n\nOn 18 December 2009, Tulip JV received a letter from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality whereby it was notified that the Municipality rejected its proposed design for the Tulip Towers part of Ispartakule III on the basis of nine specified reasons.140\n\nLetter from Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality to Emlak dated 18 December 2009 (Exhibit RE-57).\n\n141.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, Tulip JV and Emlak agreed and signed the second Progress Report regarding construction at Ispartakule III.141 The report showed that the project was 4.58% complete rather than the 68.7% required by the agreed work schedule.\n\nDecember 2009 Construction Progress Status Assessment Report (Exhibit RE-19).\n\n142.\n\nOn 11 January 2010, Mr Yeni Dogus, the general manager of Dogus (the main contractor for Ispartakule III) travelled to Rotterdam to meet with Mr Van Herk.142 He was unable to meet with Mr Van Herk and sent him a fax, in which he stated that construction was delayed at Ispartakule III because of Tulip JV\u2019s failure to pay the contractors pursuant to a \"realistic payment plan\" and advised that it would have to stop construction at Ispartakule III unless it received a revised work schedule and payment plan.143\n\nFax from Yeni Dogus Insaat to A.

Kurum (76:-l-25).\n\n144.\n\nNotwithstanding Mr Kurum\u2019s recommendation, Emlak\u2019s Board (including Mr Kurum) decided not to grant the requested extension to Tulip JV. On 1 March 2010, Emlak sent a letter to Tulip JV notifying it that the completion date for the project was still 19 May 2010.147\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV dated 1 March 2010 (Exhibit CE-193).\n\n145.\n\nBy letter dated 17 February 2010, Tulip JV indicated to Emlak that \"the original delivery date that we have verbally agreed on in our meetings is 31.07.2011\".148 Emlak did not provide any acknowledgement of this agreement. To the contrary, on 3 March 2010, Emlak wrote to Tulip JV (as well as to the individual partners) advising that if the issues Emlak had previously raised and the progress delays were not resolved within thirty days, Emlak would terminate the Contract pursuant to Art 31.149\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 17 February 2010 (Exhibit CE-195).\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV dated 3 March 2010 (Exhibit RE-68).\n\n146.\n\nBy March 2010, Tulip JV was making efforts to increase progress at the Ispartakule III site: the number of personnel on site increased from fewer than 60 people on 16 March to over 250 people in the middle of April.150 Similarly, there was a substantial increase in the number of concrete floors poured.151\n\nSupplemental Report on Construction Delay to the Project by Accuracy, Appendix 4.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n147.\n\nOn 7 April 2010, Tulip JV submitted revised preliminary drawings for the construction permit for Tulip Towers.152\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 7 April 2010 (Exhibit CE-84).\n\n148.\n\nOn 21 April 2010, Tulip JV made another request for an extension of time to Emlak, seeking an additional 582 days for completion of the project.153 The request proposed a completion date of 31 August 2011 for the Tulip Turkuaz part of the project and 31 December 2011 for the Tulip Towers. Emlak did not respond to this request prior to the eventual termination of the Contract.\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 21 April 2010 (Exhibit CE-75).\n\n149.\n\nOn 29 April 2010, Tulip JV and Emlak agreed to a third Progress Report.154 This report indicated that there was completion of 10.35% of the Tulip Turkuaz (residential) portion of the project and 6.21% completion of the overall project.155\n\nApril 2010 Progress Report (Exhibit RE-20).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n150.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, Tulip JV, intending to secure existing debts and obtain financing for the Ispartakule III project, transferred rights under the Contract amounting to TRL 3,100,000 to Denizbank Inc, Maslak Trade Center and Istanbul Public Finance Section.156 Three days later, on 17 May 2010, Tulip JV wrote to Emlak and requested Emlak\u2019s permission to assign rights to Denizbank, stating:\n\nIn order to speed up the jobs that are being performed within the scope of the Revenue Sharing in Exchange for the Sale of Parcels Istanbul Bahqe\u015fehir, Ispartakule Region 3 Job dated March 8, 2006, we would like to assign 7,500,000 TL (Seven million five hundred thousand Turkish Lira) of the receivables that you will owe us to Denizbank A.\u015f. as security for a loan we will secure. We request that permission be granted within the scope of article 30 of the agreement.157\n\nDeed of Assignment (Exhibit RE-70).\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 17 May 2010 (Exhibit CE-259).\n\n151.\n\nEmlak did not act on to the requested assignment prior to the termination of the Contract.\n\n**E. Termination of the Contract**\n----------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nOn 18 May 2010, the Emlak Construction Control Department issued a memorandum to Emlak\u2019s Legal Department, noting that the term of the Contract would expire on 19 May 2010 and requesting that the Legal Department act with respect to the \"nature of transaction required to be made\" pursuant to the Contract and also stating:\n\nEven though after the last letter of notification [dated 3 March 2010], the contracting partnership provided significant rate of increase in the number of employees and equipments functioning on the site, the required construction progress was not caught up due to insufficiency of site organisation.158\n\nConstruction Control Department Memorandum dated 18 May 2010 (Exhibit H-957).\n\n153.\n\nThe Legal Department then prepared a recommendation to the General Manager of Emlak, Mr Kurum, that the Contract be terminated.159 The Legal Department referred to a number of matters in the context of recommending termination, including the fact that progress at the site was at 10.17% and the Contract term would expire the next day, 19 May 2010, the bankruptcy of Mertkan, the assignment of receivables under the Contract to Denizbank and the ongoing dispute with FMS.160 The recommendation concluded:\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above and because the term of the contractor would expire on 19 May 2010 according to the contract, because the progress rate for the contracted work is at 10.17%, and because [the contractor] has assigned its rights arising from the contract without the permission of our Company, it is recommended that the contract for the \"Job of Revenue Sharing in Exchange for the Sale of Building Lots in Istanbul Bahcesehir Ispartakule 3. Region,\" signed between the ORDINARY PARTNERSHIP OF TULIP-FMS-MERTKAN-ILCI and our Company on 3 August 2006, be terminated based on Articles 30 and 31 of the same contract. If this recommendation is approved by your office, we request that our letter be submitted to the discretion and approval of the Board of Directors to authorize the General Management to terminate the said contract, to cash the performance bond of the contractor as revenue, to perform associated liquidation procedures, to contract out the remainder of the work under the Procedure of Revenue Sharing in Exchange for the Sale of Building Lots, and to conduct all other business affairs.161\n\nEmlak Legal Department Memorandum dated 18 May 2010 (Exhibit H-958).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n154.\n\nOn 18 May 2010, the Board of Emlak passed a unanimous resolution to terminate the Contract, determining to:\n\n[...] Annul the agreement of the \"Income Sharing Work for Bahcesehir Ispartakule 3rd Region in return of Land\" under the 30th and 31st articles of the agreement entered into by our company and TULIP-FMS-MERTKAN-iLCi-ORDINARY PARTNERSHIP dated 03/08/2006, to record the final guarantee of the undertaker as a revenue, to carry out the liquidation transactions\n\nTo tender the said work in its current condition according to the \"Income Sharing Work in return of Land\" method in accordance with the \"Regulation on the Tender for Income Sharing Work for in return of Sales, Rent, and Land Sales\" by our Company, and to authorize the General Directorate in order to implement and conclude the tender works.162\n\nEmlak Board Decision dated 18 May 2010, p. 4 (Exhibit RE-73).\n\n**F. Events after Termination**\n-------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nOn 24 May 2010, Emlak notified Tulip JV of the decision of the Board to terminate the Contract \"because the job cannot be completed in the time period agreed upon and because [Tulip JV\u2019s] conduct violates the contract.\"163 Emlak also notified Tulip JV that:\n\n(b) The performance bond has been recorded as revenue in accordance with the agreement by liquidating the account for the construction job according to the provisions of the agreement that was concluded\n\n(c) Furthermore, our Company\u2019s Liquidation Commission Delegation will be at the construction site on 07 June 2010 at 10:00 o'clock to draw up a Status Determination Report, and our Company shall be informed of the representatives that will participate in the determination proceedings on behalf of your Ordinary Partnership and be present at the specified date and time at the construction site.

Their counter arguments to this decision are based on the financial standing of their company, sales figures and ongoing construction work on the site. In this respect, Tulip REIC would like to continue the project as the pilot partner under the same contract or alternatively, purchase the land by the contract value and proceed with the project independently. Tulip REIC also requests an objective investigation of the case by public authorities.167\n\nLetter from the Dutch Consulate to Emlak dated 27 May 2010 (Exhibit CE-224).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n158.\n\nIn the next several weeks, Tulip I made a number of other attempts to revise and continue the Ispartakule III project, including offering again to buy the land for the price of the full minimum guaranteed revenue under the Contract.168\n\nLetter from Tulip I to Emlak dated 4 June 2010 (Exhibit CE-212).\n\n159.\n\nBetween 7 and 8 June 2010, representatives of Emlak\u2019s Liquidation Commission sought to enter the Ispartakule III site and conduct an assessment.169 Although the Parties disagree about the precise actions that transpired (and this aspect of the evidence will be discussed in further detail as part of the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the merits of the claims asserted by the Claimant), there is agreement that the Commission arrived at but did not enter the site on 7 June 2010 and then returned the next day, 8 June 2010, accompanied by members of the police force. On that occasion, the Commission carried out its assessment.170\n\nLetter from Tulip I to the Prime Minister dated 25 June 2010 (Exhibit CE-200).\n\nEmlak Letter Awarding EOT dated 6 November 2010 (Exhibit AD-14).\n\n160.\n\nOn 24 June 2010, Mr Kurum attended the site of Ispartakule III, accompanied by security personnel.171 The Parties disagree on the nature of events that occurred when Mr Kurum attended the site and, accordingly, the Tribunal will assess the evidence surrounding this event as part of the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the merits of the claims asserted by the Claimant. In any event, on 2 July 2010, the Office of the Prosecutor sent a letter to the Manager of the Department of Public Safety, notifying the department that Emlak must obtain an order from the civil courts to vacate the Ispartakule III site and that it would be within the duties of the department to prevent Emlak from seeking otherwise to obtain access to the site.172 Subsequently, the 6th Criminal Court of Kucukcekmece found Mr Kurum guilty of having restricted Tulip JV\u2019s \"freedom to engage in business and freedom of labour\" when he attended the Ispartakule III site on 24 June 2010.173 However, Mr Kurum has appealed the decision of the court and an appeal remains pending.174\n\nIndictment No. 2010/6644 To Kucukcekmece Criminal Court of First Instance (Exhibit C-24).\n\nLetter of the Kucukcekmece Prosecutor\u2019s Office dated 2 July 2010 (Exhibit BE-27).\n\nDecision, 6th First Instance Criminal Court of Kucukcekmece (2010/1357 E 2013/751 K) (Exhibit RE-100).\n\nTranscript, Day 4, Kurum (150: 22-24).\n\n161.\n\nIn July 2010, Emlak re-tendered the Ispartakule III project.175 Two companies, Dogu Insaat San ve Tic Ltd.

The court rejected the case, stating that it should be brought by all of the joint venture partners, as Tulip I did not have the authority or standing to file the suit on behalf of Tulip JV.184 Tulip I then applied to the Supreme Court of Appeals for a Correction of Decision (after Turkey\u2019s Civil Court of Appeal rejected Tulip I\u2019s request for appeal) stating that the appeals court approved of the local court\u2019s decision without justification and that the local court\u2019s decision was contrary to civil procedure law.185\n\nNo. 2010/788, Bakirkoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance, Decision (Exhibit RE-82).\n\nNo. 2010/788, Bakirkoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance, Request for Correction of Decision (Exhibit RE-83).\n\n165.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Tulip I\u2019s case by the lower court, Tulip JV initiated a proceeding against Emlak in the Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance, claiming that Emlak could not legally terminate the Contract unilaterally. Tulip JV sought declaratory and injunctive relief, along with TRL 100,000 in damages caused by the termination.186 The Tribunal understands that this proceeding is still pending.187\n\nNo. 2010/1654, Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance, Petition for Injunction, Section C (Exhibit RE-84).\n\nTranscript, Day 4, Keskin (160:2 - 161:2).\n\n**I.

The Respondent has failed to comply with the \"fair and equitable treatment\" obligation in Art 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nii. The Respondent expropriated the relevant investment in breach of Art 5 of the BIT.\n\niii. The Respondent failed to comply with its obligations in Art 3(2) of the BIT to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\" and to afford \"full protection and security\" to the relevant investment.\n\n(5) The Claimant is entitled to compensation for the loss caused by the termination of the Contract in breach of the BIT.\n\n168.\n\nIn response, the Respondent has requested that the following findings be made:\n\n(1) The Claimant\u2019s alleged investments fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n(2) The claims asserted by the Claimant on behalf of Mr Benitah are inadmissible on the basis that he has not joined as a party and the Claimant cannot otherwise present his claims on the basis of a purported power of attorney signed by Mr Benitah in favour of the Claimant.\n\n(3) The claims asserted by the Claimant are not attributable to the Respondent.\n\n(4) The claims asserted by the Claimant do not arise from the BIT and are, on the contrary, in essence contractual claims that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts (or, alternatively, are not admissible pending the resolution of local Turkish litigation).\n\n(5) The Respondent has not violated any aspect of the BIT.\n\n**IV. RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE BIT AND APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Relevant Provisions of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nIt is convenient to set out certain relevant provisions of the BIT.188\n\nArt 1(a) contains the definition of \"investor\" and provides that:\n\n(a) \u2018investor\u2019 means:\n\nii. a natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party under its applicable law;\n\niii. a legal person duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws and regulations of a Contracting Party.\n\nArt 1(b) contains the definition of \"investment\" and provides that:\n\n(b) \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of asset such as equity, debt, claims and service and investment contracts and includes:\n\ni. tangible and intangible property, including rights such as mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\nii. shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\niii. a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and associated with an investment;\n\niv. industrial property rights, including rights with respect to patents, trademark, trade names, industrial designs and know-how and goodwill and copyrights\n\nv. any right conferred by law or contract and any licences and permits pursuant to law.\n\nArt 2(1) provides that:\n\n(1) Either Contracting Party shall, within the framework of its laws and regulations, promote economic cooperation through the protection in its territory of investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its laws or regulations, each Contracting Party shall admit investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\nArt 2(2) sets out the scope of application of the BIT to investments and states:\n\n(2) The present Agreement shall apply to investments owned or controlled by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party which are established in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the latter Contracting Party\u2019s territory at the time the investment was made.\n\nThe phrase \"owned or control\" referred to in Art 2(2) of the BIT is defined in Art 1(d) as follows:\n\n(d) \u2018owned or controlled\u2019 means ownership or control that is direct or indirect, including ownership or control exercised through subsidiaries or affiliates, wherever located.\n\nArt 3 imposes the following obligations on Contracting Parties:\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, sale or liquidation thereof by those investors.\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded to investments of its own investors or to investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\nArt 5 contains the BIT\u2019s protection against unlawful expropriation and provides as follows in relevant part:\n\n(1) Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by the provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment or in the absence of a fair market value the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the investors, be paid and made freely transferable, without unreasonable delay, to the country of which the investors concerned are nationals or to any other country accepted by the Contracting Party concerned and in the currency in which the investment was originally made or in any freely convertible currency, mutually agreed to by the investor and the Contracting Party.\n\nArt 8 contains the BIT\u2019s investor-State dispute settlement procedure and states:\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving:\n\n(a) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by a Contracting Party\u2019s foreign investment authority to an investor of the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(b) a breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment.\n\n(2) In the event of an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. If such consultations or negotiations are unsuccessful, the dispute may be settled through the use of non-binding, third party procedures upon which such investor and the Contracting Party mutually agree. If the dispute cannot be resolved through the foregoing procedures the investor concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018Centre\u2019) for settlement by arbitration, at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose provided that in case the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Contracting Country that is a party to the dispute, and there has not been rendered a final award.\n\n(3) (a) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to the Centre for settlement by arbitration.\n\n(b) Arbitration of such disputes shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States and the \u2018Arbitration Rules\u2019 of the Centre.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this Article, any legal person incorporated or constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of either Contracting Party, but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of investors of the other Contracting Party, shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States be treated as an investor of such other Contracting Party.\n\nBIT (Exhibit C-l).\n\n**B. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n170.\n\nAlthough the BIT does not refer to a particular law as being applicable to the resolution of the dispute, Art 8(2) of the BIT references the application of the ICSID Convention, which provides at Art 42(1):\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that although the parties have not expressly agreed the applicable law, the Claimant has presented its claims (and matters concerning jurisdiction) on the basis of the provisions of the BIT, and the Respondent has proceeded to present its defence on the same basis. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the applicable law consists, for the most part, of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with international law, as well as the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal further observes that, in addition to applying the provisions of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, aspects of Turkish municipal law are also invoked, in particular as the Claimant asserts that Emlak is a \"state organ\" and entities designated as \"state organs\" under domestic law will enjoy that status under international law.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**A. Investment by Claimant**\n-----------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it made a unified investment into the Ispartakule III Project, and the Turkish construction sector, in accordance with Article 1(b) of the BIT as set out at paragraph 169 above.\n\n173.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, its overall investment includes several \"investment categories\", which validly constitute the parts making up its entire investment structure.189 The Claimant relies on the decision in *CSOB v Slovak Republic190* and other arbitral jurisprudence for the proposition that the Tribunal must assess the totality of its investment even if each element of that investment may not be sufficient on its own.191\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 352.\n\n*CSOB v Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4 (Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 24 May 1999) (Exhibit CLA-126).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 351-352 and fn. 479.\n\n174.\n\nFirst, the Claimant relies on its 65% shareholding in Tulip I, acquired on 14 August 2008.192 The Claimant asserts that this shareholding falls within the terms of Art l(b)(ii) of the BIT, referring to \"shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof\u2019.193\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 356; Tulip I Board Decision dated 14 August 2008 (Exhibit CE-239).\n\nBIT, Art l(b)(ii) (Exhibit C-l).\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, at that time of its acquisition of Tulip I shares, the \"previous Dutch Investors restructured their Turkish investment, and Claimant succeeded to the rights and obligations inherent in the shares of Tulip I transferred to it.\"194 The Claimant relies on the fact it acquired the shares from a related Van Herk Group corporate entity, OGBBA Van Herk BV, stating that the Claimant was a \u2018daughter company\u2019 of this entity.195\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 356.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 357.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that:\n\nScenarios in which an investment is transferred from one potential claimant to another sharing the same nationality, such that a BIT containing the state\u2019s standing offer to arbitrate would be applicable to both investors at one time or another, have not been found to trouble an ICSID tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.196\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 356.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on the decision in *CME v Czech Republic,* where the tribunal stated with regard to another share transfer between related companies:\n\n[A]ny claims deriving from the Claimant\u2019s predecessor\u2019s investment (also covered by the Treaty) follow the assigned shares [...] If the Treaty allows - as it does - the protection of indirect investments, the more the Treaty must continuously protect the parent company\u2019s investment assigned to its daughter company under the same Treaty regime.197\n\n*CME v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL (Partial Award dated 13 September 2001), paras. 423-424 (Exhibit CLA-122). The Claimant also cites the *Vivendi* annulment decision for the proposition that there only *might* be a question to answer even if rights were transferred between potential claimants of different nationalities - see *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux)* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (Decision on Annulment dated 3 July 2002), para. 50 (Exhibit CLA-82); Claimant\u2019s Reply, fn. 494.\n\n178.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant asserts a right to rely on a prior investment in Tulip I shares by the \"Dutch Investors\" for the purpose of bringing BIT claims pre-dating its own establishment and acquisition of an equity interest in Tulip I.\n\n179.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant has also referred to its shareholding in Tulip II in the context of its investment structure.198 However, it is not entirely clear from the Claimant\u2019s pleadings whether it pursues any purported equity interest in Tulip II as a basis for its overall \"investment\".199\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 63; Claimant\u2019s Reply, fn. 499.\n\nThe Claimant has referred to Exhibit CE-281, Articles of Association of Tulip II, dated 25 September 2007 and Exhibits CE-284, CE-285 and CE-286, Tulip II Share Transfers, but has not elaborated in its written submissions or at the Hearing on the precise nature or scope of its shareholding in Tulip II at any relevant time or whether it relies on any interest in Tulip II as an alternative to its alleged interest in Tulip I.\n\n180.\n\nAside from its shareholdings, the Claimant also refers to loans made pursuant to the EUR 20 million First Loan Facility with Tulip II dated 1 March 2008 and the EUR 2 million Second Loan Facility with Tulip I dated 25 February 2009 as forming part of its \"investment\".200\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 360-362; Subordinated Loan Facility Agreement between Tulip II and Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV dated 1 March 2008 (Exhibit CE-63); Subordinated Loan Facility Agreements between Tulip I and Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV dated 25 February 2009 (Exhibit CE-64).\n\n181.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is well-established that loans may form part of an investment when they are extended to local companies \"whose share ownership has already constituted part of the claimant\u2019s investment\", irrespective of their purpose.201 The Claimant argues that, in any event, the loans were drawn down and the Claimant has accounted for the use of the funds in Turkey as money spent for the Ispartakule III or other projects in Turkey.202\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 360 and fn. 499.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 360.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the fact that the First Loan Facility included an assignment by OGBBA Van Herk BV and Van Herk Real Estate Participations BV to the Claimant of certain earlier loans to Tulip II203 in addition to some EUR 3.5 million in \"fresh\" capital and stated as follows in Art 5.1 of the Agreement:\n\nVan Herk and OGBB herewith assign to Lender, and Lender accepts (i) the assignment of all rights and obligations of Van Herk and OGBB under the loans provided by Van Herk and OGBB to Borrower before the date of this Agreement, and (ii) the assignment of all rights and obligations of Van Herk and OGBB under the payments made by Van Hark and OGBB on behalf of Borrower before the date of this Agreement, all specified in table 2, in an aggregate amount of at least \u20ac 14,453,267.13, excluding accrued interest, costs and other amounts, but including 1% arrangement fee's [sic].204\n\nTranscript, Day 1, Newberger (35:15-23).\n\nSubordinated Loan Facility Agreement between Tulip II and Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV, Cl. 5.1 (Exhibit CE-63).\n\n183.\n\nIn accordance with Art 5.2 of the Agreement, the Borrower approved this assignment.205 Further, Art 5.4 of the Agreement specified that the balance available under the loan facility amounted to EUR 3,595,598.71 (which funds were drawn down after the loan facility was executed).206\n\n*Ibid,* Art 5.2.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art 5.4.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant appears to reference this \"very specific assignment\" to support its contention that any \"earlier investment\" was transferred to and \"captured\" by the Claimant.207\n\nTranscript, Day 1, Newberger (35:15-23).\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimant also claims \"direct out-of-pocket expenses\", such as travel costs, as contributions to the Claimant\u2019s pre-existing investment on the basis that they had no reason to exist other than in support of that investment.208 According to the Claimant, the fact that some of these expenses may have been paid by entities other than Claimant is \"of no impediment\", since the \"Dutch Investors\" who initially made the investment then reorganised that investment.209 Equally, the fact that some expenses were paid by other Van Herk entities after the Claimant came into existence can be justified as an investment belonging to the Claimant on the basis of Art 1(d) of the BIT, which the Claimant appears to interpret as extending to investments owned or controlled by an \"affiliate\", including a Van Herk sister company.210 The Claimant has submitted spreadsheets documenting the out-of pocket expenses allegedly incurred by the Claimant itself and different members of the Van Herk Group in the period between 2006 and 2011.211\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 363; Esveld Witness Statement, para. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 363.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nSummary of Tulip Expenses (Exhibit EE-8).\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that its investment included a \"performance bond\" of EUR 8,716,981.05 which took the form of a guarantee provided to Emlak by OGBBA Van Herk BV in August 2006 and subsequently transferred as a liability to the Claimant.212 The performance bond was drawn by Emlak shortly after the termination of the Contract, in May 2010. A corporate entity within the Van Herk Group, OGBBA Van Herk BV, paid the amount of EUR 8,716,981.05 to the Claimant\u2019s bank in Turkey as compensation for the payment of the principal and bank commissions. Within the Van Herk Group, the payment was recorded as a loan from van Herk Real Estate Participations B.V. to the Claimant.213\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 363; Esveld Witness Statement, para. 13.\n\nEsveld Witness Statement, paras. 13-14.\n\n187.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refers to the \"burgeoning\" Tulip brand, extending to other planned or commenced real estate projects in Turkey, as part of its overall investment. According to the Claimant, the Tulip \"brand\" falls within the meaning of an \"investment\" in Art 1(b) of the BIT on the basis that this treaty provision is inclusive rather than exhaustive and encompasses all kinds of assets.214\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 366.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that \"investments\" may be composed of various interrelated transactions, even if not each of these transactions, as such, would individually qualify as an investment.215 Nevertheless, the Respondent contends that the Claimant must show that the different elements of what it refers to as its \"investment as a unity\" validly constitutes part of the whole.216\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 291.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 488; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 292.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to dispute that the transfer of shares to Tulip I on 14 August 2008 was valid.217 Although the Respondent notes that the Claimant\u2019s ownership interest in Tulip I \"remains unclear\", it does not substantiate this assertion with specific evidence.218\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 304.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the suggestion that the transfer of shares in Tulip I assigned to the Claimant any pre-existing treaty rights acquired by the \"Dutch Investors\" prior to the Claimant\u2019s incorporation.219\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 305 and 296-297.\n\n191.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a corporate re-organisation does not automatically entail the transfer of treaty claims under the BIT. Rather, the Respondent argues, the Claimant must prove valid assignment pursuant to applicable law and has not done so in this proceeding.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the decision in *Daimler v Argentina,* where the tribunal held that:\n\nThe better view would seem to be that ICSID claims are at least in principle separable from their underlying investments. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Claimant\u2019s ICSID claims (or at least those connected with the shareholding) were necessarily and automatically transferred along with the shares by operation of law. Rather, the Tribunal finds that it should accord standing to any qualifying investor under the relevant treaty texts who suffered damages as a result of the allegedly offending governmental measures at the time that those measures were taken -provided that the investor did not otherwise relinquish its right to bring an ICSID claim.220\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1 (Award dated 22 August 2012), para. 145 (Exhibit CLA-98); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, fn. 378.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent also contests the characterisation of the two loan facilities referred to by the Claimant as parts of the Claimant\u2019s investment. The Respondent argues, firstly, that the loan agreements constitute private financial arrangements, similar to the transactions considered by the tribunal in *Burimi SRL and Eagle Games SH.A. v. Republic of Albania221*\n\n*Burimi SRL and Eagle Games SH.A v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18 (Award dated 29 May 2013 (Exhibit RLA-81); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 293 and fn. 374.\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that:\n\n(1) the Claimant has not shown that the loans were in fact *^associated'* with an investment that is the subject of the present dispute;222\n\n(2) large parts of the \"loan\" investment were not validly made on the basis that Emlak rejected Tulip Il\u2019s participation in the Ispartakule III project;223\n\n(3) no claims were made by Claimant in relation to Tulip II so that a loan to it falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.224\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 310.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 311.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 313.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that the loan agreements can only operate to establish an investment prospectively from the time they were executed and not otherwise.225\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 521; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 312.\n\n196.\n\nWith respect to \"direct out-of-pocket expenses\", the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to show that this expenditure constitutes an investment establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction226 and, in particular, contends that the Claimant:\n\n(1) has not identified the amount of expenses actually being claimed as an investment;227 and\n\n(2) has not provided a satisfactory explanation for claiming amounts paid by other Van Herk entities and/or paid after the alleged breaches of the BIT took place.228\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 314.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 315.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 527; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 317-318.\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant has not explained how the \"performance bond\" it relies on constitutes an additional aspect of its investment, has not disclosed the terms of the bond, and has not proven that the bond, paid by another Van Herk Group entity, OGBBA Van Herk BV, amounts to an investment by the Claimant.229 The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not established how the alleged assignment of the performance also assigned potential ICSID claims arising on the basis of the bond.230 Finally, the Respondent asserts that, in any event, the bond was paid to Emlak on 26 May 2010 and, therefore, only claims arising after that date could fall within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.231\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 321.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 322.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 323.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, the Respondent disputes the suggestion that the \"Tulip brand\" constitutes part of the overall investment under Art 1 (b)(iv) of the BIT or otherwise. According to the Respondent, Art 1 (b)(iv) includes a comprehensive list of intellectual property rights that were intended to be protected as investments under the BIT and does not extend to \"brands\" and the Claimant has not claimed that the brand constitutes goodwill or that it had its claimed value at the time of the termination of the Contract.232\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 324-332.\n\n199.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent argues that only a small part of the \"whole\" investment relied on by the Claimant could found the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in accordance with Art 1(b) of the BIT and Art 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant made an \"investment\" for the purposes of Art 1(b) of the BIT and Art 25 of the ICSID Convention when it acquired shares in Tulip I on 14 August 2008.233 The effect of this transaction was to give the Claimant an \u2018indirect investment\u2019 into Tulip JV and, consequently, the Ispartakule III Project.\n\nTulip I Board Decision dated 14 August 2008 (Exhibit CE-239).\n\n201.\n\nIt is well-established that an indirect shareholding in a local vehicle may form the basis for an \"investment\".234 Further, in this case, Art 1(d) of the BIT expressly contemplates direct or indirect ownership or control of an investment. Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s Tulip I shareholding constitutes a qualifying investment for the purposes of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1 (Award dated 22 August 2012), para. 91 (Exhibit CLA-98).\n\n202.\n\nFurther, although the Tribunal need not quantify the Claimant\u2019s overall investment for jurisdictional purposes,235 the Tribunal accepts that the Claimant\u2019s overall investment included various infusions of capital into the Ispartakule III Project through loans under the First Loan Facility and Second Loan Facility and other expenditure, such as certain out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nSuch quantification issues are a matter to be assessed in determining whether, and, if so, to what extent, the Claimant is entitled to compensation for any breaches of the BIT.\n\n203.\n\nUpon reviewing the evidence on the record, the Tribunal concludes that, as a matter of substance, at least part of the financing provided under the two loan facility agreements constitutes an \"investment\" by the Claimant. Although the Respondent has disputed the validity of the loan agreements for formal reasons, it is not contested that the Claimant was a party to the agreements as a lender of the funds (together with other Van Herk Group members as assignors). The Tribunal also finds that the Claimant had in fact effected regular payments pursuant to the loan arrangements in order to finance expenses in relation to Ispartakule III. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that certain funding provided under the loan facility agreements constitutes an \u2018investment\u2019 for the purposes of the BIT.\n\n204.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal accepts that, from the moment of the Claimant\u2019s incorporation and until the termination of the Contract, the Claimant incurred certain out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Ispartakule III project. Indeed, the Respondent accepts that expenditure of at least EUR 161,088 is attributable to the Claimant.236 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant also made a qualifying \u2018investment\u2019 by way of certain direct out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 529.\n\n205.\n\nFor jurisdictional purposes, the Tribunal need not determine whether the \"performance bond\" drawn by Emlak after the termination of the Contract constitutes a part of the Claimant\u2019s investment or whether it would form part of any claim for damages.\n\n206.\n\nAs regards the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* the Tribunal understands the Claimant\u2019s complaint concerns violations of the BIT that culminate in the termination of the Contract in May 2010. Indeed, the Claimant has stated in its submissions that \"[t]he dispute between Tulip and the Government of Turkey arose when the Contract was purportedly terminated as of 18 May 2010.\"237\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 384.\n\n207.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal understands that while the Claimant asserts certain other wrongful conduct by the State (such as conduct in connection with the zoning dispute), these allegations do not concern the Claimant\u2019s principal complaint. As the Claimant put it at the Hearing, in describing its allegation with respect to the zoning dispute: \"That\u2019s important background as the foundation of the case, but it\u2019s not what our claim is about for the purposes of breach\".238\n\nTranscript, Newberger, Day 1 (43:12-14).\n\n208.\n\nWhile the Tribunal may take account of the Claimant\u2019s overall complaints in assessing the whole of the Respondent\u2019s alleged conduct, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant\u2019s principal claim arises out of an \"investment\" for the purposes of the BIT.\n\n**B. Claims asserted on behalf of Mr Benitah**\n----------------------------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimant claims that it may bring BIT claims on behalf of Mr Benitah on the basis that Mr Benitah is a Dutch \"investor\" with a relevant \"investment\" who \"has an independent right, under the BIT, to seek redress, a right which he has properly exercised in this arbitration.\"239\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 368 and 372.\n\n210.\n\nThe contention is that Mr Benitah may pursue BIT claims through the Claimant despite not being named as a party because he has \"provided his irrevocable consent to Claimant to bring claims on his behalf in these proceedings\".240 In this regard, the Claimant relies on a Power of Attorney executed by Mr Benitah in favour of the Claimant, which grants the Claimant:\n\n... all necessary powers, and more specifically to act in his stead and in and on his behalf in any and all ways, with respect to any claim or rights that the Grantor has or may have arising out of, related to, or in connection with residential and commercial development and construction projects, companies, partnerships or other juridical or natural entities undertaken in or with respect to the Republic of Turkey... including but not limited to certain shareholding interests of the Grantor in [Tulip I] and [Tulip JV].241\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 243.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 374; Benitah Witness Statement, para. 11; Power of Attorney of Meyer Benitah (Exhibit CE-295).\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, by executing the Power of Attorney, Mr Benitah has complied with the \"jurisdictional\" requirement in Art 25 and the \"procedural\" requirement in Art 36 of the ICSID Convention.242 That is, Mr Benitah has given his written consent and the Request for Arbitration was signed by his legal representative. The Claimant also relies on ICSID Institution Rule 1(1), which states that a \u2018request shall be signed by the requesting party or its duly authorised representative.\u2019243 The Claimant asserts that, even if there were any deficiencies in the Request for Arbitration, the Respondent would now be time-barred for the purposes of challenging jurisdiction on the basis of such deficiencies.244\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 369-372.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 371.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 377.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the decision in *Ambiente v Argentine Republic* for the proposition that \"...the jurisdictional requirement of written consent in Art. 25 is satisfied by discharging the procedural one of filing a written request in Art. 36, either by the party itself or by its duty appointed representative.\"245 The Claimant also references *Abaclat v Argentine Republic* in support of the proposition that it may bring claims on behalf of Mr Benitah.246\n\n*Ibid,* para. 372, referring to *Ambiente Ufficio S.P.A. and others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9 (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 8 February 2013), para. 220 (Exhibit CLA-119).\n\nTranscript, Day 8, Newberger (19:3); *Abaclat and Others (Case formerly known as Giovanna a Beccara and Others) v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07 /5 (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 4 August 2011) (Exbibit CLA-1).\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimant presents the issue of Mr Benitah not being named as a party as merely \"procedural\" rather than \"jurisdictional\".247 At the Hearing, the Claimant offered to have Mr Benitah formally joined as a party with the agreement of the Respondent as a \"procedural device\",248 although that invitation to consent to the joinder of Mr Benitah *nunc pro tunc* was refused by the Respondent.249 The Claimant maintains the contention that it is nevertheless able to assert claims \u2018on behalf of Mr Benitah.250\n\nTranscript, Day 8, Newberger (16:21-24).\n\n*Ibid.,* (19:14-23).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter to the Tribunal dated 11 October 2013.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Letter to the Tribunal dated 18 October 2013.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the claims of Mr Benitah are inadmissible in this arbitration because Mr Benitah is not prosecuting his claims as a party and has not assigned his claims to the Claimant.251\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 545-550. Although the Respondent previously asserted that Mr Benitah did not make an \"investment\" for the purposes of the BIT (see Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at paras. 551-556), it appears to have abandoned this particular objection in its Rejoinder, stating at para. 334 that the Claimant can be taken as providing \"some evidence for a possible investment held by Mr Benitah.\"\n\n215.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant is \"stating the obvious\" in relying on Rule 1(1) of the Institution Rules or the decision in *Ambiente v Argentine Republic* for the proposition that a request for arbitration may be signed by a \"representative\".252 That is, the Respondent accepts that a request for arbitration plainly need not be signed by the investor itself.253\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 335-336.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 336.\n\n216.\n\nHowever, the Respondent argues that the relevant issue is not whether Mr Benitah has validly consented to the arbitration, whether he has met the formal requirements for the introduction of a claim or whether there are deficiencies to the Request for Arbitration.254 Rather, the Respondent bases its assertion of inadmissibility with respect to Mr Benitah\u2019s claims on the following matters (which, it argues, the Claimant has left unanswered):\n\n(1) The Power of Attorney relied on by the Claimant to bring claims on behalf of Mr Benitah does not act as an assignment of rights but merely grants the Claimant the power to \"prosecute\" claims as a representative of Mr Benitah.255\n\n(2) The Power of Attorney does not give the Claimant the right to assert substantive rights belonging to Mr Benitah, nor does it allow for Mr Benitah\u2019s claims to be represented in circumstances where he is not a party to the proceedings and would not be liable for costs should an award of costs be made in Respondent\u2019s favour.256\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 337.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 337.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nIn referring to claims brought \"on behalf of\u2019 Mr Benitah, undoubtedly the Claimant is seeking to assert Mr Benitah\u2019s claims in a representative capacity. Indeed, it is apparent from the Claimant\u2019s description of Mr Benitah in its submissions that the Claimant itself does not characterise Mr Benitah as a \"party\" to this proceeding in his own right. For example, the Claimant stated at the Hearing with reference to Mr Benitah:\n\nFor this proceeding, where **he has been appointed as the Claimant representative by BV through authorisation,** he is no stranger to the Tribunal or the Respondent, and he was cross-examined, he appeared here, he has submitted three witness statements.257 (emphasis added)\n\nTranscript, Day 8, Newberger (18:6-10).\n\n218.\n\nIn making these submissions, the Claimant has plainly sought to justify the right of a non-party to assert claims before the Tribunal.\n\n219.\n\nFurther, in its letter of 18 October 2013 to the Tribunal, the Claimant stated in discussing the claims of Mr Benitah that \"[h]e could have brought his own claims under the BIT.\"258\n\nLetter from Claimant to the Tribunal dated 18 October 2013.\n\n220.\n\nThe central point is that Mr Benitah did not bring his own claims before the Tribunal. Rather, he has sought to have the Claimant assert his claims in a representative capacity.\n\n221.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal is whether it may entertain such representative claims without Mr Benitah acting as a claimant in his own right.\n\n222.\n\nThe fact that Mr Benitah may be an \"investor\" who has made an \"investment\" for the purposes of the BIT and that he may have consented in writing to have his claims brought before the Tribunal cannot suffice for the purposes of the Tribunal being satisfied that it may entertain claims under the BIT brought by the Claimant \"on behalf of\u2019 Mr Benitah. The relevant enquiry must be whether the respondent State has consented to prospective liability under the BIT on the basis of representative claims. This issue is properly characterised as jurisdictional in nature rather than being merely procedural, as it concerns the scope of State consent in treaty arbitration.\n\n223.\n\nIn addressing this question, the Tribunal must defer to the fact that a host State\u2019s consent to prospective liability with respect to claims brought under the treaty, here the BIT, constitutes a waiver of State sovereignty and is governed by the terms of the BIT as defining its extent.\n\n224.\n\nIt is plain to the Tribunal that the terms of the BIT do not provide a basis to conclude that the State has consented to have representative claims brought against it.\n\n225.\n\nArt 8 of the BIT, addressing submission of disputes with the State to ICSID arbitration, relevantly provides:\n\n2) In the event of an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. If such consultations or negotiations are unsuccessful, the dispute may be settled through the use of nonbinding, third party procedures upon which such investor and the Contracting Party mutually agree. If the dispute cannot be resolved through the foregoing procedures **the investor concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018Centre\u2019) for settlement by arbitration,** at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose provided that in case the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Contracting Country that is a party to the dispute, and there has not been rendered a final award.\n\n3) (a) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to the Centre for settlement by arbitration.\n\n(b) Arbitration of such disputes shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States and the \u2018Arbitration Rules\u2019 of the Centre, (emphasis added)\n\n226.\n\nIn its unambiguously plain language, Art 8 limits the right to assert claims against the State to the \"investor\" who has an investment dispute with the State. Art 8 contemplates only that the \"investor\" who has a dispute with the State may submit claims in its own right, as a claimant. The Tribunal considers that there is no basis to read into Art 8, or any other provisions of the BIT, the establishment of a right for any alleged investor to bring claims through another entity (albeit itself a claimant) acting in a representative capacity.\n\n227.\n\nThe provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Institution Rules, relied on by the Claimant, do not alter this position. Contrary to the Claimant's contentions, the Tribunal characterises the \"jurisdictional\" requirement in Art 25 of the ICSID Convention referred to by the Claimant as a substantive stipulation that it be the investor itself who is the claimant, not its formally authorised representative. The reference to the jurisdictional requirement of written consent in *Ambiente v Argentine Republic* is no more than a reference to what is required to constitute such written consent so far as the signification of consent is concerned, and in no way extends capacity to a third party (or even to an extant claimant) to stand as agent in place of the investor required personally to be claimant in the proceedings.\n\n228.\n\nThe relevant inquiry for the Tribunal is defined as identifying the claimant or claimants from the constituting Request made under Art 36 of the ICSID Convention. As a matter of substance, it is those principal parties alone who are the claimants in proceedings instituted under the BIT, and none of Art 36 or any other provision of the ICSID Convention enable a third person not named as a claimant to prosecute claims as agent for a non-party principal.\n\n229.\n\n*Ex facie,* no provision of the ICSID Convention enables such a non-party to impose himself upon a State party respondent by deciding to \"submit himself\u2019 by giving a prior or subsequent authority to the named claimant, nor to himself be joined later in the proceeding without the explicit consent of the respondent State.\n\n230.\n\nThese obvious issues of construction have the Tribunal at somewhat of a loss to understand why Mr Benitah did not join with the Claimant as a co-claimant upon the initiation of the proceedings. For one reason or another, he made the election not to join. It is for the respondent State, here Turkey, to take the parties as it finds them. There are no means short of its consent to enable Mr Benitah to be moved from the status of a witness for the Claimant to the status either of a party advancing principal claims himself or through an agent advancing representative claims on his behalf.\n\n231.\n\nIt would be to ignore the clear provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT to enable the Claimant to prosecute his claims as his attorney. This suffices to find Mr Benitah cannot advance his personal claims in this proceeding. There is no obvious bar to Mr Benitah initiating his own claims as an investor within Art 25 of the ICSID Convention, but that possibility does not fall within the Tribunal's remit.\n\n**VI. ATTRIBUTION**\n-------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\nActs of Emlak\n-------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the acts of Emlak which form the basis of its complaint in this proceeding are attributable to TOKI and therefore to the State of Turkey.\n\n233.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant relies on Arts 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the **ILC Articles)** as representing the relevant principles of public international law on State attribution.259\n\nArt 4 states:\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n\nArt 5 states:\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\nArt 8 states:\n\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\nInternational Law Commission, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries\", Yearbook of the International Law Commission (2001) (Exhibit RLA-34).\n\n234.\n\nAlthough the Claimant\u2019s submissions do not fully relate the particular facts relied on by the Claimant to the legal criteria for attribution under each of the ILC Articles that it invokes, the Tribunal understands the Claimant\u2019s position to be as set out below.\n\n*Article 4*\n-----------\n\n235.\n\nWith respect to Claimant being a \"state organ\" for the purposes of Art 4 ILC Articles, the Claimant has argued that:\n\n(1) Emlak is \"an arm of the Turkish government\"260 which works \"to fulfil an executive function of the Turkish State\";261\n\n(2) Emlak was treated as a State entity. It was characterised as an arm of the State by the Turkish Ministry of Public Works and Housing and was described as enjoying \"special status\" by observers such as JP Morgan.262 It was audited like other public entities the Supreme Audit Board;263 and\n\n(3) Emlak was majority-owned by TOKI, a State organ within the Office of the Prime Ministry. As explained by Professor Gtinday, an expert on Turkish administrative law retained by the Claimant, at all relevant times TOKI owned 39% of Emlak\u2019s shares and controlled over 99.9% of the shares.264 Such State ownership gives rise to the presumption of statehood in accordance with previous investment tribunal decisions in *Maffezini265* and *Salini,266*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, Newberger (66:7-12).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 303.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 270.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 271.\n\nLegal Opinion of Metin Giinday, para. 32, fn. 4.\n\n*Emilio Augustin Maffezini v.

Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 23 July 2001(Exhibit CLA-37); Claimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 288-290.\n\n236.\n\nIn its closing submissions, the Claimant placed emphasis on Art 4 as being applicable to TOKI rather than Emlak: specifically, the Claimant contended that TOKI is the relevant entity to consider for the purposes of determining whether the Contract was administered by a State organ within the meaning of Art 4.267 As the Tribunal understands the closing submission, the Claimant substituted this closing approach for its initial position that Emlak is the relevant state organ for the purposes of Art 4.\n\n*E.g.,* Transcript, Day 8, Newberger (39:9-13 and 19-21).\n\n*Article 5*\n-----------\n\n237.\n\nWith respect to Art 5, because Emlak enjoys certain privileges afforded to public agencies, the Claimant argued that Emlak was empowered by Turkish law to exercise elements of governmental authority.268 According to the Claimant, Emlak exercised power under Turkey\u2019s zoning laws and with respect to land acquisition from TOKI\u2019s land banks.269 In particular, the Claimant relied on Emlak\u2019s special power under Art 26 of the Turkish Zoning Law to obtain construction permits in a preferential manner:270\n\nPermits for Public Structures and Facilities As Well As Industrial Facilities:\n\nArticle 26 - Permits shall be granted for structures that public agencies and institutions build or have built in accordance with the preliminary designs as long as it is designated for that purpose on the zoning plans and does not violate the plan or regulations on the condition that these public agencies and institutions assume responsibility for architecture, static analysis, installations and all types of scientific responsibility, and that ownership is documented.\n\nA construction permit shall be granted for structures that require secrecy in terms of state security and safety or the maneuvers and defense of the Turkish Armed Forces without requiring the documents listed in article 22 provided that the concerned municipality or governor\u2019s office is notified in writing that responsibility for static analysis and installations belong to the agencies and that the project designs are certified by the agencies in compliance with the zoning status, storey regulation, building line, construction depth and total construction square meters received from the municipality.271\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 363.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 275.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 267 - 269.\n\nZoning Law, Art 26 (partial translation) (Exhibit CE-55).\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant relied on the expert opinion of Professor Giinday, who emphasises that Art 26 refers to buildings being built by \"public authorities and institutions\" and opines that:\n\nTherefore, when Emlak Konut requests permits from municipalities, it acts as a public authority; and concerned municipalities regard Emlak Konut as a public authority. In this regard, I can say that Emlak Konut enjoys the public privileges bestowed to public authorities and institutions.272\n\nLegal Opinion of Metin Giinday, para 49.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to Emlak\u2019s ability to acquire land from TOKI on a priority basis and its consequential privileged status.273\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 275.\n\n240.\n\nFinally, the Claimant relies on the fact that Respondent\u2019s counsel were hired for the purpose of the arbitration proceedings through a public procurement process commenced by Emlak as demonstrating that Emlak is able to avail itself of processes only available to public entities.274\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 299.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimant contends broadly that Emlak relies on these privileges in the context of its development contracts with private parties.275 The Claimant also alleges that Emlak invoked its State authority unlawfully to cancel the Contract. It refers to Mr Kurum\u2019s alleged statement: \"We are the State. We can create an excuse\".276\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 363; Letter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 7 May 2007 (Exhibit CE-219).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 363; Erten Witness Statement, para. 54.\n\n242.\n\nAt the Hearing, counsel for the Claimant also asserted, in the context of the application of Art 5 ILC Articles, that Emlak was \"publicly characterised by TOKI as an affiliate of this organ of the state\".277\n\nTranscript, Day 1, Newberger (66:25 - 67:2).\n\n*Article 8*\n-----------\n\n243.\n\nWith respect to the application of Art 8, the Claimant contends that the criteria of this provision are satisfied because TOKI exercised \"an extraordinary level of control over every aspect of Emlak\u2019s operations.\"278 In particular, the Claimant relies on the fact that TOKI controlled the voting shares of Emlak and that TOKI appointed the majority of the Emlak Board members, who were constituted by employees of TOKI and represented them as such.279\n\n*Ibid.,* (67:12-13).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 262.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant highlights that Mr Ertan Yetim, the President of Emlak\u2019s Board, had served as an expert within TOKI since 2007; that Mr Murat Kurum, a civil engineer and a Board Member of Emlak, had served as an expert within TOKI from 2006 to 2012; and that Mr Ali Seydi Karaoglu was a TOKI employee and a member of Emlak\u2019s Board.280\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n245.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant places specific emphasis on the fact that Mr Bayraktar was, at all relevant times, the head of Emlak and the Chairman of TOKI. In that sense, he wore \"two hats\".281\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the fact that all key decisions with respect to the Contract took place in the offices of TOKI, rather than Emlak.282\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 264.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that TOKI and Emlak publicly presented themselves as closely linked entities as:\n\n(1) TOKI listed Emlak among its \"affiliates and subsidiaries\";\n\n(2) Emlak itself described itself as a \"state company\";\n\n(3) TOKI claimed that it could use its relationship with Emlak to \u2018secure TOKI\u2019s ambitious goals and to meet the expectations of Turkish citizens; and\n\n(4) certain correspondence and promotional materials displayed the logos of TOKI and Emlak together.283\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 263 - 265.\n\n248.\n\nFurther, according to the Claimant, the decision to cancel the Contract was not driven by commercial considerations purportedly surrounding delay as:\n\n(1) Emlak\u2019s Construction Control Department had recommended an extension of 418 days;\n\n(2) Emlak stood to gain more financially from staying with Tulip rather than re-tendering to Dogus; and\n\n(3) Emlak could have received its share of the Ispartakule III development by accepting Tulip\u2019s offer to buy the land outright. The fact that Emlak ignored all these considerations and re-tendered to a contractor that had not completed the project as of April 2013 indicates that the Contract was not cancelled for any *bona fide* commercial reasons.284\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 278 - 282.\n\n249.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the decision to terminate the Contract was made by Emlak under the control of TOKI for non-commercial purposes and in the exercise of State power. In making this argument, the Claimant relies upon, as evidence of TOKI exercising control over Emlak in the decision to terminate the Contract, a statement made by Mr Bayraktar following the termination of the Contract in the Turkish news publication *Milliyet,* where he was referred to as the \"TOKI Administrator\" and was quoted as saying:\n\nTheir sales have increased but there are problems among the partners. They refuse to give their consent. We cannot help any more. We have to protect the public interest.285\n\nBayraktar: Tulip Isi Aksatti, Tebemus Kirecci, MILLIYET (Exhibit CE-228); Transcript, Day 1, Newberger (104:18-24).\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that, although Emlak ostensibly relied on the delay as the reason for the cancellation, the press reported the reason as being due to the problems between the Tulip JV partners.286\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 281.\n\n251.\n\nFinally, as for Art 5, the Claimant again relies on the assertion that Respondent\u2019s counsel was hired for the purpose of the arbitration proceedings via a public procurement process commenced by Emlak. According to the Claimant, this is also evidence that Emlak is controlled by the State.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimant relies upon the decisions in:\n\n(1) *Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine* for the proposition that, for the purposes of attribution, it is irrelevant whether instructions or guidance given by a State organ are based on \"commercial or other reasons.\"287\n\n(2) *Salini,* citing the finding of the tribunal that \"[t]he administrative nature of the contract and of the laws that govern it corroborate the view of the Tribunal [that the entity in question\u2019s main object was to accomplish tasks that are under State control].\"288 According to the Claimant, there is a clear parallel to the present case in which Public Work Specifications are said to be incorporated into the Contract.\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16 (Award dated 8 November 2010) (Exhibit CLA-3); Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 362.\n\n*Salini Construttori S.pA. and Italstrade S.pA. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 23 July 2001, para. 34 (Exhibit CLA-37); Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 274.\n\n253.\n\nFinally, Counsel for the Claimant has relied on the assertion that Emlak takes land from TOKI\u2019s land banks as being relevant to the application of Art 8 ILC Articles.\n\nActs of other State entities\n----------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Turkish \"state agencies\" besides Emlak were involved in committing violations of the BIT.\n\n255.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant asserts that the Turkish state breached the BIT through numerous Turkish officials, including an aide to Prime Minister Erdogan, the Mayor of Ankara and Mr Bayraktar, TOKI, the Turkish police, the Supreme Audit Board and the Turkish Prime Ministry.289\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 291 - 297.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\nActs of Emlak\n-------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the acts of Emlak are not attributable to the State and that, as a consequence, the Respondent has not consented to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in this dispute and, in any event, the claims fail on the merits.\n\n257.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the question of attribution must be assessed with reference to the specific acts of Emlak that Claimant presents as constituting a breach of the BIT. The Respondent contends that, although the Claimant has not provided a definitive list of all such acts, the following acts (as referred to in different parts of the Claimant\u2019s submissions) were relied upon, namely:\n\n(1) acts in negotiating and tendering the Ispartakule III project.\n\n(2) non-disclosure of the zoning issue to Tulip JV or any of the Van Herk Group companies.\n\n(3) acts with respect to grants of permissions that were required for Tulip JV to carry out the Contract.\n\n(4) allegedly wrongful failure to grant Tulip JV extensions of time to complete the Ispartakule III project.\n\n(5) termination of the Contract in May 2010.\n\n(6) confiscation of all assets remaining in the account from the unit sales in June 2010; and\n\n(7) actions with respect to the project site following termination of the Contract.290\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 391.\n\n258.\n\nWith respect to the question of attribution, the Respondent does not deny the link between Emlak and TOKI. It asserts, however, that, in the absence of the requirements of Arts 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles being satisfied, a link, even a close link, between a State entity and a private company does not, in itself, provide a basis for attribution of the private company\u2019s acts to the State.291\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 176.\n\n*Article 4*\n-----------\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent firstly asserts that Emlak is not a \"state organ\" under Art 4. According to the Respondent, Emlak is, effectively, a private company formed under Turkish law.292 It is subject to the provisions of the Turkish Commercial Code, and to the same court jurisdiction as any private individual or company.293 As a real estate investment trust, it is regulated as other commercial entities by the Turkish Capital Markets Board.294 Emlak does not enjoy immunity against enforcement against its assets, contrary to public entities, which are protected by such immunity.295 Also, contrary to TOKI\u2019s employees, Emlak\u2019s employees are not civil servants.296\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 181.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n260.\n\nGiven that Article 127 of the Turkish Constitution provides that state entities can only be established by law, the Respondent also relies on the fact that Emlak has not been created by a specific Turkish law.297 The Respondent argues that although the expert opinion of Professor G\u00fcnday refers to a kind of \"quasi-state\" status, no such status exists for the purposes of Art 4 ILC Article.298 In any event, the Respondent asserts that Professor G\u00fcnday conceded during the Hearing that the only real link between TOKI and Emlak is established through TOKI\u2019s shareholding in Emlak.299\n\nTranscript, Day 8, Knoll (125: 16-19).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 182.\n\nTranscript, Day 8, Knoll (125: 23-25).\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that Emlak was only audited by the Supreme Audit Board on the basis of being an investment of TOKI, which is a state entity.300 Therefore, the Respondent argues that the fact that Emlak was so audited is not indicative of state character.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 183.\n\n262.\n\nFurther, the fact that TOKI held the majority stake in Emlak does not, in itself, render it a state entity. In particular, the Respondent rejects the position adopted in *Maffezini* or *Salini* to the effect that state ownership gives rise to the rebuttable presumption of statehood.301 Instead, the Respondent relies on the Commentary to the ILC Articles, which states in relevant part:\n\nSince corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.302\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 188-189.\n\nJames Crawford, \"The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries\", Cambridge University Press, (2002) p. 112 (Exhibit CLA-53); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 189.\n\n263.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent asserts that Emlak is not a \u2018state organ\u2019 within the meaning of Art 4 ILC Articles.\n\n*Article 5*\n-----------\n\n264.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that neither prong of the two-prong test under Art 5 is satisfied in the case of Emlak, as it is not empowered by Turkish law to exercise elements of governmental authority and, in any event, was not exercising any governmental authority in its execution, administration and termination of the Contract.\n\n265.\n\nThe fact that Emlak enjoys certain privileges does not, the Respondent contends, satisfy the first limb of Art 5. Further, the Respondent emphasises that \"the fact that Emlak might help to meet the constitutional objective in the Turkish Constitution does not make it a public entity and does not make its acts in any way governmental or sovereign or of *puissance publique,\"303* Hence, as to the first limb, the Respondent argues that the minor prerogative granted to Emlak by Art 26 of the Zoning Law with respect to zoning permits does not amount to any requisite *\"puissance publique\"* or governmental authority.304 Similarly, Emlak\u2019s ability to obtain land from TOKI\u2019s land banks is not tantamount to being empowered to exercise governmental authority.305\n\nTranscript, Day 8, Knoll (127: 15-19).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 193.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n266.\n\nWith respect to the second limb of the Art 5 test, the Respondent asserts that the relevant acts, the execution, administration and termination of the Contract, were performed with a commercial rather than State purpose. The Respondent relies on the decision in *Bosh International306* and argues that there is no basis to distinguish the facts of that decision from the present case.307 Here, the fact that the Supreme Audit Board recommended the termination of the Contract, which was not followed by Emlak, or that the Emlak Board making the decision to terminate comprised of majority TOKI representatives does not detract from the ultimate decision being commercial and not governmental in character.308\n\n*Bosh International, Inc. and B&P, LTD Foreign Investments Enterprise v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No ARB/08/11 (Award dated 25 October 2012) (Exhibit RLA-16).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 204-205.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 205.\n\n267.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent argues that neither of the requirements of Art 5 is satisfied with respect to any relevant acts committed by Emlak.\n\n*Article 8*\n-----------\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the requirements of Art 8 are not met because the State did not exercise control over Emlak with respect to its acts in performing and terminating the Contract.\n\n269.\n\nThe Respondent here relies on existing jurisprudence from the International Court of Justice and previous investment tribunals to contend that it is necessary to show that the Turkish State exercised effective control over Emlak and, in particular, over the acts that the Claimant seeks to have attributed to the State.309 The Respondent contends that the \"apparent control\" criterion referred to by the Claimant is not relevant to an assessment of attribution for the purposes of Art 8 (or at all).310\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 213-215.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 235.\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the acts of Emlak are not attributable to the State pursuant to Art 8 on the basis that they were not performed under the effective control of the State.\n\n271.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of the facts that TOKI exercised voting rights on behalf of over 99% of Emlak\u2019s shareholders during the relevant period or that TOKI allegedly had control of Emlak\u2019s Board on the basis that a number of Emlak Board members were chosen by TOKI or that there was some commonality of employment between Emlak and TOKI amount to effective control.311\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 217-224.\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Emlak has an independent board of directors and the fact that Mr Bayraktar was both the head of TOKI and Emlak does not detract from this:312 shared personnel does not equal effective control.313 The Respondent relies on the witness statement of Mr Yetim who states that Emlak personnel had a duty only to Emlak and not to TOKI and was obliged under Turkish law to act in Emlak\u2019s best commercial interests.314 The Respondent also asserts that TOKI had no power over the management of Emlak and had no role in determining which bidders prevailed on bids for Emlak projects, how contracts were managed, or decisions about terminating those contracts.315 Rather, those decisions were made by Emlak alone, on a purely commercial basis, independent of TOKI.316\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 219.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 220.\n\nYetim Witness Statement, para. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 222 and 237.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 229.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent contends that any \"recommendation\" by the Supreme Audit Board that the Contract be cancelled did not amount to a binding order and did not impact Emlak\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract.317 Neither did TOKI have control over Emlak on the basis of land ownership, since land owned by Emlak was not State property.318\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 234.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 225.\n\n274.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that even if the Tribunal finds that Emlak acted under the direction or control of TOKI, the question of attribution to the Respondent would turn on what Emlak perceived to be in its best interest with respect to the issues raised by the Claimant, and whether TOKI went beyond the legitimate exercise of the rights of a majority shareholder to manage the company\u2019s affairs in furtherance of those perceived interests.319 The question is whether the decision was commercially motivated and viable. In this regard, the Respondent argues that the termination was made *bona fide* and was a reasonable commercial decision in the circumstances.320 On that basis, the Respondent asserts that there can be no attribution to the State.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 227.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 234.\n\nActs of other State entities\n----------------------------\n\n275.\n\nTurkey notes the \"limited factual allegations made [by the Claimant] on the basis of direct misconduct on the part of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the police and the Price Ministry\", and accepts that these entities are part of the State machinery and, as such, their acts would be attributable to the State.321\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 286.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\nGeneral Approach to Attribution\n-------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe issue of attribution relates both to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and to the merits of this dispute. Attribution is relevant in the present context to ascertaining whether there is a dispute with a Contracting State, here Turkey, for the purposes of the BIT and Art 25 of the ICSID Convention. At the same time, the claims presented in this investment arbitration (particularly with respect to the conduct of Emlak) may only succeed if they are attributable to the State. In that sense, the issue of attribution is also relevant to the merits of the dispute. Finally, purely contractual conduct *per se* does not amount to (wrongful) action of the State.\n\n277.\n\nThe appropriate approach to the question of attribution in a similar context is usefully discussed by the tribunal in *Hamester v Ghana'.*\n\n143. The question of \"attribution\" does not, itself, dictate whether there has been a violation of international law. Rather, it is only a means to ascertain whether the State is involved. As such, the question of attribution looks more like a jurisdictional question. But in many instances, questions of attribution and questions of legality are closely intermingled, and it is then difficult to deal with the question of attribution without a full enquiry into the merits\n\n144. In any event, whatever the qualification of the question of attribution, the Tribunal notes that, as a practical matter, this question is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship between certain acts and the State.\n\n145. This approach - to deal with the question of attribution as a merits question - is particularly appropriate, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, in this case. The Tribunal is not faced here with a situation where it is readily evident that the State is not involved at all, or where the issue is capable of an answer based upon a limited enquiry (akin to other jurisdictional issues). On the contrary, the evidential record in this case is more complex. In fact, the Respondent itself recognises that some acts are attributable to the Ghanaian Government, while denying that they amount to international illegal behaviour. In other words, while the extent of the State\u2019s involvement is unclear, it is not contested that some acts are attributable to Ghana. In such a situation, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction over the case brought against Ghana and jurisdiction to decide which acts are attributable and which are not.322\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24 (Award dated 18 June 2010), paras. 143-145 (Exhibit RLA-14).\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *Hamester v Ghana* approach to the question of attribution.\n\n279.\n\nFirst, as in *Hamester v Ghana,* the Respondent accepts that insofar as the Claimant alleges wrongful conduct by actors such as the Supreme Audit Board or the Prime Ministry of Turkey, these are State actors. Accordingly, for the purposes of jurisdiction, the Tribunal is satisfied that the allegations by the Claimant involve actions of the State. For practical purposes, this means the Tribunal may decide which particular acts (including the acts of Emlak) constitute State actions.\n\n280.\n\nAs the Tribunal has not accepted bifurcation with respect to questions of jurisdiction (other than the question of compliance with the Art 8(2) notice requirement), and has joined those jurisdictional objections to the merits, it now has the benefit of the Parties\u2019 full pleadings. In those circumstances, and taking into account that the question of attribution is also relevant to the merits, the Tribunal may not limit its enquiry to a *prima facie* standard and must, instead, make an informed and dispositive ruling on the question of attribution.323\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nAttribution of Emlak\u2019s Acts to the State\n----------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties and accepts that the ILC Articles constitute a codification of customary international law with respect to the issue of attribution of conduct to the State and apply to the present dispute.\n\n*Article 4*\n-----------\n\n282.\n\nFor the purposes of Art 4, the Tribunal must determine whether any acts complained of by the Claimant with respect to the execution, administration and termination of the Ispartakule III project were carried out by a \"state organ\".\n\n283.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal had understood the Claimant\u2019s primary position to be that Emlak was the relevant alleged State organ. However, on the basis of its closing argument, the Claimant has moved its position to rely on TOKI as the relevant State organ that administered and terminated the Contract.\n\n284.\n\nAlthough it is common ground between the Parties that TOKI is a State organ, Emlak was the counterparty to the Contract and was the entity that officially took all the relevant acts with respect to the administration and termination of the Contract. Accordingly, although, as noted, it remains somewhat unclear whether the Claimant maintains the argument that Emlak is a \"state organ\", the relevant assessment for the purposes of attribution under Art 4 must be whether Emlak is a State organ. To the extent that the Claimant asserts that the acts in question were effectively taken by TOKI because it exercised full control over Emlak, the proper analysis of that argument is under Art 8.\n\n285.\n\nArt 4(2) ILC Articles establishes that an \"organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State\". Therefore, the Tribunal must first assess whether Emlak is an organ of the State under the domestic law of Turkey.\n\n286.\n\nFirst, while not conclusive, it is notable that Tulip I has itself stated in previous correspondence to Emlak that \"your company is not an administration within the scope of administrative law but a commercial company conducting business within the scope of private law\" and that \"As mentioned in article 1 of its Articles of Incorporation [...] your company is a joint stock company subject to the Turkish Commercial Code\".324\n\nLetter from Tulip I to Emlak dated 21 June 2010 (Exhibit CE-201).\n\n287.\n\nIn fact, Emlak\u2019s Articles of Association325 establish that Emlak is an open joint stock company, pursuing commercial activities under the Commercial Code and Capital Markets legislation.326 The Articles of Association also require Emlak\u2019s Board members to be independent and meet the requirement of the Turkish Commercial Code.327 This structure indicates that Emlak is a private entity.\n\nEmlak Articles of Association (Exhibit IK-1).\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 5.\n\n*Ibid.,* Arts 12-13.\n\n288.\n\nFurther, Professors G\u00fcnday and Atay agree that Emlak is classified under Turkish law as a company subject to private law.328 Although Professor G\u00fcnday notes that it \"falls short of being a commercial company\",329 the Tribunal accepts Turkey\u2019s submission that there is no \"quasi-state\" organ for the purposes of Art 4. Given that Emlak is a separate, private, entity under Turkish law, it cannot be said that Turkish municipal law treats it as a State organ. The fact that certain State entities, such as the Ministry for Public Works, referred to it as a \"public institution\" does not displace the plain legal position under Turkish law. In fact, the Turkish Supreme Court of Appeal has relevantly stated:\n\nPublic Economic Enterprises, since they set up and operate commercial undertakings, are merchants. The fact that their capital belongs to the state and there is a particular way in which appointments are made to certain of their managerial organs does not imbue these entities with public law establishment capacity and these bodies are civil law judicial persons and the provisions of private law apply to them.330\n\nJoint Legal Expert Report, para. 7.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 8.\n\nNo. 2004/13-66K, No. 2004/719, Republic of Turkey Supreme Court of Appeal, General Committee Basis (unpaginated, last page) (Exhibit RE-6).\n\n289.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not accept the Claimant\u2019s contention that, as a matter of international law, majority ownership of an entity by the State gives rise to a presumption of statehood in respect of that entity. While the decisions in *Mazzefini* and *Salini* may have held otherwise, the Tribunal is not bound by those decisions. Rather, the Tribunal is compelled to decide the issues before it in accordance with the BIT and applicable principles of international law. The conclusion of the Tribunal is that there is no basis under international law to conclude that ownership of a corporate entity by the State triggers the presumption of statehood. The position of the Tribunal is that, whilst state ownership may, in certain circumstances, be a factor relevant to the question of attribution, it does not convert a separate corporate entity into an \u2018organ\u2019 of the State. The Tribunal agrees with the holding in *EDF (Services) Limited v Romania* that state-owned corporations \"possessing legal personality under [municipal] law separate and distinct from that of the State, may [not] be considered as a State organ\".331\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13 (Award dated 8 October 2009), para. 190 (Exhibit CLA-12).\n\n290.\n\nIn view of the evidence before it, the Tribunal\u2019s determination is that Emlak is:\n\n(1) an entity separate from the State;\n\n(2) not part of the governmental structure;\n\n(3) subject to the Commercial Code, the Capital Markets Law and other private law instruments; and\n\n(4) separate from rather than an emanation of the State.\n\n291.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal determines that Emlak is not a \"state organ\" within the meaning of Art 4 ILC Articles.\n\n*Article 5*\n-----------\n\n292.\n\nAs regards attribution under Art 5, referring to the exercise of governmental authority, the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that in order for Emlak\u2019s conduct to be attributable to Turkey, it must be established both that:\n\n(1) Emlak is empowered by the law of Turkey to exercise elements of governmental authority; and\n\n(2) The conduct by Emlak that the Claimant complains of relates to the exercise of that governmental authority.\n\n293.\n\nAs to (1), the evidence on the record does not establish that Emlak is empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority. The Claimant refers to Art 26 of the Zoning Law as granting governmental privileges to Emlak. However, as is plain on the face of Art 26, it refers to the granting of permits to public agencies and institutions in accordance with preliminary designs. It grants certain preferential treatment with respect to construction permits, but does nothing to empower Emlak actually to exercise any kind of governmental authority with respect to any other entity or subject matter.\n\n294.\n\nThe position is similar with respect to the fact that Emlak is entitled to buy land from TOKI\u2019s land banks on a preferential basis. This merely establishes that Emlak enjoys certain privileges granted to organisations affiliated with TOKI. It does not show that Emlak itself exercises elements of governmental authority vis-\u00e0-vis any particular object or person.\n\n295.\n\nEqually, decisions made by Emlak within the framework of the Contract, such as whether or not to grant certain extensions of time for the completion of Ispartakule III (governed by Art 33 of the Contract) did not require the exercise of any public authority.\n\n296.\n\nSince Emlak did not exercise any governmental authority *per se,* it cannot be the case that it exercised specific governmental authority with respect to the acts that the Claimant asserted constituted violations of the BIT.\n\n297.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the requirement of the first limb of Art 5 is not satisfied.\n\n298.\n\nIn light of this conclusion as to the first limb of Art 5, the Tribunal need not make a dispositive finding with respect to the second limb. Nevertheless, the Tribunal turns to consider this issue in light of the Parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n299.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant did not explain precisely how the relevant elements of governmental authority were exercised in Emlak\u2019s administration of the Contract for the purposes of attribution of those acts to the State under Art 5 ILC Articles. That is, the Claimant did not explain how Emlak exercised *puissance publique* in carrying out any of the acts relating to its pre-contractual dealings with Tulip JV, its administration and termination of the Contract or any other acts it may have performed with respect to Ispartakule III and the Tulip JV or any of its members. The Tribunal finds that none of the acts constituted the exercise of governmental authority. There is no evidence on the record to conclude that Emlak\u2019s pre-contractual dealings with Tulip JV, its decisions on requests for extension of time and, particularly, its decision to terminate the Contract, expose *per se* any exercise of *puissance publique.*\n\n300.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence on the record does not show that Emlak exercises any governmental power within the meaning of Art 5 ILC Articles.\n\n*Article 8*\n-----------\n\n301.\n\nParagraphs 302 - 327 below set out the reasoning of the majority of the Tribunal for the determination that the acts of Emlak are not attributable to the State under Art 8 ILC Articles. The attached opinion of Mr Jaffe, assenting in the result, states Mr Jaffe\u2019s reasons for dissenting on the issue of Art 8 attribution.\n\n302.\n\nFor the purposes of Art 8 ILC Articles, the question before the Tribunal is whether Emlak acted \"on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of [the State] in carrying out the conduct\" which forms the subject of the Claimant\u2019s complaints under the BIT.\n\n303.\n\nPlainly, the words \"instructions\", \"direction\" and \"control\" in Art 8 are to be read disjunctively. Therefore, the Tribunal need only be satisfied that one of those elements is present in order for there to be attribution under Art 8. The Claimant\u2019s main contention appears to be that Emlak acted under the control of TOKI in administering and terminating the Contract. However, at certain points in its pleadings, the Claimant also refers to influence or instructions. The Tribunal has, therefore, considered whether any of the categories of \"instructions\", \"direction\" or \"control\" are met for the purposes of Art 8.\n\n304.\n\nWith respect to the question of \"control\", the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s submission that the relevant test for determining whether Emlak acted under the control of TOKI is \"effective control\".\n\n305.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether TOKI exercised effective control over Emlak and thereby enforced public policy in the administration and termination of the Contract or whether any aspect of the administration and termination of the Contract was performed under the instructions or direction of TOKI in an exercise of sovereign power.\n\n306.\n\nThe Commentary to the ILC Articles confirms that it is insufficient for the purposes of attribution under Art 8 to establish merely that Emlak was majority-owned by TOKI, *i.e.,* a part of the State:\n\nQuestions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enterprises which are State-owned and controlled. If such corporations act inconsistently with the international obligations of the State concerned the question arises whether such conduct is attributable to the State. In discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international law acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities at the national level, except in those cases where the \"corporate veil\" is a mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion. The fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity, whether by a special law or otherwise, is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity. Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5. This was the position taken, for example, in relation to the de facto seizure of property by a State-owned oil company, in a case where there was no proof that the State used its ownership interest as a vehicle for directing the company to seize the property. On the other hand, where there was evidence that the corporation was exercising public powers, or that the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct in question has been attributed to the State.332\n\nJames Crawford, \"The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries\", Cambridge University Press, (2002) pp. 112-113 (Exhibit CLA-53).\n\n307.\n\nHere, the evidence shows that TOKI at all relevant times controlled the majority of Emlak\u2019s voting shares. The evidence also establishes that the majority of Emlak\u2019s Board was made up of TOKI employees and that Mr Bayraktar served as the head of both TOKI and Emlak. In fact, Emlak\u2019s Articles of Association specifically state, at Art 8.9, that TOKI is \"the leader capitalist\" and its shares \"constitute dominancy in management\".333 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that, from an ordinary company law perspective, Emlak was subject to the control of TOKI and, therefore, the Turkish State.\n\nEmlak Articles of Association (Exhibit IK-1).\n\n308.\n\nAs a result of this control over the voting shares and through its representation on the Board, TOKI was certainly capable of also exerting sovereign control over Emlak. Indeed, the Tribunal accepts the expert view of Professor Gunday that TOKI may have at times used Emlak in order to fulfil a specific public purpose, namely to promote the development of and access to housing across Turkey.334 In that sense, TOKI was capable of exercising a degree of control over Emlak to implement elements of a particular state purpose. To the extent that TOKI exercised such governmental control in particular instances in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct of Emlak would have been attributable to the State.\n\nLegal Opinion of Metin Gtinday, para. 45.\n\n309.\n\nHowever, the relevant enquiry remains whether Emlak was being directed, instructed or controlled by TOKI with respect to the specific activity of administering the Contract with Tulip JV in the sense of sovereign direction, instruction or control rather than the ordinary control exercised by a majority shareholder acting in the company\u2019s perceived commercial best interests.\n\n310.\n\nThere is some limited evidence supporting the Claimant\u2019s contention that the decision to terminate the Ispartakule III contract was connected to TOKI and the exercise of its public power. In particular, the *Milliyet* newspaper article referred to by the Claimant quoted Mr Bayraktar, speaking in his capacity as the head of TOKI, stating with respect to the termination of the Contract:\n\nTheir sales have increased but there are problems among the partners. They refuse to give their consent. We cannot help any more. **We have to protect the public interest** **.335** (emphasis added)\n\nBayraktar: Tulip Isi Aksatti, Tebemus Kirecci, MILLIYET (Exhibit CE-228).\n\n311.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that the weight of the evidence is strongly to the contrary, to establish that the decision to terminate the Contract with Tulip JV was made by the Board of Emlak independently, in the pursuit of Emlak\u2019s commercial interests and not as a result of the exercise of sovereign power by TOKI. An analysis of the content and nature of key decisions taken by Emlak\u2019s Board with respect to the Contract, including minutes and agenda papers, does not lead to the conclusion that Emlak acted under the governmental control, direction or instructions of TOKI with a view to achieving a certain State purpose. Rather, the evidence confirms that Emlak acted in each relevant instance to pursue what it perceived to be its best commercial interest within the framework of the Contract.\n\n312.\n\nFor example, it is evident that Emlak made the initial decision to award the Contract to Tulip JV on the basis of commercial considerations relating to what would be the most \"advantageous\" bid.336 The relevant minute of the decision of the Board does not indicate that Emlak made that decision to achieve any particular State purpose for TOKI, or that it chose to award the Contract to Tulip JV on the basis of any particular non-commercial consideration.\n\nResolution of the Board of Directors of Emlak dated 27 June 2006 (Exhibit CE-60).\n\n313.\n\nSimilarly, Emlak\u2019s decision to grant a 471-day extension of time to Tulip JV demonstrates that Emlak acted as a party to a Contract and referenced Article 33 of the Contract in determining to grant the extension of time.337 There is no basis for the Tribunal to infer that the decision was taken under the control, influence or instruction of TOKI on the basis of any non-commercial considerations.\n\nDecision of the Administrative Board of Emlak dated October 30, 2008 (Exhibit CE-190).\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal has also assessed the evidence surrounding Tulip JV\u2019s request for an extension of time in late 2009,338 the recommendation from the Construction Control Department to grant such extension339 and the decision of Emlak\u2019s Board not to grant it.340 Again, there is no basis for the Tribunal to conclude that the decision, which was successively considered by the Control Department, Mr Kurum and the Board, was in fact made pursuant to any sovereign control. To the contrary, the plain documentary evidence illustrates that the decision-making process was carried out within Emlak in its capacity as a party to a commercial venture.\n\nLetter from Tulip JV to Emlak dated 4 December 2009 (Exhibit CE-124).\n\nConstruction Control Department Report dated 4 February 2010 (Exhibit CE-232).\n\nLetter from Emlak to Tulip JV dated 1 March 2010 (Exhibit CE-193).\n\n315.\n\nThe central act that the Claimant asserts constitutes a breach of the BIT, and the act with respect to which the Claimant seeks compensation, is the termination of the Contract on 18 May 2010.\n\n316.\n\nIn assessing whether this act of termination is attributable to the State, the starting point is the documented decision of the Board of Emlak,341 which shows that in terminating the Contract, the Board took legal advice, relied on substantial delays in performance and noted the purportedly impermissible assignment of receivables by Tulip JV to a third party. On that basis, the Board determined:\n\nDue to the above-mentioned reason, and also due to the fact that the period will be terminated on 19/05/2010 and that the progress of the work is at the level of 10.17%, it was deemed appropriate to annul the agreement of the \"Income Sharing Work for Bahcesehir Ispartakule 3rd Region in return of Land\" under the 30th and 31st articles of the agreement.342\n\nEmlak Board Decision dated 18 May 2010 (Exhibit RE-73).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n317.\n\nThe minute of the Board\u2019s decision establishes that Emlak acted in its capacity as a commercial party to terminate the Contract on the basis of its perceived contractual rights and contractual non-performance by Tulip JV.\n\n318.\n\nIt is not established by the evidentiary record that Emlak invoked alleged contractual breaches as a pretext, in fact acting under the control of TOKI to promote or achieve an ulterior purpose of interest to the State.\n\n319.\n\nAgain, to the contrary, the evidence of Mr Kurum (which is accepted by the Tribunal) establishes that there were compelling commercial reasons for the termination, primarily the very substantial delay in construction.343 Emlak\u2019s ongoing concern regarding the delay in construction, arising in the context of its contractual relationship with Tulip JV, is well-documented.344\n\n*E.g.,* Transcript, Day 4, Kurum (75: 9-25).\n\nSee, *e.g.,* correspondence from Emlak to Tulip JV referred to in the \"facts\" section above.\n\n320.\n\nFurther, there is compelling evidence, as confirmed by both Parties\u2019 delay experts, that the Ispartakule III project suffered from insufficient funds which exposed the entire project to the significant delays complained of by Emlak.345 Other than providing a small (and uncertain) amount of initial \"seed money\" through the First Loan Facility and Second Loan Facility, it is common ground that the Van Herk Group did not otherwise fund the project and no other external funds were provided by Mr Benitah, any of the Turkish shareholders in Tulip I, or the joint venture partners. Indeed, the Second Loan Facility expressly provided that no additional funds would be extended by the Van Herk Group for construction of Ispartakule III. As a consequence, Tulip JV was required to rely primarily on pre-sales of units to fund the project, in circumstances where the sales were below optimal on any view and the project needed a substantial injection of capital to increase construction and meet the May 2010 completion date. Undoubtedly, the absence of the required level of capital which the Claimant was obliged to provide under Art 11.17 of the Contract, being the result of a flawed business plan, was the substantial cause of the disabling delays to construction and the non-completion of the project within previously agreed timeframes.\n\nJoint Statement of Experts on Delay, para. 3.2.\n\n321.\n\nThis evidence that the project was severely limited by a lack of funding and that the Claimant had not lived up to its contractual obligations, together with evidence that there were ongoing problems among the joint venture partners to the point of complete breakdown in relationships (the seriousness of which is illustrated by the fact that the conflict with FMS resulted in a member of Tulip I being shot) confirms that there were legitimate commercial reasons for Emlak to determine that it would invoke its perceived contractual rights to terminate the Contract. Accordingly, the evidence militates against the conclusion that the termination of the Contract was pre-textual and that it amounted to any kind of improper usurpation of the Claimant\u2019s rights by the \"invisible\" hand of the State.\n\n322.\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence of any specific and disproportionate influence by Mr Bayraktar or any instructions from TOKI to make a particular decision for an ulterior sovereign purpose. To the contrary, the evidence of Mr Kurum confirms that the termination decision was made pursuant to the ordinary procedures of the Emlak Board and was done in the exercise of perceived rights as a party to the Contract, and only after a succession of indulgences given to the Claimant after its failure to meet contractual milestones.346 The evidence (particularly the Board minutes) confirms that the decision to terminate the Contract was considered carefully and dispassionately by members of the Emlak Board and that they acted professionally and independently as required by Art 12.3 of Emlak\u2019s Articles of Association.\n\n*E.g.,* Transcript, Day 4, Kurum (118:13-21).\n\n323.\n\nThere is also no evidence that the decision to terminate the Contract was made under the direction, instructions or control of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Audit Board (an entity that the Parties accept is an organ of the State).\n\n324.\n\nRather, the Tribunal concludes that Emlak was acting in what it perceived to be its commercial best interest in terminating the Contract.\n\n325.\n\nAs a consequence of these findings, the Tribunal also finds that Emlak\u2019s conduct in seizing the project site for Ispartakule III or its decision to re-tender the project rather than sell the project land to Tulip I amount to independent action taken in reliance on contractual rights and in furtherance of Emlak\u2019s perceived commercial best interests. The Tribunal finds no basis to depart from that characterisation with respect to any other actions taken by Emlak following the termination of the Contract.\n\n326.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that while Emlak was subject to TOKI\u2019s corporate and managerial control, Emlak\u2019s conduct with respect to the execution, maintenance and termination of the Contract is not attributable to the State under Art 8 of the ILC Articles due to an absence of proof that the State used its control as a vehicle directed towards achieving a particular result in its sovereign interests.\n\n327.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal therefore determines by majority that Emlak\u2019s conduct with respect to the Contract and the Ispartakule III Project is not attributable to the Turkish State and is, on that basis, outside the remit of the Tribunal.\n\nAttribution of Acts of other State Entities\n-------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nOn the other hand, insofar as the Claimant alleges that certain independent acts of other state entities breached the BIT (such a such as TOKI and its alleged misuse of zoning powers or the Turkish police and its alleged actions with respect to the Ispartakule III site), the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that these allegations plainly involve action by State organs which would be attributable to the State.\n\n**VII. TREATY VERSUS CONTRACT CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that its claims are based on violations of the substantive protections of the BIT and are not merely claims arising out of the Contract.\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimant agrees with the Respondent that the relevant inquiry for the Tribunal for the purposes of determining whether the Claimant has asserted treaty claims or other kinds of claims (in this case Contract claims) is whether the BIT constitutes the \"essential basis\" of the claims.347 The Claimant also accepts that the exercise of *puissance publique* is central to assessing whether or not the claims it asserts are to be characterised as BIT rather than contract claims.348\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 308.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 309.\n\n331.\n\nIn characterising the nature of its claims, the Claimant asserts that their \"essential basis\" is the BIT. While the Claimant acknowledges that labelling the claims as arising from the BIT is insufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Claimant also emphasises that claims \"must be taken as they are\" and the Tribunal must determine if they \"fit into the jurisdictional parameters set out by the relevant treaty.\"349\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n332.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant further asserts that it has gone beyond labelling the claims as resulting from treaty violations, and has in fact provided compelling analysis illustrating that what underlies its claims is \"the interlinking state apparatus of Emlak, TOKI and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, ***and it is the use of state power and motivations as to public purpose, not contract terms,*** which is the \u2018essence\u2019 of Claimant\u2019s claims.\"350 (original emphasis) With respect to the actions of Emlak, the Claimant argues that they are not merely breaches of contract because they involve also \"interference by TOKI and the Prime Minister\u2019s Supreme Audit Board, representatives of the Turkish State.\"351 Further, although the Claimant accepts that part of its case \"is that Emlak arbitrarily denied an extension to the Contract, and improperly insisted upon the continuance of FMS as a joint venture partner in Tulip JV\", the Claimant argues that these allegations are not made \"as points of contractual breach.\"352 Rather, the Claimant contends that these actions by Emlak \"were parts of a decision-making process which was controlled by other state organs to subvert Claimant\u2019s investment.\"353\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 307.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 309.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n333.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent *(i.e.,* the Turkish State) engaged in a \"pattern of conduct\", acting through TOKI and the Supreme Audit Board to \"induce\" the cancellation of the Contract by Emlak and unlawfully to seize the work site without court authorization and with the aid of the Turkish police.354 In that sense, Claimant asserts that the Turkish State used its \"imperium\" to control or induce Emlak\u2019s behaviour and it is the use of this imperium that amounts to the essence of BIT claims.355 According to the Claimant, this conduct constitutes a patent abridgement of Claimant\u2019s rights under the BIT, regardless of any breach of the Contract which may also have occurred.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 313.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 314.\n\n334.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on claims arising from the alleged acts of various state actors, such as TOKI, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the police, and the Supreme Audit Board, which it says are *prima facie* susceptible to BIT claims.356 The Claimant argues that the existence of *puissance publique* cannot be disputed for the purposes of these allegations and represents a significant contribution to the fullness of Claimant\u2019s claims.357 The Claimant argues that the Respondent has accepted these latter claims to be susceptible to determination under the BIT.358\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 320.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that its claims are not admissible on the basis that they remain premature while the contractual litigation between Emlak and Tulip JV is pending before the Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance in Istanbul.359\n\n*lb id.,* para. 323.\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Art 36 of the Contract, giving jurisdiction for resolution of contractual disputes between Tulip JV and Emlak to the courts of Istanbul, has no bearing on the admissibility or jurisdiction of the Claimant\u2019s claims against Turkey under the BIT. The key contention made by the Claimant is that treaty and contract jurisdiction is normatively different and a treaty cause of action is not barred by a contractual dispute resolution and governing law clause, and that the parties in both disputes are different.360\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 326 and 335.\n\n337.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant contends that it is not compelled to withdraw its BIT claims owing to a contract dispute resolution clause in a contract to which it is not a signatory but which forms part of the factual basis for its investment and treaty claims. According to the Claimant, the doctrine of *lis pendens* determines the admissibility of concurrent actions, and requires a triple identity of parties, object and cause of action.361 The case brought by Tulip JV against Emlak in Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance has no identity of parties between itself and the present arbitration. Moreover, the subsidiary rule of *ne bis in idem* regarding identity of causes of action, as noted by the tribunal in *SGS v. Pakistan,* provides that \"if the claims are not *idem, bis* does not arise\".362 The Claimant argues that the object of Tulip JV\u2019s claims and Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration also differ, and this should be construed to allow jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims.363\n\n*lb id.,* para. 335.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13 (Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 6 August 2003), para. 182 (Exhibit CLA-91); Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 337.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 345.\n\n338.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant asserts that it has presented BIT claims within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and neither the action in the Kadikoy 5th Commercial Court of First Instance nor Art 36 of the Contract bar jurisdiction over or admissibility of those claims.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to treaty-based claims and not to claims arising under a contract. According to the Respondent, putting aside the \"special case\" of umbrella clauses, in the absence of a specific BIT provision, parties to the BIT should not be presumed to have submitted themselves to international jurisdiction for purely contractual disputes.364\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 424.\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal may only determine claims which have the substantive provisions of the BIT as their \"normative source\" or \"essential basis\" and that the Arbitral Tribunal must fully review the question whether the claims asserted arise out of the BIT.365\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 261.\n\n341.\n\nIn assessing this question, the Tribunal must, according to the Respondent, analyse whether the Claimant\u2019s claims have an \"autonomous existence outside the contract\".366 That is, the Tribunal must assess whether the acts in question went beyond acts that could be carried out by an ordinary contractual party and crossed over to the realm of sovereign conduct. As an example, the Respondent draws a distinction between ordinary contractual behaviour and the acts of the Argentine Republic in *Abaclat,* where the State used its *puissance publique* to enact emergency legislation which rendered it immune from making repayments under its bond commitments.367\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para.432.\n\n*Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5 (Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 4 August 2011) (Exhibit CLA-1); Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 450.\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the \"essential basis\" or \"normative source\" of the claims here asserted by the Claimant do not extend beyond the realm of the Contract between Emlak and Tulip JV, including pre-contractual and contractual actions taken by Emlak in the administration and termination of that Contract. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has effectively \"re-packaged\" and \"labelled\" an assortment of contractual claims in order to present them as purported treaty claims in this arbitration.368\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 420.\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, in fact, the acts of Emlak did not go beyond those of an ordinary contract party. According to the Respondent, even if Emlak were an emanation of the State, it did not use any *puissance publique* in relation to its treatment of zoning matters, its responses to Tulip JV\u2019s requests for extension of time to deliver the Ispartakule III project, or its decision to terminate the Contract and seize the project site.369 The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to provide any valid evidence for an alleged conspiracy implicating sovereign action or an alleged \"pattern of conduct\" involving State actors.370 On that basis, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has merely \"labelled\" its claims as treaty claims whereas, on a proper analysis, their essential basis is contractual.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 263.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 257.\n\n344.\n\nAlthough this point does not appear to be pursued by the Claimant, the Respondent notes, in any event, that the umbrella clause in Art 3(2) of the BIT cannot be used to elevate Tulip JV\u2019s contractual claims against Emlak to international law claims by the Claimant against the Republic of Turkey on the basis that the Contract involves Emlak, a party distinct from the State.371\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 424.\n\n345.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that even if, as the Claimant alleges, the acts of TOKI, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the police, and the Supreme Audit Board \"represent[ed] a significant contribution to the fullness of Claimant\u2019s claim\", which is denied, this would not make them the \"essential basis\" of the Claimant\u2019s claims. According to the Respondent, their \"essential basis\" remains contractual.372\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 258.\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent also draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Art 36 of the Contract, which it describes as the \"exclusive jurisdiction\" clause for the purposes of resolving disputes arising from the Contract.373 The Respondent\u2019s position is that this provision represents the contractual choice of forum for disputes with respect to the Contract and the Claimant must abide by this contractual bargain.374 According to the Respondent, neither *lis pendens* not *res judicata* principles apply in circumstances where the relevant claim is properly characterised as a contractual claim for damages.375 The Respondent contends that, in those circumstances, the Tribunal is in effect being improperly petitioned by the Claimant, indirectly to enforce alleged contractual rights of Tulip JV.376\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 459.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 468.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 472.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 282.\n\n347.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that even if the Tribunal were to conclude that certain of the claims presented by the Claimant are \"genuine\" BIT claims, they depend upon a determination of the rights and obligations under the Contract, a matter to be resolved by the Turkish courts in reliance on the \"exclusive\" jurisdiction conferred on them by Art 36 of the Contract.377 On that basis, the Respondent contends that any purportedly genuine treaty claims are presently inadmissible before the Tribunal pending the resolution of the local Turkish litigation concerning the Contract.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 279.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the BIT, properly construed, does not extend to cover purely contractual disputes. This is apparent from the definition of the term \"investment dispute\" in Art 8(1) of the BIT:\n\n1) For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving:\n\n(a) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by a Contracting Party's foreign investment authority to an investor of the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(b) a breach of **any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment** **,** (emphasis added)\n\n349.\n\nArt 8(3) confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal only with respect to \"investment disputes\", stating:\n\n(a) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to the [ICSID] for settlement by arbitration.\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Art 3(2) of the BIT may be characterised as an obligation contained in an \u2018umbrella clause\u2019, which provides that:\n\n[... ] Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n351.\n\nWhile Art 3(2) of the BIT may arguably be relied on in certain circumstances to \"elevate\" a contractual obligation \"entered into\" by the State \"with regard to investments\", the Claimant does not here rely on Art 3(2) to argue that the Contract with Emlak is so converted into an international obligation. The Claimant\u2019s only contention with respect to the \"umbrella clause\" aspect of Art 3(2) of the BIT concerns Turkey\u2019s alleged obligations under the Foreign Direct Investment Law. Indeed, the Claimant confirms in its submissions:\n\nTo clarify its position: Claimant is *not* seeking to argue that breaches of any contract it entered into relating to its investments in Turkey should be elevated to the level of breaches of the BIT; the archetypical example of a so-called \"umbrella clause\" claim. Rather, Claimant has demonstrated that Respondent\u2019s obligation under Article 3(2) of the BIT, to \" *observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments[,]\"* extends to the Foreign Direct Investment Law (the \"FDIL\").378\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 677.\n\n352.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal need not address whether certain obligations under the Contract may be construed as treaty obligations by virtue of the \"umbrella clause\" in the BIT.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore consider whether, apart from the umbrella clause (other than in the context of the Foreign Direct Investment Law), the Claimant has asserted BIT claims within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the determination of whether a claim arises under a BIT involves an inquiry into the \"essential basis\" or \"normative source\" of that particular claim. In order to amount to a treaty claim, the conduct said to amount to a BIT violation must be capable of characterisation as sovereign conduct, involving the invocation of *puissance publique.* This principle has been affirmed by numerous previous investment tribunals. For example, in *Impregilo v Pakistan,* the tribunal stated:\n\nIn fact, the State or its emanation, may have behaved as an ordinary contracting party having a difference of approach, in fact or in law, with the investor. In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority *('puissance publique\u2019),* and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.379\n\n*Impregilo S.pA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/03 (Decision on Jurisdiction dated 22 April 2005), para. 260 (Exhibit CLA-84).\n\n355.\n\nSimilarly, the Annulment Committee in the *Vivendi* case observed that \"[a] Treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action; it requires a clear showing of conduct which is in the circumstances contrary to the relevant treaty standards.\"380\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal* (formerly *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux)* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (Decision on Annulment dated 3 July 2002), para. 113 (Exhibit CLA-82).\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s views are in accord with the statement in *Bayindir* that:\n\nbecause a treaty breach is different from a contract violation, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant must establish a breach different in nature from a simple contract violation, in other words one which the State commits in the exercise of its sovereign power.381\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A.\u015e v Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award dated 27 August 2009, para. 180 (Exhibit RLA-78).\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore assess whether the impugned conduct involves the exercise of sovereign power distinct from action attributable to an ordinary contractual counter-party.\n\n358.\n\nThis issue is inexorably intertwined with the question of attribution. Indeed, it is difficult in this case clearly to separate the issue of attribution from the question of whether the claims presented by the Claimant arise from the BIT. In this regard, in concluding that the conduct of Emlak is not attributable to the State under Art 5 of the ILC Articles, the Tribunal has already determined that none of the conduct in question amounted to the exercise of governmental (i.e., sovereign) power. Similarly, in holding that the actions of Emlak vis-\u00e0-vis Tulip JV and the Ispartakule III project are not attributable to the State under Art 8 ILC Articles, the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that such conduct was not carried out under the instructions, direction or control of the State in pursuit of a sovereign purpose. In sum, the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that there is no cogent evidence of sovereign interference - *i.e.,* sovereign instructions, direction or control - in Emlak\u2019s contractual relations with Tulip JV.\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding that Emlak\u2019s conduct is properly characterised as contractual in nature, in the context of attribution, informs its determination that the claims asserted by the Claimant with respect to Emlak\u2019s conduct may not properly be characterised as treaty claims.\n\n360.\n\nThis would remain the position even if the Tribunal were to assume, *arguendo,* that Emlak is an emanation of the State. The question for the Tribunal would nevertheless remain whether Emlak has gone beyond acting as an ordinary contractual party to utilise State power to interfere with the contractual arrangement (as was the case in *Abaclat,* where the State plainly went beyond acting as an ordinary contractual party in enacting legislation to shield itself from its bond obligations).\n\n361.\n\nTo the contrary, there is no persuasive evidence before the Tribunal that Emlak went beyond acting as an ordinary contractual party in pursuit of its commercial best interests. For example, the Claimant\u2019s claims regarding Emlak\u2019s failure to grant reasonable extensions of time is, essentially, a claim arising out of the contractual relationship between Emlak and Tulip JV and Emlak\u2019s exercise of rights in reference to the Contract. Similarly, the termination of the Contract was, as discussed above, an exercise of perceived contractual rights consistent with promoting Emlak\u2019s commercial best interests. Indeed, none of the claims presented by the Claimant with respect to the conduct of Emlak are amenable to be characterised by the Tribunal as arising out of the BIT. Accordingly, they fall outside the scope of the Tribunal \u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent has placed emphasis on the \"exclusive\" jurisdiction clause in favour of Turkish courts contained in Art 36 of the Contract. Here, Art 36 does not expressly state that the jurisdiction of the Turkish courts shall be to the exclusion of any other forum. The proper meaning of Art 36 remains a matter of construction. However, in circumstances where the Tribunal has concluded that, even in the absence of a contractual choice of forum provision, the claims asserted by the Claimant with respect to Emlak and its administration and termination of the Contract do not arise out of the BIT, the Tribunal need not further consider the construction or application of Art 36.\n\n363.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant has asserted claims arising from the independent conduct of various government bodies and officials, such as TOKI with respect to its use of zoning powers, the conduct of the Prime Ministry, the Supreme Audit Board and the Turkish police, these are plainly assertions about the conduct of state entities in the performance of their state functions.\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the submission of the Respondent that, even if the Tribunal concludes that such claims are within its jurisdiction, their essential basis remains contractual and the Tribunal must therefore await the resolution of the contractual aspects of the dispute in the Turkish courts before proceeding with its determination of such claims on the merits. Indeed, the Respondent has not explained why it asserts that those claims are inadmissible pending the resolution of the contractual dispute in the Turkish courts.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s view is that a proper analysis of the claims with respect to State actors such as TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Prime Ministry and the police demonstrates that the allegations are not substantially connected to contractual issues between Emlak and Tulip JV. For example, the question of whether TOKI used its zoning powers in violation of the BIT is independent of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the Contract. The same may be observed with respect to the (unsuccessful) recommendation of the Supreme Audit Board to terminate the Contract, and whether in making such a recommendation the Board misused its governmental powers. Accordingly, the Tribunal need not await the resolution of the contractual dispute in Turkey before addressing these \"ancillary\" claims on their merits.\n\n**VIII. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S CLAIMS**\n-------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nSince the Tribunal has concluded by majority that the claims asserted by the Claimant with respect to the conduct of Emlak do not entail acts attributable to the State (and has also determined that such claims do not arise from the BIT), those claims must fail.\n\n367.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal will turn to consider whether the claims presented by the Claimant in respect of Emlak could amount to any violations of the BIT if the Tribunal were to assume that they could be characterised as treaty claims attributable to the Respondent.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal will also consider the Claimant\u2019s claims asserted by the Claimant with respect to State actors such as TOKI, the Prime Ministry, the Supreme Audit Board and the Turkish police which are, in any event, properly within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and admissible before it.\n\n369.\n\nIn deciding on the different claims put forward by the Claimant, the Tribunal has examined the evidence put before it and has concentrated on assessing the extent to which, if any, the evidence supports a finding of a violation of the BIT. It has found unanimously that no such violation occurred. To the extent that any question is not discussed, it is because the Tribunal considers that the resolution of the question would not affect its decision, even if the question were resolved in favour of the Claimant.\n\n**A. Fair and Equitable Treatment Claim**\n-----------------------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent, acting through TOKI, Emlak and various other entities, engaged in conduct that breached the \"fair and equitable treatment\" **(FET)** standard embodied in Art 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s principal complaints are that the Respondent\u2019s conduct:\n\n(1) breached the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations with respect to its investment; and\n\n(2) amounted to arbitrary and/or discriminatory treatment of the Claimant\u2019s investment.382\n\nClaimant\u2019s Skeleton, paras. 62 - 84.\n\n372.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Tribunal must assess its claims concerning breach of the FET standard, as well as its claims regarding other alleged violations of the BIT, by reference to the entire course of conduct allegedly engaged in by the Respondent.383 The Claimant argues that there is no need to establish that this alleged course of conduct was motivated by a common illegal intent.384 Rather, the Tribunal must assess whether the Respondent engaged in \"converging action\" towards the same ultimate result, namely the termination of the Contract.385\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 389.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 389.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 400.\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the proper inquiry for determining whether acts or omissions violate the FET standard is the impact of measures on the investment, not the intent in adopting those measures.386 There is, therefore, no requirement to establish that the State acted with bad faith.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 407.\n\n374.\n\nWith respect to the content of the FET obligation imposed on the State by Art 3(1) of the BIT, the Claimant asserts that the \"pro-active\" standard in *Tecmed* applies.387 That is, the State is required by Art 3(1) to provide stability and predictability for Claimant\u2019s investment and to protect the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations by creating a transparent and stable legal and business framework.388 The Claimant argues that this legal standard should apply given the plain language and purposes of the BIT in issue to promote foreign investment and recent awards in investment arbitration endorsing standards similar to that in *Tecmed389* On that basis, the Claimant argues that the less exacting standard endorsed by the tribunal in *Saluka* ought not apply (contrary to the position of the Respondent).390\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 413.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Tecnicas Medioambientales TecMed SA v.

Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL (Partial Award dated 17 March 2006) (Exhibit CLA-38); Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 413.\n\n375.\n\nIn asserting violations of its legitimate expectations, the Claimant relies on the expectations of the Van Herk Group and Mr Benitah from the time of their initial investment in 2006, and, in particular on representations that the Claimant says were made to them regarding the benefits of TOKI\u2019s control over Emlak\u2019s Board of Directors, the Contract and tender documents, as well as the Respondent\u2019s conduct during the performance of the Contract and the general principles of good faith as embodied in Turkish and international law.391\n\nClaimant\u2019s Skeleton, para. 61.\n\n376.\n\nIn particular, Claimant argues that the \"Dutch Investors\" had legitimate expectations that: (1) zoning was in place for the Ispartakule III project; and (2) if zoning issues arose, TOKI would act in accordance with its representations as well as its own commercial interests.392 The Claimant asserts that it can rely on those legitimate expectations on the basis that it succeeded as the relevant investor as a result of a corporate re-organisation.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 62.\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent violated these legitimate expectations on the basis that:\n\n(1) Prior to the Contract being concluded, TOKI and Emlak knew about the existence of the zoning litigation and failed to disclose that material fact to the Claimant; and\n\n(2) TOKI and Emlak failed to take the design of Ispartakule III into account in redrawing the zoning plan despite their own alleged commercial interests and representations.393\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 453-455.\n\n378.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Respondent failed to grant reasonable extensions to Tulip JV in connection with the zoning dispute.394 According to the Claimant, both Emlak\u2019s Construction Control Department and the Supreme Audit Board recognised that the 471-day extension granted to Tulip JV to complete the Ispartakule III construction was insufficient because the delay period from 17 August 2006 until 27 June 2008 was \"due to no fault of the contractor\".395 Contrary to the suggestion otherwise by the Respondent, even if the Claimant had commenced construction before the Danistay order, such progress would have been futile in light of the new zoning.396\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 458.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 459.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 462; Legal Opinion of Metin Giinday, para. 26.\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent cannot claim to have \"cured\" its breach of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations by granting an allegedly insufficient extension, because Emlak later used delay as a pretext to terminate the Contract.397\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 460.\n\n380.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations in its handling of the zoning litigation.\n\n381.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the Respondent violated the requirements of Art 3(1) not to act arbitrarily, in a discriminatory manner or in the absence of proportionality.\n\n382.\n\nFor the purposes of defining arbitrariness, the Claimant relies on the standard endorsed by the tribunal in *EDF v Romania,* which described an \"arbitrary\" measure as being:\n\n(a) a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; (b) a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference; (c) a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker; (d) a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.398\n\n*EDF (Services) Ltd v.

V. v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL (Partial Award dated 17 March 2006), para. 303 (Exhibit CLA-38). Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 471.\n\n384.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s complaints with respect of Art 3(1) include the following:\n\n(1) TOKI discriminated against the Claimant\u2019s investment and/or made an arbitrary decision when it failed to take into account the design of Ispartakule III despite being requested to do so and despite taking into account other \"similarly situated\" neighbouring construction projects, *i.e.,* Ispartakule I and Ispartakule II.400\n\n(2) The Respondent engaged in arbitrary conduct with respect to FMS by: (a) refusing to approve the removal of FMS from the partnership despite its criminal acts and its default of partnership obligations; and (b) subsequently requiring FMS\u2019 signature for Tulip JV to take any action.401\n\n(3) The Respondent arbitrarily interfered in Tulip JV on the basis that Mr Bayraktar, in his capacity as the President of TOKI and the head of Emlak, threatened to terminate the Contract unless the Van Herk Group and Mr Benitah removed Messrs Erten and Mertoglu from Tulip I.402 The Claimant contends that Mr Bayraktar made this alleged threat directly to the Van Herk Group and Mr Benitah at the January 2007 meeting in Ankara. The purported basis for the alleged request to remove Messrs Erten and Mertoglu was \"pressure from the Party\" and that they are \"bad people\".403\n\n(4) The Respondent treated the Claimant\u2019s investment in an inconsistent manner. It threatened to terminate the Contract and, at the same time, gave assurances that the Contract would not be cancelled and encouraged the Claimant to continue performing the Contract.404 In particular, despite the alleged threats made by Mr Bayraktar on 16 January 2007, Mr Kurum made assurances to Mr Erten in November 2009 that Tulip JV would be granted an extension if it improved the pace at which the project was being constructed, then on 5 February 2010 approved the recommendation of the Construction Control Department to grant Tulip JV an extension of time of 418 days and then the Emlak Board, despite substantial improvement in the pace of construction, endorsed the decision to deny Tulip JV any further extension, thereby setting the basis for the termination of the Contract that followed.405\n\n(5) The Respondent arbitrarily and discriminatorily refused to grant reasonable extensions to the Claimant on the basis of Art 33 of the Contract to compensate for the delays that were outside the control of Tulip JV. Aside from the failure to grant a sufficient extension of time in connection with the zoning dispute, the Respondent did not grant extensions of time to compensate for delays caused by the global economic crisis. This denial was despite the fact that: (a) Emlak\u2019s Construction Control Department noted that the global financial crisis \"had a major impact up until the middle of 2009 particularly affected the real estate industry\" in Turkey406; and (b) Emlak granted such an extension to other similarly situated Turkish developers, such as Kuzu Toplu Insaat Ltd. Sti.407\n\n(6) According to the Claimant, the course of conduct engaged in by the Respondent culminated in the arbitrary and discriminatory termination of the Contract in breach of Art 3(1). Specifically, the Contract termination: (a) violated Turkish law; (b) the reasons to justify the termination were pre-textual; (c) the termination was discriminatory, treating Claimant\u2019s investments differently than similarly situated Turkish developers.408 Further, and in any event, the termination of the Contract was in breach of the FET standard because it was not proportional to any legitimate end.409\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 456, 473 and 475.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 123-129; Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 483.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 530.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 143-144.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 553.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 552; Erten Witness Statement, para. 45.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 560.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 559.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 567.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras 261-270; Claimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 600-607.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent denies that there has been any breach of Art 3(1) either on the basis of a violation of legitimate expectations or any arbitrary or discriminatory conduct.\n\n386.\n\nAs a general matter, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal need not consider the Respondent\u2019s conduct as a whole in assessing whether there has been a violation of Art 3(1) (or any other substantive provisions of the BIT) unless it can be shown that such a course of conduct was motivated by an illegal common intent.410 The Respondent asserts that there was no such common intent driving any of the actions at issue in this arbitration.411 The Respondent contends that, if the Tribunal accepts that it can assess the entire course of the Respondent\u2019s conduct, then it is necessary to consider the impact of all relevant actions; the Claimant cannot \"pick and choose\".412\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder para. 341.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 344.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n387.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the assertion that the \"pro-active\" *Tecmed* standard applies to Art 3(1). The Respondent relies on criticisms of the *Tecmed* standard as \"questionable\", imposing \"inappropriate and unrealistic obligations\" on the State, appearing to be \"a programme of good governance that no State in the world is capable of guaranteeing at all times\", or a \"description of perfect public regulation in a perfect world, to which all states should aspire but few (if any) will ever attain.\"413\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 348.\n\n388.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the State cannot be expected to adhere to an ideal business and regulatory environment. Rather, as found by the tribunal in *Saluka,* the ordinary meaning of the term \"fair and equitable\" is \"\u2018just,\u2019 \u2018even-handed\u2019, \u2018unbiased\u2019, \u2018legitimate\u2019\"; infringement of that standard requires \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.\"414\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 351.\n\n389.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the language of Art 3(1) is very similar to the FET clause at issue in *Saluka* and, therefore, the Tribunal ought to follow the *Saluka* standard.415\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n390.\n\nFurther, according to the Respondent, the relevant legitimate expectations are those of the Parties in these proceedings, not those of the \"Dutch Investors\". The Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations arose, at the earliest, on 14 August 2008, and must reflect \"the state of the law and the totality of the business environment\" in Turkey at this time.416 Since the zoning dispute and the Danistay order took place before the Claimant made its investment, and at a time when the Claimant knew of the issues surrounding the zoning litigation, the zoning dispute cannot serve as the basis for the Claimant\u2019s allegations of a breach of legitimate expectations.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 358-363; Respondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 40.\n\n391.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent asserts that any conduct associated with the zoning dispute did not breach the legitimate expectations of the Claimant in violation of Art 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n392.\n\nThe Respondent denies that either TOKI or Emlak knowingly withheld any material facts regarding the zoning litigation at the time when Emlak entered into the Contract with Tulip JV.417\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 240 and 598; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 136-140.\n\n393.\n\nFurther, the Respondent asserts that the substance of the Claimant\u2019s complaint in truth amounts to an expectation of \"immutable zoning\" and that there was no basis in the Contract for such an expectation to exist.418\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 170; 246, 588, 589, 592 and 595; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 133, 364, 365 and 367-369.\n\n394.\n\nRather, Art 4.9 of the Tender Specifications imposed on the Claimant an obligation to conduct its own due diligence and to be aware of the zoning situation at the time of entering into the Contract.419 In addition, TOKI did not have any obligation towards the Claimant to act in any \"commercial\" best interests. To the contrary, in effecting zoning changes, TOKI was entitled to, and did, exercise its legitimate State planning powers, acting in the public interest.420\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 371.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 380.\n\n395.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that TOKI did not take Ispartakule III into account in approving the new zoning plan on the basis that this approval took place on 11 September 2007 whereas Mr Benitah first sought Emlak\u2019s assistance to ensure that Ispartakule III would be accommodated in the new zoning plan on 9 November 2007.421\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 381.\n\n396.\n\nFurther, and in any event, any delay that may have been caused by the zoning change was cured by the extension of time that Tulip JV was granted.422 Any other extensions of time were within the discretion of Emlak under Art 33 of the Contract.423 Therefore, the determination of the extent of the extension of time granted in a construction contract was the act of an ordinary contracting party and not a government measure which could breach the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 388.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 391.\n\n397.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s allegations of arbitrary and/or discriminatory conduct, the Respondent first takes issue with the Claimant\u2019s characterisation of the applicable legal standard for the \"arbitrariness\". The Respondent\u2019s contention is that the standard formulated by the International Court of Justice in *ELSI* should be applied by the Tribunal.424 The position of the Respondent is that the Tribunal ought to be guided by the pronouncements of the ICJ, since it is the highest judicial authority with power to interpret international law instruments.425 Accordingly, and on the basis of the decision in *ELSI,* the Respondent argues that, to be arbitrary, the State\u2019s actions must:\n\n(1) go beyond a merely inconsistent or questionable application of administrative or legal policy or procedure; and\n\n(2) constitute an unexpected and shocking repudiation of a policy\u2019s very purpose and goal; or\n\n(3) otherwise grossly subvert a domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive.426\n\n*Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.pA (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy),* Judgment of 20 July 1989, 1989 ICJ Reports 15 (Exhibit RLA-42).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 602; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 395.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 43.\n\n398.\n\nTurning to the issue of discrimination, the Respondent accepts that State conduct is discriminatory where \"(i) similar cases are (ii) treated differently (iii) and without reasonable justification\" and that \"it is not essential to establish any bad faith on part of the host state\" in order for a measure to be discriminatory.427\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 44.\n\n399.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position with respect to the Claimant\u2019s numerous assertions of arbitrary and/or discriminatory treatment is as follows:\n\n(1) The zoning changes were carried out by TOKI in line with applicable regulations and in the public interest and could not take into account Tulip JV\u2019s request to take its existing plans into account since the request was made only after TOKI had already approved the zoning plans.428 Further, and in any event, Tulip JV suffered no harm by the new zoning Plan, given that it was granted a sufficient extension of time and was able to make changes to the Project to make it more profitable.429\n\n(2) With respect to FMS, Emlak did not engage in any arbitrary conduct in refusing to accept the submissions of Tulip JV without the signature of FMS, given that:\n\n(i) Tulip JV\u2019s Joint Venture Agreement explicitly required FMS\u2019s signature on all Tulip JV submissions;\n\n(ii) FMS\u2019 management and signature authority in Tulip JV could not be legally revoked without a court order, as confirmed by Tulip I\u2019s own legal expert; and\n\n(iii) FMS had notified Emlak that it exposed itself to civil and criminal liability if it accepted submissions from Tulip JV without FMS\u2019s approval.430\n\n**(3)** There was no improper interference in Tulip JV or Ispartakule III by TOKI or Emlak. There is no cogent evidence in support of Mr Benitah\u2019s account of the 16 January 2007 meeting with Mr Bayraktar and the allegations that Mr Bayraktar threatened to terminate the Contract in the event that Tulip JV failed to remove Messrs Erten and Mertoglu from the Ispartakule III project.431 The Claimant presents no evidence of any impact due to Tulip I\u2019s refusal to comply with Emlak\u2019s alleged demands and, in any event, these alleged threats did not constitute a government measure.432\n\n(4) Emlak did not treat the Claimant\u2019s investment inconsistently in breach of Art 3(1) of the BIT. Rather, in light of the uncontested delay to the Project, with Tulip JV failing to achieve more than 10% progress in almost 2 years of construction, Emlak was fully justified to demand acceleration, invoke the possibility of termination and eventually to terminate the Contract.433 In this regard, Emlak engaged in an exercise of contractual rights and did not violate the BIT.\n\n(5) Emlak did not discriminate in granting extensions to any other construction project on the basis that such projects were not \"similarly situated\" to Ispartakule III. In particular, the Respondent relies on: (a) Art 11.17 of the Contract, which was specific in placing the risk of low sales on Tulip JV and required it to continue construction and not to halt the work despite such low sales; and (b) the fact that other construction on other projects progressed faster than Ispartakule III.434\n\n(6) The termination of the Contract was not arbitrary or discriminatory because Emlak did not go beyond the exercise of contractual rights in its perceived best interests.435\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 45-46.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 47.\n\n*Ibid.,* **section 5.1.2.3.**\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 53.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 54-55.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 56.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 327; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 475-476.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 60.\n\n400.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent asserts that it is not responsible for any violation of Art 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Art 3(1) of the BIT is to be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the term \"fair and equitable,\" *i.e.,* \"\u2018just,\u2019 \u2018even-handed\u2019, \u2018unbiased\u2019, \u2018legitimate\u2019\" and infringement of that standard requires \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable\".436\n\nSee *Saluka Investments B.V. v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL (Partial Award dated 17 March 2006), para. 297 (Exhibit CLA-38).\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant has indicated that its principal claims on the merits concern the failure to grant extensions (principally in 2009-2010) and the termination of the Contract. The Tribunal has considered the Claimant\u2019s other assertions about earlier conduct, such as with respect to the zoning dispute, as part of the course of conduct alleged against the Respondent, but has noted that they do not form part of the primary claim asserted by the Claimant.\n\n403.\n\nTurning to the Claimant\u2019s complaint surrounding the zoning dispute, the Tribunal considers that there is no cogent evidence that representatives of the Turkish State, such as an aide to Prime Minister Erdogan, the Mayor of Ankara, Mr Bayraktar or any other actors made specific representations or gave concrete assurances to the \"Dutch Investors\" about the nature and scope of Ispartakule III prior to the execution of the Contract. Rather, the Tribunal finds that, at best, the evidence supports the conclusion that Turkish State actors expressed general support for the \"Dutch Investors\" making their proposed investment into the Turkish construction sector.\n\n404.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that the primary source of any legitimate expectations with respect to the Ispartakule III project would have been the Contract and any pre-contractual representations made through the Tender Specifications or agreed in the Contract.\n\n405.\n\nContrary to making specific warranties about the condition of the zoning, Art 4.9 of the Tender Specifications for Ispartakule III placed the obligations of due diligence with respect of relevant administrative requirements and permits on Tulip JV, stating:\n\nBIDDER declares unconditionally that it has read and understood the entire tender document and its attachments, that it knows the responsibilities of BIDDER and CONTRACTOR, that it has seen the location where the job will be carried out before bidding and has **carried out the necessary investigation, that by seeing the location it has learned about the location where the job will be carried out and has learned about all matters, material resources and ground conditions related to the job and about the local conditions necessary to perform the Job** **, that**  **it has a good grasp of the legal and administrative situation, that it knows the CONTRACTOR shall fulfill [sic] all administrative requirements to obtain permits, all necessary legal requirements** and any actual conditions that must be met in order to start the job, and that after the Tender is concluded, the contract to be signed will be certified by a notary public.437 (emphasis added)\n\nEmlak Residential Real Estate Investment Partnership LLP Proposal Submission Specifications (Exhibit C-6).\n\n406.\n\nThe affirmative witness evidence of Messrs Bayraktar438 and Yetim,439 which the Tribunal accepts, is that neither TOKI nor Emlak knew of the zoning litigation at that time when Tulip JV entered into the Contract. Further, Professor Atay, an expert in Turkish administrative law, opines that there was no basis for TOKI, a third party to the zoning dispute, to have prior actual knowledge that the zoning litigation had been initiated and was pending.440 Professor G\u00fcnday does not provide a compelling basis to contradict the finding of Professor Atay.441\n\nTranscript, Day 3, Bayraktar (35:14-20).\n\nYetim Witness Statement, para. 54.\n\nLegal Opinion of Ender Ethem Atay, paras. 46-47.\n\nSee Legal Opinion of Metin Gunday.\n\n407.\n\nOn the re-zoning issue, the evidence illustrates that Tulip JV wrote to Emlak to request that TOKI take the design of Ispartakule III into account in October 2007, when TOKI\u2019s new zoning plan was already in progress. In any event, the Parties agree that Emlak granted Tulip JV a 471-day extension of time to complete construction on the basis of delays caused by the zoning litigation. The parties then agreed on a new Work Program for Ispartakule III, which fixed a new completion date of 19 May 2010 and took the extension of time explicitly into account. In these circumstances, even if there had been a basis for a complaint under the BIT in connection with the re-zoning, the extension of time and the new agreed Work Program cured that complaint and closed the matter.\n\n408.\n\nOn the Claimant\u2019s complaint that Emlak insisted on FMS\u2019s participation in the affairs of Tulip JV, the Tribunal notes, without determining issues of Turkish law, that the Tulip JV Agreement which was not imposed upon the Van Herk Group by TOKI or Emlak but freely entered into, specifically provided for an appointee of FMS, as a member of the Executive Board, to be included in all submissions. The Tribunal also notes that FMS consistently insisted on the respect of this provision and threatened legal actions against Emlak on several occasions in the event that Emlak proceeded to deal with Tulip JV without FMS. The Claimant does not argue that the provisions of the Joint Venture Agreement were inoperative in light of FMS\u2019 conduct absent a court order, nor does the Claimant dispute that the interim injunction obtained against FMS was vacated. What is more, it is uncontested that in February 2010, the FMS issue re-emerged, after the injunction against FMS, which permitted the other Tulip JV partners to act without it, was lifted. At that time, FMS repeated its threat to hold Emlak and others responsible for any actions taken without FMS\u2019 participation.\n\n409.\n\nWhile Emlak could have elected to ignore FMS\u2019 threats and deal with the consequences, the Tribunal cannot say that it was obliged to choose that course. From that it follows that it cannot be said that Emlak\u2019s decision amounted to arbitrary behaviour. Accordingly, insofar as Tulip JV predicates a claim of a BIT violation on Emlak\u2019s response to FMS\u2019 threats, that claim is not sustained.\n\n410.\n\nSince there is no evidence that the termination three years later was driven by the participation of Messrs Erten and Mertoglu in the Joint Venture, the Claimant\u2019s version of events at 16 January 2007, *i.e.,* that Mr Bayraktar threatened to terminate the Ispartakule III project in the event that the \"Dutch Investors\" failed to remove Messrs Erten and Mertoglu, could not constitute a violation of the BIT. This is particularly so given that the evidence suffices to establish that: (1) Emlak did not terminate the Contract after the 270 days for acquiring a construction permit had expired (when it could have done so); and (2) Emlak actually gave Tulip JV a substantial extension of time after the zoning dispute. Such conduct by Emlak is inconsistent with the notion that Mr Bayraktar had decided to terminate the Contract in January 2007.\n\n411.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant has not shown how the alleged threats of Contract cancellation in January 2007 impacted in any negative manner on Tulip JV\u2019s construction progress. To the contrary, the evidence on the record shows that the progress was primarily impeded by factors attributable to Tulip JV, *i.e.,* inadequate resourcing and internal conflict. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the Claimant\u2019s version of events as at the 16 January 2007 meeting constitutes a breach of the BIT.\n\n412.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant did not offer persuasive evidence that Emlak violated Art 3(1) of the BIT when it decided not to grant further extensions to Tulip JV in early 2010 or when it subsequently terminated the Contract.\n\n413.\n\nThe decision to decline further extensions cannot be considered \"discriminatory\" or \"arbitrary\" in circumstances where Emlak enjoyed a broad contractual discretion by virtue of Art 33 of the Contract and where: (1) the evidence showed that construction progress on other projects that received extensions vastly outpaced the progress made on the Ispartakule III project, even if measured only by the progress achieved in 2010 when Tulip JV increased the resources that it brought to bear; (2) Art 11.17 of the Contract required Tulip JV to complete the project with its own resources in the absence of funds available from sales; and (3) the EUR 20 million available under the First Loan Facility was completely drawn down on 28 November 2008 and the EUR 2 million available under the Second Loan Facility was completely drawn down on 19 May 2009.442\n\nEsveld Witness Statement, para. 11; Tulip I Copies of Drawdown Requests and Wire Transfers (Exhibit EE-6); Tulip I Summary of Drawdown Requests (Exhibit EE-7).\n\n414.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal also concludes unanimously that the termination of the Contract was not a violation of Art 3(1) of the BIT in circumstances where Emlak was faced with a project that was in substantial financial hardship and beset with severe construction delays.\n\n**B. Expropriation Claim**\n--------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n415.\n\nIn short, the Claimant contends that the termination of the Contract by Emlak and the acts that followed constitute an expropriation of its investment by the Republic of Turkey in violation of Art 5(1) of the BIT. The Claimant argues that, by terminating Claimant\u2019s Contract, physically seizing the Ispartakule III site by force, calling the performance bond, seizing all of the money in the Project sales account and leaving the Tulip brand without its founding project, Respondent expropriated Claimant\u2019s entire investment in Turkey.443 According to the Claimant, the termination of the Contract was not commercial in nature but rather an act that attracts the protection of the BIT.444 The Claimant refers to the recommendation of the Supreme Audit Board, a Turkish State organ, to Emlak to terminate the Contract.445 According to the Claimant, the recommendation was a catalyst for the termination.446\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 650.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 659.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 657.\n\nAside from referring to the May 2009 recommendation of the Supreme Audit Board with respect to the Ispartakule III project, the Claimant also relies on a Supreme Audit Board recommendation purportedly made following an inspection carried out in April 2010 but included in the 2009 Supreme Board Audit Report - see Claimant\u2019s Reply, fn. 358.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that Emlak was contractually entitled to terminate the Contract due to Tulip JV\u2019s numerous breaches, namely the project delays, Mertkan\u2019s bankruptcy, FMS\u2019s criminal conduct, and the assignment of receivables to Denizbank.447 The Respondent further contends that the other acts complained about by the Claimant (repossession of the site, calling of the performance bond, seizing the funds in the Project sales account) are a legitimate consequence of the termination.448\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 66.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 67.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded unanimously that the evidence offered by the Claimant falls short of establishing a violation of the BIT, inasmuch as the termination was pursued within the framework of the Contract and in Emlak\u2019s perceived commercial best interests.\n\n418.\n\nAs regards the recommendation of the Supreme Audit Board, suggesting that Emlak consider termination of the project in light of the slow pace of construction, the record does not reveal that any such recommendation had any particular influence on Emlak. What is more, Claimant offers no basis on which the Tribunal could find a mere recommendation to consider taking an action as an improper exercise of sovereign power. Especially is that so in the absence of any evidence that the Board exerted pressure on Emlak to terminate the Contract or that its recommendation was motivated by an improper purpose.\n\n**C. Full Protection and Security Claim**\n-----------------------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n419.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the \"full protection and security\" **(FPS)** clause in Art 3(2) of the BIT, which imposed on the host State an obligation to \"make every reasonable effort to ensure the physical protection and security of foreign investments.\"449\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 619.\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the Respondent violated its FPS obligations when Mr Kurum of Emlak orchestrated the physical invasion of the Ispartakule III site, accompanied by police and armed security personnel.450\n\nClaimant\u2019s Skeleton, para. 94.\n\n421.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the views of the alleged invasion expressed by the Kucukcekmece Public Prosecutor in issuing an indictment against Mr Kurum and others for trespass and other offences, which stated:\n\n...[T]he attempt by one party to remove the other from the construction site by using its own resources and employing force is clearly in breach of Articles 151, 154 and 117 of Act No. 5237; and it was ascertained that the suspects committed the offences they are accused of.451\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 622; Indictment No. 2010/6644 To Kucukcekmece Criminal Court of First Instance (Exhibit CE-24).\n\n422.\n\nThe Claimant contends that there was no legal justification for the invasion, as Tulip JV had challenged the legality of the purported termination in the Turkish courts and the case was pending at that time.452\n\nClaimant\u2019s Skeleton, para. 95.\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the alleged use of violence by Emlak representatives, the apparent cooperation of the police and the failure of the State to prevent the invasion renders the events at issue here analogous to the scenario in *Wena Hotels,453*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 96; *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4 (Award dated 8 December 2000) (Exhibit CLA-49).\n\n424.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has violated the FPS clause in Article 3(2) of the BIT.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the events surrounding the repossession of the Ispartakule III site did not amount to a breach of the FPS clause of the BIT.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that once the Contract was terminated, Emlak was entitled to repossess the site and Tulip JV no longer had any right to occupy the site. Accordingly, the Respondent contends that the Republic no longer had any duty to secure and protect access to it by the Claimant or any of the Tulip companies.454\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 76.\n\n427.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that, although the 6th Criminal Court of Kucukcekmece found Mr Kurum guilty of having restricted Tulip JV\u2019s \"freedom to engage in business and freedom of labour\", which constitutes a crime under Article 117 of the Turkish Criminal Code, the finding established that there was no substantial violence involved in the site repossession.455\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 77.\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the police did not assist Emlak with the repossession of the site, but ensured the safety of all involved.456\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 78.\n\n429.\n\nFinally, the Respondent\u2019s contends that the fact that the Public Prosecutor ordered that Tulip JV should regain exclusive possession of the site shows the State provided Tulip JV with effective remedies, meaning that there was no failure to provide FPS.457\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 79.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the observations in *Wena Hotels* that the FPS standard does not impose on the State a \"strict liability\" obligation.458 That is, the State cannot insure or guarantee the full protection and security of an investment. The question of whether the State has failed to ensure FPS is one of fact and degree, responsive to the circumstances of the particular case.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4 (Award dated 8 December 2000), para. 84 (Exhibit CLA-49).\n\n431.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the events that transpired in this case do not amount to a breach of the FPS standard by the State.\n\n432.\n\nWithout determining whether the repossession was legally justified under Turkish law, the Tribunal considers it relevant that Emlak came to the site in the belief that, having terminated the Contract, it could exercise its contractual rights to repossess the site in circumstances where it was the owner of the land. While Emlak may have been mistaken, there is no indication that it acted with a pre-determined intention to seize the site illegally and through organised violent action.\n\n433.\n\nThere is, therefore, no basis to conclude, that the State (assuming, *arguendo,* that Emlak were an emanation of the State) planned to engage in an unlawful seizure of land belonging to a foreign investor or, alternatively, that State organs failed to exercise due diligence and to prevent planned unlawful action by a private party.\n\n434.\n\nContrary to the assertion put forward by the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that Emlak\u2019s attempt to repossess the site did not involve substantial violence. The video material submitted by the Claimant establishes that, while there was some force being employed by persons representing Emlak, including Mr Kurum, such force does not rise to the level of generalised violence.459\n\nVideo Recording of the Site Seizure (Exhibit CE-308).\n\n435.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal considers that there is no evidence that the Turkish police violated the FPS clause by either assisting Emlak through use of force or being inactive, as was the case in *Wena Hotels.*\n\n436.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most significantly, the State took action against Emlak representatives for improperly using force and the State prevented Emlak from repossessing the Ispartakule III site while legal action against those representatives was pending. The fact that Emlak was ordered to remove its personnel from the site renders this case starkly different to the circumstances in *Wena Hotels,* where the tribunal found that the State of Egypt took no steps to return the hotels to Wena until nearly a year later.460\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4 (Award dated 8 December 2000), para. 91 (Exhibit CLA-49).\n\n437.\n\nAccordingly, in all the circumstances, the Respondent has not breached the FPS obligation in Art 3(2) of the BIT.\n\n**D. Umbrella Clause Claim**\n----------------------------\n\na) *Position of the Claimant*\n-----------------------------\n\n438.\n\nThe Claimant states explicitly that it \"is not seeking to argue that breaches of any contract it entered into relating to its investment in Turkey should be elevated to the level of breaches of the BIT, the archetypal example of the so-called \"umbrella clause\" claim but contends that the provisions of the Foreign Direct Investment Law **(FDIL),** a domestic Turkish legislative instrument concerning protections of foreign direct investment, constitutes an obligation which falls within the scope of the \"umbrella clause\" in Art 3(2) of the BIT.461 On that basis, the Claimant asserts that Art 3(2) of the BIT elevates the domestic law provisions of the FDIL into international obligations, assumed by the Turkish State vis-\u00e0-vis investors from the Netherlands.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para 677.\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the Respondent breached the obligation in Article 3(a) of the FDIL to afford \"national treatment\" to foreign investors, guaranteeing that they would be \"subject to equal treatment with domestic investors\" on the basis that:\n\n(1) TOKI forced Tulip JV to incur additional expense and delay to revise its plans in connection with a new zoning plan following the zoning dispute, while neighbouring projects developed by Turkish companies were not asked to alter their plans or to move the locations of their buildings.462\n\n(2) TOKI, acting through Emlak, arbitrarily refused to grant Tulip JV reasonable extensions in performing the Contract, whereas it routinely granted reasonable extensions to similarly situated Turkish companies.463\n\n(3) The Respondent cancelled and forcibly invaded Ispartakule III, which was under development by foreign investors but did not subject projects being developed by Turkish firms to the same treatment.464\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 310.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 311; Claimant\u2019s Reply, paras. 678-684.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 312.\n\n440.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Respondent breached the obligation in Art 3(2) of the BIT not to expropriate or nationalise foreign direct investments, except for public interest and upon compensation in accordance with due process of law.465\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 313.\n\n441.\n\nFinally, the Claimant asserts that, separate from its obligations under the FDIL, the Respondent also failed to comply with the obligations it undertook through binding unilateral assurances to support the investment, including assurances allegedly made by Mr Egemen Bagis, Prime Minister Erdogan\u2019s aide, during a meeting specifically designed to discuss investment opportunities in Turkey.466\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 314-315.\n\n442.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the alleged breaches of the FDIL and non-compliance with State assurances amount to breaches of the \"umbrella clause\" in Art 3(2) of the BIT.\n\nb) *Position of the Respondent*\n-------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the scope of the umbrella clause in Art 3(2) of the BIT does not extend to legislative acts such as the FIDL. The Respondent relies in particular on the assertion that the term \"entered into\" in Art 3(2) of the BIT denotes an obligation other than a general legislative instrument, and is targeted towards obligations specifically undertaken by the State, such as contractual obligations.467\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 626.\n\n444.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant asserts that any alleged breach of the FDIL does not amount to a breach of the umbrella clause.\n\n445.\n\nEven if it does, the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Respondent failed to comply with the obligations it assumed under the FDIL is in any event irrelevant since the FDIL\u2019s requirement to provide \"national treatment\" does not create any additional obligations to those already encompassed in Article 3(1) of the BIT, namely the requirement to provide fair and equitable treatment.468\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 80.\n\n446.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s assertions concerning breach of assurances by the State, the Respondent contends that a vague and general statement of support by a government official of the \"Dutch Investors\u2019\" efforts in Turkey does not create any \"legally binding obligation\" on Turkey.469\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 636.\n\n447.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent asserts that it was not in a position to intervene in Emlak\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract. The Respondent refutes any suggestion that the Contract was terminated at the recommendation of the Supreme Audit Board or that it otherwise had any power to interfere in the contractual relations between Emlak and Tulip.470\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 639.\n\nc) *Determination of the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has reservations about the argument that a legislative instrument such as the FDIL is capable of falling within the scope of obligations envisaged by the \"umbrella clause\" in Art 3(2) of the BIT, there is no need for the Tribunal to decide this matter conclusively in circumstances where it does not consider that, in any event, there has been any non-compliance with the requirements of the FDIL.\n\n449.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has already considered and rejected the Claimant\u2019s contention that its investment was subjected to arbitrary and discriminatory treatment. The same reasoning applies to the issue of whether there has been any failure not to afford national treatment to the Claimant. In short, there has not been any such failure in the circumstances.\n\n450.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal has also addressed the Claimant\u2019s contention that the Respondent breached certain pre-contractual assurances in its determination with respect to the Art 3(1) claim for breach of the FET standard. It is sufficient merely to state that the Tribunal does not find there to be any compelling evidence of specific non-Contractual assurances that went beyond general expressions of support for the proposed foreign investment.\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimant has not, therefore, established its \"umbrella clause\" claims under Art 3(2) of the BIT.\n\n**E. Promotion and Protection of Investments Claim**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant asserted a violation of Art 2(1) of the BIT on the basis of the State\u2019s failure to intervene and assist Tulip JV following the termination of the Contract. It is unclear whether this claim is still being pursued by the Claimant.471\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 317.\n\n453.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant appears also to have suggested that the actions of the Turkish police in the attempted repossession of the Ispartakule III site amount to a breach of Art 2(1).472\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, para. 416.\n\n454.\n\nThe Respondent rejects any violation of Art 2(1) on the basis that this provision does not impose a legally-binding obligation to promote and protect foreign investments.473 In any event, the Respondent disputes any suggestion that the State violated Art 2(1) either by failing to intervene after the Contract was cancelled or through any inappropriate action of the Turkish police.474\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton, para. 80.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 81.\n\n455.\n\nIn short, and even assuming, *arguendo,* that Art 2(1) imposes a binding obligation on the State, the Tribunal does not accept that the State in this case acted incompatibly with any requirement to protect and promote the investment. The Tribunal concludes that, in circumstances involving a contractual relationship between Emlak and Tulip JV, the State did not breach any international obligation due to its non-interference in the termination of the Contract.\n\n456.\n\nThe Tribunal has already made findings with respect to the actions of the police in the context of the Claimant\u2019s FPS claim. Its conclusions that the police did not act in a manner that breached the State\u2019s international obligations under the BIT apply equally here.\n\n457.\n\nThe Claimant has not, therefore, established its Art 2(1) claim.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n458.\n\nBoth Parties request an award of costs in respect of the legal fees and expenses and the costs of arbitration incurred in this proceeding, namely the advances paid to ICSID to cover the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of ICSID\u2019s facilities.\n\n459.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s legal fees and expenses total USD 9,368,621.48. This amount consists of the following items: (i) Crowell & Moring fees: USD 6,215,000; (ii) Crowell & Moring expenses: USD 1,461,952.16; (iii) expert fees and expenses: USD 1,360,846.74; (iv) Dutch and Turkish counsel fees: USD 323,644.85; and (v) additional direct travel expenses: USD 7,177.73. The Claimant has advanced USD 500,000 to ICSID to cover the costs of arbitration, as well as a lodging fee of USD 25,000.\n\n460.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant has incurred USD 506,032.04 in connection with the Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue (USD 466,422.75 Crowell & Moring fees, USD 25,089.29 Crowell & Moring expenses, and USD 14,520 expert fee). In view of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue, the Claimant has not included these costs in its request for costs.\n\n461.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses amount to USD 2,194,884 and EUR 1,605,082.00. These amounts consist of the following items: (i) Kuseyri Hukuk Btirosu fees and expenses: USD 874,898; (ii) Nixon Peabody fees and expenses: USD 660,000; (iii) LALIVE fees and expenses: USD 659,986; (iv) expert fees and expenses: EUR 1,501,740; (v) travel and accommodation: EUR 72,598; and (vi) hearing expenses: EUR 30,744. The Respondent has advanced USD 499,847.86 to ICSID to cover the costs of arbitration.\n\n462.\n\nThe Respondent estimates that it has incurred USD 300,000 in connection with the pleadings and hearing on the Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue. It maintains that these costs, as well as all other costs incurred as a result of this proceeding, should be borne by the Claimant.\n\n463.\n\nArt 10(6) of the BIT states in relevant part:\n\nEach Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the Tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings; the cost of the Chairman and the remaining costs shall be borne in equal parts by the Parties. The Tribunal may, however, in its decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the Parties, and this award shall be binding on the Parties.\n\n464.\n\nFurther, the ICSID Convention provides in Art 61(2) that:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n465.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion to decide on the allocation of costs. They both contend that the Tribunal ought to apply the \u2018costs follow the event\u2019 principle, in the sense that the unsuccessful party is required to pay the successful party\u2019s costs.\n\n466.\n\nThere is no rule in ICSID arbitration that \u2018costs follow the event\u2019, nor does the broad body of arbitral practice suggest that this is the approach which should be followed in ICSID arbitration proceedings. However, in the exercise of its discretion to allocate costs, the Tribunal has the authority to award all or part of a party\u2019s costs of the arbitration and its legal fees and expenses. Taking into account all factors in this case, the Tribunal has decided partially to apply this principle.\n\n467.\n\nAs the Respondent ultimately prevails in this arbitration, the Tribunal determines that the Claimant shall bear USD 450,000 of the costs of arbitration (the advances paid to ICSID to cover the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of ICSID\u2019s facilities) incurred by the Respondent.475\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final. The final costs of arbitration incurred by each party may not correspond to the amount awarded. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n468.\n\nAs to the Art 8(2) proceeding, the Claimant was successful in establishing compliance with the requirements of Art 8(2) of the BIT. However, the Tribunal indicated in its Decision on the Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue that the Claimant should not have its costs of the Art 8(2) application and that Respondent may contend upon finality that it should have its costs, which are estimated to USD 300,000. The Tribunal determines that these costs should be paid by the Claimant. While the Claimant prevailed on the application, it could have been avoided by an explicit notice to the Respondent of an investment dispute pursuant to Art 8(2) of the BIT.\n\n469.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant shall pay to the Respondent USD 750,000.\n\n**X. DISPOSITIVE PART**\n-----------------------\n\n**The Tribunal determines as follows:**\n\n**1. The Claimant has made an investment into Turkey within the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.**\n\n**2. The claims of Mr Benitah are inadmissible.**\n\n**3. By majority, the acts of Emlak are not attributable to Turkey.**\n\n**4. Unanimously, and in any event, the acts of Emlak do not constitute breaches of the BIT.**\n\n**5. Also unanimously, the acts of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Turkish police and Turkish government officials are attributable to Turkey but do not constitute breaches of the BIT.**\n\n**Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s claims are dismissed.**\n\n**Costs:**\n----------\n\n**The Claimant is ordered to pay the Respondent USD 750,000, constituted by:**\n\n**(a) USD 450,000 in part reimbursement of the advances paid by the Respondent to ICSID; and**\n\n**(b) USD 300,000 for its other costs.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2015-12-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| App. Exh.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 3, 2014, Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. (\"Applicant\" or \"Claimant\" or \"Tulip\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application requesting the annulment of the award rendered on March 10, 2014 (\"Award\") in the case between the Applicant (the Claimant in the original proceedings) and the Republic of Turkey (\"Respondent\" or \"Turkey\"). The application (\"Application\") was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). Tulip sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, the Secretary-General informed the parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* committee pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of August 26, 2014, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the parties that the *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee\") had been constituted - composed of H.E.

THE AWARD AND THE SEPARATE OPINION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Award was rendered by a Tribunal composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith (President, appointed by the parties), Mr. Michael Evan Jaffe (appointed by the Claimant in the original proceedings) and Prof. Rolf Knieper (appointed by the Respondent). Attached to the Award was the separate opinion of Mr. Jaffe (\"Separate Opinion\") on the question of attribution under Article 8 of the International Law Commission\u2019s (\"ILC\") Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\" or \"ILC Articles on State Responsibility\"). While Mr. Jaffe partially dissented from the Award, the outcome of the Award was unanimous in that the Claimant\u2019s claims based on alleged breaches of the Agreement on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Turkey dated March 27, 1986 (\"BIT\") were dismissed.\n\n15.\n\nSections I and II of the Award introduce the parties to the dispute, and provide an overview of the procedural history. On November 2, 2012, the Tribunal had bifurcated the proceeding to address one of the three objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent as a preliminary question. The Award incorporates the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue dated March 5, 2013, in which the Tribunal rejected the third objection to its jurisdiction and proceeded to the next phase of the proceeding.\n\n16.\n\nSection III provides a factual overview of the dispute. The facts in that section can be summarized as follows.\n\n17.\n\nThe dispute relates to the Claimant\u2019s involvement in a mixed-use real estate development project in Istanbul, known as Ispartakule III. In 2006, Tulip JV, an unincorporated joint venture, was awarded a tender to complete the project by a Turkish real estate investment trust, Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi A.S. (\"Emlak\"). Emlak was at the time 39% owned by TOKI, a State organ responsible for Turkey\u2019s public housing, and TOKI controlled over 99.9% of Emlak\u2019s shares.\n\n18.\n\nThe lead partner in Tulip JV - Tulip Gayrimenkul Gelistirme ve Yatirim Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (\"Tulip I\") - was established as a local investment vehicle by the Van Herk Group and Mr. Meyer Benitah, a national of the Netherlands. The other members of Tulip JV were three local Turkish partners: FMS Mimarlik Ltd Sti. (\"FMS\"), Mertkan Insaat Ltd Sti. (\"Mertkan\"), and Ilci Insaat A.S. (\"Ilci\"). Pursuant to a Joint Venture Agreement dated August 2, 2006, Tulip I was allocated a 74.8% interest in the joint venture, FMS 25% and Mertkan and Ilci 0.1% each.\n\n19.\n\nTulip JV and Emlak executed a contract for the development of the Ispartakule III project on August 3, 2006 (\"Contract\"), and the project site was delivered later that month to Tulip JV. The key terms of the Contract are set out in paragraphs 75-89 of the Award.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant was incorporated in the Netherlands in 2007. Shortly thereafter, Tulip Gayrimenkul Yatirim A.S. (\"Tulip II\") was incorporated under Turkish law, and all of the obligations of Tulip JV under the Contract were assigned to Tulip II. In August 2008, the Claimant acquired 65% of the shares in Tulip I. In March 2008 and February 2009, the Claimant also entered into two loan facility agreements with Tulip I and Tulip II in order to finance the development of the project.\n\n21.\n\nThere were a number of issues relating to the development of the project, which are described in the Award. These included conflicts among the joint venture members (including attempts to forcibly remove certain members from the joint venture), zoning changes impacting the project, construction delays and failure to meet certain milestones in the Contract.\n\n22.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, Emlak\u2019s Board passed a unanimous resolution to terminate the Contract. On May 26, 2010, Emlak further drew the full amount of a performance bond (EUR 8,716,981.05) that had been provided by Fortis Bank. Steps taken by the Tulip JV and its members to revise and continue the project were unsuccessful, and the project was retendered by Emlak.\n\n23.\n\nFollowing the termination of the Contract, Tulip I and Tulip JV commenced domestic court proceedings against Emlak in Turkey for improper termination of the Contract. At the time of the Award, one of the proceedings had been rejected and the other was pending.\n\n24.\n\nIn October 2011, the Claimant filed the ICSID case. Paragraph 60 of the Award summarizes the Claimant\u2019s claims as follows:\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent, acting through various alleged state actors and/or entities operating under State control, engaged in a pattern of conduct that interfered with the construction of Ispartakule III in breach of the BIT and ultimately terminated the Contract in a manner that amounts to wrongful expropriation that deprived the Claimant and Mr Benitah of the entire value of their real estate development projects throughout Turkey.1\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial in the Original Proceeding, para. 3.\n\n25.\n\nAsa result, the Claimant claimed that the Respondent had: (i) failed to comply with the \"fair and equitable treatment\" obligation in Article 3(1) of the BIT; (ii) expropriated the investment in breach of Article 5 of the BIT; and (iii) failed to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\" and to afford \"full protection and security\" to the investment, in breach of Article 3(2) of the BIT.\n\n26.\n\nSection IV of the Award describes the relevant provisions of the BIT, including the dispute settlement clause in Article 8 of the BIT. It also contains the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the applicable law:\n\nThe Tribunal observes that although the parties have not expressly agreed [on] the applicable law, the Claimant has presented its claims (and matters concerning jurisdiction) on the basis of the provisions of the BIT, and the Respondent has proceeded to present its defence on the same basis. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the applicable law consists, for the most part, of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with international law, as well as the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal further observes that, in addition to applying the provisions of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, aspects of Turkish municipal law are also invoked, in particular as the Claimant asserts that Emlak is a \"state organ\" and entities designated as \"state organs\" under domestic law will enjoy that status under international law.2\n\nAward, para. 171.\n\n27.\n\nSection V of the Award, \"Jurisdiction and Admissibility,\" addresses two questions: (i) whether the Claimant had an investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention; and (ii) whether the claims asserted on behalf of Mr. Benitah (who was not formally a party in the proceeding) were admissible. The Award summarizes the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to these questions, and provided the Tribunal\u2019s determination that: i) the Claimant had an investment for the purposes of Article 1(b) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; and ii) Mr. Benitah\u2019s claims were not admissible.\n\n28.\n\nSection VI of the Award, \"Attribution,\" addresses the parties\u2019 arguments and the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on whether Emlak\u2019s actions were attributable to the Respondent under Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal described its general approach to the question of attribution as follows:\n\n276. The issue of attribution relates both to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and to the merits of this dispute. Attribution is relevant in the present context to ascertaining whether there is a dispute with a Contracting State, here Turkey, for the purposes of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. At the same time, the claims presented in this investment arbitration (particularly with respect to the conduct of Emlak) may only succeed if they are attributable to the State. In that sense, the issue of attribution is also relevant to the merits of the dispute. Finally, purely contractual conduct *per se* does not amount to (wrongful) action of the State.\n\n[...]\n\n280. As the Tribunal has not accepted bifurcation with respect to questions of jurisdiction (other than the question of compliance with the Art 8(2) notice requirement), and has joined those jurisdictional objections to the merits, it now has the benefit of the Parties\u2019 full pleadings. In those circumstances, and taking into account that the question of attribution is also relevant to the merits, the Tribunal may not limit its enquiry to a *prima facie* standard and must, instead, make an informed and dispositive ruling on the question of attribution.3\n\nThe Tribunal referenced, and adopted, the approach to the issue of attribution taken by the Tribunal in *Gustav F W Homester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24), Award, June 18, 2010, paras. 143-145 *(\"Homester v. Ghana\").*\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal unanimously concluded that Emlak\u2019s actions were not attributable to the Respondent under either Articles 4 or 5 of the ILC Articles. By majority, the Tribunal also found that the acts of Emlak were not attributable to the State under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. The Tribunal concluded in that regard:\n\n326. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that while Emlak was subject to TOKI\u2019s corporate and managerial control, Emlak\u2019s conduct with respect to the execution, maintenance and termination of the Contract is not attributable to the State under Art 8 of the ILC Articles due to an absence of proof that the State used its control as a vehicle directed towards achieving a particular result in its sovereign interests.\n\n327. In conclusion, the Tribunal therefore determines by majority that Emlak\u2019s conduct with respect to the Contract and the Ispartakule III Project is not attributable to the Turkish State and is, on that basis, outside the remit of the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nSection VII of the Award, \"Treaty Versus Contract Claims,\" addresses the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extended only to treaty-based claims and not claims arising under a contract. The Award summarizes the parties\u2019 arguments and provides the Tribunal\u2019s determination on this question. The Tribunal concluded that purely contractual claims are not covered by the BIT. It further found that the claims relating to Emlak\u2019s actions were contractual in nature, stating that:\n\n361. [T]here is no persuasive evidence before the Tribunal that Emlak went beyond acting as an ordinary contractual party in pursuit of its commercial best interests. For example, the Claimant\u2019s claims regarding Emlak\u2019s failure to grant reasonable extensions of time is, essentially, a claim arising out of the contractual relationship between Emlak and Tulip JV and Emlak\u2019s exercise of rights in reference to the Contract. Similarly, the termination of the Contract was, as discussed above, an exercise of perceived contractual rights consistent with promoting Emlak\u2019s commercial best interests. Indeed, none of the claims presented by the Claimant with respect to the conduct of Emlak are amenable to be characterised by the Tribunal as arising out of the BIT. Accordingly, they fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction over the independent actions of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Prime Ministry and the police, as claims with respect to those actors were not substantially connected to contractual issues between Emlak and Turkey and were assertions about the conduct of State organs in the performance of their State functions.\n\n33.\n\nSection VIII of the Award, \"The Claimant\u2019s Claims,\" sets out the parties\u2019 positions and the Tribunal\u2019s rulings on the merits of the dispute with regard to the questions outlined by the Tribunal in paragraphs 367-368 of the Award:\n\n367. Nevertheless, the Tribunal will turn to consider whether the claims presented by the Claimant in respect of Emlak could amount to any violations of the BIT if the Tribunal were to assume that they could be characterised as treaty claims attributable to the Respondent.\n\n368. The Tribunal will also consider the Claimant\u2019s claims asserted by the Claimant with respect to State actors such as TOKI, the Prime Ministry, the Supreme Audit Board and the Turkish police which are, in any event, properly within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and admissible before it.\n\n34.\n\nThe Award continued:\n\n369. In deciding on the different claims put forward by the Claimant, the Tribunal has examined the evidence put before it and has concentrated on assessing the extent to which, if any, the evidence supports a finding of a violation of the BIT. It has found unanimously that no such violation occurred. To the extent that any question is not discussed, it is because the Tribunal considers that the resolution of the question would not affect its decision, even if the question were resolved in favour of the Claimant.\n\n35.\n\nEven assuming that Emlak\u2019s conduct could be attributed to the government of Turkey, the Tribunal thus unanimously concluded that the challenged actions, including those of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Prime Ministry and the police, did not constitute breaches of the BIT.\n\n36.\n\nSection IX of the Award, \"Costs,\" sets out the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the allocation of the parties\u2019 legal fees and expenses, and the costs of arbitration. The Tribunal ordered the Claimant to pay to the Respondent USD 750,000 to reimburse advances paid to ICSID and other costs associated with the proceedings.\n\n37.\n\nFinally, Section X of the Award is the *dispositif.*\n\nThe Tribunal determines as follows:\n\n1. The Claimant has made an investment into Turkey within the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n2. The claims of Mr Benitah are inadmissible.\n\n3. By majority, the acts of Emlak are not attributable to Turkey.\n\n4. Unanimously, and in any event, the acts of Emlak do not constitute breaches of the BIT.\n\n5. Also unanimously, the acts of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Turkish police and Turkish government officials are attributable to Turkey but do not constitute breaches of the BIT.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant\u2019s claims are dismissed.\n\nCosts :\n\nThe Claimant is ordered to pay the Respondent USD 750,000, constituted by:\n\n(a) USD 450,000 in part reimbursement of the advances paid by the Respondent to ICSID; and\n\n(b) USD 300,000 for its other costs.\n\n38.\n\nMr. Jaffe\u2019s Separate Opinion expressed his view on Article 8 of the ILC Articles. He found that Emlak\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract was taken at the direction of TOKI. The Separate Opinion concluded as follows:\n\n11. [B]ecause there is at least a credible basis for finding that Emlak\u2019s termination decision was taken under the direction and control of TOKI, an organ of the Turkish State, I would treat the attribution question under Art 8 as provisionally addressed in favor of attribution and focus on the question of whether there was state action amounting to a violation of the BIT. On that question, I join my colleagues in concluding that the proof offered was not sufficient to find a violation of the BIT.\n\n**III. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. General Observation**\n--------------------------\n\n**A.** ***The Function of Annulment under the ICSID Convention***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, annulment provides relief for egregious violations of certain basic principles. Article 52(1) of the Convention circumscribes the reasons for annulment.\n\n40.\n\nIn any review process, two potentially conflicting principles are at work: the principle of finality and the principle of correctness. Finality serves the purpose of efficiency in terms of an expeditious and economical settlement of disputes. Correctness is an elusive goal that takes time and effort, and may involve several layers of control, a phenomenon that is familiar from proceedings in domestic courts. In arbitration, the principle of finality typically takes precedence over the principle of correctness.\n\n41.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention follows the model of a limited review. It represents a control mechanism that ensures that a decision has remained within the framework of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate and is the result of a process that was in accord with basic requirements of fair procedure. The main function of annulment is to provide a limited form of review of awards in order to safeguard the integrity of ICSID proceedings. The *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC v. Seychelles* described this review in the following terms:\n\nThis mechanism protecting against errors that threaten the fundamental fairness of the arbitral process (but not against incorrect decisions) arises from the ICSID Convention\u2019s drafters\u2019 desire that Awards be final and binding, which is an expression of \"customary law based on the concepts of *pacta sunt servanda* and *res judicata f* and is in keeping with the object and purpose of the Convention. Parties use ICSID arbitration (at least in part) because they wish a more efficient way of resolving disputes than is possible in a national court system with its various levels of trial and appeal, or even in non-ICSID Convention arbitrations (which may be subject to national courts\u2019 review under local laws and whose enforcement may also be subject to defenses available under, for example, the New York Convention). Procedural protections are, however, all the more necessary in order to ensure that the resulting award is truly an \"award,\" i.e., a result arrived at fairly, under due process and with transparency, and hence in the basic justice of which parties will have faith.4\n\n*CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 36 (\"CDC *v. Seychelles\u2019\u2019* \u2019). Footnotes omitted.\n\n42.\n\nAnnulment is fundamentally different from appeal. The result of a successful application for annulment is the invalidation of the original decision. The result of a successful appeal is its modification. A decision-maker exercising the power to annul only has the choice between leaving the original decision intact or annulling it in whole or in part. An appeals body may substitute its own decision for the decision that it has found to be deficient. Under the ICSID Convention, an *ad hoc* committee only has the power to annul the award. The *ad hoc* committee may not amend or replace the award by its own decision on the merits. Article 53(1) of the Convention explicitly rules out any appeal.\n\n43.\n\nAnnulment is concerned only with the legitimacy of the process of a decision: it is not concerned with its substantive correctness. Appeal is concerned with both. Annulment is possible on a very limited number of grounds. In the case of the ICSID Convention, these are listed exhaustively in Article 52(1). Appeal is possible on a much broader variety of reasons including those going to the merits of the decision.5\n\nThe distinction between annulment and appeal has been aptly described by *D. Caron,* Reputation and Reality in the ICSID Annulment Process: Understanding the Distinction Between Annulment and Appeal, 7 ICSID Review\u2014 Foreign Investment Law Journal (1992) 21.\n\n44.\n\nICSID *ad hoc* committees have adamantly stressed the distinction between annulment and appeal. They have stated consistently that their functions are limited and that they do not have the powers of a court of appeal.6 A decision to annul has to be based on one of the five reasons listed in Article 52(1).7*Ad hoc* committees cannot review an award\u2019s findings for errors of fact or law.8\n\nSee e.g. : *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v.

Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007, paras. 85, 136.\n\n**B.** ***Discretion to Annul***\n--------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nArticle 52(3) of the ICSID Convention provides in part that \"[t]he Committee shall have the authority to annul the award [...].\" Under the ordinary meaning of this provision, an *ad hoc* committee has some discretion and is not under an obligation to annul even if it finds that there is a ground for annulment listed in Article 52(1).9 Decisions on applications for annulment confirm that, even if a ground listed in Article 52(1) exists, annulment will ensue only if the flaw has had a serious adverse impact on one of the parties.\n\nFor the discussion of this principle in early ICSID cases see: *Klockner v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 151, 179; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia,* Decision on Annulment, December 3, 1992, para. 1.20 (\"Amco *II v. Indonesia\"); MINE v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, paras. 4.09-4.10.\n\n46.\n\nThe **ad hoc** Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* stressed that a ground for annulment must have had an effect on the outcome of the award and must have led to a substantially different result in order to actually lead to annulment.10 The **ad hoc** Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* cautioned that it \"must guard against the annulment of awards for trivial cause.\"11 It stressed the discretion of committees and the practical significance of any error.12\n\nSee *Wena v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 58, 105.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 63.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 66. In the same sense: *Soufraki v.

Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 37.\n\n47.\n\nIt follows that, even in the presence of one of the grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, annulment does not follow automatically. An *ad hoc* Committee must decide whether the fault is grave enough to warrant annulment, especially whether it has made a material impact on one of the parties.\n\n**C.** ***Principles Governing Annulment***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Background Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID13 lists the following six broad principles that *ad hoc* committees have affirmed:\n\n(1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled;\n\n(2) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an *ad hoc* Committee is limited;\n\n(3) **ad hoc** Committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an **ad hoc** Committee cannot substitute the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the merits for its own;\n\n(4) *ad hoc* Committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards;\n\n(5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly;\n\n(6) an **ad hoc** Committee\u2019s authority to annul is circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an **ad hoc** Committee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, z'.e., either partial or full.\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012, 27 ICSID Review -FILJ (2012) 443,470.\n\n**D.** ***The Present Case***\n-----------------------------\n\n49.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention lists the following five grounds on which an award may be annulled:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\nIn the present case, the Applicant seeks annulment based on grounds (b), (d) and (e).\n\n50.\n\nThe parties in the case-at-hand agree that annulment is an extraordinary remedy that can only be granted in matters of fundamental importance and cannot amount to an appeal of an ICSID award. However, they diverge as to the interpretation of the three grounds raised by the Applicant under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**2. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicant points out that a tribunal exceeds its powers in three situations. First, if it exercises jurisdiction it does not possess. Second, if it fails to exercise jurisdiction with which it is vested. Third, if it acts outside the terms of reference set by the parties, such as when it fails to apply the applicable law to the dispute or otherwise fails to make a tenable determination of jurisdiction or merits.14\n\nApplication, paras. 128, 129; App. Mem. Annul., para. 211.\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicant identifies three positions in practice with respect to the requirement that an excess of powers must be manifest: (1) this can refer to the seriousness of the excess of powers; (2) it can refer to the obviousness or ease with which the excess of powers is perceived; and (3) it can refer to the tenability of the tribunal\u2019s exercise of its powers.15 Specifically, the exercise by a tribunal of jurisdiction, after it finds it does not have jurisdiction, is manifestly an excess of powers.16\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 212.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 214; App. Rep. Annul., paras. 163-164.\n\n**B.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Applicant\u2019s legal test for \"manifest excess of powers.\" It points to the Tribunal\u2019s power under Article 41(1) of the Convention to determine its own competence.17 Based on the jurisprudence of other *ad hoc* committees, the Respondent argues that the term \"manifest\" means that the excess of powers must be both apparent or obvious, and at the same time, substantial or serious. In the Respondent\u2019s view, there is a heavy burden on the Applicant to establish manifest excess of powers.18\n\nResp. C-Mem. Annul., para. 34.\n\nResp. Rej. Annul., para. 21; Transcript, Day 1, pp. 153-155.\n\n54.\n\nWith respect to the argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Respondent points out that this is a question of evaluation of evidence rather than a matter of excess of powers. Moreover, even if the Tribunal had failed to apply the ILC Articles, this would at most amount to a failure to apply the proper rule of the applicable law, rather than the proper law (international law).19\n\nResp. C-Mem. Annul., para. 100.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAn excess of powers occurs when a tribunal deviates from the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. This would be the case if a tribunal makes a decision on the merits although it does not have jurisdiction or if it exceeds its jurisdiction. Failure to exercise an existing jurisdiction also constitutes an excess of powers. Failure to apply the proper law may also amount to an excess of powers.\n\n*(i) Manifest Nature of the Excess of Powers*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe requirement that an excess of powers must be \"manifest\" in order to constitute a ground for annulment means that the excess must be obvious, clear or easily recognizable.20 Some *ad hoc* committees have interpreted the term \"manifest\" to mean that the excess must also be serious or material to the outcome of the case.21\n\n*Wena v.

Therefore, it is unnecessary to interpret the term \"manifest\" in Article 52(1)(b) as adding a requirement that the excess must be serious or material.22\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Kthc v. Turkmenistan* commented upon the discussion surrounding the meaning of \"manifest\" in the following terms: \"The Committee concurs in that it is unnecessary to consider the two approaches as alternatives. The term \u2018manifest\u2019 would by itself seem to correspond to \u2018obvious\u2019 or \u2018evident,\u2019 but it follows from the very nature of annulment as an exceptional measure that it should not be resorted to unless the tribunal\u2019s excess had serious consequences for a party.\"\u00a0*K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

Turkmenistan\").*\n\n*(ii) Failure to Apply the Proper Law*\n--------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe provisions on applicable law are an essential element of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. The application of a law other than that agreed to by the parties may constitute an excess of powers and can be a ground for annulment. An error in the application of the proper law, even if it leads to an incorrect decision, is not a ground for annulment. Therefore, the misapplication of a particular rule, which is part of the correctly identified applicable law, does not amount to an excess of powers.23\n\n*Klockner v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 60-61; *Amco I v. Indonesia,* Decision on Annulment, May 16, 1986, paras. 21-28; *MINE v.

Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Applicant submits that \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" has two elements: the departure must (i) concern a fundamental rule of procedure and (ii) be serious. The Applicant states that fundamental rules of procedure concern principles of natural justice, which unquestionably include the right to be heard and the principle of equal treatment of the parties. These principles require not just formal compliance but also substantive adherence.25\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 36-38.\n\n61.\n\nWith regard to the requirement that a violation be \"serious,\" the Applicant notes that a violation is serious if it deprives the party of the protection the rule is intended to provide, or if the tribunal, had it observed the rule of procedure, could have reached a decision that is substantially different from its actual decision. The Applicant refers to the reasoning adopted in *Pey Casado v. Chile,26* which held that the seriousness of the departure must be analysed in view of the impact that the issue may have had on the award, *i. e.* an applicant is not required to prove that the tribunal would necessarily have changed its conclusion if the rule had been observed.27\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, paras. 77-80 *(\"Pey Casado v. Chile\").*\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 64-67.\n\n62.\n\nThe Applicant further submits that an *ad hoc* committee does not have the discretion to decline to annul an award once it has found a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It relies on the proposition in *Pey Casado v. Chile* that discretion is exercised in determining whether the departure was serious.28 Once a serious departure is established, it requires an annulment *ipso facto* of the award.29\n\n*Pey Casado v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, paras. 79-80.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 68-69; App. Rep. Annul., para. 88.\n\n63.\n\nWith respect to the right to be heard, the Applicant states that it is not the same as the right to speak but requires a tribunal to listen.30 Moreover, arbitrators are required to consider all of the evidence presented by the parties.31 This means that it is not sufficient to admit materials into evidence, but requires a tribunal to engage with the materials submitted to it. A tribunal may not render a decision which exhibits willful blindness to the record. Although a tribunal need not address every piece of evidence, any implication that a piece of evidence has been dispensed with as being irrelevant and immaterial may be foreclosed by the tribunal\u2019s own rulings. This would be the case if a tribunal\u2019s ruling in a procedural order has indicated that evidence is relevant and material to the dispute. The tribunal\u2019s discretion in determining the probative weight of evidence does not entitle the tribunal to dispose of the dispute without exercising that discretion.32\n\nApplication, paras. 28 *et seq.;* App. Mem. Annul., para. 46.\n\nApplication, paras. 31-32; App. Mem. Annul., para. 49.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 51-56; App. Rep. Annul., paras. 95-101, 136.\n\n64.\n\nThe Applicant also relies on the principle of equality of the parties. Apart from formal equality, a tribunal must also ensure equality of arms.33 The principle of equality of the parties requires that a tribunal consider all evidence presented to it equally and that the evidentiary burdens of proof be applied equally.34\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 58-60.\n\nApplication, paras. 76 *et seq.;* App. Mem. Annul., paras. 61-62; App. Rep. Annul., paras. 133-135.\n\n65.\n\nThe Applicant urges the Committee to take into account human rights instruments and decisions in interpreting Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, such as the jurisprudence on the right to a fair trial interpreting Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\"ECHR\"). In view of Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), the *ad hoc* Committee should seek guidance from the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (\"ECtHR\").35\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 38-41; App. Rep. Annul., paras. 37- 46.\n\n**B.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Applicant that the test for what is a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is two-fold, emphasizing that the standard is thus doubly high. The Respondent does not deny that the right to be heard and the principle of equality of the parties constitute fundamental rules of procedure.36\n\nResp. C-M. Annul., para. 19\n\n67.\n\nWith respect to the seriousness of a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Respondent argues that departure will be serious if it has caused actual, proven prejudice, either substantive (by causing the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed) or procedural (by depriving a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide). The Respondent\u2019s position on the requirement of seriousness is that the applicant must show that the departure was outcome-determinative. This means the applicant must prove that the departure caused actual prejudice.37\n\nResp. C-M. Annul., paras. 21-23; Resp. Rej. Annul., para. 11.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that *ad hoc* committees do not have the authority to review an ICSID tribunal\u2019s evaluation of evidence. There is no right to have any particular piece of evidence cited or examined in the award. Specifically, there is no rule to the effect that a procedural order indicating that evidence is relevant and material forecloses the possibility that a tribunal subsequently finds that same evidence irrelevant or immaterial in the award.38\n\nResp. C-M. Annul., paras. 13-18; Resp. Rej. Annul., para. 9.\n\n69.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the jurisprudence under the ECHR is irrelevant for ascertaining the meaning of a fundamental rule of procedure in the sense of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. Article 6 of the ECHR on the right to a fair trial and Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, dealing with a fundamental rule of procedure, refer to different concepts in different regimes.39\n\nResp. C-M. Annul., paras. 24-29; Resp. Rej. Annul., paras. 12-14.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nUnder Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, a violation of a rule of procedure is a ground for annulment if two requirements are met: the rule concerned must be fundamental and the departure from the rule must be serious. Even a serious violation of a rule of procedure does not constitute a ground for annulment unless the particular rule is fundamental. The violation of even a fundamental rule cannot lead to annulment unless the violation was serious.\n\n*(i) Fundamental Rule*\n----------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe preparatory works to the Convention make it clear that only procedural principles of special importance qualify as \"fundamental rules\" and that a simple violation of the arbitration rules is not, by itself, a ground for annulment. The fundamental rules of procedure that might furnish a ground for annulment, if violated, would be restricted to the principles of natural justice.40 In other words, fundamental rules of procedure are principles that are essential to a fair hearing.41\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention: Documents Concerning the Origin and Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, Vol. II, (Washington, D.C. 1970) 271, 423, 480, 517. Curiously the Spanish version of the ICSID Convention omits reference to the requirement that the rule of procedure must be fundamental and merely refers to \"una norma de procedimiento.\" See also *Repsol v. Petroecuador,* Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2007, para. 81.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Annulment, May 22, 2013, para. 85 (\" *Libananco v. Turkey\").*\n\n72.\n\nThere is no disagreement between the parties that the right to be heard and the principle of equal treatment are fundamental rules of procedure. But the parties disagree on the precise meaning of these principles.\n\n*(ii) Serious Departure*\n------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe chief disagreement between the parties concerns the meaning of \"serious\" in Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The Applicant argues that it is enough that the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure had the potential to lead to a different decision. The Respondent argues that the departure must have caused actual prejudice, which must be proven.\n\n74.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE v. Guinea* pointed out that the term \"serious\" means that \"the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"42\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, para. 5.05.\n\n75.\n\nIn some decisions, ***ad hoc*** committees have examined the existence of actual material prejudice.43 In *Wena v. Egypt,* the ***ad hoc*** Committee stated that \" [i]n order to be a \u2018serious\u2019 departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\"44 Similarly, in *El Paso v. Argentina,* the ***ad hoc*** Committee said that it agreed with what other committees have stated, that \"in order to be grounds for annulment, the departure has to have a material impact on the outcome of the award.\"45 These cases suggest that \"serious\" means that prejudice, as a consequence of the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, must actually be established as a fact.\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 245-246 (\" *Fraport v. Philippines\"); Impregilo v.

Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, paras. 51, 234; *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 22, 2014, para. 269.\n\n76.\n\nOther **ad hoc** committees have adopted a more flexible position.46 In *Pey Casado v. Chile,* the **ad hoc** Committee found a potential effect on the award sufficient. The Committee said:\n\nThe applicant is not required to show that the result would have been different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected.47 [...]\n\n[T]he Committee does not consider, [...], that an applicant is required to prove that the tribunal would necessarily have changed its conclusion if the rule had been observed. This requires a committee to enter into the realm of speculation which it should not do.48\n\nSee also *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, para. 99.\n\n*Pey Casado v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, para. 78.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 80.\n\n77.\n\nIn applying this method, the Committee examined whether \"the Award might have been substantially different,\" but \"the applicant is not required to prove that the end result would have been different had the rule been observed.\"49\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 269. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Kthc v. Turkmenistan* endorsed the position that a potential effect on the outcome of the case would be sufficient to make the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure serious. *Kili$ v. Turkmenistan,* Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015, para. 70.\n\n78.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee considers the approach adopted in *Pey Casado* reasonable. To require an applicant to prove that the award would actually have been different, had the rule of procedure been observed, may impose an unrealistically high burden of proof. Where a complex decision depends on a number of factors, it is almost impossible to prove with certainty whether the change of one parameter would have altered the outcome. Therefore, an applicant must demonstrate that the observance of the rule had the *potential* of causing the tribunal to render an award substantially different from what it actually decided. In addition, in order to be serious, the departure must be more than minimal. It must be substantial. It must have deprived the affected party of the benefit of the rule in question.\n\n79.\n\nA number of ****ad hoc**** committees have pointed out that once an ****ad hoc**** committee has established that a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is serious, it no longer has the discretion not to annul. The serious adverse impact upon the affected party, which is a condition for the exercise of an ****ad hoc**** committee\u2019s discretion to annul under Article 52(3), is implicit in a finding that the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure has been serious. In *Pey Casado v. Chile,* the ****ad hoc**** Committee said:\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it has no discretion not to annul an award if a serious departure from a fundamental rule is established. The Committee exercises its discretion when it determines whether or not the departure was serious.50\n\n*Pey Casado v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, para. 80. To the same effect: *CDCv. Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 49, fn. 71.\n\n*(iii) The Right to Be Heard*\n-----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe parties agree that the right to be heard is a fundamental rule of procedure. The ICSID Arbitration Rules reflect this right throughout.51 The right to be heard affords the parties the opportunity to present all the arguments and all the evidence that they deem relevant and to respond to arguments and evidence submitted by their opponent. In particular, each party must have the opportunity to address every formal motion before the tribunal and every legal issue raised by the case. The principal human rights instruments also accept the right to present one\u2019s case as an essential element of a fair hearing.52\n\nSee especially ICSID Arbitration Rules 20-21, 31-32, 37, 39-42, 44, 49-50, 54.\n\nArticle 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(UDHR); Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); Article 6 of the ECHR.\n\n81.\n\nWhile the right to be heard is uncontested in principle, its implications are sometimes disputed. For instance, *ad hoc* committees have had to deal with the question of whether there was a violation of a party\u2019s right to be heard if the tribunal had based its decision on a theory that the parties had not fully discussed.53\n\n*Klockner v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 89-91; *Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 66-70; *Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, paras. 82-85; *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, paras. 90-96; *El Paso v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 22, 2014, paras. 278-286.\n\n82.\n\nThe right to be heard refers to the opportunity given to the parties to present their position. It does not relate to the manner in which tribunals deal with the arguments and evidence presented to them. In particular, the fact that an award does not explicitly mention an argument or piece of evidence does not allow the conclusion that a tribunal has not listened to the argument or evidence in question. A refusal to listen, amounting to a violation of the right to be heard, can only exist where a tribunal has refused to allow the presentation of an argument or a piece of evidence. Therefore, absence in an award of a discussion of an argument or piece of evidence put forward by a party does not mean that a tribunal has violated the right to be heard.\n\n83.\n\nAn indication through a procedural order that a tribunal regards a piece of evidence, that has yet to be submitted, as relevant and material can only be provisional. Whether the evidence is indeed relevant and material can only be determined once the tribunal has heard it. A tribunal that has called for the submission of particular evidence should normally explain what it thinks of it once it has heard it. Failure to do so may be unwise, but does not amount to a violation of the right to be heard.\n\n*(iv) Equality of the Parties*\n------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nUnequal treatment of the parties may be a sign of lack of impartiality and may amount to a serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure. However, a finding of this nature would require clear and incontrovertible substantiation. ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) states that the tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility as well as of the probative value of any evidence. A clear violation of a rule of evidence, such as the reversal of the burden of proof, may amount to a serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure.54 On the other hand, the evaluation of evidence is within the discretion of the tribunal. In the words of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena v. Egypt;*\n\n[I]rrespective whether the matter is one of substance or procedure, it is in the Tribunal's discretion to make its opinion about the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof presented by each Party. Arbitration Rule 34(1) recalls that the Tribunal is the judge of the probative value of the evidence produced.55\n\n*Klockner v. Cameroon,* Resubmitted Case: Decision on Annulment, May 17, 1990, para. 6.80; *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, para. 97.\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 65. See also: *CDC v. Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, paras. 59-61; *Azurix v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, paras. 207-217; *Continental Casualty v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 97; *Pey Casado v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, paras. 199, 223; *Kthc v. Turkmenistan,* Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015, para. 154.\n\n85.\n\nTherefore, an applicant\u2019s dissatisfaction with the way a tribunal has exercised its discretion in evaluating evidence cannot be a basis for a finding that there has been unequal treatment and hence a serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure necessitating annulment. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Impregilo v. Argentina* explained this principle as follows:\n\nThere is no requirement whatsoever for arbitral tribunals to indicate in an award the reasons why some types of evidence are more credible than others. Discretionary authority that is reasonable and reasoned is the rule in this regard, and it is clearly not within the purview of Annulment Committees, which do not have direct and immediate access to the evidence submitted by both parties, to determine whether the determinations made in an award were correct. Attempting to do so would involve a subsequent assessment of the conclusions of arbitral tribunals, which would destroy the basic principles of the institution of arbitration and [would be] outside the power of *ad hoc* Committees.56\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, January 24, 2014, para. 176.\n\n*(v) The Relevance of Human Rights*\n-----------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe parties disagree on the relevance of human rights instruments and decisions in interpreting Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The influence on international investment arbitration of human rights and of the multilateral treaties reflecting their current status has attracted much attention. There is a widespread sentiment that the integration of the law of human rights into international investment law is an important concern.57\n\nFor extensive treatment see: Human Rights in International Investment Law and Arbitration (*F. Francioni, E.-U. Petersmann, P.-M. Dupuy,* eds.), Oxford University Press (2009); *M.

The only requirements of Article 31(3)(c) are that the rules are relevant and that they are applicable as between the States parties to the treaty to be interpreted.\n\nFor detailed treatment see *C. McLachlan,* The Principle of Systemic Integration and Article 31(1)(c) of the Vienna Convention, 54 Inti & Comparative LQ 279 (2005); *R. Gardiner,* Treaty Interpretation, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, pp. 289-343 (2015); *B. Simma & T.

Weeramantry,* Treaty Interpretation in Investment Arbitration, Oxford University Press, pp. 88-95 (2012).\n\n88.\n\nThe ILC has discussed Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT extensively in its Fragmentation Report.59 In doing so, its Study Group has referred to that provision as a \"master key\" to the house of international law.60 It has described the function of that provision as follows:\n\n[I]f it is indeed the point of international law to coordinate the relations between States, then it follows that specific norms must be read against other norms bearing upon those same facts as the treaty under interpretation.61\n\nILC, Report of a study group on Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, UN Doc A/CN.4/L.682, paras. 410-480 (April 13, 2006).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 420.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 416\n\n89.\n\nThe ILC Study Group has rejected any suggestion that tribunals should restrict themselves to the treaty upon which their jurisdiction is based and which constitutes the treaty under dispute. It said:\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that international tribunals or law-applying (treaty) bodies are not entitled to apply the law that goes \"beyond\" the four corners of the constituting instrument or that when arbitral bodies deliberate the award, they ought not to take into account rules or principles that are not incorporated in the treaty under dispute or the relevant *compromis.* But if, [...], all international law exists in systemic relationship with other law, no such application can take place without situating the relevant jurisdiction-endowing instrument in its normative environment. This means that although a tribunal may only have jurisdiction in regard to a particular instrument, it must always *interpret* and *apply* that instrument in its relationship to its normative environment - that is to say \"other\" international law. This is the principle of systemic integration to which article 31(3)(c) VCLT gives expression.62\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 423. Footnotes omitted. Italics original.\n\n90.\n\n*Simma* and *Kill* describe the practice of systemic integration in the following terms:\n\nUnder customary principles of treaty interpretation, tribunals routinely resort to rules of international law whose normative validity is grounded in a source outside of the treaty that is the subject of interpretation.63\n\n*B. Simma & T. Kill, supra* note 58, at 681.\n\n91.\n\nIn investment cases involving parties to the ECHR, some tribunals have relied on the Convention and its case law.64 In other cases involving non-parties, that case law was used as authority on a number of points concerning individual rights.65 In a similar way, investment tribunals have relied on the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights (IACHR) and on the practice of its Court.66 In one case, the tribunal was \"mindful\" of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights(UDHR).67 One tribunal undertook an extensive examination of the right to a fair trial in international human rights instruments, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), for purposes of interpreting a treaty provision on fair and equitable treatment.68\n\n*Ronald S.

This is not to add obligations extraneous to the ICSID Convention. Rather, resort to authorities stemming from the field of human rights for this purpose is a legitimate method of treaty interpretation.\n\n**4. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Applicant concedes that reasons supplied by a tribunal need not be persuasive or correct. However, it is a tribunal\u2019s duty to supply reasons for all parts of its award. An *ad hoc* committee may reconstruct reasoning but may not add pertinent facts that were overlooked by the tribunal.69\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., paras. 167-170, 184; App. Rep. Annul., paras. 148-149.\n\n94.\n\nThe Applicant complains about an inadequate and incomplete analysis of attribution70 The Applicant also complains about the failure of the majority of the Tribunal (\"Majority\") to address evidence that the Tribunal itself requested be submitted.71 For the Applicant, the Majority\u2019s treatment of the parties\u2019 evidence is incomprehensible.72 Moreover, the Applicant finds a contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s examination of the merits after it had found that the acts in question were not attributable to Turkey.73\n\nApplication, paras. 92-104; App. Mem. Annul., paras. 171-185.\n\nApplication, paras. 105-109; App. Mem. Annul., paras. 186-190.\n\nApplication, paras. 110-116; App. Mem. Annul., paras. 191-198.\n\nApplication, paras. 117-126; App. Mem. Annul., paras. 199-207; App. Rep. Annul., para. 152.\n\n**B.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent argues that reasons must be given for an award, not for each specific determination along the way. It is sufficient if the committee can understand the tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusions based on the articulated premises, but it need not agree with them. The Respondent rejects the existence of a rule to the effect that overlooking pertinent facts amounts to a failure to state reasons. Rather, it is for the Tribunal to establish which facts are pertinent. If the Tribunal has not specifically mentioned facts, this is because it has found them not to have been proven, or determined within its discretion that they were not pertinent. A failure to refer to a particular argument or piece of evidence cannot amount to a failure to state reasons. The evaluation of evidence is beyond the supervisory authority of an annulment committee.74\n\nResp. C-M. Annul., paras. 30-33.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent states that it is for the Tribunal to make the findings of fact and not for the Committee to second-guess them. The obligation to state reasons in the Award merely requires that the Tribunal set out what the pertinent facts are, and then draw comprehensible conclusions from them and the applicable law. There is a difference between setting out the pertinent facts and setting out the evaluation of any given piece of evidence75\n\nResp. Rep. Annul., paras. 15-20.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nUnder Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal is under an obligation to state the reasons upon which its award is based.76 Failure to comply with this duty is a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\nThis requirement is restated in ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i).\n\n*(i) The Standard of Reasoning*\n-------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe purpose of a statement of reasons is to explain to the reader of the award, especially to the parties, how and why the tribunal reached its decision. Since the parties are the award\u2019s primary addressees, it is not necessary for a tribunal to restate all their arguments and evidence. The parties will be familiar with the main issues before the tribunal, with the evidence that was before it and with the main legal arguments presented to it. Moreover, Article 48(3) does not require discussion of arguments without impact on the award.77\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12), Award, November 2, 2012, paras. 273-275.\n\n99.\n\nExplaining to the parties the motives that have induced the tribunal to adopt its decision is not the same as convincing the losing party that the decision was right. A party that has not prevailed in litigation is inclined to regard the decision as incomprehensible and to feel that the decision-maker has not explained adequately why it rejected its arguments.\n\n100.\n\nEarly *ad hoc* committees operating under the ICSID Convention have stated that reasons would have to be \"sufficiently relevant\" or \"appropriate.\"78 The most widely accepted formula for the requirements of reasons, which the parties in the present annulment proceedings have endorsed, stems from *MINE v. Guinea.*\n\n5.08. The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal\u2019s decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a ground for annulment.\n\n5.09. In the Committee\u2019s view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\n\nThis minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.79\n\n*Klockner v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, para. 130; *Amco I v. Indonesia,* Decision on Annulment, 16 May 1986, para. 43.\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, paras. 5.08, 5.09.\n\n101.\n\nTherefore, the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* dismissed the concept of the adequacy of reasons except for the rejection of contradictory or frivolous reasons. It held that the standard merely requires that the reader can understand what motivated the tribunal. As long as an *ad hoc* committee can follow the reasons, it is irrelevant what it thinks of their quality.\n\n102.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* endorsed this position and said:\n\nThe ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the **ad hoc** Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the **ad hoc** Committee in *MINE,* this ground for annulment refers to a \"minimum requirement\" only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).80\n\n*Wena v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 79.\n\n103.\n\nThe limited role of a failure to state reasons as a ground for annulment is also apparent in the Decision on Annulment in *Vivendi.* The *ad hoc* Committee said:\n\n[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52 (1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.81\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 64 (emphasis in original). Footnote omitted.\n\n104.\n\nSubsequent *ad hoc* committees have since adopted this standard.82 Therefore, an *ad hoc* committee does not need to be persuaded that the reasons given by the tribunal are correct or convincing. The function of reasons is to enable the reader to understand what motivated the tribunal. *Ad hoc* committees have consistently confirmed that ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(e) does not permit any inquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons. *Ad hoc* committees may be dissatisfied with the adequacy of reasons, but provided the reasons meet the conditions set out in *MINE,* and confirmed in *Wena* and *Vivendi,* this will not be a ground for annulment.\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, paras. 66-75; *Mitchell v. DRC,* Decision on Annulment, November 1, 2006, para. 21; *MTD v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, para. 92; *Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, para. 134; *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A. formerly Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A.) v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4), Decision on Annulment, September 5, 2007, paras. 127, 128*;* *Azurix v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, paras. 53-56,178\u00a0(\"Lucchetti v. Peru\"); *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador, Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009*, paras. 82,\u00a086; *Fraport v. Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 272, 277; *Continental Casualty v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 100; *Libananco v. Turkey,* Decision on Annulment, May 22, 2013, paras. 90-94; *Impregilo v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, January 24, 2014, paras. 180-181; *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, paras. 101-102; *Alapli ElektrikB.V.* *v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13), Decision on Annulment, July 10, 2014, paras. 197-199 *(\"Alapli v. Turkey\");* *El Paso v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 22, 2014, paras. 217, 235; *Kilic v. Turkmenistan,* Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015, paras. 59-64.\n\n105.\n\nIt follows that reasons may be terse, summarizing a tribunal\u2019s overall impression of evidence without evaluating it in detail. In particular, a finding that the record does not support a particular proposition may not require detailed reasoning. Absence of convincing evidence on a particular point is not a matter that needs discursive substantiation by a tribunal.\n\n*(ii) Implicit Reasons*\n-----------------------\n\n106.\n\nEven where reasons on a particular point are missing, an **ad hoc** committee may reconstruct missing reasons. The **ad hoc** Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* said in this respect:\n\nNeither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal\u2019s reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the parties will be able to understand the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The Tribunal\u2019s reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.83\n\n*Wena v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 81.\n\n107.\n\nOther **ad hoc** committees have confirmed the possibility of reconstructing missing reasons.84 The task of reconstructing reasons includes looking at the record before the tribunal. In the words of the **ad hoc** Committee in *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan:*\n\nThe Committee is not limited in its review of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention to the text of the Award alone, but rather should seek to understand the motivation of the Award in the light of the record before the Tribunal.85\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, para. 6,104; *CDC v. Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 87; *Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, paras. 63-64; *CMS v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007, paras. 125-127;\u00a0*Azurixv. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, para. 360;\u00a0*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, March 25, 2010, paras. 83,138; *Fraport v. Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 264-266; *Continental Casualty v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 101.\n\n*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, March 25, 2010, para. 179. In the same sense: *Duke Energy v. Peru,* Decision on Annulment, March 1, 2011, para. 205.\n\n108.\n\nTherefore, an award is not subject to annulment if the reasons for a decision, though not stated explicitly, are readily apparent to the **ad hoc** committee. Implicit reasoning is sufficient as long as the committee can infer them reasonably from the terms and conclusions of the award as well as from the record before the tribunal. If the **ad hoc** committee can explain an award by clarifying reasons that may be only implicit, it may do so and need not annul.\n\n*(iii) Contradictory Reasons*\n-----------------------------\n\n109.\n\nContradictory reasons will not enable the reader to understand a tribunal\u2019s motives and may amount to a failure to state reasons.86 On the other hand, discussion of conflicting or competing considerations should not lead an **ad hoc** committee lightly to assume contradiction. In *Vivendi v. Argentina,* the **ad hoc** Committee warned against a hasty finding of contradiction in an award:\n\n[T]ribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be a reflection of such conflicting considerations.87\n\n*Klockner v.

Argentina,* the **ad hoc** Committee said:\n\nThe Committee adds that for genuinely contradictory reasons to cancel each other out, they must be such as to be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision. An example might be where the basis for a tribunal\u2019s decision on one question is the existence of fact A, when the basis for its decision on another question is the *non-existence* of fact A. In cases where it is merely arguable whether there is a contradiction or inconsistency in the Tribunal's reasoning, it is not for an annulment committee to resolve that argument. Nor is it the role of an annulment committee to express its own view on whether or not the reasons given by the tribunal are logical or rational or correct.89\n\n*Azurix v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, paras. 364-365; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* Decision on Annulment, March 25, 2010, para. 82; *Fraport v. Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, para. 274; *Duke Energy v. Peru,* Decision on Annulment, March 1, 2011, para. 166; *Alapli v.

Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 103.\n\n111.\n\nIn particular, reasoning that explores alternatives to a tribunal\u2019s decision should not be regarded as contradictory even if the alternative seems ruled out by the tribunal\u2019s primary finding. Reasoning based on \"even if\u2019 arguments is not contradictory but demonstrates that the tribunal has looked also at other avenues of reasoning. For instance, if the tribunal finds that a claim must fail as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility, it is not contradictory to add that the claim would have failed on the merits.\n\n112.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Daimler v. Argentina* described this situation as follows:\n\n[I]f after having stated its reasons and deciding a given point, the Tribunal, in an excess of caution or otherwise, analyses the other arguments made by the parties, such additional - and perhaps unnecessary - analysis cannot be compared with the reasons for the decision of the Tribunal to determine whether the two sets of reasons are contradictory, for even if they are they will not cancel one another. In such cases, the reasons for the decision are already in the Award, and the additional reasons can have no impact on the decision of the Tribunal.90\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, January 7, 2015, para. 135.\n\n*(iv) Alternative Remedies*\n---------------------------\n\n113.\n\nOpen questions as to the meaning of an award do not find their remedy in annulment for failure to state reasons but, rather, in Article 50 of the ICSID Convention. That Article provides for the interpretation of an award in case there is a dispute between the parties about its meaning or scope. The possibility of an interpretation under Article 50 would make annulment under Article 52 a disproportionate remedy to deal with ambiguities left by the tribunal\u2019s reasoning. Nor is annulment the appropriate remedy in case of omissions and technical errors in the award. Under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention a tribunal may, upon the request of a party, supplement omissions in the award and rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error.91\n\n*Wena v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 80.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT INVOKED BY THE APPLICANT**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Applicant invokes three grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n(i) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n(ii) that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(iii) that the Award failed to state the reasons upon which it was based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n115.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s complaints center around the Tribunal's findings on attribution. It summarizes the defects in the Award as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal ruled that Tulip\u2019s claims \"fall outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\" It nevertheless proceeded to address the merits. \"A decision on the merits by a tribunal that lacks competence is the most obvious example of an excess of powers.\" In this case, the excess is plainly stated within the four corners of the [Award],\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal made itself willfully blind to evidence it itself had previously determined to be material and relevant to the outcome of the dispute\u2014the testimony of Mr. Erdogan Bayraktar. The Tribunal gave the parties no indication that it would derogate from its own procedural directives. It thus deprived the parties of their right to be heard with regard to the evidence to which the Tribunal rendered itself willfully blind.\n\n\u2022 The first part of the Award dealing with attribution logically contradicts the second part of the Award dealing with the merits. The merits discussion assumes **arguendo** that the relevant actions in dispute were attributable to Turkey. The attribution discussion concludes that the actions of Tulip\u2019s contractual counterparty Emlak were not attributable to the state because Turkey\u2019s actions did not render Emlak\u2019s stated reasons for termination a mere pretext. The merits decision nevertheless concludes that Turkey\u2019s conduct did not violate the BIT because Turkey did not introduce itself into Emlak\u2019s commercial decision-making process. This conclusion is precisely foreclosed by the premise-assumed **arguendo** by the Tribunal-that the termination of the contract in question was attributable to Turkey.92\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 7. Footnotes omitted.\n\n116.\n\nThe Applicant states that these defects can be challenged under more than one of the three grounds raised. As a result of these deficiencies, it seeks annulment of the entire Award.\n\n117.\n\nThe Committee will deal with the Applicant\u2019s complaints by each category of defect pleaded: (1) the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence relating to attribution; (2) the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the merits despite lack of jurisdiction; and (3) the Award\u2019s contradictory and incomplete reasons concerning attribution.\n\n**1. The Tribunal\u2019s Treatment of Evidence Relating to Attribution**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal consciously and deliberately disregarded critical evidence on the record and therefore violated the Applicant\u2019s right to be heard and the principle of equality of arms. This is shown by the Award\u2019s lack of citation to the evidence in question and prior decisions of the Tribunal during the arbitration. The relevant evidence is the witness testimony of Minister Erdogan Bayraktar and Emlak officials at the hearing, as well as new documentary evidence produced following a request made by the Tribunal at the hearing. The evidence was of a dispositive nature and, had the majority of the Tribunal considered it, the conclusion on attribution in the Award would have been different, which would have affected both the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and the merits of the claim. Furthermore, by failing to consider the evidence, the Tribunal also failed to apply the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which formed part of the applicable law.\n\n*(i) Hearing Testimony*\n-----------------------\n\n119.\n\nMr. Erdogan Bayraktar was at all relevant times of the dispute the head of TOKI and at the same time the Chairman of the Board of Emlak during the Applicant\u2019s investment project in Turkey, and later became a minister in the Turkish government. He thus had firsthand knowledge of the project and the relationship between Emlak and TOKI. Following the Tribunal\u2019s order to call Mr. Bayraktar for examination at the hearing as the Tribunal\u2019s witness, Mr. Bayraktar provided oral testimony which went \"directly to the issue of attribution.\"93 He corroborated a statement made in a newspaper article showing that TOKI exercised its control over Emlak to terminate the Contract for the public good. He further developed on TOKEs actions with regard to Emlak\u2019s contractual counterparties.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 50.\n\n120.\n\nHowever, although the testimony was clearly relevant to the matter of attribution, as indicated in the Separate Opinion, the Majority does not discuss this evidence in the Award. According to the Applicant, \"the Tribunal turned itself willfully deaf to evidence the Tribunal knew existed precisely because the Tribunal had to concede that addressing the evidence would entail altering the outcome predetermined for the case before the evidence was presented for a hearing.\"94 The Award confirms that this evidence was ignored because it states at paragraph 322 that \"there is no evidence of any specific and disproportionate influence by Mr. Bayraktar or any instructions from TOKI to make a particular decision for an ulterior sovereign purpose,\" despite the fact that such evidence was adduced during his testimony. The Separate Opinion also confirms this, as Mr. Jaffe stated that the Majority \"all but ignores the very evidence that they say would be probative, namely the evidence found in the testimony of Erdogan Bayraktar.\"95\n\nApp. Rep. Annul., para. 36.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 61, quoting Separate Opinion, para. 6.\n\n121.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, there are only three possible valid reasons for disregarding the evidence: (i) that the Majority found Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony on attribution to be irrelevant; (ii) that the Majority found his testimony to be immaterial; or (iii) that the Majority deemed that Mr. Bayraktar was not a credible witness. However, no such implications can plausibly be drawn in this case. The Tribunal itself admitted that Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony was relevant and material to the outcome by calling him to testify over the objections of the Respondent, following a series of written and oral statements made by the Tribunal in the course of the arbitration. Several procedural orders (Nos. 2-5) dealt with Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s examination as the Tribunal's witness at the hearing pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a). According to the Applicant, the Tribunal \"would not have called Mr. Bayraktar unless it thought that he would likely have meaningful testimony to give and that this testimony would be relevant to the matters in dispute.\"96 The directions in the orders included topics of examination, *e.g.* the relationship between TOKI and Emlak, and the Emlak Board\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract. The Tribunal also found that Mr. Bayraktar was a credible witness because it accepted his testimony in connection with another matter addressed in the Award. Although the Separate Opinion pointed out the importance of the testimony to the Majority, the Majority chose to disregard the evidence without giving reasons why and without addressing the Separate Opinion.\n\nApp. Rep. Annul., para. 113.\n\n122.\n\nIn the Applicant\u2019s submission, the Tribunal also failed to consider the testimony of Emlak officials at the hearing. This testimony concerned whether or not the Emlak Board\u2019s termination decision was pretextual. The Award states that the evidentiary record did not establish that Emlak had invoked contractual breaches as a pretext for termination of the Contract; however, it contains no indication that the testimonies of Messrs. Keskin, Yetim and Kurum were considered by the Tribunal.\n\n*(ii) New Documentary Evidence*\n-------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Applicant states that the Tribunal also failed to consider new documentary evidence produced at the hearing, as well as testimony given on that evidence. The existence of the documents was disclosed during an oral testimony at the hearing, and the Tribunal decided to order the production of these documents. According to the Applicant, one of the documents - an Emlak memorandum of February 11, 2010 - showed that the termination of the Contract was pretextual. It showed that Emlak had no good-faith commercial reason for reversing its recommendation to grant a further project extension. The document was therefore relevant to the attribution analysis. However, the document and the ensuing testimony about it went entirely unacknowledged in the Award, demonstrating \"an apparent pattern of [the Tribunal] in ignoring evidence in its deliberative process.\"97\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 13.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal clearly considered the document relevant and material as it had exceptionally ordered its production, and the Award indicates that the witness who testified about it (Mr. Kurum) was a credible witness. Yet the Tribunal deliberately chose not to consider the document and the related oral testimony, thus violating the Applicant\u2019s right to be heard.\n\n*(iii) Other Defects in the Treatment of Evidence*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal also breached the principle of equality of the parties in several ways: (i) by impermissibly privileging the proceeding\u2019s written phase over its oral phase, thereby advantaging the Respondent; (ii) by failing to restore the imbalance in the equality of arms caused by the Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate in the production of evidence; and (iii) by failing to apply evidentiary burdens consistently.\n\n126.\n\nBoth parties must have an equal opportunity to present their arguments and evidence, and the right to expect that a tribunal will give equal attention to their respective submissions as to the legal import of the evidence. In the Applicant\u2019s submission, the Award appears to have privileged the pre-hearing written submissions over the parties\u2019 oral closing submissions. Since there was new evidence in favor of the Claimant\u2019s case at the hearing, this meant that the Tribunal unfairly favored the Respondent.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent violated its obligation to produce three documents in its possession or even to mention their existence prior to the hearing. The Tribunal ordered the production of these documents at the hearing. Due to the Respondent\u2019s violation, the Claimant was forced to rely to a greater degree on evidence adduced at the hearing. The Tribunal did not wish to discuss the Respondent\u2019s violation and instead assured the Claimant that it could make its case on the newly disclosed documents. These measures taken by the Tribunal at the hearing were nevertheless insufficient, as it did not even acknowledge in the Award its finding of exceptional circumstances necessitating an order that the Respondent produce the documents, and as the Tribunal ultimately ignored the evidence produced. Therefore, the Tribunal failed to restore the equality of arms between the parties.\n\n128.\n\nThe Award also demonstrates that the Majority of the Tribunal failed to apply the evidentiary burdens of proof equally and appropriately to each party with respect to attribution.\n\n*(iv) Consequences of the Treatment of Evidence*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal's jurisdictional determination must be annulled because the Tribunal committed two serious departures from a fundamental rule of procedure. First, the Tribunal failed to afford the Claimant the right to be heard with respect to evidence presented at the hearing. Second, the Tribunal\u2019s failure to hear the Claimant\u2019s evidence at the hearing also violated the principle of equality of the parties.\n\n130.\n\nThe right to be heard goes beyond a party\u2019s right to present its case, but also requires that the tribunal listen to the party\u2019s argument, that the tribunal take such argument into account in its deliberations, and, in connection with the obligation to state reasons under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(e), also requires that the award reflect the manner in which the tribunal assessed the argument and the evidence in question.98 This requires \"the right to have the possibility to present your case to be heard in an effective manner.\"99\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 31-32.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 31.\n\n131.\n\nIn this case, these fundamental rights have not been observed because the Award, including the Separate Opinion, demonstrate that testimony of Mr. Bayraktar, evidence that \"went to the heart of Claimant\u2019s case,\"100 was deliberately ignored by the Majority. If the Tribunal changed its mind about the importance of the evidence of Mr. Bayraktar, it should have given notice to the parties to allow them the opportunity to make further submissions about the change in approach.101 That was required as part of the right to a fair hearing, which has been confirmed by the Committee in *Fraport v. Philippines* and the ECtHR.102 The Tribunal\u2019s decision to ignore certain evidence presented during the hearing is \"a serious departure from the right to be heard\" because the \"evidence would have provided a critical counterweight to evidence cited on the dispositive issues before the Tribunal.\"103\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 32.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 90.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 34-36. The Applicant refers to: *Fraport v. Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 200, 202, 227, 229; and Article 6 of the ECHR.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 83.\n\n132.\n\nIn addition, the fundamental procedural requirement of equality of arms was violated when the Tribunal disregarded certain evidence presented during the hearing. The principle of equality of arms requires that one party be given the same tools available to the other party to prove their respective cases, such that the parties are on an even playing field.104 It is a tribunal\u2019s responsibility to preserve this equality of arms, and to ensure that there are consequences where one party materially derogates from its duty of cooperation. In this case, the Applicant did not have access to certain documentary and testimonial evidence that was highly relevant to the question of attribution until the hearing. By ignoring new evidence adduced during the hearing, the Tribunal privileged the written phase over the oral phase, which created an imbalance between the parties. Furthermore, the Tribunal applied evidentiary burdens differently between the parties on the question of attribution and did not make any effort to account for the Respondent\u2019s failure to cooperate in the production and presentation of evidence.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para 60.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the evidence also led to a manifest excess of powers. The Tribunal\u2019s findings on attribution led to the dismissal of the Emlak claims on jurisdictional grounds, which is apparent from paragraph 361 of the Award concluding that the claims \"fall outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\" It is well accepted by *ad hoc* committees that the non-exercise of a jurisdiction that a tribunal has can lead to an excess of powers. In this case, it is clear that the Tribunal committed an excess of power in its finding that it had no jurisdiction over the claims arising from the conduct of Emlak.\n\n134.\n\nThe excess of powers must be considered manifest under any standard of manifestness, because the willful disregard of the hearing testimony of Mr. Bayraktar was: (i) serious; (ii) self-evident; and (iii) \"no tribunal could tenably reach the conclusion that Emlak\u2019s acts were not attributable to the State after hearing and considering *all* of the evidence presented by the parties.\"105 Therefore, the Applicant argues that the attribution and jurisdiction decision of the Tribunal must be annulled as a manifest excess of powers.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 218 (emphasis in original).\n\n135.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal also failed to apply the applicable international law to its determination of attribution. The ILC Articles would have compelled the Tribunal to conclude, based on the available evidence, that the acts of Emlak in terminating the Contract were attributable to the Respondent. The question before the Tribunal as per Article 8 of the ILC Articles was \"whether Emlak was being directed, instructed or controlled by TOKI with respect to the specific activity of administering the Contract with Tulip JV in the sense of sovereign direction, instruction or control rather than the ordinary control exercised by a majority shareholder acting in the company\u2019s perceived commercial best interest.\"106 Mr. Bayraktar provided the evidence addressing this question, yet the Tribunal failed to consider it. By disregarding the evidence, the Tribunal thus failed to apply the proper law. The excess is manifest, as it is patently obvious that the Tribunal did not apply the ILC Articles.\n\nAward, para. 309 (emphasis in original).\n\n**B.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicant seeks to annul the Tribunal\u2019s factual findings on attribution. Although the Applicant is labeling the defect as one that concerns the process of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, it is really a claim that the Tribunal erred in its evaluation of the evidence. This is not a permissible ground for annulment, as annulment committees have no authority to review an ICSID tribunal\u2019s evaluation of evidence. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), it is for a tribunal to evaluate the admissibility and probative value of the evidence, and it need not comment in the award on every piece of evidence. According to the Respondent, \"[t]here are no objectively pertinent facts. There are the Tribunal's pertinent findings and it is within the Tribunal's discretion to decide what its pertinent facts are, as the Tribunal is the one and the only trier of facts.\"107\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 174.\n\n*(i) Hearing Testimony*\n-----------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal went out of its way to accommodate the Claimant by calling Mr. Bayraktar as a witness. The Respondent agrees with the Applicant that it was an unusual step to compel a sitting Government Minister to give oral evidence where no such evidence had been proffered by the State. However, if anything, this only demonstrated that the Tribunal was procedurally generous to Tulip and respected its right to be heard. The Tribunal\u2019s decision to order the examination of Mr. Bayraktar did not create any \"heightened expectation\" regarding his testimony.108 The Tribunal could not have predetermined that the evidence was relevant and material before the hearing, as it had yet to hear the evidence. Instead, it gave the Claimant the opportunity to present the evidence that the Claimant considered important on an issue that the Tribunal acknowledged was relevant and material.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 161.\n\n138.\n\nUnder the legal test prescribed by Article 8 of the ILC Articles, the Claimant needed to show that Emlak was acting on the instructions of, or under the directions or effective control of, the State (in this case TOKI) in terminating the Contract. It is clear from Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony that the Tribunal was well aware of Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s two hats (his roles in TOKI and Emlak) and that it was attentive to this evidence in connection with the issue of attribution during his testimony.109 The questions posed to Mr. Bayraktar by the counsel for the Claimant were general and did not address, *e.g.,* meetings at TOKI concerning the termination of the Contract. In fact, Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony did not show that the lines of separateness between TOKI and Emlak were all but non-existent, nor did it show any evidence of interference by TOKI in the termination decision. It showed the contrary.110 The Separate Opinion quotes the passages in Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony concerning the general relationship between TOKI and Emlak and does not speak to the specific decision to terminate the Contract.111 As a consequence, the Majority was correct that there was no evidence supporting attribution of Emlak\u2019s acts to the State.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 40-51.\n\n*Ibid.,* pp. 47-48.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n139.\n\nIn addition, it is clear from the conclusion in the Separate Opinion that the Tribunal did consider the evidence on attribution as a whole. The Separate Opinion quotes extensively from Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony and disagrees with the Majority on the issue of attribution on that basis. It is implausible to suggest that this evidence would not have been brought up by Mr. Jaffe during the Tribunal's deliberations, and the \"Tribunal must have considered it if for no other reason to determine whether it agreed with Mr. Jaffe or not.\"112 The Majority thus likely concluded that Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s oral evidence did not add anything to what was already before it on the issue of attribution and therefore did not discuss it in regard to each specific issue of attribution. The Tribunal had discretion to evaluate the evidence as it best saw fit, and that discretion cannot be subject to review.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 164.\n\n140.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant itself did not rely on Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony for its case on attribution in its closing submission at the hearing. According to the Respondent, the Claimant likely did not believe that the testimony was important for its case on attribution and cannot now put forward in the annulment proceeding an argument that it should have pleaded during the arbitration. The Applicant\u2019s conspiracy theory that the Tribunal deliberately aimed to defeat the Applicant\u2019s meritorious claim is therefore highly implausible and fails for complete lack of evidence.\n\n*(ii) New Documentary Evidence*\n-------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal gave the Claimant ample opportunity to adduce evidence and make submissions in relation to the three documents produced and translated during the course of the hearing, including recalling two witnesses to testify about the additional documents. The fact that the Tribunal did not specifically mention one of the documents in the Award does not signify that the Tribunal did not consider the evidence, but, even if that were the case, there is no obligation on the Tribunal to cite every piece of evidence on the record. In any event, failure by a tribunal to consider any one piece of evidence is insufficient to amount to an annullable error.\n\n142.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence that the Respondent violated its disclosure obligations by withholding the three documents during the document production phase. This oversight, which was rectified during the hearing, cannot come close to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*(iii) Other Defects in the Treatment of Evidence*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the procedural history as described by the Applicant itself shows that the Tribunal went out of its way to accommodate the Claimant and hear its case, both before and at the hearing. Therefore, the Applicant\u2019s argument that there was an imbalance in the equality of arms between the parties that the Tribunal failed to restore is spurious. Even if the Tribunal had privileged the written phase over the oral phase of the proceeding, such \"privileging\" could not amount to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. However, even if it did, a tribunal has the discretion to evaluate the evidence in whichever format it is presented, whether written or oral.\n\n*(iv) Consequences of the Treatment of Evidence*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there cannot be either full or partial annulment under any of the grounds for annulment invoked with regard to the treatment of evidence in the proceedings. The Respondent also refutes the Applicant\u2019s argument that the grounds could be cumulated. This is not permissible under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which provides alternative grounds for annulment. According to the Respondent, \"[a] committee cannot find that the complaint has some merit under one ground and a bit more merit under another ground and therefore arrive at a fully justified complete ground of annulment.\"113 Even if the Committee decided to annul the Tribunal\u2019s findings on attribution, the decision on the merits would stand because Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony was of no relevance to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the merits.114\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 60.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 64.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that a breach of the fundamental right to be heard in the proceedings would be a ground for annulment.115 The Committee accepts that the lack of a fair hearing would be a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure under the ICSID Convention. The right to a fair hearing encompasses a number of matters. In the present case, the focus is on three particular aspects of a fair hearing, namely, the right to be heard, the principle of equality of arms and the duty to give reasons.\n\n*Fraport v. Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 197 *et seq.*\n\n146.\n\nThe disagreement between the parties concerns the content of the right to be heard in the factual circumstance of this case. The ECtHR has recognized \"equality of arms\" as an important component of the right to a fair trial. The requirement is that \"each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case - including his evidence - under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent.\"116\n\n*Dombo Beheer BVv. Netherlands,* ECtHR, App. No. 1448/88, Merits and Just Satisfaction, October 27.1993, para. 33.\n\n147.\n\nInitially, when the Claimant wanted to cross examine Mr. Bayraktar, it wanted the Respondent to produce him as a witness. It was only because the Respondent declined to do so that the Tribunal, in order to allow the Claimant to advance its case, decided in its Procedural Order No. 2 to treat him as the Tribunal's own witness. The Committee rejects the suggestion that, in admitting the evidence of Mr. Bayraktar in this way, the Tribunal was making any indication at all of the relevance or importance of this evidence. It was simply ensuring equality of arms and holding the ring between the parties. Moreover, this Committee cannot conclude merely from the fact that fairness led the Tribunal to admit Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s evidence that, having heard his evidence and his thorough cross examination by the Claimant, the Tribunal was then obliged to conclude that his evidence was material to the Tribunal's decision. The Majority had the discretion to determine that the evidence was not material and, although it might have been helpful had they expressly said so, the Committee does not consider that the failure to do so is itself grounds to annul the Award.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal is required to consider all the evidence before it and reach its own conclusions as to which evidence is material to the findings it has to make and which is not. The Tribunal heard evidence from a total of 17 witnesses, including Mr. Bayraktar, but it referred only to the oral evidence of two of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses and two of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses in its ruling, as set out in the table below:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Name** | **Affiliation** | **Dealt with in the Award?** |\n| Minister Erdogan Bayraktar | Called by the Tribunal | Yes - his oral evidence is referred to in the majority decision at para. 406 but in relation to the zoning issue. His oral evidence is considered in the Separate Opinion at paras. 4.6 and 8. |\n| Mr. Meyer Benitah | Claimant\u2019s Representative and Witness | Yes - Section D: Claims asserted on behalf of Mr. Benitah; and para. 399(3). |\n| Mr. Burak Erten | Claimant\u2019s Witness | | ********No -********  reference is made to witness statement (paras. 241, 384(4)) but not oral testimony. |\n| Mr. Erik Esveld | Claimant\u2019s Witness | | ********No -********  reference is made to witness statement (paras. 73, 126, 185, 186, 443) but not oral testimony. |\n| Mr. John Anderson | Claimant\u2019s Expert | | ********No -********  no mention at all, except briefly on procedural history (para. 32). No treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. |\n| Dr. Jose Alberro | Claimant\u2019s Expert | | ********No -********  again no mention at all, except briefly on procedural history (paras. 21, |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | 32, 50). No treatment of evidence - oral or written - whatsoever. |\n| Prof. Metin Gunday | Claimant\u2019s Expert | Yes - para. 260 only briefly. Reference to Legal Opinion (paras. 235(3), 238, 308). |\n| Mr. Ertan Yetim | Respondent\u2019s Witness | | | | | ****************No -****************  reference to witness statement only (paras. 97, 114, 272, 406). |\n| Mr. Murat Kurum | Respondent\u2019s Witness | | | | | **Yes** -paras. 143, 160, 319, 322. |\n| Mr. ibrahim Keskin | Respondent\u2019s Witness | | | | | Yes - para. 165; also reference to witness statements (paras. 63, 96). |\n| Mr. Ekim Alptekin | Respondent\u2019s Witness | | | | | ****************No -****************  no treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. | | | | | |\n| Mr. Enver Bulut | Respondent\u2019s Witness | | | | | ****************No -****************  no treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. | | | | | |\n| Mr. Ender Ethem Atay | Respondent\u2019s Expert | | | | | ****************No -****************  reference only to Joint Legal Expert Report (para. 288); Legal Opinion (para. 406). |\n| Mr. Nicolas Barsalou | Respondent\u2019s Expert | | | | | ****************No -****************  no treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. | | | | | |\n| Mr. Erik van Duijvenvoorde | Respondent\u2019s Expert | | | | | ****************No -****************  no treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. | | | | | |\n| Mr. Herv\u00e9 de Trogoff | Respondent\u2019s Expert | | | | | ****************No -****************  no treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. | | | | | |\n| Mr. Chris Ives | Respondent\u2019s Expert | | | | | ****************No -****************  no treatment of evidence, oral or written, whatsoever. | | | | | |\n\n149.\n\nThe Committee considers that the lack of reference to the oral evidence of both parties is not a dereliction of the Tribunal\u2019s duty to act fairly by respecting the right to be heard and ensuring equality of arms, but is in fact an illustration of exercising its judicial function of choosing which evidence it finds relevant and which it does not. The Committee cannot accept the Applicant\u2019s allegation that the Tribunal ignored the oral testimony of Emlak officials that the Emlak Board\u2019s decision to terminate the Contract was pretextual. This allegation rather reveals the disagreement of the Applicant with the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of evidence and its conclusion that \"[i]t is not established by the evidentiary record that Emlak invoked alleged breaches as a pretext\"117 for termination of the Contract in the pursuit of State interest. Accordingly, the Committee rejects the Applicant\u2019s argument that the failure to address all the factual matters dealt with in oral evidence must in itself lead to the Award being annulled as a breach of the obligation to ensure a fair hearing.\n\nAward, para. 318.\n\n150.\n\nSimilar considerations also apply to the fact that the Tribunal has not referred in its reasoning to one of the three documents it ordered the Respondent at the hearing to produce, namely, an Emlak Memorandum of February 11, 2010. When a tribunal orders the production of a document, it does so on the assumption that it *may* be relevant to the issues in dispute. It is only after having received it, and having heard the arguments of the parties, that, in the exercise of its discretionary power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), it evaluates its probative value. The Tribunal received the February 11, 2010 Memorandum during the hearing. There is no doubt that it was aware of it and its content, as it had been discussed during the cross-examination of Mr. Kurum. The fact that the Tribunal does not refer to it specifically in its reasoning implies that it did not consider it to be material. As mentioned in paragraph 83 above, failure to explain what the Tribunal thinks about that document may be unwise, but does not amount to a violation of the right to be heard.\n\n151.\n\nThe second criticism directed at the Tribunal in relation to the oral evidence of Mr. Bayraktar is that the Tribunal, by failing to refer to it, failed in its duty to give reasons for its Award. A contrast is made with the Separate Opinion, which does address Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s evidence.\n\n152.\n\nThe obligation for tribunals to give reasons for their decisions arises out of the overriding duty to afford the parties a fair hearing, guaranteed in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i), and reiterated in numerous decisions of ICSID *ad hoc* committees. In *Ruiz Torija v. Spain,* the ECtHR stated:\n\nThe Court reiterates that Article 6(1) [of the ECHR] obliges the Courts to give reasons for their judgments, but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the Courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a Court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 of the Convention, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case.118\n\n*Ruiz Torija v. Spain,* ECtHR App. No. 18390/91, A/303-A, Merits and Just Satisfaction, December 9, 1994, para. 29.\n\n153.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Committee that these broad parameters apply equally to international tribunals constituted under the ICSID Convention. The depth and extent of the duty to give reasons will inevitably vary from one case to another. The duty is contextually sensitive and a tribunal's reasons need not be extensive as long as its decision makes sense and enables the parties to know the strengths and weaknesses of their respective cases.\n\n154.\n\nMr. Jaffe, in his Separate Opinion, formed the view that, as a \"practical matter,\" the decision to terminate the Ispartakule III Contract was taken at the direction of TOKI, and hence the State, for the purposes of Article 8 of the ILC Articles. He refers to Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s oral evidence at the hearing, particularly the fact that, throughout his oral evidence, Mr. Bayraktar spoke not about Emlak\u2019s interest and purpose, but about TOKI\u2019s.119 He then concludes that Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s testimony shows that TOKI\u2019s sovereign interests drove the termination.120\n\nSeparate Opinion, paras. 4, 6, citing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 25, 34, 52 -53.\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 8.\n\n155.\n\nIt is regrettable that the Majority does not address this divergence of view in terms, but it does make findings on the issue at paragraphs 324 to 326 of the Award.\n\n156.\n\nThis disagreement between the Tribunal Members is a disagreement about evaluating the evidence, and about the logic applied in answering the question of attribution and in the reasoning of the conclusion reached by the Majority, as is shown in paragraphs 9 to 11 of the Separate Opinion. Mr. Jaffe criticises the Majority\u2019s conclusion made in paragraphs 324 to 326 of the Award that, because there were commercially viable grounds for the termination, there was no basis for attributing the acts of Emlak to the State.\n\n157.\n\nMr. Jaffe states:\n\nThat approach answers the first question (whether the acts of Emlak are to be attributed to the State) by answering the second question (whether the decision to terminate was based on commercially viable grounds).121\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 9.\n\n158.\n\nHowever, he goes on to conclude that, although he would answer the first question differently from his colleagues, he agrees with their conclusion on the second question and therefore there was not sufficient proof offered to find a violation of the BIT.122\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 11.\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee will further address below the disagreement between the Majority and the Separate Opinion as a matter of law, but in relation to the separate criticism that the Majority\u2019s failure to address Mr. Bayraktar\u2019s evidence - and Mr. Jaffe\u2019s findings based upon such failure - in the Award itself is a breach of the obligation to give reasons, the Committee concludes that the Award gives sufficient reasons for the parties, and particularly the Applicant, to be able to understand why the Majority reached the decision it did on attribution. Accordingly, the Committee rejects this criticism of the Award as well.\n\n160.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that it cannot uphold the Applicant\u2019s request that it annul the Award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, as there has been no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by the Tribunal in the original proceeding.\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Determination on the Merits Despite Alleged Lack of Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the parties agree that the tribunals core holding concerned attribution and that \"the Tribunal could have exercised judicial economy and ended its reasoning after paragraph 327 of the Award, but only as far as the acts of Emlak were concerned.\"123 The central issue therefore concerns how the Award addresses jurisdiction and the merits. If a tribunal dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds, the natural consequence is that any following decision on the merits is either *obiter dicta* or a clear excess of powers.124 A Tribunal's exercise of a jurisdiction that does not exist has been recognized as the \"most obvious example\" of a manifest excess of powers.125\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 72, quoting Resp. C-Mem. Annul., para. 55.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 74.\n\nApp. Rep. Annul., para. 159, citing *C. Schreuer with L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair,* The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, p. 943, para. 155 (2009).\n\n162.\n\nIn this case, it is clear from paragraph 327 of the Award that Section VI, entitled \"Attribution,\" dismissed claims arising from the conduct of Emlak on jurisdictional grounds because the Majority had determined that Emlak\u2019s conduct was not attributable to the State. According to Applicant, it is also apparent from paragraphs 358 and 361 of the Award that Section VII of the Award, entitled \"Treaty Versus Contract Claims,\" dismissed claims relating to Emlak\u2019s conduct on jurisdictional grounds, because of the close link with the attribution decision in Section VI.126 Having decided that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the Emlak claims, the Tribunal nevertheless proceeded to analyze the merits of these claims in Section VIII, entitled \"Claimant\u2019s Claims,\" and dismissed the claims on the merits. In doing so, the Tribunal exercised a power that it did not have over the treaty claims that were based on the acts of Emlak, and therefore committed an annullable error.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 76-77.\n\n163.\n\nAlternatively, the Tribunal\u2019s determinations in Section VIII must be considered to be merely *obiter dicta* without any legal effect. The Applicant states that, in such case, this portion of the Award \"cannot be given any kind of residual legal effect in this or any other proceeding, and must be disregarded by the annulment committee in its entirety.\"127 In other words, Section VIII could not amount to a separate and independent ground for dismissal of the claims.128\n\nApp. Rep. Annul., para. 166.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 77.\n\n164.\n\nThe Applicant argues that Sections VI, VII and VIII of the Award are inexorably linked, meaning that, if the Committee decides to annul the Tribunal\u2019s decision on attribution, it must proceed to annul the entirety of the Award.\n\n**B.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Applicant\u2019s characterization of the findings on attribution as pertaining only to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. According to the Respondent, the Award indicates that the conclusion on attribution not only affected jurisdiction, but also supported the dismissal of the claims on the merits.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the Emlak claims on three independent grounds in Sections VI-VII and was fully entitled to do so. There were many reasons why it made sense for the Tribunal to consider all of the alternative arguments advanced by the parties, as is shown by the structure of the Award. The first reason is that the parties\u2019 arguments were linked. The second reason is that the Tribunal needed to consider claims of BIT breaches of actors other than Emlak, which it did in Section VIII. Third, the questions of attribution and treaty versus contract claims, were, as admitted by the Tribunal, intimately linked with the merits.129 Fourth, it was clear that the Award was structured with the desire to achieve a unanimous decision.130 The Respondent states that, although the Tribunal could have stopped at paragraph 327 with regard to the acts of Emlak, there was a clear logic and aptness of the Award\u2019s structure, and judicial propriety in this case militated in favor of addressing all three independent grounds for dismissing the Emlak claims.\n\nResp. C-Mem. Annul., para. 58.\n\nResp. Rej. Annul., para. 48.\n\n167.\n\nEven though the question of attribution was linked to the merits, the Respondent submits that lack of attribution was a finding relevant to both jurisdiction and merits. The issue affects the competence of a tribunal as well as whether a State is responsible for an internationally wrongful act *(i.e.* whether the claim has merit). The Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Emlak claims were outside of its jurisdiction was therefore not the end of the matter. Indeed, \"[t]he finding of no attribution of the acts constituting the alleged breaches was in and of itself a finding on the merits.\"131 Previous tribunals faced with similar situations have all concluded that the issue of attribution is one also pertaining to the merits and have structured their awards as the Tribunal did in this case.132 In four cases, the tribunals also considered whether there would have been a treaty breach if the acts had been attributable to the State.133 The Tribunal in this case thus followed a line of consistent jurisprudence on this matter.\n\nResp. Rej. Annul., para. 36.\n\nResp. Rej. Annul., paras. 51-55, referring *to* *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Award, August 27, 2008; *Homester v. Ghana,* Award, June 18, 2010; *Bosh International, Inc. AndB&P, LTD Foreign Investments Enterprise v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/11), Award, October 25, 2013 *(\"Bosh v. Ukraine\");* *Ulysseas, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Award, June 12, 2012 *(\"Ulysseas v. Ecuador\");* *Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v. Republic of Tajikistan* (SCC Case No. V (064/2008)), Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, September 2, 2009.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 53.\n\n168.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its power by exercising a jurisdiction that it did not have. The Applicant has failed to show both that there is an excess of powers, and that the excess is manifest, meaning that the \"excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.\"134\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 154, quoting *Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on the Application for Annulment, June 5, 2007, para. 40.\n\n169.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that no matter what happens to the findings on attribution, the Award must stand. The principle of severability prescribes that only the parts of the Award which are tainted by an annullable error can be annulled. Even if the Committee annulled the Tribunal\u2019s findings on attribution with regard to the Emlak claims, the alternative grounds under which those claims were dismissed must stand. The Award\u2019s *dispositif leaves* no doubt that the claims would have been dismissed even if the Tribunal had found in favor of the Claimant on attribution. In other words, the Applicant can at most achieve a partial annulment of the Award.\n\n170.\n\nThe Applicant submits fundamentally contradictory grounds for annulment with regard to manifest excess of powers. On the one hand, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to exercise a jurisdiction that it had when it disregarded evidence and, as a result, concluded that it had no jurisdiction over the Emlak claims. On the other hand, the Applicant also argues that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction when it considered the merits. However, in order to succeed in annulling the full Award, the Applicant must show that both the jurisdictional and the merits findings amount to annullable errors.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal devoted to the issue of attribution a separate chapter in its Award, Chapter VI, which follows Chapter V, titled \"Jurisdiction and Admissibility.\" The latter chapter deals with the issue of whether the Claimant made an \"investment\" in Turkey for the purposes of Article 1(b) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, concluding that the Tribunal was \"satisfied that the Claimant\u2019s principal claim arises out of an \u2018investment\u2019 for the purposes of the BIT.\"135 The other issue which the Tribunal considered in this chapter, namely whether the claims asserted on behalf of Mr. Benitah, and the conclusion reached therein that such claims were inadmissible in the proceedings instituted by Tulip,136 are of no relevance in the context of this annulment proceeding, as the Tribunal's conclusion on this point was not challenged by the Applicant.\n\nAward, para. 208.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 231, point 2 of the *dispositif.*\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal has not discussed the issue of attribution in the chapter on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, but rather dealt with it in a separate chapter. The Tribunal itself provides an explanation for this approach when it opines that \"[t]he issue of attribution relates both to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to the merits of the dispute.\"137 The Tribunal was inspired by the approach to the question of attribution adopted by the Tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana,* describing that approach as \"appropriate\"138 and expressly agreeing with it.139 The Tribunal in *Hamester* expressed the view that \"[t]he question whether the issue of attribution is, in a given case, one of jurisdiction or of merits is not susceptible of a clear-cut answer.\"140\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 276.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 277.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 279.\n\n*Hamester v. Ghana,* para. 140.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal quoted in full three of the paragraphs of the ****Hamester**** Award.141 It is worth noting that, in the quoted paragraphs, the ****Hamester**** Tribunal did not directly characterize the issue of attribution as one which goes to jurisdiction, despite considering that issue in the context of Ghana\u2019s second \"jurisdictional objection\" based on non-attribution, which rested on an analysis of the different acts complained of. The Tribunal in ****Hamester**** was more nuanced, stating that \"the question of attribution looks more like a jurisdictional question.\"142 It explained that \"in many instances, questions of attribution and questions of legality are closely intermingled, and it is then difficult to deal with the question of attribution without a full enquiry into the merits.\"143 In the end, the ****Hamester**** Tribunal adopted a pragmatic approach, as is apparent from its noting that \"as a practical matter, this question is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship between certain acts and the State.\"144\n\nAward, para. 277, quoting *Hamester v. Ghana,* Award, June 18, 2010, paras. 143-145.\n\nAward, para. 277, quoting *Hamester v. Ghana,* Award, June 18, 2010, para. 143.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* quoting *Hamester v. Ghana,* Award, June 18, 2010, para. 144.\n\n174.\n\nThis is thus the approach which inspired the Tribunal in the original *Tulip v. Turkey* proceeding and which has been adopted by a number of other tribunals, a trend identified by the Respondent when referring to, *inter alia, Bosh v. Ukraine* and *Ulysseas v. Ecuador.145*\n\nResp. C-Mem. Annul, para. 62, quoting *Bosh v. Ukraine,* Award, October 25, 2013 and *Ulysseas v. Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Award, June 12, 2012.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal expressed its view that attribution was relevant, in the context of the case it had to deal with, for two reasons: first, for \"ascertaining whether there [was] a dispute with a Contracting State, here Turkey, for the purposes of the BIT and Art 25 of the ICSID Convention,\" and second, because in its view, \"the claims presented in this investment arbitration (particularly with respect to the conduct of Emlak) may only succeed if they are attributable to the State.\" The Tribunal continued by stating that \"[i]n that sense, the issue of attribution is also relevant to the merits of the dispute.\"146\n\nAward, para. 276.\n\n176.\n\nThe Committee questions whether attribution is really relevant to ascertaining the existence of a dispute between Tulip and Turkey. Article 8 of the BIT, which is about the settlement of disputes between investors of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, defines an investment dispute:\n\n[A]s a dispute involving:\n\n(a) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by a Contracting Party\u2019s foreign investment authority to an investor of the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(b) a breach of any right conferred or created by this [BIT] with respect to an investment.147\n\nArt. 8(1) of the BIT.\n\n177.\n\nThus, a dispute to which the dispute settlement procedures under Article 8 of the BIT apply must be one falling within the scope of this definition. There is nothing in that definition about attribution. Attribution may be relevant in the context of enquiring whether there was a breach of an obligation under the BIT, but that pertains to the merits of a case, as the Tribunal was fully aware when it stated that \"the issue of attribution [was] also relevant to the merits of the dispute.\"148\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n178.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention, to which the Tribunal referred in its explanation as to why it was necessary to consider the issue of attribution for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of a dispute, opens Chapter II of the ICSID Convention, which is entitled \"Jurisdiction of the Centre.\" It provides that:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the Parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\n\n179.\n\nAgain, no specific mention is made of attribution in relation to disputes which may fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre. Such dispute shall be a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment and shall involve a national of a State Party to the ICSID Convention and another State (or its designated agency or constituent subdivision) which is a Party to the Convention.\n\n180.\n\nThere is no specific definition of the term \"dispute\" either in the BIT or in the ICSID Convention. When interpreting that term, in accordance with Article 31 (3)(c) of the VCLT, \"there shall be taken into account [... ] [a]ny relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Parties.\" As the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") stated, there is:\n\n[...] established case law on that matter, beginning with the frequently quoted statement by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* case in 1924: \"A dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"149\n\nThe ICJ, on several occasions, stressed that for a dispute to exist, \"[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other.\"150\n\n*Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, *I.C.J. Reports 2011* (1), April 1, 2011, p. 84, para. 30, referencing the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* case, *Judgment No. 2 1924, P. C.I.J. Series A, No. 2,* p. 11.\n\n*South West Africa Cases (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v. South Africa),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, *I.C.J. Reports 1962,* December 21, 1962, p. 328; *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application:* *2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda),* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, *I. C.J. Reports 2006,* December 19, 2005, p. 40, para. 90.\n\n181.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Tribunal was seised of the dispute in which Tulip\u2019s claim was positively opposed by Turkey. Tulip advanced the claim that Turkey breached several of its obligations under the BIT, the alleged breaches having been specified in the Request for Arbitration and then subsequently throughout the written and oral phases of the proceeding. The Tribunal, in its chapter on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, satisfied itself that \"the Claimant\u2019s principal claim arises out of an \u2018investment\u2019 for the purposes of the BIT.\"151\n\nAward, para. 208.\n\n182.\n\nThe Committee notes that, although the Tribunal announced that its inquiry into the issue of attribution would be relevant in order to ascertain whether there is a dispute with Turkey for the purposes of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it did not expressly state its conclusion on this question. Rather, it focused on attribution for purposes of determining whether the impugned conduct of Emlak was attributable to Turkey because, as it correctly stated, the claims with respect to Emlak\u2019s conduct \"may only succeed if they are attributable to the State.\"152\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 276.\n\n183.\n\nAttribution is a concept elaborated upon in the context of State responsibility. The ILC considered it to be one of the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State. Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which codifies customary international law,153 is entitled *Elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State* and provides that:\n\nThere is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission:\n\n(a) is attributable to the State under international law; and\n\n(b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\n\nSee e.g., *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/04/5), Award, November 21, 2007, para. 275.\n\n184.\n\nBoth elements have to be established in order to reach a conclusion that an internationally wrongful act of a State has been committed. If one of the elements is missing, there is no international wrongful act, and responsibility of a State cannot be engaged. In the words of the ILC Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility (\"ILC Commentary\" or \"Commentary\"), attribution of the conduct of a person, organ, institution or entity to the State under international law means that \"conduct consisting of an act or omission or a series of acts or omissions is to be considered as the conduct of the State.\"154 International law contains rules on attribution which the ILC codified and developed in Chapter II of its Articles on State Responsibility (Articles 4-11). The ILC Commentary explains, \"[t]he attribution of conduct to the State as a subject of international law is based on criteria determined by international law and not on the mere recognition of a link of factual causality.\"155 As the last Special Rapporteur of the ILC for State responsibility wrote, \"[t]he process of attribution as stated in Article 2 reflects a conception of attribution that is essentially normative.\"156 The term \"attribution\" refers \"to the body of criteria of connection and the conditions which have to be fulfilled, according to the relevant principles of international law, in order to conclude that it is a State [...] which has acted in the particular case.\"157\n\nCommentary to Chapter II, Yearbook of the ILC, 2001, Volume II, Part Two, p. 38, para. 1.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 4.\n\n*J. Crawford,* State Responsibility, The General Part, Cambridge University Press, p. 113 (2013).\n\n*L. Condorelli & C. Kress,* The Rules on Attribution: General Consideration, in: The Law of International Responsibility *(J. Crawford, A. Pellet, S. Olleson,* eds.), Oxford University Press, 221 (2010).\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal applied the relevant criteria for ascertaining whether the conduct of Emlak, which formed the basis of the Claimant\u2019s complaint in the original proceeding (in particular the termination of the Contract), was attributable to Turkey. The Tribunal analysed all three of the ILC Articles on which the Claimant relied, namely Articles 4 (conduct of organs of a State), 5 (conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority) and 8 (conduct directed or controlled by a State). After a thorough analysis, the Tribunal reached the unanimous conclusion that \"Emlak is not a \u2018state organ\u2019 within the meaning of Art 4 [of the] ILC Articles\"158 and therefore Emlak\u2019s conduct could not be attributed to Turkey on that basis. Likewise, the Tribunal reached the unanimous conclusion that \"the evidence on the record does not show that Emlak exercises any governmental power within the meaning of Art 5 [of the] ILC Articles.\"159 These conclusions are not challenged by the Applicant.\n\nAward, para. 291.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 300.\n\n186.\n\nWhat is challenged is the Majority\u2019s conclusion on attribution under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. Mr. Jaffe attached his Separate Opinion on this question, which consisted of some 11 paragraphs, but noted expressly \"that [his] separate views do not affect the outcome of the proceedings.\"160\n\nSeparate Opinion, p. 1.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal devoted the major part of its analysis of attribution, some 26 paragraphs,161 to Article 8. The Tribunal, in interpreting Article 8, took into account the ILC Commentary, as is demonstrated by a longer quote in paragraph 306 of the Award. The fact that a company or enterprise is State-owned or controlled is not sufficient to attribute its conduct to the State, as the quoted passage from the Commentary makes clear. Rather, the conduct of a corporate entity has been attributed to the State when \"the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation *specifically* in order to achieve a *particular* result.\"162\n\nAward, paras. 301-326.\n\nILC Commentary to Article 8, para. 6 (emphasis added), quoted in the Award, para. 306. The ILC referred to the jurisprudence of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. See *J. Crawford,* The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentary, Cambridge University Press, p. 113, fn. 174 (2002).\n\n188.\n\nRelying thus on Article 8 and its Commentary, the Tribunal stated that:\n\n[T]he relevant enquiry remains whether Emlak was being directed, instructed or controlled by TOKI with respect to the specific activity of administering the Contract with Tulip JV in the sense of sovereign direction, instruction or control rather than the ordinary control exercised by a majority shareholder in the company\u2019s perceived commercial best interests.163\n\nAward, para. 309 (emphasis in the original).\n\n189.\n\nThe Committee has no doubt that the Tribunal correctly interpreted Article 8 of the ILC Articles and applied the relevant test, that of effective control.164 Whether the evidence adduced by the Claimant satisfied that test was for the Tribunal to evaluate. According to Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, \"[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.\" It is not for this Committee to re-evaluate the evidence presented in the original proceedings.\n\nMr. Jaffe also agreed that this was the relevant test. Separate Opinion, p. 1, point 2.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal, having considered the evidence, reached the conclusion that:\n\n[... ] while Emlak was subj ect to TOKE s corporate and managerial control, Emlak\u2019s conduct with respect to the execution, maintenance and termination of the Contract [was] not attributable to the State under Art. 8 of the ILC Articles due to an absence of proof that the State used its control as a vehicle directed towards achieving a particular result in its sovereign interests.165\n\nAward, para. 326.\n\n191.\n\nIn the subsequent paragraph, which perhaps could have been visually more clearly separated from the paragraphs on attribution under Article 8, the Tribunal summarized its overall conclusion on attribution - that is on attribution under all three Articles (4, 5 and 8) on which the Claimant relied - as follows: \"the Tribunal therefore determines by majority that Emlak\u2019s conduct with respect to the Contract and the Ispartakule III Project is not attributable to the Turkish State.\"166 The Tribunal continued with the following final statement, that Emlak\u2019s conduct was \"on that basis, outside of the remit of the Tribunal.\"167\n\nAward, para. 327.\n\n*Ibid.* The same term \"remit\" is used by the Tribunal in paragraph 231 when concluding its consideration of whether the claims on behalf of Mr. Benitah were admissible. Having concluded that the Claimant cannot prosecute Mr. Benitah\u2019s claims as his attorney, it stated that \"[t]here is no obvious bar to Mr. Benitah initiating his claims as an investor within Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, but that possibility does not fall within the Tribunal\u2019s remit.\"\n\n192.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT uses the term \"remit.\" The English Oxford Dictionary defines the term as \"the referring or consignment of a matter to some other person or authority for settlement,\" \"the transfer of a case from one Court or judge to another\" or as \"an area of authority\" frequently used as part of the expression \"within (also beyond, etc.) one\u2019s remit.\"168\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press (1989).\n\n193.\n\nIt seems that the Tribunal meant \"competence\" or \"jurisdiction\" when using the term \"remit.\" That impression is strengthened by considerations of the Tribunal in the following chapter, Chapter VII, entitled \"Treaty versus Contract Claims.\"\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal expressed the view that \"it is difficult in this case clearly to separate the issue of attribution from the question of whether the claims presented by the Claimant arise from the BIT.\"169 Having recalled its conclusions on Articles 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles, it stated that \"[t]he Tribunal\u2019s finding that Emlak\u2019s conduct is properly characterised as contractual in nature, in the context of attribution, informs its determination that the claims asserted by the Claimant with respect to Emlak\u2019s conduct may not properly be characterised as treaty claims.\"170\n\nAward, para. 358.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 359.\n\n195.\n\nAs the Tribunal was of the view that \"none of the claims presented by the Claimant with respect to the conduct of Emlak are amenable to be characterised by the Tribunal as arising out of the BIT,\" it stated that \"[a]ccordingly, they fall outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"171\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 361.\n\n196.\n\nThe Committee is thus fully aware that the Tribunal used the expressions that Emlak\u2019s conduct was \"outside the remit of the Tribunal\" or that the claims with respect to the conduct of Emlak \"fall outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\" The Tribunal, however, in the dispositive part of the Award, did not rule that it was without jurisdiction to consider the Claimant\u2019s claims relating to Emlak\u2019s conduct. After ruling that, \"[b]y majority, the acts of Emlak are not attributable to Turkey,\" the Tribunal decided \"[u]nanimously\" that, in any event, the acts of Emlak do not constitute breaches of the BIT.\"172\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 138.\n\n197.\n\nArticle 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he Award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\" In the view of the Committee, it is the dispositive part of the Award that is binding on the parties. This is a part in which a tribunal authoritatively rules on the submissions of the parties, either on jurisdictional or merits submissions, following its consideration of the parties\u2019 evidence and arguments in the reasoning part of its Decision/Award. The ICJ, in relation to its Judgments, stated that \"[t]he operative part of a Judgment of the Court possesses the force of *res judicata \"173*\n\n*Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro),* Judgement, *I.C.J. Reports 2007,* February 26, 2007, p. 94, para. 123.\n\n198.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal has made several findings, or, to use the Tribunal's terminology, \"determinations,\" in the dispositive part, namely:\n\n1. The Claimant has made an investment into Turkey within the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n2. The claims of Mr Benitah are inadmissible.\n\n3. By majority, the acts of Emlak are not attributable to Turkey.\n\n4. Unanimously, and in any event, the acts of Emlak do not constitute breaches of the BIT.\n\n5. Also unanimously, the acts of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Turkish police and Turkish government officials are attributable to Turkey but do not constitute breaches of the BIT.174\n\nNone of them constitutes a finding that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to consider Tulip\u2019s claims. Therefore, in the Committee\u2019s view, one cannot conclude that when the Tribunal made the determination that \"the Claimant\u2019s claims are dismissed,\" it would have exceeded its powers, even less so manifestly. This was not \"a jurisdictional dismissal\"175 of the claims, but a dismissal after having considered the merits. The Tribunal was entitled to that course of action.\n\nAward, p. 138.\n\nApp. Rep. Annul., para. 157.\n\n199.\n\nMoreover, Tulip alleged in the original arbitration proceeding that Turkey breached its obligations under the BIT by the conduct of \"various state actors such as TOKI, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the police, and the Supreme Audit Board.\"176 The Tribunal, noting agreement between the parties that \"these allegations plainly involve action by State organs which would be attributable to the State,\"177 considered that \"these [were] plainly assertions about the conduct of state entities in the performance of their state functions.\"178 As these claims relating to the conduct of the above-mentioned State entities were \"properly within the Tribunal's jurisdiction,\"179 the Tribunal was under a duty to consider these claims on the merits and to reach conclusions on them. This is what the Tribunal did in Chapter VIII of its Award titled \"[t]he Claimant\u2019s Claims.\"\n\nAward, para. 334, referring to Claimant\u2019s Reply, para. 320.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 328.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 363.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 368.\n\n200.\n\nIt is true that in that Chapter, the Tribunal also considered the claims based on Emlak\u2019s conduct which, as it earlier determined, was not attributable to Turkey.180 As Tulip\u2019s claims were treaty claims alleging the breach of obligations under the BIT, such obligations could have been breached only by Turkey, through acts of its State organs or other entities the conduct of which is attributable to it, as obligations under an inter-State treaty can be breached only by a Party to it.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 327.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal was thus correct when it stated, in respect of the claims based on Emlak\u2019s conduct, that those claims \"must fail.\"181 Although economy in drafting would have justified the Tribunal to disregard these claims when it considered the claims on their merit, the Tribunal was under no duty to proceed in such manner. It proceeded to consider these claims on the assumption that Emlak\u2019s conduct was attributable to Turkey.182 This approach allowed the Tribunal to \"double-check\" its conclusion resulting in the unanimous dismissal of Tulip\u2019s claims.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 366.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 367. The Tribunal was rather imprecise when it formulated its assumption that these claims in respect of Emlak\u2019s conduct \"could be characterised as treaty *claims attributable* to the Respondent\" (emphasis added). It is the conduct which is attributable, not the claims.\n\n202.\n\nIn view of the above, the Committee has to reject the Applicant\u2019s submission that the Award be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention on the ground that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n**3. Award\u2019s Contradictory and Incomplete Reasons**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the attribution portion of the Award fails to state the reasons upon which it is based. According to the Applicant, the Majority\u2019s conclusions that Emlak\u2019s conduct was not attributable to the State because TOKI did not \"instruct\u2019 or \"direct\" Emlak is unmotivated. The Tribunal explained the relevant question before it as follows:\n\n*[W]hether TOKI exercised effective control* over Emlak and thereby enforced public policy in the administration and termination of the Contract *or whether any aspect* of the administration and termination of the Contract *was performed under the instructions or direction of TOKI* in an exercise of sovereign power.183\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 174., quoting Award, para. 305, (emphasis added).\n\n204.\n\nThe Applicant complains that the Majority only analyzed the first of the questions and paid no attention to the \"instructions\" and \"direction\" elements. Resolution of these two issues was necessary in order to be able to reach a decision that attribution under Article 8 of the ILC Articles had not been established. The Award only includes cursory references concerning these elements in its paragraphs 311, 313 and 322. Because the standards for these elements were not defined, the Majority\u2019s conclusion that they were not established is wholly unmotivated.\n\n205.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal's reasoning on the two elements of Article 8 of the ILC Articles on attribution is impossible to reconstruct. Although the Tribunal found that there was some evidence of \"effective control,\"184 it went on to conclude that there was \"no basis\" to infer that the decision was taken under the control of TOKI and \"no evidence\" of any specific influence or instruction.185 In the Applicant\u2019s view, the Award contradicts itself by stating that there was \"some limited evidence\" of effective control while at the same time stating that there was \"no evidence\" of influence or instruction. In addition, the basis for concluding that there was \"no evidence\" in regard to the other two elements of Article 8 of the ILC Articles is unknown. This insufficient reasoning in the Award amounts to a failure to state reasons.\n\nAward, para. 310.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 179, quoting Award, paras. 313, 322.\n\n206.\n\nThe Applicant also submits that the Tribunal's findings on attribution in the jurisdiction portion of the Award contradict its findings in the merits section. The Tribunal made an assumption for the purposes of its determination on the merits that Emlak\u2019s conduct was attributable to the State. In doing so, it needed to assume that the commercial justifications for terminating the Contract were pretextual and that the termination was made as a result of a political directive handed down by TOKI. However, in the merits portion, the Tribunal found again that this assumption was incorrect. This contradiction is inherent in the reasons, and the Award is therefore annullable.\n\n**B.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that reasons must be given for the award, not for each specific determination made along the way. A failure to refer to a particular argument, document or other piece of evidence cannot amount to a failure to state the reasons. According to the Respondent, \"[t]his would interfere with the evaluation of evidence which is beyond the supervisory authority of an annulment committee.\"186\n\nResp. C-Mem. Annul., para. 33.\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Majority\u2019s reasoning on attribution is clear and can be followed with ease. The Tribunal discussed the legal standard under all three claimed grounds for attribution (Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles) and considered the evidence for each of the grounds, concluding that the evidence did not support the Claimant\u2019s arguments that the Emlak claims were attributable to the State. For example, the Award devotes 17 paragraphs to the evaluation of evidence relating to arguments under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.187 It is clear from the Award that the Tribunal applied the ILC Articles to the facts of the case to determine questions of attribution.\n\nAward, paras. 307-323.\n\n209.\n\nAs far as evidence regarding the criteria of \"control,\" \"instructions\" and \"direction\" are concerned, the Majority - in paragraphs 311,313 and 322 of the Award, the very paragraphs quoted by the Applicant - specifically considered whether the evidence presented was sufficient to prove that Emlak acted \"on the instructions\" or \"under the direction\" of TOKI. The Majority\u2019s analysis was clear on these issues and no reader could struggle to follow it from the premise to the conclusion. In particular, the Respondent points out that paragraph 311 of the Award states:\n\nAn analysis of the content and nature of key decisions taken by Emlak\u2019s Board with respect to the Contract, including minutes and agenda papers, *does not lead to the conclusion that Emlak acted under the governmental control, direction or instructions of TOKI with a view to achieving a certain State purpose,188*\n\nResp. C-Mem. Annul., para. 103 (emphasis added).\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Applicant itself did not elaborate on the difference of the legal standards for \"control,\" \"instructions\" and \"direction\" during its closing arguments at the hearing, or on how the evidence supported that those standards had been met in this case. According to the Respondent, because of the Separate Opinion\u2019s position concerning the evidence on attribution, the Applicant is now trying to advance an argument that it did not put forward during the arbitration.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Applicant\u2019s request to annul the Award on the basis of the Tribunal's failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based (Article 52 (1)(e) of the ICSID Convention) is focused on the alleged failure of the Tribunal to state reasons in \"[t]he attribution portion of the Award,\"189 namely for the conclusion that Emlak\u2019s conduct was not attributable to Turkey under Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility because TOKI did not \"instruct\" or \"direct\" Emlak.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., p. 80, title of Section B.\n\n212.\n\nThe Committee thus has to verify whether the Applicant\u2019s criticism of this part of the Award on the ground invoked is justified. The other conclusions reached by the Tribunal elsewhere in the Award seem to be sufficiently motivated, enabling the Applicant to follow how the Tribunal reached its conclusions.\n\n213.\n\nThe Committee observes that when the Tribunal analysed Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, it expressed the view that \"[p]lainly, the words \u2018instructions,\u2019 \u2018direction\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 in Art. 8 are to be read disjunctively.\"190 The Tribunal was thus fully aware of the fact that it had to consider \"whether any of the categories of \u2018instructions,\u2019 \u2018direction\u2019 or \u2018control\u2019 [were] met for the purposes of Art. 8.\"191 This, however, does not imply that the Tribunal could not have considered in parallel whether on evidence one of these \"categories\" was met, but had to do it successively for each and every category separately.\n\nAward, para. 303.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n214.\n\nWhile the Applicant disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions that Emlak\u2019s \"conduct\" cannot be attributed to Turkey \"due to an absence of proof that the State used its control as a vehicle directed towards achieving a particular result in its sovereign interests,\"192 it is not asserting that the Tribunal's analysis of attribution on the basis of control is not adequately motivated or reasoned. Therefore, the Committee need not dwell on this aspect of the reasoning on attribution.\n\nAward, para. 326.\n\n215.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Emlak\u2019s conduct was not attributable to Turkey on the basis of either \"instruction\" or \"direction,\" as they were not been proven, which, in the view of the Applicant, is unmotivated.\n\n216.\n\nThe Committee cannot agree with the Applicant that the Tribunal, while defining the standard for \"control,\" made \"no similar effort [...] to define the standards for \u2018instructions\u2019 or \u2018 direction. \u2019\"193 It is beyond any doubt that the Tribunal looked not only at the text of Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, but also at the authoritative ILC Commentary that accompanies these Articles.194 Having been inspired by the Commentary, the Tribunal formulated the required standard. It stated that \"the relevant enquiry remains whether Emlak was being directed, instructed or controlled by TOKI with respect to the specific activity of administering the Contract with Tulip JV in the sense of *sovereign* direction, instruction or control.\"195 Thus, in the view of the Tribunal, the standard for attribution was the same for all three possible bases of attribution, namely, instruction, direction, or control. The Tribunal made clear that the question before it was \"whether any aspect of the administration of the Contract was performed under the instruction or direction of TOKI in exercise of sovereign power.\"196\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 176.\n\nSee Award, para. 306, quoting extensively from the ILC Commentary to Article 8.\n\nAward, para. 309 (first emphasis in original, second emphasis added).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 305.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal was thus looking for evidence that the \"specific activity of administering the Contract,\" namely, its termination by Emlak, was done on instruction of TOKI, or whether TOKI directed Emlak in reaching that decision with a view to achieving a certain State purpose.\n\n218.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, there was no need for the Tribunal to define the terms \"instruction\" or \"direction,\" as their ordinary meaning is rather clear. \"Instruction\" can be understood as \"making known to a person what he is required to do\" or to give \"an order.\"197 \"Direction\" is defined as an \"authoritative guidance, instruction,\" as \"instructing how to proceed or act aright.\"198 What the Tribunal needed was the evidence that State officials told, or gave orders or authoritative guidance to, Emlak that it had to terminate the Contract with Tulip in the State interest.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press (1989).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n219.\n\nWhile the Tribunal admitted that \"[t]here [was] some limited evidence supporting the Claimant\u2019s contention that the decision to terminate the Ispartakule III Contract was connected to TOKI and the exercise of its public power,\"199 it, however, having looked at the evidence, \"considered] that [its] weight [...] is strongly to the contrary,\" showing \"that the decision to terminate the Contract with Tulip JV was made by the Board of Emlak *independently,* in the pursuit of Emlak\u2019s commercial interests, and not as a result of the exercise of sovereign power by TOKI.\"200 In the Committee\u2019s view, the quoted passages do not reveal \"a conceptual flaw in the Tribunal's reasoning,\" as asserted by the Applicant.201 It is not unusual that in the exercise of judicial or arbitral functions a court or a tribunal finds some elements of the evidentiary record indicating one possible direction/conclusion, but other elements indicating a different direction/conclusion. It is for a court or a tribunal to weigh the evidence in accordance with the principle of free assessment of evidence202 in order to reach, on the balance of that evidence, its conclusions.\n\nAward, para. 310.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 311.\n\nApp. Mem. Annul., para. 181.\n\n*R. Kolb,* The International Court of Justice, Hart Publishing, p. 930 (2013). As the ICJ stated \"within the limits of its Statute and Rules, it has freedom in estimating the value of the various elements of evidence, though it is clear that general principles of judicial procedure necessarily govern the determination of what can be regarded as proved.\" *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, Judgment (Nicaragua v. United States),* Judgment on the Merits, *I.C.J. Reports 1986,* June 27, 1986, p. 40, para. 60. For ICSID arbitral proceedings see Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n220.\n\nThis is what the Tribunal did in this case. It is not difficult to follow its reasoning, including that relating to attribution on the basis of instruction or direction. The Tribunal explains that it \"analysed] the content and nature of key decisions taken by Emlak\u2019s Board with respect to the Contract, including minutes and agenda papers.\"203 The Tribunal explicitly refers in footnotes 336-340 to specific documents on the basis of which it reached its conclusion. In relation to, as the Tribunal called it, \"[t]he central act [... ] with respect to which the Claimant [sought] compensation,\"204 namely, the termination of the Contract, the Tribunal again refers to a number of documents (including quoting one of them).205 In light of the above, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the lack of attribution of Emlak\u2019s conduct in terminating the Contract to the Respondent on the basis of an alleged instruction or direction is sufficiently reasoned.\n\nAward, paras. 311-314.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 315.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 316, 319, 320, fns. 341-342, 344-345.\n\n221.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that it cannot uphold the Applicant\u2019s request to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention on the ground that the Award has failed to state reasons on which it is based.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A.** ***Applicant\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe parties submitted their claims for costs on July 15, 2015. The Applicant\u2019s legal costs total USD 1,119,955.28 and its expenses total USD 332,769.25. The expenses include the advance payment to ICSID in the amount of USD 200,000.00, which was covered solely by the Applicant in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, as well as the lodging fee of USD 25,000. The Applicant subsequently made a further advance in the amount of USD 75,000 following a request made by ICSID on August 7, 2015. Accordingly, the Applicant\u2019s total costs and expenses in the annulment proceeding amount to USD 1,527,724.53.\n\n223.\n\nThe Applicant notes that under Articles 61(2) and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, **ad hoc**  committees have the discretion to examine the expenses incurred by the parties and to determine how and by whom such expenses and costs shall be borne. The Applicant requests that, in the event the Award is annulled, the Committee direct the Respondent to bear the costs of the proceeding in full, in line with the *ad hoc* Committees in *Sempra v. Argentina206* and *MHS v. Malaysia207* If the Award is not annulled, the Applicant requests that, \"at most, the costs of the proceeding be divided equally between the parties,\"208 and that each party bear its own legal expenses and fees, in line with the approach by, amongst others, the **ad hoc**  Committees in *Continental Casualty v. Argentina,209 Lucchetti v. Peru210* and *Soufraki v. UAE.211*\n\n*Sempra v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2010.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN BHD v.

The Respondent argues that it was forced to incur these costs by defending itself in a proceeding that was \"destined to fail and indeed frivolous.\"212 The Respondent contends that, if the Award is upheld, an order of costs may be made under either the \"costs follow the event\" standard or the \"fundamentally lacking in merit\" approach. According to the Respondent, Tulip is using the annulment proceedings to delay its payment under the Award, which is a circumstance that should be considered by the Committee in line with recent jurisprudence.213 Further, *ad hoc* committees have ordered that the unsuccessful applicant pay the other party\u2019s costs if the application was fundamentally lacking in merit. In any event, in line with jurisprudence during the last five years, the Respondent should not be required to contribute to the costs of the proceeding as \"no *ad hoc* committee that distinguished between the Costs of the Proceeding and Party Costs has required a successful respondent to reimburse the applicant for any of the Costs of the Proceeding.\"214 This is supported by the text of the ICSID Convention and the exceptional nature of annulment proceedings as recognized by the Committee in *M.C.I.

Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6), Decision on Annulment, February 12, 2015, para. 207.\n\n*M.C.I Power v. Ecuador,* Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, para. 88.\n\n**C.** ***Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which is contained in its Chapter VI titled \"Cost of Proceedings,\" provides:\n\n[T]he Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.\n\nRule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules implementing Article 61(2) states that \"[t]he award shall be in writing and shall contain [...] any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n227.\n\nIn accordance with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Article 61(2) being part of Chapter VI \"shall apply **mutatis mutandis** to proceedings before the Committee.\" Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules specify that these Rules \"shall apply **mutatis mutandis** to any procedure relating to the [...] annulment of an award and to the decision of the [...] Committee.\"\n\n228.\n\nBoth parties recognize that under the above-mentioned provisions the Committee enjoys discretion in allocating the costs.\n\n229.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e), the Applicant made the advance payments requested by ICSID to cover the costs of the annulment proceeding (i.e. the costs and expenses of the Centre and fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee) (\"ICSID Costs\"). The ICSID Costs amount to USD 247,874.98.216\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) relating to the dispatch of this Decision. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.\n\n230.\n\nThe Committee has rejected the Application. The Applicant has, however, requested that in case the Award is not annulled, the Committee divides the ICSID Costs equally between the parties. Although Regulation 14(3)(e) - stating that the Applicant shall be solely responsible for making the advance payment - is without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention to decide how and by whom the ICSID Costs shall be paid, the Committee does not see any compelling reason to divide these costs equally between the parties. As the *ad hoc* Committee in *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador* stated, \"[a] consequence of this rule [Regulation 14(3)(e)], which imposes on the party who applies for annulment the financial burden of advancing the costs, should normally be that the Applicant, when annulment is refused, remains responsible for these costs.\"217 The Committee therefore decides that Tulip has to bear all of the ICSID Costs.\n\n*M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador,* Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, para. 89.\n\n231.\n\nThe Committee does not share the Respondent\u2019s view that the \"annulment application [...] was always destined to fail, and indeed frivolous.\"218 The Applicant raised a number of worthwhile points that required the Committee\u2019s detailed consideration. The Committee also has to acknowledge that the Applicant and its Counsel pursued the annulment proceeding in a professional and courteous way. In view of these factors, the Committee decides that each party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses incurred in this annulment proceeding.\n\nResp. Submission for the Costs of the Annul. Proceeding, July 15, 2015, para. 3.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n232.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee decides:\n\n(1) Tulip\u2019s Application for Annulment is dismissed in its entirety;\n\n(2) Tulip shall bear all ICSID Costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding;\n\nand\n\n(3) Each Party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses in the annulment proceeding."}]}
