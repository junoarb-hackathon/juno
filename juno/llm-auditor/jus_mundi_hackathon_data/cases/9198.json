Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision addresses the Request for Provisional Measures submitted on 4 January 2023 by First Majestic Silver Corp. (\"**First Majestic**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), on its own behalf and on behalf of Primero Empresa Minera, S.A. de C.V. (\"**PEM**\"), on the basis of NAFTA Article 1134, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.\n\n**II. Relevant Procedural History**\n-----------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn 1 March 2021, the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration (\"**Request for Arbitration**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 25 April 2022, the Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"**Memorial**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 25 November 2022, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Admissibility, Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"**Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 15 December 2022, the Claimant objected to certain information and statements contained in the Counter-Memorial and indicated that it would be seeking provisional measures from the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 December 2022, the Respondent presented a letter in response, reserving its right to respond to any request for provisional measures and noting that the Parties were in the process of conferring regarding a procedural order on confidentiality.\n\n7.\n\nOn 4 January 2023, the Claimant filed the Request for Provisional Measures (the \"**Request**\").\n\n8.\n\nFollowing communications from the Parties dated 4 and 5 January 2023, the Respondent was invited to provide its response to the Claimant's Request by 27 January 2023. Pending a decision on the Claimant's Request, the Tribunal further invited the Parties \"to abstain from measures and initiatives that might aggravate the dispute or prejudice any decision by the Tribunal on the Claimant's Request.\"\n\n9.\n\nOn 20 January 2023, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had attempted to reach an agreement with the Claimant to obtain an extension for the presentation of its response to the Request but noted that the Parties were unable to reach an agreement. Accordingly, the Respondent requested a two-week extension.\n\n10.\n\nOn 23 January 2022, the Claimant responded to Mexico's correspondence, indicating that it opposed the two-week extension on the grounds that it would be prejudicial to the Claimant, \"including by exacerbating the dispute, prolonging it and cause irreparable harm.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 January 2023, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request for a two-week extension and indicated that it would expect the Respondent's response by 10 February 2023. It further reminded the Parties \"to abstain from measures and initiatives that might aggravate the dispute or prejudice any decision by the Tribunal on the Claimant's Request, as already indicated in the Tribunal's letter of January 10, 2023.\"\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 February 2023, the Respondent presented its Response to the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (the \"**Response**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 13 February 2023, the Centre informed the Parties of the Tribunal's intention to hold a half-day virtual hearing \"to further clarify the respective positions of the Parties on the Request\" (the \"**Hearing**\"). Additionally, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit jointly \u2013 or, where they are unable to agree, separately \u2013 one week before the hearing date, a chronology of relevant facts.\n\n14.\n\nOn 6 March 2023, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to jointly prepare a chronology of relevant facts and both Parties submitted their own separate chronologies.\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 March 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the organization of the Hearing, which included a list of questions to be addressed by the Parties during their oral arguments.\n\n16.\n\nOn 13 March 2023, the Tribunal held the Hearing with the Parties by video conference. The following individuals participated in the session:\n\n**Members of the Tribunal**:\n\nGiorgio Sacerdoti, President of the Tribunal  \nStanimir Alexandrov, Member of the Tribunal  \nYves Derains, Member of the Tribunal\n\n**ICSID Secretariat**:\n\nSara Marzal, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n**On behalf of the Claimant**:\n\nRiyaz Dattu, ArentFox Schiff LLP  \nLee Caplan, ArentFox Schiff LLP  \nTimothy Feighery, ArentFox Schiff LLP  \nMaya Cohen, ArentFox Schiff LLP  \nMaxime Jeanpierre, ArentFox Schiff LLP  \nSophie Hsia, First Majestic  \nLuis Salvador Robles Espinoza, First Majestic\n\n**On behalf of the Respondent**:\n\nAlan Bonfiglio, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nGeovanni Hern\u00e1ndez, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nLuis Mu\u00f1oz, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nLaura Mej\u00eda, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nAlicia Islas, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nAlejandro Rebollo, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nFabi\u00e1n Trejo, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda  \nVincent DeRose, Tereposky & DeRose LLP  \nXimena Iturriaga, Tereposky & DeRose LLP\n\n**Court Reporters**:\n\nDavid Kasdan, B&B Reporters  \nDante Rinaldi, D-R Esteno\n\n**Interpreters**:\n\nSilvia Colla  \nDaniel Giglio\n\n**Technical Support Staff**:\n\nGina Pollard, Sparq\n\n17.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, the Claimant requested the introduction of three new documents into the record.\n\n18.\n\nOn 3 April 2023, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's above-mentioned request.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that on Friday, 31 March 2023 it had served the Respondent with a NAFTA Notice of Intent seeking recovery of VAT refunds [REDACTED].\n\n20.\n\nOn 6 April 2023, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's request to introduce new documents into the record.\n\n**III. The Parties' Positions1**\n--------------------------------\n\nThis summary does not intend to be a detailed and exhaustive description of all of the Parties' arguments. Its objective is merely to establish the general context for this decision.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Request**\n-----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal recommend the following provisional measures:\n\n*a) The suspension or stay of the proceedings pending before the Collegiate Court, in relation to the* amparo *relief requested by PEM from the Collegiate Court.*\n\n*b) Requiring the SAT and any other authority working in conjunction with the SAT, to refrain from:*\n\n*i. undertaking any additional enforcement measures, whether* [REDACTED] *against the Claimant and its investment (and the assets of the investment);*\n\n*ii. undertaking any further tax audits and issuing any additional tax reassessments based on any methodology other than provided for in the APA issued in 2012; and*\n\n*iii. initiating any proceedings, whether* [REDACTED]*, against the management personnel of the Claimant and its investment, whether in Mexico or residing outside the country, and whether currently or previously employed, in relation to the measures currently under adjudication before this Tribunal and also any settlement offer made to the Respondent (whether or not in compliance with Mexican law formalities) offers made by PEM.*\n\n*c) Requiring the SAT to make all payments of VAT refunds owed to PEM after the filing of the Request for Arbitration and all future VAT refund payments into a newly opened bank account of PEM* \\_.P *that will remain free from SAT's seizure or freezing order; and*\n\n*d) maintaining strict confidentiality of the arbitration proceeding such that no written or other media statements are made by the President of Mexico and any other Mexican government official, concerning the arbitration proceedings or the legal dispute with First Majestic and its investment.*2\n\nRequest, para. 153.\n\n22.\n\nIn its Request, the Claimant first indicates that it seeks provisional measures on its own\n\nbehalf and on behalf of its investment in order to:\n\n*a) fully protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction,*\n\n*b) ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, and*\n\n*c) to preserve their rights as detailed herein.*3\n\nRequest, para.12.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant specifies the purpose of its requests as follows:\n\n*The provisional measures requested seek to avoid having the Government of Mexico, while this Tribunal is exercising its jurisdiction, from:*\n\n*a) interfering with the Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention to adjudicate the dispute in a neutral manner and in an international forum (and to the exclusion of any domestic process in Mexico), in relation to the measures taken and not taken, that have been identified by the Claimant to be in violation of Chapter 11 of NAFTA;*\n\n*b) exacerbating the dispute including by causing irreparable harm to the Claimant and its investment; and*\n\n*c) impinging on any legal rights of the Claimant and its investment including the ability to carry on its business at the San Dimas Mine which is the source of livelihood for hundreds of its employees and their families in Mexico.*4\n\nRequest, para. 18 (footnotes omitted).\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant further explains the content of the provisional measures requested, which it describes as having been framed in a \"*narrow, specific and proportionate manner*\", as follows:\n\n*a*) Immediate Suspension of the amparo proceedings relegated to the Mexican Fourteenth Collegiate Court on Administrative Matters of the First Circuit (Collegiate Court) proceeding*: The stay or suspension order requested by the Claimant concerns an* amparo *filed by PEM with the Collegiate Court on November 30, 2020 and which was thereafter admitted on February 23, 2021. The* amparo *was filed by PEM as a necessary protective measure to preserve the validity of the APA, and before the filing by the Claimant of the Request for Arbitration and the formation of this Tribunal. As discussed further below, based on political interference and machinations, the* amparo *proceeding was sought to be transferred by the Government to the Mexican Supreme Court based on an unusual and rarely used procedure known as the 'power of attraction.' However, the Government of Mexico has now, after the lapse of two years, inexplicably withdrawn as of December 8 and 9, 2022, each of the two separate petitions filed for the transfer of the* amparo *to the Mexican Supreme Court. The decision on the **amparo**, after this inordinate delay, has been relegated back to the Collegiate Court which has acknowledged receipt of the case on December 12, 2022. A decision has yet to be issued by the Collegiate Court, but could be issued any day.*\n\n*b)* Prohibition against the Mexican government officials' use of the Public Media to Discuss the Dispute*: The order requested would prohibit any statements by the President of Mexico, the Minister of Economy and any other Mexican government official, to the public media concerning matters that are the subject of this arbitration proceeding including its progress.*\n\n*c)* Future VAT refunds payable to PEM*: The requested order would require the SAT to make all VAT refunds that have accrued to PEM after the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, and all future VAT refund payments, to be made fully accessible to PEM. Furthermore, the order would require that these VAT refunds remain free from SAT's seizures or freezing of bank accounts.*\n\n*d)* Stay of Enforcement, Transfer Pricing Audits and [REDACTED] *The order would ensure that the SAT and any other authority working in conjunction with the SAT, will refrain from:*\n\n*i. Undertaking any additional enforcement or collection measures against the Claimant and its investment (including the assets of the investment), whether* [REDACTED] *in relation to any amounts claimed to be owing as taxes, penalties, interest and surcharges for the 2010 to 2014 taxation years of PEM.*\n\n*ii. Undertaking any transfer pricing related investigations or audits and issuing any additional tax reassessments for 2010 and all subsequent years, based on any methodology other than that provided for in the APA issued in 2012.*\n\n*iii. Initiating any proceedings, whether* [REDACTED] *against the management personnel of the Claimant and its investment, whether residing in Mexico or outside the country, and whether currently or previously employed, including in relation to:*\n\n*a. the obtaining by PEM of the APA in 2012, and any amounts claimed by the SAT to be owing as taxes, penalties, interest, and surcharges for the 2010 to 2020 taxation years of PEM, and any other measures currently under adjudication before this Tribunal; and*\n\n*b. any settlement offer made to the Respondent (whether or not in compliance with Mexican law formalities) by PEM for any reassessments for its taxation years 2010 to 2020 in order to achieve a final resolution of the dispute.*5\n\nRequest, para.19 (footnotes omitted).\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the provisional measures it requests:\n\n*are necessary to fully protect and make effective the Tribunal's jurisdiction, to avoid the exacerbation of this dispute, and to permit the Claimant and its investment to preserve their legal rights. Furthermore, they are narrow, specific, necessary, urgent, and proportional and will avoid irreparable harm that will otherwise be suffered by the Claimant and its investment.6*\n\nRequest, para. 21.\n\n26.\n\nAs a legal basis for the Tribunal's authority to grant the provisional measures requested, the Claimant refers \"cumulatively\" to NAFTA Article 1134, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n*Article 47 ICSID Convention*\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n*Rule 39 ICSID Arbitration Rules: Provisional Measures*7\n\n*(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.*\n\n*(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests. Article 1134 NAFTA: Interim Measures of Protection A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.*\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules of 10 April 2006, in force when this arbitration was initiated and applicable pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, para. 1.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant refers specifically to Article 1134 NAFTA pointing out that, in its view, such provision \"explicitly provides this Tribunal broad discretionary authority to award interim relief to preserve the rights of a disputing party, protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to ensure that its jurisdiction is made fully effective, provided the order does not constitute an '\u2026attachment or enjoin the application of measures alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.'\" The Claimant adds, in relation to the limitation found in the last sentence of Article 1134, that \"[n]one of the provisional measures requested seek to attach or enjoin the application of the measures that have been enumerated by the Claimant to constitute a breach of Mexico's NAFTA obligations*.*\"8\n\nRequest, paras. 23-24.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes hereafter the reasons, in law and in fact, which the Claimant has set forth in order to support its request.\n\n**1.** ***Prima facie*** **jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nFirst, the Claimant states that the Tribunal has the *prima facie* jurisdiction required to issue provisional measures, since the Respondent has not asked for bifurcation of the proceedings in relation to its objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the Tribunal has received the evidence that confirms such *prima facie* jurisdiction over the claims.9\n\nRequest, paras. 27-33.\n\n30.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Tribunal should find *prima facie* jurisdiction based on the evidence submitted in the Memorial. In particular, the Claimant argues that: (i) it is an investor of Canada; (ii) it has made significant investments in Mexico for close to twenty years, including in the San Dimas Mine; (iii) the measures taken \"by the executive branch and the administrative courts [of the Respondent], have detrimentally and severely impacted the Claimant's ability to carry on its business in Mexico;\" (iv) it is entitled to bring its claims on its own behalf, and on behalf of PEM, pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117; (v) all temporal requirements set out in NAFTA Chapter 11 have been satisfied; (vi) the requirements in NAFTA Article 1121 and under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Institution Rules and the ICSID Arbitration Rules have also been met; and (vii) the measures at issue are not excluded from the scope of NAFTA Chapter 11, including NAFTA Article 2103(1) as they are not \"taxation measures\", and furthermore the Claimant has complied with the requirements of NAFTA Article 2103(6) as the competent authorities failed to agree within the requisite period that an expropriation has not occurred.10\n\nRequest, para. 33.\n\n**2. The Claimant's factual presentation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***a. First request: that the pending amparo proceedings be immediately suspended***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant argues that such a stay is necessary for the \"protection of the Tribunal's jurisdiction\", for making its jurisdiction \"fully effective\" and for \"avoiding irreparable harm\".\n\n32.\n\nAs to the \"protection of the Tribunal's jurisdiction\", the Claimant argues that the domestic *amparo* proceedings contradict the exclusive jurisdiction of this Tribunal to resolve the dispute in accordance with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention \"without its process being up-ended or usurped in whole or in part by the Mexican courts and administrative decision-makers*.*\"11 The Claimant adds that \"seeking to have the Collegiate Court suspend its proceedings is entirely appropriate an compelling\" because Mexican courts \"are obligated to adhere to international law and decisions of international tribunals, and do so regularly,\" especially in view of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to the Tribunal under the NAFTA \"to establish what rights are owed to Claimant and its investments, under relevant international law and treaties.\"12\n\nRequest, paras. 39-40.\n\nRequest, paras. 48-50.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant lists a series of considerations that, in its opinion, \"support imposing an immediate stay on the Collegiate Court process and maintaining the status quo, so as to preserve the Tribunal's jurisdiction\" which are summarized hereunder:13\n\n\u2022 The political interference in the administrative and judicial processes in respect of the recourse by SAT to the *Lesividad* proceeding \"to unlawfully coerce PEM to abandon reliance on the APA\"; the lack of fairness, due process and justifiable legal grounds in respect of the decision of the TFJA of 23 September 2020 which concluded the *Lesividad* proceeding with the annulment of the APA with retroactive effects; the proposed transfer to the Supreme Court of Mexico at the behest of a single Member of the Court \"through the 'power of attraction' process\" of the amparo proceedings, by which PEM had challenged the TFJA decision, and its transfer back to the Collegiate Court in December 2022.14\n\n\u2022 The \"irreparable harm\" which will be caused to the Claimant and its investment should the current status of the APA not be preserved by preventing a possibly unfavorable decision of the Collegiate Court due to \"PEM's legal right to defend against the unlawfulness of the amounts claimed by SAT as taxes, penalties, interest and surcharges\" being \"immediately extinguished under Mexican law;\" [REDACTED]15\n\nRequest, para. 56.\n\nRequest, para. 54.\n\nRequest, para. 55. The Claimant additionally states that the request sub (a) has also as a principal objective \"the preservation of existing legal rights (i.e., maintaining the status quo)\", Request, para.77.\n\n34.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimant submits that:\n\n*[i]t is evident from the facts available to this Tribunal that the Collegiate Court ruling on PEM's amparo request, if negative and rendered before the Tribunal makes its final award, will cause the Claimant and PEM irreparable harm particularly if leave to appeal to the Mexican Supreme Court is refused. In the absence of the provisional measures requested, PEM* [REDACTED].16\n\nRequest, paras. 103, 137.\n\n35.\n\nIn light of the above factors, the Claimant submits that its request of stay of the Collegiate Court proceedings is also justified to avoid aggravating or extending the dispute, to maintain the orderly conduct and the integrity of the proceedings, and to protect the Claimant's and PEM's rights.17\n\nRequest, para. 64.\n\n36.\n\nTo support its request that the *amparo* proceedings be suspended, the Claimant relies on a number of ICSID cases, which it considers have dealt with situations similar to the one at hand. In those cases, tribunals issued provisional measures enjoining, or rather recommending, that certain pending domestic proceedings be suspended or discontinued in order not to prejudice the integrity of the arbitration proceedings (so as to ensure that the arbitration tribunal may render its final award) or not to aggravate or extend the dispute.18\n\nThe Claimant relies (at para. 44 of its Request) on *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3, dated 29 September 2006, para. 135, CL-0086; at para. 46 on *Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1, Further Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 12 May 1974, CL-0085; at para. 66 on *MINE v. Republic of Guinea (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 4 December 1985, CL-0085; at para.68 on *Tokios Tokol\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1, dated 1 July 2003, CL-0085 and CL-0089; and at para. 69 on *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic (I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Claimant's Amended Application for Provisional Measures, dated 17 September 2013, \u00b6 30, CL-0094. The Claimant also refers extensively to various paragraphs of Christoph H. Schreuer, *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention*, Cambridge University Press, 3rd Ed., 2022, especially to the commentary on Article 47 ICSID Convention, vol II; p.1053 ff. CL-0085.\n\n***b. Second request: that certain statements made to the Media (Press Releases) be prohibited***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the current President of Mexico:\n\n*has made the Claimant and its investment a consistent target of his media campaign of over three years of 'naming and shaming' multi-national companies. The very act of initiating this arbitration proceeding resulted in the President's singling out of the Claimant unjustifiably as a Canadian mining company that allegedly refuses to pay taxes. These statements to the press show no sign of abating. As recently as December 2022, the Minister of Economy, Ms. Raquel Buenrostro (previously the Head of the SAT), has continued to malign Canadian mining companies as being corrupt, with specific reference to the Claimant.*19\n\nRequest, para. 73 (footnotes omitted).\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant considers that such statements made to the public media \"can have the potential of affecting the integrity of the arbitration process including its interim and final awards or have the potential to aggravate the dispute.\"20 The Claimant lists what it submits are \"[e]xamples of the President, as well as the Tax Prosecutor and the Head of the SAT (now the Minister of Economy), engaging in the public 'naming and shaming' media campaign and using the press to publicly brand First Majestic [REDACTED].21\n\nRequest, para. 70. The Claimant additionally states that the request sub (b) has also as a principal objective, just as its request sub (a), \"the preservation of existing legal rights (*i.e.,* maintaining the *status quo*), Request para.77.\n\nRequest, para. 122.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that:\n\n*[t]he provisional remedy requested for prohibiting the President of Mexico, the Minister of Economy and government officials from making media statements is necessary for the prevention of the aggravation of the dispute. Furthermore, this provisional measure is necessary to preserve the rights of the Claimant, to avoid irreparable harm, meet the existing urgency, has been framed in a narrow manner, and is clear and specific.*22\n\nRequest, para.112.\n\n40.\n\nIn support of its request, the Claimant refers to two cases where the circumstances were, it submits, factually similar to those present here. In *Biwater v. Tanzania*, the tribunal considered that \"the prosecution of a dispute in the media or in other public fora, or the uneven reporting and disclosure of documents or other parts of the record in parallel with a pending arbitration, may aggravate or exacerbate the dispute and may impact upon the integrity of the procedure.\"23 The Claimant further relies on the reasoning and decision in *Legacy Vulcan v. Mexico* where:\n\n*the circumstances were very similar to the present case, except that in that case the current President of Mexico made prejudicial statements at the late stages of an ongoing arbitration process, where as in the present case the same President has made the Claimant and its investment a consistent target of his media campaign of over three years of 'naming and shaming' multi-national companies.*24\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3 on Provisional Measures, dated 29 September 2006, para. 136 (emphasis added), CL-0086, as quoted in the Request, para. 72.\n\nRequest, para. 73, *Legacy Vulcan, LLC v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/1, Procedural Order No. 7, dated 11 July 2022, para. 83, CL-0091.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant quotes Procedural Order No. 7 issued in *Legacy Vulcan v. Mexico* where:\n\n*[t]he Tribunal therefore considers that public comments made by Mexico's President on Claimant's claims and damages sought in these proceedings jeopardise the integrity of the arbitral process and are tantamount to prosecution of the dispute in the media and other public fora, contrary to the non-aggravation of the dispute. Such harm is irreparable, in the sense that it cannot be compensated by damages. Subject to its considerations on urgency below, the Tribunal therefore finds it necessary to issue a recommendation in relation to this item.*25\n\nRequest, paras 74 and 120.\n\n***c. Third request: Future VAT refunds payable to PEM to be made fully accessible to PEM and to remain free from SAT's seizure or freezing of bank accounts***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn respect of this request, the Claimant explains that PEM is entitled to VAT refunds in accordance with Mexican law which are periodically paid to it by SAT to its bank accounts. Currently, the equivalent of about [REDACTED] of such refunds, in part as a result of deposits made after the filing of the Request of for Arbitration, are deposited on bank accounts of PEM which have been blocked or seized by SAT as a result of certain tax enforcement and collection measures against PEM.26 The Claimant does not ask that the freezing of the account be lifted (since this would run counter to the prohibition contained in the last sentence of Article 1134 NAFTA), but rather that refunds not be deposited on such frozen account, while SAT has \"continued depositing the VAT refunds into frozen bank accounts without any direction or authorization from PEM.\"27\n\nThese measures are described by the Claimant at para. 97 of the Request, especially at para. 97 (ii) and (v), [REDACTED] The Claimant indicates that, on average, these VAT refunds payable in the future amount to [REDACTED]\n\nRequest, paras 80-81.\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this request \u2013 that the Respondent does not impede the rights and entitlement of the Claimant to VAT refunds (\"*which is not in dispute*\") \u2013, seeks to ensure the preservation of the *status quo* so as not to exacerbate the dispute.28\n\nRequest, paras 79, 83. The Claimant refers in support of its request to *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, dated 29 June 2009, \u00b6 31, CL-0093, whereby that tribunal granted a provisional measure against the seizure of the oil production by Ecuador for the purpose of \"preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute.\"\n\n***d. Fourth request: Stay of Enforcement, Transfer Pricing Audits and*** [REDACTED]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant lists a number of actions that Mexican authorities have undertaken in respect of PEM, notably: [REDACTED] and the methodology provided there for the determination of transfer prices; [REDACTED].\"29\n\nRequest, paras.97 and 148.\n\n45.\n\nTo use the words of the Claimant:\n\n*the Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue provisional measures requiring the Respondent to maintain* status quo *and to allow the Claimant and PEM management personnel to maintain and operate the San Dimas mine, from within Mexico or from outside the country, without being subject to (i) additional enforcement measures, whether* [REDACTED]*; (ii) additional tax investigations, audits and reassessment that is inconsistent with the methodology provided for in the APA; and (iii) threat of* [REDACTED] *against management personnel of the Claimant and the Mexican subsidiaries including in relation to any settlement offer made to the Respondent (whether or not in compliance with Mexican law formalities).*30\n\nRequest, para. 98.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant considers that:\n\n*[t]hese measures are necessary to avoid exacerbation of the dispute, to avoid delays and the disruption of the current arbitration proceedings (such that the Tribunal can exercise its jurisdiction based on the existing claims made by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration and the Claimant's Memorial), and also so as to avoid irreparable harm to the Claimant and its investment which are already subject to restrictive measures arising from previous enforcement actions of the SAT.*31\n\nRequest, para. 99.\n\n47.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that the requested provisional measures are narrow in their scope and specific in their application, thus adhering to the legal requirements set out in the applicable provision of NAFTA, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.32\n\nRequest, paras. 142-144.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimant's Request both on the facts and on its legal basis.\n\n49.\n\nIn the Respondent's view:\n\n*los tribunales s\u00f3lo pueden recomendar medidas provisionales si la parte solicitante demuestra los siguientes elementos: i) que el Tribunal tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n* prima facie*; ii) que existe un derecho susceptible de protecci\u00f3n; iii) que la medida provisional es necesaria; iv) que la medida solicitada es urgente, y v) la proporcionalidad de la medida frente a los derechos de la contraparte en la controversia, siendo en este caso el Estado mexicano.*\n\n*La Demandante debi\u00f3 demostrar estos cinco elementos para cada una de las medidas provisionales que solicit\u00f3, lo cual, no realiz\u00f3. En su lugar, la Solicitud contiene una sesgada caracterizaci\u00f3n de los hechos en controversia en este arbitraje, particularmente aquellos relacionados con un juicio de amparo promovido por Primero Empresa Minera, S.A. de C.V. (\"PEM\") en contra de la sentencia del Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa que resolvi\u00f3 el Juicio de Lesividad (Amparo 12/2021); las auditor\u00edas de precios de transferencia; los procesos civiles/penales; los procedimientos de devoluci\u00f3n de IVA, y las declaraciones de funcionarios p\u00fablicos hechas como parte de un ejercicio informativo dirigido a la ciudadan\u00eda.*33\n\nResponse, paras. 4-5.\n\n50.\n\nFirst of all, the Respondent describes in detail Mexico's proceedings, measures and actions in respect of which the Claimant asks the provisional measures, as a basis to argue that Mexico's actions are legitimate and that the requested provisional measures are not required to preserve the Claimant's rights.\n\n**1. The Pending** ***Amparo*** **Proceeding 12/2021**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAs to the pending *amparo* proceedings 12/2021, which the Claimant requests be suspended,34 the Respondent explains that the \"*juicio de Lesividad*\" was initiated by SAT in front of the TFJA to annul the APA (or MPT35) in view of certain procedural and substantive irregularities that vitiated it (\"*el abuso fiscal de PEM*\"36). It was PEM who challenged, by filing an *amparo* (12/2021), the decision of the TFJA which on 23 September 2020 annulled the APA/MPT by a decision \"*en la que concluy\u00f3,* inter alia*, que existieron m\u00faltiples irregularidades en la emisi\u00f3n de la Resoluci\u00f3n MPT que la llevaron a declararla nula*.\"37\n\nResponse, para.70.\n\n*Resoluci\u00f3n en Materia de Precios de Transferencia*.\n\nResponse, para. 26.\n\nResponse, para. 16 with reference to R-00045.\n\n52.\n\nAfter a request to remit the case to the Supreme Court was filed in 2021 but was subsequently withdrawn in December 2022, the *amparo* proceeding is currently pending \"*al 2\u00b0 Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Administrativa del Primer Circuito (\"2\u00b0 Tribunal Colegiado\"), por lo que se advierte que el Amparo 12/2021 contin\u00faa su tr\u00e1mite normal. La Demandada desconoce cu\u00e1ndo se emitir\u00e1 la resoluci\u00f3n del Amparo 12/2021, pero se estima que ocurrir\u00e1 en los pr\u00f3ximos meses*.\"38\n\nResponse, para. 21.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent describes the possible outcomes of the pending *amparo* proceeding as follows:\n\n*El 2\u00ba Tribunal Colegiado, en pleno ejercicio de sus facultades, concluir\u00e1 en pr\u00f3ximas fechas si existen causales de improcedencia que conduzcan a su sobreseimiento, o si procede alguna otra acci\u00f3n como negar el Amparo 12/2021; revocar la sentencia del TFJA u ordenar al SAT que emita una nueva resoluci\u00f3n siguiendo ciertas directrices que establezca el 2\u00ba Tribunal Colegiado.*39\n\nResponse, para. 22.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent adds that:\n\n*[e]n todo caso, si el 2\u00ba Tribunal Colegiado emite una resoluci\u00f3n que la Demandante no considere favorable a sus intereses, \u00e9sta podr\u00e1 impugnar la decisi\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de un recurso establecido en la legislaci\u00f3n mexicana denominado 'recurso de revisi\u00f3n', por lo que no existir\u00eda un da\u00f1o irreparable para la Demandante que no pueda ser resarcido por otros medios legales.*40\n\nResponse, para. 156.\n\n55.\n\nBy detailing the developments of the case, the Respondent points out that the suspension of the *amparo* proceeding which the Claimant requests lacks the requirements of being urgent or necessary, \"*pues no existe un riesgo de que la resoluci\u00f3n del mismo cause (o amenace en causar) un da\u00f1o irreparable a los derechos de la Demandante*.\"41\n\nResponse, para. 171.\n\n**2. The Press Releases (*****Notas de prensa*****)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimant's complaint that certain press statements of the President of Mexico and other high officials have singled out the Claimant or PEM within a campaign against Canadian mining companies that allegedly refuse to pay taxes. According to the Respondent:\n\n*las ruedas de prensa matutinas que realza el Presidente de M\u00e9xico.... constituyen un mecanismo de rendici\u00f3n de cuentas y de difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n que sirve para asegurar el derecho de acceso a la informaci\u00f3n de todos los ciudadanos mexicanos, en el pleno ejercicio del derecho a la libertad de expresi\u00f3n.*42\n\nResponse, para. 26.\n\n57.\n\nMore specifically: *[E]stas declaraciones est\u00e1n relacionadas con procedimientos de fiscalizaci\u00f3n iniciados en contra de diversas empresas, algunos de los cuales comenzaron mucho antes de que entrara en funciones el actual gobierno de M\u00e9xico. Se observa que estas notas de prensa acompa\u00f1aron al Memorial de Demanda, y pr\u00e1cticamente los mismos argumentos planteados en la Solicitud se encuentran reflejados en el Memorial de Demanda.*43\n\nResponse, para. 27.\n\n58.\n\nAs to the latest press releases of the current *Secretaria de Econom\u00eda*: \"*de una simple lectura de la nota de prensa exhibida como anexo C-0047 queda claro que no se menciona a la Demandante o a PEM*.\"44 Thus, the Respondent submits that:\n\n*[e]l Estado mexicano en ning\u00fan momento ha iniciado una 'campa\u00f1a medi\u00e1tica' en contra de la Demandante. El hecho de que algunos funcionarios del gobierno de M\u00e9xico se refieran a la situaci\u00f3n fiscal de algunas empresas de alg\u00fan sector o industria en particular se debe a que es un tema de inter\u00e9s general y una problem\u00e1tica que ha tenido que ser analizada por las autoridades competentes.*45\n\nResponse, para. 25.\n\nResponse, para. 29.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent notes that \"*el TLCAN no proh\u00edbe este tipo de manifestaciones realizadas en el pleno ejercicio de la libertad de expresi\u00f3n y como parte de un mecanismo de transparencia*.\"46\n\nResponse, para. 29.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that:\n\n*no son las 'declaraciones a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n' las que tienen el potencial de exacerbar una controversia entre dos partes ante un tribunal arbitral, sino m\u00e1s bien la divulgaci\u00f3n unilateral de ciertos documentos espec\u00edficos relacionados con el proceso arbitral. La Demandada no hizo ninguna divulgaci\u00f3n unilateral. Las acciones de la Demandada no est\u00e1n de hecho agravando esta controversia y, en consecuencia, este Tribunal no debe recomendar las medidas provisionales solicitadas por la Demandante.*47\n\nResponse, para. 31.\n\n**3. Future VAT Refunds Payable to PEM /** ***Devoluciones del Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA)***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, upon a close examination of the Claimant's request that VAT refunds to PEM not be made on accounts that are blocked by SAT so that they may be freely available to PEM, \"*todo indica que su reclamaci\u00f3n, en realidad, es que las devoluciones en cuesti\u00f3n se depositaron en cuentas congeladas sin la autorizaci\u00f3n o instrucci\u00f3n de PEM*.\"48 According to the Respondent, SAT has fully refunded, without any reduction upon verification, all VAT refunds that PEM has filed.\n\nResponse, para. 34.\n\n62.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent submits that:\n\n*cuando existe un saldo favorable o un saldo que deba ser devuelto a un contribuyente, es el propio contribuyente quien indica la cuenta bancaria a la cual se tiene que transferir la devoluci\u00f3n de la contribuci\u00f3n en cuesti\u00f3n. Esto significa que cualquier devoluci\u00f3n por devoluci\u00f3n de IVA que el SAT haya realizado a la fecha, se deposit\u00f3 en las cuentas bancarias que la propia Demandante o PEM especific\u00f3 para tal prop\u00f3sito.*49\n\n*Para que PEM pueda recibir tales recursos, \u00fanicamente debe indicar en la solicitud de devoluci\u00f3n, la cuenta bancaria a la cual se tiene que realizar el dep\u00f3sito correspondiente. Claramente, esta no es una situaci\u00f3n que requiera la intervenci\u00f3n del Tribunal.*50\n\nResponse, para. 37.\n\nResponse, para.38\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that \"*el 3 de abril de 2020 el SAT inici\u00f3 un procedimiento administrativo de ejecuci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9ditos fiscales, conforme al cual se orden\u00f3 el aseguramiento provisional de cinco cuentas bancarias de PEM, con la finalidad de proteger el inter\u00e9s fiscal adeudado por la empresa*.\" However, \"*PEM impugn\u00f3 esta decisi\u00f3n y los tribunales mexicanos suspendieron el congelamiento de dichas cuentas bancarias. Por lo tanto, PEM puede disponer de los fondos depositados en tales cuentas bancarias*.\"51\n\nResponse, paras. 37-39.\n\n**4. Stay of Enforcement, Transfer Pricing Audits and** [REDACTED] ***/ Suspensi\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n, auditor\u00edas de precios de transferencia y*** [REDACTED]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent contends that:\n\n*[l]a Solicitud busca suspender cualquier auditor\u00eda y* [REDACTED] *que las autoridades mexicanas puedan iniciar en contra de la Demandante o PEM. Por si no fuera poco, la Solicitud ni siquiera precisa a qu\u00e9 auditor\u00edas o procedimientos legales se refiere. Por esta raz\u00f3n la Demandada se ve en la necesidad de precisar, a continuaci\u00f3n, varios aspectos en torno a las alegaciones de la Demandante.*52\n\nResponse, para. 40.\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent distinguishes under this heading, as the Claimant does, the latter's requests relating to (1) \"*la ejecuci\u00f3n de los montos que se adeudan por concepto de impuestos, multas, intereses y recargos incurridos por PEM de 2010 a 2013*\", (2) \"*Auditor\u00edas relacionadas con los precios de transferencia*\", and (3) [REDACTED]\n\n66.\n\nAs to (1), the Respondent explains that Mexican tax authorities have the power to review tax payers tax returns and statements and to enforce collection of any amount due through \"*un procedimiento administrativo de ejecuci\u00f3n*\". Taxpayers have however a right to challenge the tax assessment and initiate judicial proceedings before the TFJA asking for the suspension of the tax determination. In respect of PEM, SAT has determined through several assessments that PEM owes taxes (\"*credito fiscal*\" in favor of SAT) for each of the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. SAT's tax audits for the years 2014 to 2021 are pending (at various stages of the audit process).53\n\nResponse, paras. 43-44.\n\n67.\n\nAs a consequence, PEM \"*ten\u00eda la obligaci\u00f3n de garantizar los cr\u00e9ditos fiscales, ya determinados por el SAT,* [REDACTED] *pero no lo hizo*.\" The consequence has been that:\n\n*el SAT* [REDACTED] *iniciara un procedimiento administrativo de ejecuci\u00f3n. Como parte de dicho procedimiento, se* [REDACTED] *No obstante, como se se\u00f1al\u00f3 anteriormente, PEM puede manejar estas cuentas bancarias libremente gracias a que logr\u00f3 obtener las suspensiones correspondientes en un juicio de amparo.*54\n\nResponse, para. 45.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that since these proceedings (tax assessments and a taxpayer's right to challenge them) are in conformity with Mexican law applicable to all taxpayers, a provisional measure by the Tribunal to exempt PEM from general tax obligations, by restricting SAT from auditing and assessing PEM would violate \"*el principio de igualitad tributaria*\".55\n\nResponse, para. 47.\n\n69.\n\nAs to the Claimant's request (3) of provisional measures enjoining proceedings against the management personnel of the investor and its investment (\"*Procedimientos*  [REDACTED]\"), the Respondent first explains the basic features of [REDACTED] in Mexico. Such proceedings are initiated whenever a complaint signals a likely liability of a legal or natural person for having committed a crime or *ex officio*. The Mexican system fully recognizes the \"presumption of innocence\", protects the constitutional right of defense and safeguards the confidentiality of investigations. Only if sufficient elements are collected at the investigation stage, a [REDACTED] trial will follow with full rights of defense for the accused as well as right to appeal.56 [REDACTED].57\n\nResponse, paras. 52-57.\n\nResponse, para. 118.\n\n70.\n\nIn the light of the above, the Respondent concludes that:\n\n*la Demandante ni siquiera proporcion\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n de alg\u00fan* [REDACTED] *enfrentado por alg\u00fan ejecutivo o trabajador de PEM, o de la propia Demandante. Esto demuestra que las medidas provisionales requeridas por la Demandante son especulativas y \u00fanicamente buscar generar controversia sobre hechos que ni siquiera se explican con claridad en la Solicitud.*58\n\nResponse, para. 58.\n\n**5. The Respondent's Legal Arguments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent elaborates on the applicable legal standards and the five requirements under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention regarding all of the Claimant's requests and in light of previous ICSID cases on provisional measures similar to those requested by the Claimant. Namely, measures enjoining the respondent State from carrying on certain domestic proceedings and actions that would allegedly prejudice the conduct of the arbitral proceedings and cause irreparable damage to a claimant.59\n\nSee above para. 48. The criteria listed are*:* \"*i) que el Tribunal tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n prima facie; ii) que existe un derecho susceptible de protecci\u00f3n; iii) que la medida provisional es necesaria; iv) que la medida solicitada es urgente, y v) la proporcionalidad de la medida frente a los derechos de la contraparte en la controversia, siendo en este caso el Estado mexicano*.\"\n\n72.\n\nPreliminarily, the Respondent states that provisional measures are extraordinary measures \"*which should not be recommended lightly*\" and that the threshold for recommending them is very high.60\n\nResponse, paras. 63-64 with reference to various precedents.\n\n73.\n\nAlso preliminarily, the Respondent challenges the admissibility of the Claimant's request under Article 1134 NAFTA which \"*establece que '[u]n tribunal no podr\u00e1 ordenar el embargo, ni la suspensi\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la medida presuntamente violatoria a la que se refiere el Art\u00edculo 1116 o 1117.*'\". According to the Respondent:\n\n*[a]l pretender suspender el Amparo 12/2021, prohibir declaraciones p\u00fablicas y ordenar devoluciones de IVA, la Solicitud de la Demandante intenta orillar al Tribunal a prejuzgar si tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n y resolver aspectos relacionados con las medidas reclamadas en este arbitraje, lo cual est\u00e1 prohibido en virtud del Art\u00edculo 1134 del TLCAN.*61\n\nResponse, paras. 89-91.\n\n74.\n\nAs to the specific legal standards for granting provisional measures, in respect to the Tribunals' *prima facie* jurisdiction, the Respondent recalls that it has contested the Tribunal's jurisdiction in its *Memorial de Contestaci\u00f3n* and that the Tribunal has not yet examined its objection.62 The Respondent further contends that \"[l]*a Demandada no niega que el Tribunal cuente con la facultad de recomendar medidas provisionales conforme al TLCAN, el Convenio CIADI y las Reglas de Arbitraje del CIADI*.\" However:\n\n*[l]a cuesti\u00f3n a considerar es que el Tribunal no tiene competencia para recomendar las medidas provisionales requeridas por la Demandante, toda vez que el TLCAN no impide a ning\u00fan Estado Parte aplicar su legislaci\u00f3n interna, ni brinda inmunidad en contra de auditor\u00edas e investigaciones penales a cargo de autoridades investigadoras. Las cortes y tribunales dom\u00e9sticos son las \u00fanicas instancias competentes para conocer y resolver la situaci\u00f3n jur\u00eddica de una persona o empresa auditada, demandada o acusada de cometer un il\u00edcito conforme a derecho mexicano.*63\n\nResponse, paras. 67-68.\n\nResponse, para.71.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that, in any case, \"[s]*i el Tribunal determina que cuenta con jurisdicci\u00f3n prima facie para resolver la Solicitud, nada impide que en una etapa posterior estudie y resuelva objeciones jurisdiccionales, y como resultado de ello concluya que es incompetente para conocer de la controversia planteada por la Demandante*.\"64\n\nResponse, para.68, referencing at fn. 61 *PNG v.

The Respondent denies that the provisional measures discussed in the cases relied upon by the Claimant (*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine, Teinver v. Argentina, Quiborax v. Bolivia* and *Finley v. Mexico*) involved relations between domestic proceedings and international arbitrations comparable to those in the present case, Response, paras. 108-110. The Respondent also points out that the ICSID tribunal in *Finley Resources Inc., MWS Management Inc., and Prize Permanent Holdings, LLC v. United Mexican States*, Decision on the Claimants' Application for interim measures, ICSID Case No. ARB/21/25, 26 January 2022, para. 34, RL-0111 stated that the jurisdiction of an international tribunal cannot be affected by facts subsequent to its establishment.\n\nResponse, para. 115. According to Respondent, \"[e]*l otorgamiento de una medida se da con objeto de evitar un da\u00f1o sustancial o irreparable a los derechos de una de las partes, el cual debe de estar relacionado con la integridad del proceso arbitral, es decir, debe de existir una amenaza clara y sustancial que ponga en riesgo la capacidad de alguna de las partes para continuar con el arbitraje*\", Response, para. 96.\n\n77.\n\nAs to the criterion that provisional measures may be warranted to avoid the aggravation of a dispute, the Respondent submits that the furtherance of domestic proceedings by Mexico authorities (such as the *amparo* and the assessment and recovery of taxes) in which the Claimant and PEM are allowed to fully exercise their rights are not aggravating the dispute.69 Moreover the Claimant has failed to sufficiently identify the [REDACTED] that it has criticized.70\n\nResponse, paras. 120-127, relying on *Plama Consortium Limited v.

En este caso la reanudaci\u00f3n de operaciones no es un factor porque PEM no ha cesado sus operaciones en la mina San Dimas. Por lo tanto, las declaraciones de los funcionarios mexicanos a medios de comunicaci\u00f3n no han afectado negativamente el derecho de PEM a realizar sus operaciones.*72\n\nResponse, paras. 132-133, referring to *Legacy Vulcan, LLC v.

According to the Respondent, \"[u]*na medida es 'necesaria' si tiene como finalidad prevenir que los derechos de una parte sean afectados por un 'da\u00f1o irreparable'. En otras palabras, debe existir una amenaza clara y sustancial a la capacidad de una parte de continuar con el proceso arbitral. Adem\u00e1s, el posible da\u00f1o debe estar relacionado con la integridad procesal del arbitraje y no con cuestiones ajenas a \u00e9ste.

Even in case of an unfavorable decision in the *amparo*, the arbitration proceeding would not be affected and could continue, as the Claimant itself recognizes.76\n\nResponse, paras. 153-157 with reference to the Request, para. 136.\n\n83.\n\nThe same holds true, according to the Respondent, with respect to the non-availibility of the VAT refunds (which the Respondent argues are in any case available to PEM since Mexican tribunals \"*concedieron la suspensi\u00f3n definitiva a PEM, permiti\u00e9ndole manejar de manera libre las cuentas aseguradas por el excedente de la cantidad que constituy\u00f3 la inmovilizaci\u00f3n, hasta en tanto se resuelva el fondo del asunto*\").77 The Respondent further argues that this is also the case \"*con relaci\u00f3n a supuestas auditor\u00edas, recaudaciones fiscales o el inicio de procesos civiles o penales en contra de personas relacionadas con la Demandante*\"78\n\nResponse, para. 160.\n\nResponse, para. 162.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the requested provisional measures are moreover not \"urgent\" (condition (iv)) and thus cannot be granted since urgency (which is closely related to necessity) is in any case required as international case law abundantly confirms.79\n\nResponse, paras. 166-168.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent submits that since no relevant development has happened in the domestic proceedings on which the Claimant focuses since the initiation of this arbitration, the lack of urgency is shown in the first place by the Claimant having waited until now to present its Request.80 The suspension of the *amparo* is not urgent since a (negative) decision is not imminent and, in any case, would not risk to cause an irreparable damage to the Claimant's rights.81\n\nResponse para.173-175, relying on *Sergei Viktorovich Pugachov v. Russian Federation*, Interim Award, 7 July 2017, UNCITRAL, para. 250, RL-0099.\n\nResponse, para.171.\n\n86.\n\nThe same can be said with respect to the VAT refund issue, since \"*la Demandante tiene la facultad de requerir, en su solicitud de devoluci\u00f3n, que los montos sean transferidos a cualquier otra cuenta bancaria que considere conveniente sin la intervenci\u00f3n de este Tribunal*.\"82 As to the press releases, the Respondent points out that \"*lo que realmente no explica la Demandante es que tales declaraciones ocurrieron en 2020, 2021 y 2022. El transcurso de tiempo le resta credibilidad a los argumentos de la Demandante sobre la supuesta \"urgencia\" de las medidas*.\"83\n\nResponse, para. 172.\n\nResponse, para.177.\n\n87.\n\nAs to the last (v) requirement (proportionality of the measures), according to the Respondent, it is necessary \"*que el Tribunal realice un balance entre el supuesto da\u00f1o causado o inminente a la parte solicitante de la medida provisional y la posible afectaci\u00f3n que la medida provisional solicitada causar\u00e1 a la contraparte,* i.e.*, a M\u00e9xico.*\"84 The measures sought would \"unduly encroach on the State's sovereignty and activities serving public interests\" with respect to: (i) the judicial *amparo* proceedings, (establishing a sort of inadmissible \"*mecanismo judicial supranational*\"); (ii) the SAT activities (whose possible negative effects on PEM have been suspended pursuant to PEM's judicial recourse); and (iii) the right of public officials to issue statements to the press (which do not aggravate the pending arbitration).85\n\nResponse, para. 180.\n\nResponse, paras. 184-186.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimant's requests would breach the proportionality requirement. The Respondent relies on *Caratube II v. Kazakhstan*, in which the tribunal considered that a proportional measure must be \"*appropriate*,\" which implies balancing the interests at stake of the parties and taking into account that the respondent is a sovereign State.86 The Respondent submits that the provisional measure consisting of the stay of the *amparo* proceeding does not comply with the principle of proportionality and would violate the Constitution of Mexico, its laws, and the independence of the judiciary.\n\n*International Oil Company LLP & Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 4 December 2014, RL-0097.\n\n89.\n\nBased on the above arguments, the Respondent urges the Tribunal to reject all of the Claimant's requests for provisional measures.\n\n**IV. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicable Legal Principles**\n----------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal to decide on the Request is to summarize the applicable principles for granting provisional measures, based on the relevant provisions in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 1134 of the NAFTA, and in light of previous case law. Previous arbitral decisions on provisional measures offer an important guidance, both because the provisions mentioned are in part generic, and because previous decisions offer a variety of circumstances, some similar to those at hand in the present dispute, in the context of which such requests have been submitted and analyzed by investment tribunals.87\n\nAlthough the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules are not applicable to this arbitration (which is governed by the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules), Rule 47 of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules provides some clarity by describing provisional measures as measures to \"*(a) prevent action that is likely to cause current or imminent harm to that party or prejudice to the arbitral process; (b) maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute; or (c) preserve evidence that may be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.*\"\n\n91.\n\nAccording to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 \"provisional measures\" in the form of \"recommendations\" may be granted by a tribunal, at the request of a party, to \"preserve the respective rights of either party.\" According to Article 1134 of the NAFTA, interim measures of protection may be ordered or recommended by a tribunal to \"preserve the rights of a disputing party\" or \"to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction be made fully effective\", or \"to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"88\n\nThe distinction between recommendations and orders does not appear to be relevant because it is generally admitted that \"*tribunals have developed a doctrine under which provisional measures have binding effects on the parties,*\" Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., *Commentary to Article 47*, para. 21, CL-0085.\n\n92.\n\nThe Parties do not significantly differ on the substantive requirements, conditions or elements that are necessary to grant provisional measures under those provisions, but differ as to their contour, exact content, their respective importance and, of course, as to their presence or absence in respect of the Claimant's Request. While the Claimant has referred to them throughout the presentation of its various requests, the Respondent has listed them as five requirements or elements that must be present for provisional measures to be granted.89 The Tribunal rephrases them hereunder as appropriate to deal with the matter before it.\n\nResponse, para. 4, see above Section III.B.\n\n93.\n\nThose requirements are (a) that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction; (b) that the provisional measures are aimed at protecting, while the dispute is pending, either a substantive right of the requesting party, (c) or a procedural right, notably as to the integrity of the arbitral process, the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration, and/or are aimed at avoiding the aggravation of the dispute (maintaining the *status quo* while the dispute is pending); (d) from actions by the other party that are likely to cause an actual or imminent serious (irreparable) harm to the above rights, so that the requested measures appear to be necessary (proportionate) and urgent. Moreover, the measures are by their nature provisional, *i.e.*, temporary, and must not prejudge the final decision of the dispute.90\n\nSee generally Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., Commentary to Article 47, para. 83 ff, CL-0085.\n\n94.\n\nIn this arbitration under NAFTA, an additional condition for granting interim measures under Article 1134 NAFTA is that such measures must not \"enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.\"\n\n95.\n\nAs to (a), that the Tribunal have *prima facie* jurisdiction to decide on the Request, this requirement means that there has to be an appearance of a proper basis for the Tribunal to rule upon the dispute, such as the existence and applicability of a treaty under which the claimant is qualified to bring against the respondent the pending dispute, which ICSID has duly registered.91 A finding of *prima facie* jurisdiction at this stage, *ratione temporis, materiae, personae,* is without prejudice of further analysis as to jurisdiction and the merits in subsequent stages of the proceedings.92\n\nSee to this effect Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., Commentary to Article 47, para. 64, CL-0085.\n\nSee Response, para. 68 and the references cited there at fn 67.\n\n96.\n\nAs to (b), the protection of both substantive and procedural rights can be the object and aim of provisional measures. As to *substantive rights*, such measures may aim at avoiding that the rights that a claimant accuses the respondent to breach in violation of an international obligation not be irreparably prejudiced or destroyed while the case is pending. The *prima facie* existence of such rights must be shown. As to *procedural rights*, the integrity and exclusivity of the arbitration, and the avoidance of aggravation of the dispute (maintaining the *status quo*) may come into play. In this respect, provisional measures have been issued by ICSID tribunals against actions by a respondent State that would have interfered with the carrying out of the arbitration. This could be the case of domestic proceedings which might jeopardize the impartiality and fairness of the arbitration or hamper a party's or its counsel and experts unincumbered right to participate in the proceedings.93\n\nSee *International Oil Company LLP & Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 4 December 2014, para.137, RL-0097. The tribunal held that \"a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding [REDACTED] conducted by a state.\"\n\n97.\n\nAs to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings, as provided in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, tribunals have reaffirmed that \"the parties to a dispute over which ICSID has jurisdiction must refrain from any measure capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision,\" such as (\"parallel\") proceedings in any other forum in respect of the subject matter of the dispute before ICSID.94\n\n*Tokios Tokol\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1, dated 1 July 2003, para. 2, CL-0085 and CL-0089.\n\n98.\n\nThe non-aggravation of the dispute (maintaining the *status quo*), in compliance with the general obligation to conduct arbitration in good faith, so not to hinder the resolution of the dispute, can concern avoiding heightened tension between the parties, may aim at ensuring the confidentiality of the arbitration and may entail the stay of domestic proceedings.95\n\nThis is a common feature at the basis of provisional measures orders, see for the discussion of relevant cases generally Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., *Commentary to Article 47*, para. 191 ff, CL-0085.\n\n99.\n\nAs to (d) (preventing actual or imminent serious, possibly irreparable, harm), the actions by the other party which a provisional measure is aimed at preventing or blocking must be such as to cause or threat to cause an actual or imminent serious harm to the rights to the requesting party while the case is pending. On the other hand, the substantive rights which a claimant aims at protecting *lite pendente* are not definitely ascertained as long as there is no decision on the merits. The protection of such a \"putative\" right of a claimant must therefore be balanced with the need not to excessively limit the other party in carrying out activities which for the time being appear to be legitimate.96\n\nSee *Sergei Pausok, et al. v. Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Order on interim Measures of 2 September 2008, para 55, RL-0090.\n\n100.\n\nHence, the paramount requirement is that provisional measures be necessary to protect such rights, appropriate to preserve the *status quo* and to avoid serious, in principle irreparable, harm to a right of the requesting party, even if disputed.97\n\n*Alleged Violations of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights (Iran v. USA)*, CIJ, Order, 3 October 2018, para 77 (\"*The Court, pursuant to Article 41 of its Statute, has the power to indicate provisional measures when there is a risk that irreparable prejudice could be caused to rights which are the subject of judicial proceedings or when the alleged disregard of such rights may entail irreparable consequences*.\"), RL-0112; *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Rep\u00fablica de Chile*, Caso CIADI No. ARB/98/2, Decisi\u00f3n sobre la adopci\u00f3n de medidas provisionales solicitadas por las partes, 25 de septiembre de 2001, paras. 2, 18-19, 20-6, RL-0113.\n\n101.\n\nOn the other hand, the concept of \"necessity\" also entails a notion of proportionality between the measure and its objective, in that a measure that goes beyond what is (strictly) necessary to avoid (additional) harm ceases to be necessary, would not be proportionate to the need, nor balanced considering the right of the opposing party.98\n\nSee *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 59, RL-0114.\n\n102.\n\nThe requirement of urgency is inherent to the nature of provisional measures, since they are based on the premise that the protection of a party's right may not wait until a decision is taken in the merits at the end of the proceedings, and/or that these must be ensured immediately as to their proper conduct while pending (integrity). Therefore, the action of the other party that is being enjoined must be imminent and likely to cause prejudice *medio tempore* while the dispute is pending.99\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 89, RL-0114.\n\n103.\n\nIt is in light of these criteria that the Tribunal, based on the arguments of the Parties, will deal with the Claimant's requests that the Tribunal enjoin the Respondent from carrying out certain activities (judicial proceedings, press releases, tax assessments and enforcement, [REDACTED] against employees) that may cause serious (irreparable) prejudice to its rights, aggravate the dispute, and prejudice the integrity and exclusivity of the arbitration.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Evaluation of the Claimant's Requests for Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal observes at the outset that, as far as it results from the Parties' briefs, the Parties are not in agreement on the characterization of Mexico's actions that the Claimant asks to be enjoined, or on the impact, immediate, likely or threatened, that they may have on the Claimant's rights and on the regular conduct of the arbitration. In light of this situation, in its Procedural Order No. 4 the Tribunal posed a number of questions to the Parties to be answered during the Hearing to clarify the factual situation and asked them to supply chronological tables of the various relevant developments. The answers of the Parties at the Hearing provided some clarity but have not dispelled all doubts. The Tribunal will nevertheless duly take into consideration those answers to resolve as far as possible the above factual doubts.\n\n**1.** ***Prima Facie*** **Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAs to the Tribunal having *prima facie* jurisdiction on the dispute, the Tribunal considers that this is undoubtedly the case. The Claimant's Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID on 31 March 2021, following a preliminary examination by the Secretary-General in conformity with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent has not challenged that the Claimant is a Canadian company entitled to bring an arbitration against Mexico also *ratione temporis* as provided by the \"legacy provisions\" of Annex 14-c of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (\"USMCA\") which has replaced the NAFTA.\n\n106.\n\nThe fact that the Respondent has raised a jurisdictional objection to the Claimant's action *ratione materiae* based on Article 2103(1) of the NAFTA (exclusion of tax measures from the dispute settlement mechanism of NAFTA Chapter 11) does not exclude that the Tribunal has currently *prima facie* jurisdiction to entertain the dispute and conduct proceedings, in any case until this exception has been adjudicated. The further course of the proceedings has been decided by the Tribunal in agreement with the Parties in Procedural Order No. 1, which covers its course up to further determinations concerning the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits.\n\n107.\n\nIt is now time for the Tribunal to examine each of the various requests of the Claimant to determine whether the conditions for the granting of the provisional measures are met.\n\n**2. Suspension of the** ***Amparo*** **Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nAs summarized above, the *amparo* proceedings currently pending before the Collegiate Court were initiated by PEM, the Claimant's Mexican investment, to challenge the decision of the TFJA of 2020 by which the TFJA annulled with retroactive effects the 2010 APA. By means of the APA (an administrative act), SAT in 2012 had accepted [REDACTED] for the sales of PEM's mine's silver to foreign related companies (\"Streaming Agreement\") as a basis to calculate PEM's revenues for the years 2010-2013. In turn, the decision of the TFJA was issued at the conclusion of a judicial proceeding initiated by SAT in 2015 in which PEM exercised its full rights to contradict and defend the validity of the APA.\n\n109.\n\nAs mentioned above,100 the Claimant lists two reasons in support of its request that the *amparo* proceedings be stayed.\n\nSee above Section III.A.2.a.\n\n110.\n\nFirst, to ensure the \"protection of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\" Under this heading the Claimant argues that the domestic *amparo* proceedings \u2013 which allegedly have been marred by political interference \u2013 contradict the exclusive jurisdiction of this Tribunal to resolve the dispute in accordance with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. The Claimant recalls that the arbitration is meant to establish under the NAFTA \"what rights are owed to Claimant and its investment, under relevant international law principles and treaties*,*\"101 \"without its process being up-ended or usurped in whole or in part by the Mexican courts and administrative decision-makers.\"102\n\nRequest, paras. 48, 50.\n\nRequest, paras. 39-40.\n\n111.\n\nSecondly, to avoid the \"irreparable harm\" that Claimant and its investment would allegedly suffer should the current status of the APA not be preserved, by preventing a possibly unfavorable decision of the Collegiate Court. In such a case, \"PEM's legal right to defend against the unlawfulness of the amounts claimed by SAT as taxes, penalties, interest and surcharges\" would be \"immediately extinguished under Mexican law.\" [REDACTED]103 [...]\n\nRequest, paras. 55, 163, 137, and Hearing Transcript, p. 48 ff.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"the Collegiate Court ruling on PEM's *amparo* request, if negative and rendered before the Tribunal makes its final award, will cause the Claimant and PEM irreparable harm particularly if leave to appeal to the Mexican Supreme Court is refused.\"104\n\nRequest, para. 103.\n\n113.\n\nIn order to determine exactly what impact the decision of the TFJA may have on the Claimant, the Tribunal posed various questions to the Parties. From theirs answers at the Hearing the Tribunal has gathered the following factual conclusions:105\n\n(a) It is undisputed that the *amparo* proceedings were initiated by PEM in 2021 to challenge the decision of the 2020 TFJA which had annulled the 2010 APA pursuant to an annulment request of SAT (*Juicio de Lesividad)*.\n\n(b) Since an *amparo* proceeding against the TFJA decision is pending, the annulment decision of the TFJA is not effective and the APA is still in force.106\n\n(c) The decision by the Collegiate Court, which is expected not before some months, may be favorable or unfavorable to PEM:\n\n(i) If the decision is favorable, the annulment of the APA will be cancelled or revoked so that the APA will remain in force. SAT, however, may appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Mexico which will finally decide the issue.107\n\n(ii) If the decision of the TFJA is unfavorable to PEM, the annulment of the APA will be confirmed, but PEM may appeal to the Supreme Court. In this case, the annulment of the APA by the TFJA will continue to be suspended until a final decision.108\n\nSee List of Questions, Annex D to Procedural Order No. 4.\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 88-89 (Respondent's statement).\n\nThe Supreme Court could also annul the TFJA judgment only in part and remand the case to it. Hearing Transcript, p.49.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 50 (Respondent's answer).\n\n114.\n\nThe *amparo* proceeding is thus likely to go on for some time before the TFJA and, in all likelihood, before the Supreme Court, without the annulment of the APA becoming effective, if at all. In light of this factual situation and considering the applicable legal principle highlighted above, the Tribunal concludes that the continuation of the *amparo* proceedings does not entail an imminent threat of a serious prejudice or harm to the Claimant's rights, so that the issuance of a provisional measure to stay the proceedings would not be justified.\n\n115.\n\nMoreover, the consequences of the annulment of the APA feared by the Claimant are far from certain or even likely, based on the limited evidence supplied by the Claimant. The Tribunal has received no figures upon which it could conclude, with some certainty, that such a development \u2013 assuming tentatively that the annulment of the APA would be in breach of the NAFTA \u2013 would lead to the bankruptcy of PEM, assuming that such an event might be defined as irreparable, insofar that it could not be fully compensated by monetary damages.\n\n116.\n\nAs to the other ground put forth by the Claimant in support of its request, the Tribunal is not convinced that the continuation of the *amparo* proceeding, or in any case a decision of the *amparo* challenge, is incompatible with the integrity and exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings.\n\n117.\n\nFirst of all, from a purely *legal* point of view, the ICSID arbitration is unaffected by the fact that the *amparo* proceeding is pending before the courts of Mexico or by whatever final decision these courts may issue concerning the validity of the APA. This Tribunal /-PZ will continue exercising its responsibilities in this case, steering it to a final decision according to the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and the various procedural orders, issued or to be issued in the future, irrespective of the development of the *amparo* case.\n\n118.\n\nThe legal and factual divide that distinguishes the domestic *amparo* proceedings from this arbitration makes it unlikely that the latter may be *factually* negatively affected by the first one, *e.g*., in the sense that a forthcoming final decision of the *amparo* on the validity of the APA would render the ICSID award inutile. The two proceedings have different objects: the present proceedings must determine whether the Claimant is right in claiming that Mexico has breached certain standards of treatment laid down in the NAFTA by annulling the APA (or possibly by the very initiation by SAT of the *Lesividad* annulment proceedings). In the *amparo* proceedings, PEM challenges that same annulment under Mexican law. Should PEM prevail before the Mexican courts, the ICSID arbitration might become moot in respect of that claim because the alleged breach of the NAFTA would have been cured at the domestic level.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unconvinced that the continuation of the *amparo* proceedings would aggravate the dispute in such a way that a stay would be warranted. This is so, first, because, as highlighted above, the two proceedings, domestic and international, are situated at different levels. Additionally, it appears contradictory to hold that the regular prosecution of the *amparo*, which has been filed by PEM *before* the initiation of the ICSID proceedings in the furtherance of the Claimant's interests, could aggravate the ICSID dispute, which has also been initiated by the Claimant.\n\n**3. Prohibition of Press Releases (Statements to the Media)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nAs recalled above,109 the Claimant has requested a provisional remedy prohibiting the President of Mexico, the Minister of Economy and government officials generally, from making derogatory media statements (such as the ones made in the past), which the Claimant considers necessary for the prevention of the aggravation of the dispute, to preserve its rights and avoid irreparable harm.\n\nSee above Section III.A.2.b.\n\n121.\n\nIn order to support its request, the Claimant relies on previous decisions on provisional measures of ICSID tribunals such as in *Biwater v. Tanzania* and *Legacy Vulcan v. Mexico*.110 In *Biwater* the tribunal recommended that high authorities of the respondent State cease or abstain from \"the prosecution of the dispute in the media or in other public fora, or the uneven reporting and disclosure of documents or other parts of the record in parallel with a pending arbitration,\" considering that such actions \"may aggravate or exacerbate the dispute and may impact upon the integrity of the proceedings\".111\n\nSee the reference at the following footnotes.\n\nRequest, para. 119; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3, dated 29 September 2006, para. 135, CL-0086.\n\n122.\n\nAs to *Legacy Vulcan v. Mexico*, the Claimant points out the tribunal's finding that \"*public comments made by Mexico's President on Claimant's claims and damages sought in these proceedings jeopardise the integrity of the arbitral process and are tantamount to prosecution of the dispute in the media and other public fora, contrary to the non-aggravation of the dispute,*\" causing \"*irreparable*\" harm.112\n\nRequest, para. 74; *Legacy Vulcan, LLC v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/1, Procedural Order No. 7, dated 11 July 2022, para. 93, CL-0091.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that such focused public statements by high authorities of the respondent State, singling out a specific foreign investor, criticizing the legitimate recourse by it to international arbitration and presenting the dispute in an unfavorable light may aggravate the dispute and jeopardize the integrity of the arbitral process, so to warrant the issuance of a provisional recommendation restraining such conduct.\n\n124.\n\nAn examination of the exhibits that the Claimant has introduced to document the conduct of Mexican authorities as to this request does not show, however, that these authorities have engaged in this type of objectionable conduct towards the Claimant or PEM. The stenographic version of the press conference of the President of Mexico of 7 February 2022 does mention First Majestic as a Canadian mining company that has an open dispute with SAT on the payment of taxes and that the Mexican authorities believe that the company, similarly to other foreign companies (also named), are not paying them correctly. The tone is however informative, although understandably the point of view of the government is stressed. The statement acknowledges that the dispute is pending both in international arbitration and before the Mexican judiciary; it concludes with the President expressing full faith in the objectivity of the judiciary in respect of the dispute.113 The Tribunal does not find that such a statement (which dates about one year back) can be considered improper in view of the pending arbitration and capable of interfering with it. In fact, the arbitration has proceeded regularly since.\n\nSee Request, para. 73 referencing *Versi\u00f3n estenogr\u00e1fica de la conferencia de prensa matutina del presidente Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador*, dated 7 February 2022, p. 1, C-0003, p. 89, where the reference to First Majestic (named by the journalist questioning the President and not by him) is found at pp. 103-105 of the transcript. Relevant passages are as follows: \"*Interlocutora: Presidente durante la conferencia del 22 de febrero de 2021 inform\u00f3 que en Tayoltita, Durango, la minera First Majestic se negaba a pagar impuestos, por lo que usted pidi\u00f3 al embajador de Canad\u00e1 en M\u00e9xico, Graeme Clark, solicite a la compa\u00f1\u00eda cumplir con sus obligaciones fiscales. Hoy sabemos que esta empresa sigue litigando en tribunales internacionales y que incluso est\u00e1 esperando un fallo de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n para dejar de pagar m\u00e1s de 11 mil millones de pesos a M\u00e9xico por la extracci\u00f3n de los minerales preciosos de la naci\u00f3n. En este sentido, presidente, \u00bfcu\u00e1l ha sido el resultado del acercamiento que tuvo usted con el embajador? Y tambi\u00e9n tenemos entendido que con el primer ministro Justin Trudeau se trat\u00f3 de este tema. Presidente Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador: S\u00ed, con las mineras canadienses tenemos s\u00f3lo dos asuntos, o tenemos dos asuntos, queda uno, queda este que es fiscal y s\u00ed lo trat\u00e9 con el primer ministro Trudeau. El de Cosal\u00e1 ya est\u00e1 resuelto, pero s\u00ed nos queda pendiente el de Tayolita, Durango, porque es un asunto fiscal, no quieren pagar impuestos. Interlocutora: Alegan discriminaci\u00f3n fiscal en tribunales internacionales. Presidente Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador: S\u00ed, s\u00ed, s\u00ed. Entonces, s\u00ed existe una denuncia de parte nuestra que est\u00e1 resolvi\u00e9ndose en el Poder Judicial que lo que t\u00fa sostienes. Voy a ver c\u00f3mo va, pero estamos pendientes y afortunadamente en el Poder Judicial se est\u00e1 actuando con rectitud en este caso*.\"\n\n125.\n\nThe same can be said about the more recent statement of December 2022 of the Minister of the Economy (previously head of SAT) which, according to the Claimant \"has continued to malign Canadian mining companies as being corrupt, with specific reference to the Claimant.\"114 The Tribunal notes that the statement complained of by the Claimant consists of an isolated sentence reported from an article in an economic magazine (the echo of whose publication, even if accurate, the Tribunal cannot evaluate) where the Claimant is not named.115 Even admitting that the statement *per se*, if correctly reported, would be objectionable if not supported by evidence or based on the result of objective investigations, it does not appear to the Tribunal that such a statement may affect (or has affected) the proper conduct of this arbitration, in light of the criteria applied by other ICSID tribunals mentioned above.\n\nRequest, para. 73, fn 129: \"See *Sector minero no tributa y es corrupto: Econom\u00eda, El Economista,* dated December 7, 2022, p. 1 (quoting Buenrostro: *'*they do not want to pay their taxes, because there was a person who worked in the SAT and had a brother who worked in an office, and they gave them an interpretation according to criteria')\", C-0047.\n\nThe relevant sentence of the interview to the Minister in the article C-0047 is textually \"*Buenrostro narr\u00f3 el caso de una empresa extranjera que lleva a cabo un juicio legal con la Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda, en la que argumenta 'discriminaci\u00f3n', cuando 'no quieren pagar sus impuestos, porque hab\u00eda una persona que trabajaba en el SAT, y ten\u00eda un hermano que trabajaba en el despacho, y les hicieron una interpretaci\u00f3n de criterio a modo'. Ella abund\u00f3 que este juicio est\u00e1 en la Suprema Corte de Justicia y, con ese criterio, la empresa decidi\u00f3 no pagar impuestos durante 10 a\u00f1os*\". The Tribunal does not see in these comments any public \"naming and shaming\" media campaign against the Claimant, or \"using the press to publicly brand First Majestic as a [REDACTED]\" as the Claimant alleges, Request, para. 122.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the conditions for enjoining Mexican authorities to abstain from expressing similar statements in the future are not met.\n\n**4. Availability of VAT Refunds**\n----------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nAs highlighted above,116 the Claimant complains that tax refunds owed to PEM have been deposited, without PEM's authorization, in accounts of PEM that have been blocked by SAT pursuant to pending tax enforcement proceedings. The Claimant seeks an order restraining SAT from continuing to deposit VAT refunds on accounts that PEM cannot use so to ensure that the *status quo* is preserved and so not to exacerbate the dispute.117\n\nSee above Section III.A.2.c.\n\nRequest, paras 79, 83. The Claimant refers in support of its request to *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, dated 29 June 2009, para. 59, CL-0093, whereby that tribunal granted a provisional measure against the seizure of the oil production by Ecuador for the purpose of \"preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute.\"\n\n128.\n\nAfter having examined the Claimant's Request and the Respondent's Response, the exact factual situation has remained unclear to the Tribunal. The Claimant has specified that it \"is not seeking to have the freezing of PEM's bank accounts undone including the funds that were on deposit at the time of the seizure, which could be viewed as directed at a measure being challenged in this arbitration,\" contrary to the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA.118 The Respondent, on the other hand, has stated that VAT refunds are paid into accounts that the taxpayer indicates to the tax authorities in charge to make such payment. It is up to PEM therefore to indicate to these authorities (apparently SAT) on which accounts it wishes to have the VAT refunds deposited, given that such refunds are *per se* are available to PEM.119\n\nRequest, para. 80.\n\nResponse, paras. 34-39. Specifically, \"*la demandada tiene conocimiento que no se le ha negado ninguna de las solicitudes de devoluci\u00f3n que PEM ha presentado mensualmente,*\" at para. 36.\n\n129.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant's request concerns future deposits and not the amounts already deposited in the past.120 On the other hand, the unblocking of these previously deposited amounts would not be a proper object of a provisional measure because it would be a sort of anticipation of a decision on the merits on this issue.\n\nSee Request, para 80. The Claimant's request concerns however \"payments of VAT refunds owed to PEM as to the filing of the Request for Arbitration\" as well as \"all future payments\" (at para.78). The Tribunal considers however that a provisional measure of the type requested by the Claimant, concerning the VAT refunds to which PEM is entitled, in order not to aggravate the dispute and to maintain the *status quo*, cannot cover actions by the Respondent that predate the relevant request (4 January 2023).\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal has felt the need to ask for clarifications to the Parties, which they provided during the Hearing, as to the reasons why the payments were made on these blocked accounts and as to what would prevent future deposits to be made at PEM's request on other accounts that are freely at its disposal.121\n\nSee Hearing Transcript, pp. 105-110.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal must say that the factual situation has not been fully clarified by the Parties. According to the Respondent, past deposits were made on those accounts because those were the accounts indicated by PEM for such purposes.122\n\nSee Response, para. 33. According to the Respondent, those accounts had been blocked by SAT in order to ensure payments allegedly due by PEM under the (re-) assessments, although tax collection under the latter have been judicially suspended as a result of PEM's challenges against them, see Counter-Memorial, para. 260; Hearing Transcript, p. 104.\n\n132.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent at the Hearing stated that it is for PEM to indicate to the tax authorities the accounts in which it intends to receive VAT refunds.123 It is not clear to the Tribunal whether this means that since the amounts of VAT to be refunded in the future pertain to PEM and PEM can freely use them, if PEM indicates to SAT other unblocked accounts in which it wishes to have the tax refunds deposited, SAT will do so.\n\nSee Hearing Transcript pp. 75-76: \"*in connection with VAT refund procedures, we have explained that it is the Claimant itself who has the possibility of choosing the bank accounts in which it wishes refunds to be made. This obviously does not require the Tribunal's involvement*.\"\n\n133.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal considers that if SAT were to block further payments of future VAT refunds owed to PEM, this would aggravate the dispute and affect the *status quo*.\n\n134.\n\nIn light of the principles recalled above124 governing the issuance of provisional measures intended to avoid the aggravation of the dispute and maintain the *status quo* while the arbitration is pending, the Tribunal grants the following provisional measure: the Tribunal recommends to the Respondent not to block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant's Request (4 January 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending, and that such payments be made into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM.125\n\nSee above Section IV.A.\n\nThe Tribunal considers appropriate to remind here that although provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are labelled \"recommendations\", ICSID tribunals have consistently held that such provisional measures have a binding effect on the parties, see Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., Commentary to Article 47, para. 21, CL-0085, with reference to relevant case law at paras. 21-32, concluding at para.32 that \"there is now almost universal acceptance that provisional measures have binding force.\" The Tribunal shares this view, based also on Article 1134 of the NAFTA on \"Interim Measures of Protection,\" which authorizes tribunals to issue orders and not only recommendations to this effect.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that the above recommendation is not prevented by the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA against provisional measures that would \"enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.\" This is because the denial by SAT of PEM's free access to future VAT refunds is not a measure challenged by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration nor discussed in its Memorial.\n\n**5. Stay of Enforcement, Transfer Pricing Audits and [REDACTED]**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nUnder this heading the Claimant complains, as mentioned above,126 that Mexican authorities have proceeded with tax reassessments for the years 2010-2013 and tax investigations and audits for the subsequent years, without taking into account the existence /2z7 of the APA and the methodology provided there for the determination of transfer prices. The Claimant also complains of [REDACTED].127\n\nSee above Section III.A.2.d\n\nRequest, paras. 97 and 148.\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant considers that such actions breach the *status quo* and aggravate the dispute. It requests the Tribunal to issue a provisional measure to stay all such proceedings to avoid the exacerbation of the dispute, as well as delays in and the disruption of the current arbitration proceedings, and irreparable harm to its business.\n\n138.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these actions are carried out in the normal exercise of administrative functions, equally applicable to any taxpayer, in respect of which the Claimant is exercising its own right of defense. The Respondent complains of the vagueness of the Claimant complains, particularly as to the [REDACTED] it mentions, which are in any case conducted in strict compliance with [REDACTED] and other applicable statutes.128\n\nResponse, para. 47.\n\n139.\n\nWhile the Claimant and the Respondent have provided information as to the tax proceedings mentioned, the Claimant has remained vague as to the [REDACTED] and prosecutions it complains of. The Tribunal is therefore not in the position to determine whether and how these investigations relate to the subject matter of the arbitration. In any case, there is no evidence that such proceedings and investigation have disrupted in any way the arbitration or have not respected the Claimant's right of defense.\n\n140.\n\nAs to tax assessments and audits, notwithstanding the additional information sought by the Tribunal and submitted by the Parties at the Hearing, the factual and legal basis of these actions has remained uncertain, especially as to their relation with the APA and its validity. Since it is acknowledged that the APA concerning export prices to related buyers is applicable only to the years [REDACTED] and is provisionally valid while the *amparo* is /p pending, tax assessments and enforcements for those year appear based on unrelated premises. The same should hold true for the subsequent years. These tax actions by Mexican authorities appear thus not to be directly related to the dispute in this arbitration and unlikely, at present, to aggravate it.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant has not provided evidence that these tax measures are not based on generally applicable Mexican legislation or are intended to harass and single out the Claimant because of its challenge of the APA and other Mexican measure in this arbitration. It is further uncontested that the Claimant and PEM are exercising, with some success, their rights to contradict and oppose, procedurally and in the merits, in those proceedings, having obtained judicial suspensions of the reassessments.129\n\nSee the relevant references at note 122 above.\n\n142.\n\nThe slow path of the proceedings (which are still *sub judice* for all the years since 2010) makes it unlikely, at the present moment, that their outcome may bring irreparable damages to the Claimant's business in Mexico. The Tribunal concludes therefore that the requirements of necessity and urgency are lacking in respect of the provisional measures requested by the Claimant.\n\n**I. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\n1. RECOMMENDS as provisional measure pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 1134 of the NAFTA that the Respondent not block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (4 January 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending, and that such payments be made into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM;\n\n2. REJECTS all other provisional measures requests by the Claimant; and\n\n3. RESERVES for the Award the decision on the allocation of costs resulting from the Request.\n\nDated: 26 May 2023"}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Revocation of Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2023-09-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Revocation of Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

By this PM Decision, the Tribunal recommended, as a provisional measure:\n\n\"*that the Respondent not block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (4 January 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending, and that such payments be made into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM.*\"1\n\nDecision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, 26 May 2023 (\"PM Decision\"), para. 143.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal briefly recalls hereafter the proceedings that lead to the PM Decision by which the Tribunal addressed a Request for a number of provisional measures submitted on 4 January 2023 by Claimant (the \"PM Request\"), on its own behalf and on behalf of its Mexican subsidiary Primero Empresa Minera, S.A. de C.V. (\"PEM\"), on the basis of Article 1134 of the NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n3.\n\nIn its PM Request, Claimant requested that the Tribunal recommend the following provisional measures:\n\n\"*a) The suspension or stay of the proceedings pending before the Collegiate Court, in relation to the amparo relief requested by PEM from the Collegiate Court.*\n\n*b) Requiring the SAT and any other authority working in conjunction with the SAT, to refrain from:*\n\n*i. undertaking any additional enforcement measures, whether [REDACTED], against the Claimant and its investment (and the assets of the investment);*\n\n*ii. undertaking any further tax audits and issuing any additional tax reassessments based on any methodology other than provided for in the APA [REDACTED]; and*\n\n*iii. initiating any proceedings, whether [REDACTED] and its investment, whether in Mexico or residing outside the country, and whether currently or previously employed, in relation to the measures currently under adjudication before this Tribunal and also any settlement offer made to the Respondent (whether or not in compliance with Mexican law formalities) offers made by [REDACTED]*\n\n*c) Requiring the SAT to make all payments of VAT refunds owed to PEM after the filing of the Request for Arbitration and all future VAT refund payments into a newly opened bank account of [REDACTED] that will remain free from SAT's seizure or freezing order; and*\n\n*d) maintaining strict confidentiality of the arbitration proceeding such that no written or other media statements are made by the President of Mexico and any other Mexican government official, concerning the arbitration proceedings or the legal dispute with First Majestic and its investment.*\"2\n\nClaimant's Request for Provisional Measures, 4 January 2023 (\"PM Request\"), para. 153.\n\n4.\n\nIn its PM Request, Claimant indicated that it was seeking those provisional measures on its own behalf and on behalf of its investment (PEM) in order to:\n\n*\"a) fully protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction,*\n\n*b) ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, and*\n\n*c) to preserve their rights as detailed herein.*\"3\n\nPM Request, para. 12.\n\n5.\n\nClaimant specified the purpose of its PM Request as follows:\n\n*\"The provisional measures requested seek to avoid having the Government of Mexico, while this Tribunal is exercising its jurisdiction, from:*\n\n*a) interfering with the Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention to adjudicate the dispute in a neutral manner and in an international forum (and to the exclusion of any domestic process in Mexico), in relation to the measures taken and not taken, that have been identified by the Claimant to be in violation of Chapter 11 of NAFTA;*\n\n*b) exacerbating the dispute including by causing irreparable harm to the Claimant and its investment; and*\n\n*c) impinging on any legal rights of the Claimant and its investment including the ability to carry on its business at the San Dimas Mine which is the source of livelihood for hundreds of its employees and their families in Mexico.*\"4\n\nPM Request, para. 18 (internal references omitted).\n\n6.\n\nOn 10 February 2023, Respondent presented its Response (the \"PM Response\") to Claimant's PM Request, providing its reasoned opposition.\n\n7.\n\nOn 9 March 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the organization of a hearing with the purpose of discussing with the Parties the PM Request (the \"Hearing on Provisional Measures\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 March 2023, the Tribunal held the Hearing on Provisional Measures by video-conference where the Parties elaborated on their respective requests. Subsequently, by letter of 3 April 2023, Claimant informed the Tribunal that on Friday, 31 March 2023, it had served the Government of the United Mexican States with a NAFTA Notice of Intent (\"NOI\") seeking recovery of VAT refunds in the amount of *[REDACTED]*, by submitting a separate new ICSID dispute.5\n\n*See* PM Decision, para. 19. The Tribunal notes here the following, which results from the record of the present case as of today: (a) the NOI has been subsequently submitted by Respondent as R-0201 and by Claimant as C-0048; (b) Claimant has made good on its NOI by filing a Request of Arbitration with ICSID on 30 June 2023 (the last day available for the submission of \"legacy investment claims\" under NAFTA in accordance with USMCA Annex 14-C, *see* Respondent's Revocation Request of Provisional Measures, 19 June 2023 (\"Revocation Request\"), para. 22). Its text has feen filed by Respondent as R-0202; (c) this Request has been registered by ICSID on 21 July 2023 under ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28.\n\n**B. The PM Decision granting a provisional measure and the Tribunal's grounds supporting it**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nBy its PM Decision, the Tribunal granted only one of the provisional measures sought by Claimant, recommending that Respondent:\n\n\"*not block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (4 January 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending, and that such payments be made into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM*.\"6\n\nPM Decision, para. 143.\n\n10.\n\nPreliminarily, the Tribunal recalled the legal basis of its authority to grant the provisional measures requested, to which Claimant had referred \"cumulatively\" in its PM Request, namely: Article 1134 of the NAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, whose texts are reproduced below:\n\n*Article 47 of the ICSID Convention*\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n*Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules: Provisional Measures*7\n\n*(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.*\n\n*(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.*\n\n*Article 1134 of the NAFTA: Interim Measures of Protection*\n\n*A Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.*\n\nText of 2006 in force when this arbitration was initiated and applicable pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, para.1.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that Claimant had referred specifically to Article 1134 of the NAFTA pointing out that, in its view, such provision:\n\n\"*explicitly provides this Tribunal broad discretionary authority to award interim relief to* preserve the rights of a disputing party, protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to ensure that its jurisdiction is made fully effective*, provided the order does not constitute an '\u2026attachment or enjoin the application of measures alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.*'\"8\n\nPM Request, para. 23.\n\n12.\n\nClaimant had added, in relation to the limitation found in the last sentence of Article 1134 of the NAFTA, that \"[n]*one of the provisional measures requested seek to attach or enjoin the application of the measures that have been enumerated by the Claimant to constitute a breach of Mexico's NAFTA obligations*.\"9\n\nPM Decision, para.43, referencing PM Request paras. 24, 80-81.\n\n13.\n\nAs to Claimant's third request (c) that future VAT refunds payable to PEM be made fully accessible and remain free from SAT's seizure or freezing of bank accounts \u2013 which was granted by the Tribunal and is now the object of Respondent's Revocation Request \u2013, the Tribunal first noted Claimant's statement that: \"*PEM has not authorized such VAT refunds being deposited into one or more frozen bank accounts. The SAT has not denied that these VAT refunds are owed to PEM, and yet has continued depositing the VAT refunds into frozen bank accounts without any direction or authorization from PEM*.\"10\n\nPM Request, para. 81.\n\n14.\n\nAs to the reasons put forth by Claimant in respect of the VAT refunds, the Tribunal noted that:\n\n\"*Claimant explains that PEM is entitled to VAT refunds in accordance with Mexican law which are periodically paid to it by SAT on its bank accounts. Currently the equivalent of about [REDACTED] of such refunds, in part as a result of deposits made after the filing of the Request of for Arbitration, are deposited on bank accounts of PEM which have been blocked or seized by SAT as a result of certain tax enforcement and collection measures against PEM. Claimant does not ask that the freezing of the account be lifted (since this would run counter to the prohibition contained in the last sentence of Article 1134 NAFTA) but rather that refunds not be deposited on such frozen account, SAT having 'continued depositing the VAT refunds into frozen bank accounts without any direction or authorization from PEM.*'\"11\n\nPM Decision, para. 42; PM Request, paras. 80-81. These measures are described by Claimant at para. 97, especially at para. 97 (ii) and (v) of its PM Request and appear to be the result of SAT's tax reassessments for the years 2010-2013 in disregard of the APA (whose validity is the object of the *Lesividad* and subsequent amparo proceedings). Claimant indicates that, on average, these VAT refunds payable in the future amount to [REDACTED].\n\n15.\n\nAccording to Claimant, this request, \u2013 i.e., that Respondent not impede the rights and entitlement of Claimant to VAT refunds (\"*which is not in dispute*\") \u2013, seeks to ensure that the *status quo* is preserved so as not to exacerbate the dispute.12\n\nPM Decision, para. 43, referencing PM Request, paras. 79, 83.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted in its PM Decision that Respondent objected to the presentation of the matter by Claimant.13 According to Respondent, SAT had fully refunded, without any reduction upon verification, all VAT refunds that PEM had filed, \"[p]*ara que PEM pueda recibir tales recursos, \u00fanicamente debe indicar en la solicitud de devoluci\u00f3n, la cuenta bancaria a la cual se tiene que realizar el dep\u00f3sito correspondiente. Claramente, esta no es una situaci\u00f3n que requiera la intervenci\u00f3n del Tribunal*.\"14\n\nPM Decision, para. 62, referencing Respondent's Response to the Request for Provisional Measures, 10 February 2023 (\"PM Response\") paras. 37-38.\n\nPM Response, para. 38.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal also took due note that Respondent was challenging the admissibility of Claimant's PM Request under Article 1134 of the NAFTA which \"*establece que '[u]n tribunal no podr\u00e1 ordenar el embargo, ni la suspensi\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la medida presuntamente violatoria a la que se refiere el Art\u00edculo 1116 o 1117*.'\"15 According to Respondent:\n\n\"[a]*l pretender suspender el Amparo 12/2021, prohibir declaraciones p\u00fablicas y ordenar devoluciones de IVA, la Solicitud de la Demandante intenta orillar al Tribunal a prejuzgar si tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n y resolver aspectos relacionados con las medidas reclamadas en este arbitraje, lo cual est\u00e1 prohibido en virtud del Art\u00edculo 1134 del TLCAN.*\"16\n\nPM Response, para. 89.\n\nPM Decision, para. 73, with reference to PM Response, paras.89-91.\n\n18.\n\nAfter having reviewed the Parties' arguments, the PM Decision recapitulated the principles on the granting of provisional measures stemming from the above-quoted ICSID and NAFTA provisions on the matter.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled that:\n\n\"*[a]ccording to Article 47 ICSID and ICSID Rule 39 'provisional measures' in the form of 'recommendations' may be granted by a tribunal, at the request of a party, in order to 'preserve the respective rights of either party.' According to Article 1134 of the NAFTA, interim measures of protection may be ordered or recommended by a tribunal to 'preserve the right of a disputing party' or 'to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction be made fully effective', or 'to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.'*\"*17*\n\nPM Decision, para. 91 (Original footnote 88): \"*The distinction between recommendations and orders does not appear to be relevant because it is generally admitted that 'tribunals have developed a doctrine under which provisional measures have binding effects on the parties*,'\" Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., Commentary to Article 47, para. 21, CL-0085.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that:\n\n\"*The Parties do not significantly differ on the substantive requirements, conditions or elements that are necessary to grant provisional measures under those provisions, but differ as to their contour, exact content, their respective importance and, of course, as to their presence or absence in respect of the Claimant's Request. While the Claimant has referred to them throughout the presentation of its various requests, the Respondent has listed them as five requirements or elements that must be present for provisional measures to be granted.89 The Tribunal rephrases them hereunder as appropriate to deal with the matter before it.*\"18\n\n\"*Those requirements are (a) that the Tribunal has* prima facie *jurisdiction; (b) that the provisional measures are aimed at protecting, while the dispute is pending, either a substantive right of the requesting party, (c) or a procedural right, notably as to the integrity of the arbitral process, the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration, and/or are aimed at avoiding the aggravation of the dispute (maintaining the* status quo *while the dispute is pending); (d) from actions by the other party that are likely to cause an actual or imminent serious (irreparable) harm to the above rights, so that the requested measures appear to be necessary (proportionate) and urgent. Moreover, the measures are by their nature provisional, i.e., temporary, and must not prejudge the final decision of the dispute.*\"19\n\n\"*In this arbitration under NAFTA, an additional condition for granting interim measures under Article 1134 NAFTA is that such*\n\n*measures do not 'enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.*'\"20\n\nPM Decision, para. 92\n\nPM Decision, para. 93.\n\nPM Decision, para. 94.\n\n21.\n\nIn light of these criteria and based on the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal decided to only grant the provisional measure requested by Claimant concerning the VAT refunds, reasoning as follows in the final paragraphs of the PM Decision:\n\n\"*Claimant complains that tax refunds owed to PEM have been deposited, without PEM's authorization, on accounts of PEM that have been blocked by SAT pursuant to pending tax enforcement proceedings. The Claimant seeks an order restraining SAT from continuing to deposit VAT refunds on accounts that PEM cannot use so to ensure that the status quo is preserved and so not to exacerbate the dispute.*\"21\n\n\"*After having examined Claimant's Request and Respondent's Response, the exact factual situation has remained unclear to the Tribunal. Claimant has specified that it 'is not seeking to have the freezing of PEM's bank accounts undone including the funds that were on deposit at the time of the seizure, which could be viewed as directed at a measure being challenged in this arbitration,' contrary to the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA. The Respondent, on the other hand, has stated that VAT refunds are paid into accounts that the taxpayer indicates to the tax authorities in charge to make such payment. It is up to PEM therefore to indicate to these authorities (apparently SAT) on which accounts on which it seeks to obtain payments, which* per se *are available to PEM.*\"22\n\n\"*In this context, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant's request concerns future deposits and not the amounts already deposited in the past.*\"23 \"*On the other hand, the unblocking of these previously deposited amounts would not be a proper object of a provisional measure because it would be a sort of anticipation of a decision on the merits on this issue.*\"24\n\n\"*In light of the principles, recalled above*\"25 \"*governing the issuance of provisional measures intended to avoid the aggravation of the dispute and maintain the* status quo *while the arbitration is pending, the Tribunal grants the following provisional measure (\u2026)*.\"26\n\n\"*Finally, the Tribunal considers that the above recommendation is not prevented by the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA against provisional measures that would 'enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.' This is because the denial by SAT of PEM's free access to future VAT refunds is not a measure challenged by Claimant in its Request for Arbitration nor discussed in its Memorial.*\"27\n\nOriginal footnote 117 at PM Decision, para. 127: PM Request, paras 79, 83. \"*The Claimant refers in support of its request* Burlington Resources, Inc. v.

Respondent's Request of 19 June 2023 for the Revocation of the provisional measure granted by the Tribunal in its PM Decision of 26 May 2023**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nRespondent, first of all, recalls that the Tribunal has the power to reconsider and revoke its provisional measures in accordance with Rule 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.28 On the merits, Respondent refers to the NOI served by Claimant to Respondent on 31 March 2023 by which Claimant notified to Respondent of its intention to initiate an ICSID proceeding, with the following object:\n\n\"*Las acciones del SAT consistentes en negar firmemente que PEM tenga acceso a los fondos respecto de los cuales legalmente tiene derecho a acceder es ilegal conforme a las leyes mexicanas y contraviene las disposiciones del Cap\u00edtulo 11 del TLCAN y, en consecuencia, constituye una disputa en t\u00e9rminos del TLCAN.*\"29\n\nRevocation Request, para. 2.\n\nRevocation Request, para. 4 with reference to NOI, para. 6, R-0201.\n\n23.\n\nMore specifically, Respondent points out Claimant's allegation in the NOI that: \"[l]*as restricciones impuestas por el Gobierno de M\u00e9xico a las devoluciones de IVA supuestamente son violatorias de los Art\u00edculos 1102 (Trato Nacional), 1103 (Trato de Naci\u00f3n M\u00e1s Favorecida), 1105 (Nivel M\u00ednimo de Trato), 1109 (Transferencias) y 1110 (Expropiaci\u00f3n y compensaci\u00f3n) del TLCAN*.\"30\n\nRevocation Request, para. 20.\n\n24.\n\nRespondent explains that, in its view,\n\n\"*la medida provisional dictada en este procedimiento afectar\u00eda el desarrollo de la nueva reclamaci\u00f3n referida en la NOI 2023 de dos maneras.* Primero*, interfiere con el proceso de consultas derivado de la NOI 2023, pues la medida provisional* de facto *suspende la medida que se reclama en este potencial nuevo procedimiento.* Segundo*, siguiendo el mismo razonamiento del p\u00e1rrafo 129 de la Decisi\u00f3n sobre Medidas Provisionales, el efecto de la medida provisional dictada sobre devoluciones del IVA futuras podr\u00eda ser una especie de anticipaci\u00f3n de una decisi\u00f3n sobre el fondo de la nueva reclamaci\u00f3n, lo cual afectar\u00eda el debido proceso.*\"31\n\nRevocation Request, para.7.\n\n25.\n\nIn subsequent paragraphs of its Revocation Request, Respondent expands on its argument that the provisional measure granted in the current case would prejudice the new case between the Parties (now pending as ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28). This is because, in its view, the provisional measure relates to the same facts (the payment by SAT of VAT refunds on PEM's block accounts) that Claimant challenges in the new case as being in breach of NAFTA.\n\n26.\n\nRespondent argues as follows:\n\n\"*30.* [E]*l Tribunal determin\u00f3 que la medida relacionada con las devoluciones de los saldos a favor por concepto de devoluci\u00f3n IVA no contraven\u00eda lo dispuesto en el Art\u00edculo 1134 del TLCAN porque dichas devoluciones futuras no constitu\u00edan una medida reclamada en el arbitraje ARB/21/14. El Tribunal se\u00f1al\u00f3 adem\u00e1s que la medida recomendada se emiti\u00f3 con el fin de evitar agravar la disputa y mantener el* status quo *del arbitraje ARB/21/14 mientras \u00e9ste se encuentre pendiente de resolver.*\n\n*31. No obstante, la Demandada considera que esta recomendaci\u00f3n no tom\u00f3 en consideraci\u00f3n el efecto que tendr\u00eda sobre la nueva controversia notificada en la NOI 2023, el potencial arbitraje que podr\u00eda suscitarse en poco tiempo y la baja probabilidad de que las negociaciones resuelvan la controversia dada la posici\u00f3n de la Demandante. De hecho, recientemente la Demandada recibi\u00f3 una comunicaci\u00f3n de First Majestic en donde se se\u00f1ala que la reclamaci\u00f3n se someter\u00e1 a arbitraje antes del 1 de julio de este a\u00f1o si el Gobierno de M\u00e9xico no accede a sus peticiones.*\n\n*32. La Demandada desea hacer notar al Tribunal que su recomendaci\u00f3n afectar\u00e1 directamente la materia del nuevo arbitraje que se instaure a partir de la NOI 2023, que seguramente incluir\u00eda la presunta interferencia con el derecho legal de PEM a recibir y utilizar las devoluciones, pasadas y futuras, de saldos a favor por concepto de IVA. Esto es as\u00ed porque la medida provisional otorgada por el Tribunal interferir\u00e1 con una medida que es objeto de controversia en un procedimiento independiente al Caso ARB/21/14.*\"32\n\nRevocation Request, paras. 30-32.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent also submits the following:\n\n\"*33. La Demandada tambi\u00e9n encuentra preocupante que, al emitir una recomendaci\u00f3n sobre una medida que es el objeto de otro procedimiento, se est\u00e9n prejuzgando los m\u00e9ritos de ese nuevo caso, incluso antes de haber iniciado el arbitraje. Esto, desde luego, afectar\u00eda el desarrollo del nuevo procedimiento arbitral que inicie a partir de la NOI 2023.*\n\n*34. Como se dijo anteriormente, el Art\u00edculo 1134 del TLCAN proh\u00edbe a un Tribunal ordenar la suspensi\u00f3n de una medida presuntamente violatoria. Es evidente que, si este Tribunal no puede ordenar la suspensi\u00f3n de medidas que son objeto del presente arbitraje ARB/21/14, mucho menos puede recomendar o suspender medidas que ser\u00e1n objeto de un procedimiento independiente cuya resoluci\u00f3n corresponder\u00e1 a otro tribunal.*\"33\n\nRevocation Request, paras. 33-34.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent submits that the NOI (and, by implication, the subsequent initiation of the new ICSID case \u2013 which has in the meantime occurred \u2013) represents a change of the relevant circumstances existing when the provisional measure was granted that allows and justifies its revocation in conformity with Rule 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n\"*27. Las circunstancias que exist\u00edan al momento en que fue otorgada la medida provisional han cambiado a la luz de la presentaci\u00f3n de la NOI 2023 y la inminente solicitud de arbitraje que seguramente se presentar\u00e1 antes del 1 de julio de 2023. Por esta raz\u00f3n, la Demandada considera indispensable que se revoque la medida provisional relacionada con los dep\u00f3sitos futuros por concepto de devoluci\u00f3n de IVA con base en las Reglas 39.3 y 39.4 de las Reglas de Arbitraje a las que hace referencia el \u00b61.1 de la Resoluci\u00f3n Procesal 1 (RP 1).*\"34\n\nRevocation Request, para. 27.\n\n**B. Claimant's Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n29.\n\nClaimant opposes Respondent's Revocation Request and asks the Tribunal to reject it, based on the following reasons. First, Claimants reiterates that PEM is entitled to the VAT refunds at issue. It also complains that Respondent has made misleading statements as to the reasons why the VAT refunds have not been paid into accounts that PEM could freely dispose of and alleges that there were no valid reasons for SAT to block those accounts in the first place.35\n\nClaimant's Reply to Respondent's Request for Revocation of Recommendation of Provisional Measures, 21 July 2023 (\"Reply to Revocation Request\"), paras. 18-61.\n\n30.\n\nClaimant further explains that that it has filed the new case because of the continuing prejudice it is suffering by PEM being deprived of the amount of the VAT refunds to which it is entitled.36 Claimant denies that the filing of the new case is a new fact that warrants the revocation of the provisional measure, arguing as follows:\n\n\"*63. After the Tribunal rendered its Decision, Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration. Both Respondent and the Tribunal were made aware of Claimant's intention to file a Request for Arbitration. This is not a new development or unexpected event and cannot provide grounds for revocation of the Decision.*\n\n*70. In the present case, there are no new material facts or considerations that the Tribunal has not previously addressed. In fact, as discussed, Claimant notified the Tribunal of its NOI with regard to the VAT refunds claim prior to the Tribunal issuing its Decision. As a result, Respondent is merely repeating its arguments from prior submissions and hoping now for a different result.*\"37\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 64-65.\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 63, 70.\n\n31.\n\nClaimant recalls \"*the extremely high threshold for justifying a reversal of the Tribunal's discretionary Decision.*\"38 In this case, the factors that pursuant to ICSID's longstanding practice may justify a tribunal to modify or revoke provisional measures are not present. Such factors are: (1) whether the circumstances underlying its original decision have changed; (2) whether it failed to consider a material fact in the prior record; (3) whether the provisional measures continue to be necessary; and (4) whether a revocation of provisional measures would cause a party irreparable harm.39\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 66-69, quoting *Nova Group Investments, B.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/19, Procedural Order No. 8 Concerning Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of Procedural Order No. 7, 18 April 2017, para. 31, CL-0098: \"*The very nature of the provisional measures analysis involves assessments of the necessity, urgency and proportionality of particular measures at particular points in time, and if the underlying facts have changed that alter the prior calculus, parties should be free to bring these changes to a tribunal's attention. This is different, however, from simply asking a tribunal to 'reconsider' its prior decision based on the exact same evidentiary and legal record as previously presented.*\"\n\nReply to Revocation Request, para. 71.\n\n32.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the existence of changed circumstances is the critical factor for a tribunal's reconsideration of its order of provisional measures.40 But, according to Claimant, \"*Respondent's argument that the NOI is a 'changed circumstance' is entirely misplaced*.\"41\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 74-75, with reference to *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania* (I), ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Final Award, 11 December 2013, para. 111, CL-0097 *\"[The tribunal] further considered that the circumstances \u2026 had not changed to such an extent as to warrant revocation, suspension, or modification of the provisional measures in question*.\"\n\nReply to Revocation Request, para. 79.\n\n33.\n\nClaimant submits its views on the relation between the provisional measure and the claim made (or to be made) in the new arbitration concerning VAT refunds:\n\n\"*81. There is no basis for Respondent to claim that 'the interim measure granted by the Tribunal will interfere with a measure that is at issue in a separate proceeding from Case ARB/21/14.'*\n\n*82. In fact, the contrary is the case. The Tribunal's interim measures of protection and the ability of PEM to access VAT refunds as of January 4, 2023 will make unnecessary for the Claimant to seek relief in the newly filed arbitration claim under the NAFTA with respect to VAT refunds paid to PEM as of January 4, 2023.*\n\n*83. Equally, it is entirely incorrect to claim, as has been done by the Respondent, that by 'issuing a recommendation on a measure that is the subject of another proceeding, the merits of that new case are being prejudged, even before having initiated arbitration.'*\"42\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 81-83.\n\n34.\n\nClaimant goes on explaining why, in its view, the new case and its object do not represent new circumstances that would warrant the re-examination of the provisional measure and its revocation as follows:\n\n\"*84. The current Decision has been made based on the applicable laws including the principles related to the making of provisional relief decisions. As such, its provisional relief measures are made pending the making of the final award.*\n\n*85. The Respondent in asserting, that by this Tribunal making its interim decisions or when rendering its final award, it is somehow prejudging the merits of the new case, is simply absurd.*\n\n*86. It is axiomatic that an arbitral tribunal's mandate is limited to the resolution of the claims presented to it. The claims in the new arbitration are not before the Tribunal in this proceeding. Importantly, the Tribunal has no authority to decide a matter in the new arbitration. The arbitration tribunal in the newly filed NAFTA claim will make its decision based on the facts presented to it and the applicable law. It will not be bound by the decisions made by this Tribunal, although it may consider the impact of this Tribunal's decision in deliberating on issues such as double-recovery and indemnification for losses suffered.*\"43\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 84-86.\n\n35.\n\nOn this basis, and in view of the fact that no other circumstances have changed since the issuance of the PM Decision, Claimant concludes requesting the Tribunal to dismiss the Revocation Request.44\n\n*See* Reply to Revocation Request, para. 78: \"*The growing amount of funds that remain inaccessible to Claimant only further demonstrates the need for the continuation of the Tribunal's recommendation based on the need to avoid exacerbation of the dispute and to maintain the* status quo*.\"*\n\n**III. The Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Reasoning**\n----------------\n\n36.\n\nFrom the above presentation of the Parties' arguments, it appears that they agree that a modification, or even more a revocation, of a provisional measure, which is within the powers of a tribunal as explicitly provided in Rule 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, requires a material change in the circumstances that justified the granting of the measure in the first place.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in the present case the provisional measure at issue is a recommendation:\n\n\"*that the Respondent not block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (4 January 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending, and that such payments be made into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM.*\"45\n\nPM Decision, para. 143.\n\n38.\n\nIn order to determine whether there has been a material change in the circumstances that the Tribunal considered as justifying the granting of the provisional measure, it is necessary to look at the reasoning of the Tribunal in the PM Decision, which has been referred to above, namely:\n\n\"*(a) that the Tribunal has* prima facie *jurisdiction; (b) that the provisional measures are aimed at protecting, while the dispute is pending, either a substantive right of the requesting party, (c) or a procedural right, notably as to the integrity of the arbitral process, the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration, and/or are aimed at avoiding the aggravation of the dispute (maintaining the* status quo *while the dispute is pending); (d) from actions by the other party that are likely to cause an actual or imminent serious (irreparable) harm to the above rights, so that the requested measures appear to be necessary (proportionate) and urgent to that end. Moreover, the measures are by their nature provisional, i.e., temporary, and must not prejudge the final decision of the dispute.*\"46\n\nPM Decision, para. 93.\n\n39.\n\nAt paragraph 134 of the PM Decision, the Tribunal stated that it was granting the provisional measure \"[i]*n light of the principles recalled above governing the issuance of provisional measures intended to avoid the aggravation of the dispute and maintain the* status quo *while the arbitration is pending.*\"\n\n40.\n\nThe issue is therefore whether the introduction by Claimant of a new arbitration request against Respondent on 30 June 2023 (following the NOI of 31 March 2023), having as its object the recovery, as damages, of a sum equal to the amount of the VAT refund that PEM has been unable to access, based on the premise that the denial of such access represents a breach by Respondent of certain NAFTA obligations towards Claimant, represents a relevant change of the circumstances that justified the issuance of provisional measure.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the answer cannot but be in the negative for the following reasons.\n\n42.\n\nThe initiation of the new ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 does not change the fact that the VAT refunds to which PEM is entitled have been deposited (and continue to be deposited as long as Respondent does not comply with the provisional measure)47 on accounts that are not freely accessible to PEM, thus aggravating the dispute and prejudicing the *status quo, pendente lite.*\n\n*See* Reply to Revocation Request, para. 52, referring to a letter of Claimant's counsel of 15 June 2023, seeking compliance with the PM Decision, C-0060.\n\n43.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal also noted in the PM Decision that, based on statements made by Claimant itself,48 the effective payment of those VAT refunds was not a claim that Claimant was making in this arbitration, so that a provisional order of payment would not be contravening the provision in Article 1134 of the NAFTA that: \"[a] *Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117*.\"49\n\n*See* PM Decision, para. 43, referencing PM Request, paras. 24, 80-81.\n\n*See* PM Decision, paras. 42 and 135, referencing PM Request, paras. 80-81.\n\n44.\n\nAccordingly, the provisional measure was limited to VAT refunds to be paid after the date of the Claimant's PM Request (4 January 2023). Additionally, this Tribunal stressed that the order was provisional, to be in force as long as the present dispute was not decided, as required by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n45.\n\nIn the new ICSID case, First Majestic claims that the deposit by SAT of the VAT refunds into a blocked account represents a breach of certain NAFTA provisions by Respondent for which Claimant is entitled to damages of a corresponding amount.50 Such a claim, for the reasons stated above, as confirmed by Claimant itself, is not before this Tribunal.\n\nMore exactly the claims of First Majestic in its Request for Arbitration in the case registered under ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 (R-0202) are the following: \"*86. As a result of the Government of Mexico's refusal to pay to PEM* [REDACTED] *to date and amounts equal to future VAT refunds that belong to PEM, First Majestic and its investments in Mexico and its returns on its investments, have been severely injured in violation of Articles 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105, 1109, 1110 of the NAFTA. 87. First Majestic, therefore, requests on its behalf and on behalf of its investments, monetary compensation estimated at this time at a minimum of* [REDACTED].\n\n46.\n\nThe introduction of the new ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 and the fact that it is pending do not remove the situation of aggravation of the dispute in the present ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 nor of the prejudice to the *status quo* represented by the unavailability of the VAT refunds for PEM.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the fact that the provisional measure is in place may (*de facto*) have an impact on the new case. Thus, as mentioned by Claimant itself, compliance by Respondent with the provisional measure (that is, making the VAT refunds accrued from 4 January 2023 freely available to PEM) might make the claim submitted by Claimant in ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 in part moot.51\n\nReply to Revocation Request, paras. 82-86.\n\n48.\n\nThis possible future evolution is however not a matter of concern for this Tribunal, since it will be a matter to be addressed (if and when) by the tribunal that will be appointed to preside over ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28. Moreover, this possible future evolution does not affect the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in respect of the provisional measure recommended in the PM Decision, nor does it undermine its continued validity, since the circumstances underpinning its issuance have not changed.\n\n49.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent where it submits that \"[e]*s evidente que, si este Tribunal no puede ordenar la suspensi\u00f3n de medidas que son objeto del presente arbitraje ARB/21/14, mucho menos puede recomendar o suspender medidas que ser\u00e1n objeto de un procedimiento independiente cuya resoluci\u00f3n corresponder\u00e1 a otro tribunal*.\"52\n\nRevocation Request, para. 34.\n\n50.\n\nThe provisional measure that the Tribunal granted in its PM Decision is obviously limited to the context of the present case. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction on ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 and is not competent to pass any judgement on its object, or the claims and defenses made or to be made in those proceedings, and even less to issue orders on matters subject to the jurisdiction of the tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28. Based on the evidentiary filings of the Parties in the present case and their arguments, this Tribunal is just taking note for the purpose of these proceedings, as facts, of the existence of ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28, based on the information that the Parties have supplied to this Tribunal.\n\n**B. Decision**\n---------------\n\n51.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. Respondent's Request of 19 June 2023 that the Tribunal revoke its Decision of 26 May 2023 granting the provisional measure set forth therein is hereby rejected.\n\nDated: 1 September 2023"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2023-12-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures and the Tribunal's Decision on Claimant's Request**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn January 4, 2023, the Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (\"**PM Request**\"), requesting that the Tribunal recommend four provisional measures, the third one being:\n\n*c)* Future VAT refunds payable to PEM*: The requested order would require the SAT to make all VAT refunds that have accrued to PEM after the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, and all future VAT refund payments, to be made fully accessible to PEM. Furthermore, the order would require that these VAT refunds remain free from SAT's seizures or freezing of bank accounts.*1\n\nPM Request, para. 19.\n\n6.\n\nIn respect of this request, the Claimant explained that in accordance with Mexican law, PEM is entitled to VAT refunds which are periodically paid by SAT to PEM's bank accounts. The Claimant further explained that the equivalent of about [REDACTED] of such refunds (partly made after the filing of the Request for Arbitration), were deposited in PEM's bank accounts that were blocked or seized by SAT as a result of certain tax enforcement and collection measures against PEM.2 The Claimant clarified that it was not asking that the freezing of the accounts be lifted (since this would run counter to the prohibition contained in the last sentence of Article 1134 NAFTA). Rather, it was requesting that future refunds not be deposited in such frozen accounts, because SAT has *\"continued depositing the VAT refunds into frozen bank accounts without any direction or authorization from PEM.*\n\nDecision on PM. para. 42. referring to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures. January 4. 2023 (\"PM Request\"), paras. 80-81 and original footnote 27 of the Decision on PM: *\"These measures are described by the Claimant at para. 97 of the Request, especially at para. 97 (ii) and (v), and appear to be the result of* SAT [REDACTED] *The Claimant indicates that, on average, these VAT refunds payable in the future amount to* [REDACTED] per month\n\n7.\n\nOn February 10,2023, the Respondent submitted its Response to the PM Request (the **\"PM Response\").** According to the Respondent, SAT has paid in full all VAT refunds due to PEM in the bank accounts that the Claimant or PEM had specified to that effect.3\n\nPM Response, para. 37.\n\n8.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent submitted that:\n\n*Para que PEM pueda recibir tales recursos, \u00fanicamente debe indicar en la solicitud de devoluci\u00f3n, la cuenta bancaria a la cual se tiene que realizar el dep\u00f3sito correspondiente. Claramente, esta no es una situaci\u00f3n que requiera la intervenci\u00f3n del Tribunal4*\n\nPM Response, para. 38.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 29, 2023, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Claimant\u2019s PM Request (the **\"PM Decision\").** In its examination of the Claimant\u2019s request concerning the VAT refunds, the Tribunal stated, *i.a.,* the following:5\n\n*127. As highlighted above, the Claimant complains that tax refunds owed to PEM have been deposited, without PEM\u2019s authorization, in accounts of PEM that have been blocked by SAT pursuant to pending tax enforcement proceedings. The Claimant seeks an order restraining SAT from continuing to deposit VAT refunds on accounts that PEM cannot use so to ensure that the status quo is preserved and so not to exacerbate the dispute.*\n\n*128. After having examined the Claimant's Request and the Respondent's Response, the exact factual situation has remained unclear to the Tribunal. The Claimant has specified that it 'is not seeking to have the freezing of PEM's bank accounts undone including the funds that were on deposit at the time of the seizure, which could be viewed as directed at a measure being challenged in this arbitration,' contrary to the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA. The Respondent, on the other hand, has stated that VAT refunds are paid into accounts that the taxpayer indicates to the tax authorities in charge to make such payment. It is up to PEM therefore to indicate to these authorities (apparently SAT) on which accounts it wishes to have the VAT refunds deposited, given that such refunds are per se are available to PEM.*6\n\n*129. In this context, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant's request concerns future deposits and not the amounts already deposited in the past.*7 *On the other hand, the unblocking of these previously deposited amounts would not be a proper object of a provisional measure because it would be a sort of anticipation of a decision on the merits on this issue.*\n\n*130. The Tribunal has felt the need to ask for clarifications to the Parties, which they provided during the Hearing, as to the reasons why the payments were made on these blocked accounts and as to what would prevent future deposits to be made at PEM's request on other accounts that are freely at its disposal.*\n\n*131. The Tribunal must say that the factual situation has not been fully clarified by the Parties. According to the Respondent, past deposits were made on those accounts because those were the accounts indicated by PEM for such purposes.*8\n\n*132. Indeed, the Respondent at the Hearing stated that it is for PEM to indicate to the tax authorities the accounts in which it intends to receive VAT refunds.*9 *It is not clear to the Tribunal whether this means that since the amounts of VAT to be refunded in the future pertain to PEM and PEM can freely use them, if PEM indicates to SAT other unblocked accounts in which it wishes to have the tax refunds deposited, SAT will do so.*\n\n*133. On the other hand, the Tribunal considers that if SAT were to block further payments of future VAT refunds owed to PEM, this would aggravate the dispute and affect the status quo.*\n\n*134. In light of the principles recalled above*10 *governing the issuance of provisional measures intended to avoid the aggravation of the dispute and maintain the status quo while the arbitration is pending, the Tribunal grants the following provisional measure: the Tribunal recommends to the Respondent not to block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant's Request (4 January 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending and until the final decision of the dispute, and to make such payments into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM.*11\n\n*135. Finally, the Tribunal considers that the above recommendation is not prevented by the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA against provisional measures that would \"enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.\" This is because the denial by SAT of PEM's free access to future VAT refunds is not a measure challenged by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration nor discussed in its Memorial .*12\n\nPM Decision, paras. 127-134 (footnotes omitted except otherwise indicated).\n\nOriginal footnote 119: *Response, paras. 34-39. Specifically, \"la demandada tiene conocimiento que no se le ha negado ninguna de las solicitudes de devoluci\u00f3n que PEM ha presentado mensualmente,\" at para. 36.*\n\nOriginal footnote 120: *See Request, para 80. The Claimant's request concerns however \"payments of VAT refunds owed to PEM as to the filing of the Request for Arbitration\" as well as \"all future payments\" (at para.78). The Tribunal considers however that a provisional measure of the type requested by the Claimant, concerning the VAT refunds to which PEM is entitled, in order not to aggravate the dispute and to maintain the status quo, cannot cover actions by the Respondent that predate the relevant request (4 January 2023)*.\n\nOriginal footnote 122: *See Response, para. 33. According to the Respondent, those accounts had been blocked by SAT in order to ensure payments allegedly due by PEM under the (re-) assessments, although tax collection under the latter have been judicially suspended as a result of PEM's challenges against them, see Counter-Memorial, para. 260; Hearing Transcript, p. 104.*\n\nOriginal footnote 123: *See Transcript pp. 75-76: \"in connection with VAT refund procedures, we have explained that it is the Claimant itself who has the possibility of choosing the bank accounts in which it wishes refunds to be made. This obviously does not require the Tribunal's involvement.\"*\n\nOriginal footnote 124: *See above Section IV.A.*\n\nOriginal footnote 125: *The Tribunal considers appropriate to remind here that although provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are labelled \"recommendations\", ICSID tribunals have consistently held that such provisional measures have a binding effect on the Parties, see Schreuer et al., 3rd ed., Commentary to Article 47, para. 21, CL-0085, with reference to relevant case law at paras. 21-32, concluding at para.32 that \"there is now almost universal acceptance that provisional measures have binding force.\" The Tribunal shares this view, based also on Article 1134 of the NAFTA on \"Interim Measures of Protection,\" which authorizes tribunals to issue orders and not only recommendations to this effect.*\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n10.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal unanimously decided as follows:\n\n*1. RECOMMENDS as provisional measure pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 1134 of the NAFTA that the Respondent not block payments of VAT refunds owed by Mexican tax authorities to PEM since the date of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (4 January\u2019 2023) and those accruing to PEM in the future while the arbitration is pending and until the final decision of the dispute, and to make such payments into accounts to be indicated by PEM and to be maintained freely available to PEM;*\n\n*2. REJECTS all other provisional measures requests by the Claimant; and*\n\n*3. RESERVES for the Award the decision on the allocation of costs resulting from the Request.13*\n\nPM Decision, para. 143.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Request for the Revocation of Provisional Measures and the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nShortly after the issuance of the PM Decision, on June 19, 2023, the Respondent sought the revocation of the provisional measure granted by the Tribunal (the **\"Revocation Request\").14**\n\nPM Revocation Request, para. 2.\n\n12.\n\nThe Revocation Request was grounded on the fact that on March 31, 2023, the Claimant had served the Respondent with a Notice of Intent (\"NOI\"), by which it notified the Respondent of its intention to initiate a second arbitration (which was later formally commenced on June 29, 2023, and was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/23/29, the **\"Second Arbitration\"** or, as defined by the Claimant, the **\"VAT Arbitration\").**\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent noted that this Second Arbitration had the following object:\n\n*13. [...] Las acciones del SAT* [REDACTED] *es ilegal conforme a las leyes mexicanas y contraviene las disposiciones del Cap\u00edtulo 11 del TLCAN y, en consecuencia, constituye una disputa en t\u00e9rminos del TLCAN.15*\n\nPM Revocation Request, para. 4 with reference to NOI, para. 13. R-0201.\n\n14.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent pointed to the Claimant\u2019s allegation in the NOI that:\n\n*[l]as restricciones[REDACTED] a devoluciones de IVA supuestamente son violatorias de los Art\u00edculos 1102 (Trato Nacional), 1103 (Trato de Naci\u00f3n M\u00e1s Favorecida), 1105 (Nivel M\u00ednimo de Trato), 1109 (Transferencias) y 1110 (Expropiaci\u00f3n y compensaci\u00f3n) del TLCAN.16*\n\nPM Revocation Request, para. 20.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent explained that, in its view:\n\n*la medida provisional dictada en este procedimiento afectar\u00eda el desarrollo de la nueva reclamaci\u00f3n referida en la NOI 2023 de dos maneras.* Primero, *interfiere con el proceso de consultas derivado de la NOI 2023, pues la medida provisional* de facto *suspende la medida que se reclama en este potencial nuevo procedimiento.* Segundo, *siguiendo el mismo razonamiento del p\u00e1rrafo 129 de la Decisi\u00f3n sobre Medidas Provisionales, el efecto de la medida provisional dictada sobre devoluciones del IVA futuras podr\u00eda ser una especie de anticipaci\u00f3n de una decisi\u00f3n sobre el fondo de la nueva reclamaci\u00f3n, lo cual afectar\u00eda el debido proceso.17*\n\nPM Revocation Request, para. 7.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent further explained that the provisional measure granted in the present arbitration would prejudice the Second Arbitration because the provisional measure relates to the same facts (the payment by SAT of VAT refunds in PEM\u2019s blocked accounts) that the Claimant challenges in the Second Arbitration as being in breach of NAFTA.\n\n17.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for the Revocation of Provisional Measures (the **\"Decision on the Revocation Request\"),** rejecting it.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal reasoned, *i.a.,* that the initiation of the Second Arbitration does not change the fact that the VAT refunds to which PEM is entitled have been deposited (and continue to be deposited notwithstanding the provisional measure)18 in accounts that are not freely accessible to PEM, thus aggravating the dispute and prejudicing the *status quo, pendente lite, i.e.,* as highlighted in the PM Decision.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Reply to Respondent\u2019s Request for Revocation of Recommendation of Provisional Measures, July 21, 2023, para. 52. referring to a letter of Claimant\u2019s counsel of June 15, 2023, seeking compliance with the PM Decision. C-0060.\n\n19.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal noted in the PM Decision that, \"(43) based on statements made by Claimant itself,19 the effective payment of those VAT refunds was not a claim that Claimant was making in this arbitration, so that a provisional order of payment would not be contravening the provision in Article 1134 of the NAFTA that: \"[a] Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.\"20\n\nOriginal footnote 48: *See PM Decision, para. 43, referencing PM Request, paras. 24, 80-81.*\n\nOriginal footnote 49: *See PM Decision, paras. 42 and 135, referencing PM Request, paras. 80-81.*\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that its Decision of May 26, 2023, limited the provisional measure to VAT refunds paid or to be paid after the date of the Claimant\u2019s PM Request (January 4, 2023). Additionally, the Tribunal stressed that the order was provisional, to remain in force until the present dispute was decided, as required by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n21.\n\nIn Decision of September 1, the Tribunal has stated *i.a.* the following:\n\n*(45) In the new ICSID case, First Majestic claims that the deposit by SAT of the VAT refunds into a blocked account represents a breach of certain NAFTA provisions by Respondent for which Claimant is entitled to damages of a corresponding amount.21 Such a claim, for the reasons stated above, as confirmed by Claimant itself is not before this Tribunal. 22*\n\n*(46) The introduction of the new ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 and the fact that it is pending do not remove the situation of aggravation of the dispute in the present ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 nor of the prejudice to the status quo represented by the unavailability of the VAT refunds for PEM.*\n\n*(47) The Tribunal recognizes that the fact that the provisional measure is in place may (de facto) have an impact on the new case. Thus, as mentioned by Claimant itself, compliance by Respondent with the provisional measure (that is, making the VAT refunds accrued from 4 January 2023 freely available to PEM) might make the claim submitted by Claimant in ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 in part moot.23*\n\n*(48) This possible future evolution is however not a matter of concern for this Tribunal, since it will be a matter to be addressed (if and when) by the tribunal that will be appointed to preside over ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28. Moreover, this possible future evolution does not affect the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in respect of the provisional measure recommended in the PM Decision, nor does it undermine its continued validity, since the circumstances underpinning its issuance have not changed.*\n\n*(49) For the same reason, the Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent where it submits that '[e]s evidente que, si este Tribunal no puede ordenar la suspensi\u00f3n de medidas que son objeto del presente arbitraje ARB/21/14, mucho menos puede recomendar o suspender medidas que ser\u00e1n objeto de un procedimiento independiente cuya resoluci\u00f3n corresponder\u00e1 a otro tribunal.'24*\n\n*(50) The provisional measure that the Tribunal granted in its PM Decision is obviously limited to the context of the present case. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction on ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 and is not competent to pass any judgement on its object, or the claims and defenses made or to be made in those proceedings, and even less to issue orders on matters subject to the jurisdiction of the tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28. Based on the evidentiary filings of the Parties in the present case and their arguments, this Tribunal is just taking note for the purpose of these proceedings, as facts, of the existence of ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28, based on the information that the Parties have supplied to this Tribunal.*\n\nOriginal footnote 50: *More exactly the claims of First Majestic in its Request for Arbitration in the case registered under ICSID Case No. 23/28 (R-0202) are the following: '86. As a result of the Government of Mexico\u2019s refusal to pay to PEM [REDACTED] to date and amount equal to future VAT refunds that belong to PEM, First Majestic and its investments in Mexico and its returns on its investments, have been severely injured in violation of Articles 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105, 1109, 1110 of the NAFTA. 87. First Majestic, therefore, requests on its behalf and on behalf of its investments, monetary compensation estimated at this time at a minimum of*[REDACTED]\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nOriginal footnote 51: *Reply to Revocation Request, paras. 82-86.*\n\nOriginal footnote 52: *Revocation Request, para. 34.*\n\n**C. The Preliminary Objection**\n--------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nWhile proceedings on the Revocation Request were pending, on July 28, 2023, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objection on Jurisdiction (the \"**Preliminary Objection**\").\n\n23.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, as authorized by the Tribunal, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Preliminary Objection (the \"**Response**\").\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal having allowed the Parties to file a second round of briefs, on September 9, 2023, the Respondent filed a Reply on the Preliminary Objection (the \"**Reply**\"), and on November 6, 2023, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on the Preliminary Objection (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n**II. The Parties' Requests for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n*i) Suspender el procedimiento del Caso CIADI No. ARB/21/14 y analizar esta objeci\u00f3n a la jurisdicci\u00f3n del Tribunal como cuesti\u00f3n preliminar, de conformidad con la Regla 41 de las Reglas de Arbitraje del CIADI de 2006;*\n\n*ii. Determinar que no tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer del Caso CIADI No. ARB/21/14 y, en la alternativa, que no tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer de la reclamaci\u00f3n relacionada con el bloqueo de cuentas y/o el acceso a las devoluciones de IVA y/o el dep\u00f3sito de devoluciones de IVA en cuentas congeladas;*\n\n*iii. Condene a la Demandante a pagar los costes de esta fase de jurisdicci\u00f3n*25\n\nReply, para. 91.\n\n26.\n\nIn response, the Claimant's requests the Tribunal to:\n\n*i) Deny the Request for Bifurcation;*\n\n*ii) Dismiss the Objection to Jurisdiction as it lacks serious merit;*\n\n*iii) Determine that the Claimant and PEM have not breached the waivers provided at the outset of this arbitration, and that the VAT entitlement measures are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the tribunal that is to be appointed in the VAT Arbitration, and are not before this Tribunal for adjudication; and*\n\n*iv) Deny the Respondent's request for suspension of the APA Arbitration and the Decision on Provisional Measures.*26\n\nRejoinder, para. 115.\n\n**III. The Bifurcation Request**\n--------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objection, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings on the merits and address its jurisdictional objection as a preliminary matter in accordance with AR 41. The Respondent submits that the proceedings should be bifurcated, with the proceedings on the merits suspended and the Preliminary Objection decided immediately because, in its view, the Preliminary Objection: (a) is *prima facie* serious and substantiated; (b) may be examined separately from the merits; and (c) if accepted, may resolve all or a significant part of the dispute.27\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 10.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant submits that there are no grounds for bifurcating the proceedings, since the Respondent's objection is not *prima facie* serious or substantiated and bifurcation would not result in a material reduction of the next phase, so that the Respondent's arguments should be joined to the merits.28\n\nResponse, paras. 115-137.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal is deciding on the Respondent's jurisdictional objection in the present Decision and, therefore, the Respondent's suspension request is moot.\n\n30.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal believes that it is appropriate to explain its decision to deal with the jurisdictional objection immediately, without suspending the proceedings on the merits, since the Parties have discussed rather extensively the issue in their briefs.29\n\nThe Parties agree that following ICSID tribunal's case law, three conditions must be met in order to bifurcate: (1) that the objection is prima facie serious and substantial; (2) that it can be examined without entering or prejudging the merits of the case; (3) that it may dispose of the totality or a substantial part of the dispute. While the Parties basically agree on these criteria, they are at odds whether the three conditions are met, see Preliminary Objection, paras. 10-13; Response, paras. 115-127.\n\n31.\n\nAccording to Arbitration Rule 41(3) (of the 2006 version, which is applicable in the present case), \"[u]*pon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the Parties may file observations on the objection*.\"30\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n32.\n\nThus, AR 41 gives tribunals ample discretion to decide whether to suspend the proceedings on the merits or not, depending on the circumstances of each case. When deciding, tribunals must be guided by consideration of fairness and procedural efficiency.31\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention*, Cambridge University Press, 3rd Ed., dated 2022, p. 792, \u00b6 152, CL-85; see also Response, para. 184.\n\n33.\n\nIn the present case, the objection is narrow, based on just one ground and does not require examining the merits to be decided. Given its narrow scope, the Tribunal considers that it can be addressed concurrently with the ongoing proceedings on the merits, without the need for suspension and without placing an undue burden on any of the Parties.\n\n34.\n\nThe Parties have not asked for an oral phase in relation to the jurisdictional objection, nor does the Tribunal believe that such a phase is required \u2013 it is optional pursuant to Rule 41(4). In the view of the Tribunal, an oral hearing is not necessary. The Parties have stated their arguments on the objection in two rounds of briefs, as they have requested, and the Tribunal considers that these briefs have fully presented the Parties' respective arguments. Finally, the proceedings on the merits are in no way prejudiced by the parallel briefing or by the Tribunal's deliberations and decision on the objection.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore proceeds to examine below the substance of the Preliminary Objection.\n\n**IV. The Parties' position on the Preliminary Objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn its essence, the Respondent's argument is clear and simple. The Respondent submits that in the Second Arbitration \"*se reclaman medidas que tambi\u00e9n forman parte de la reclamaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 conociendo este Tribunal, lo cual viola el compromiso asumido por First Majestic en la renuncia que present\u00f3 conforme al Art\u00edculo 1121 del TLCAN para poder iniciar el presente procedimiento (Caso CIADI No. ARB/21/14).*\"32\n\nRespondent's Objection, para. 1.\n\n37.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in the Second Arbitration the Claimant:\n\n*reclama\u2026 violaciones basadas en las mismas medidas reclamadas en el arbitraje ARB/21/14 y que, en ambos procedimientos reclama esencialmente los mismos da\u00f1os. Por lo tanto, existe el riesgo de decisiones incongruentes y doble compensaci\u00f3n, que es precisamente lo que el Art\u00edculo 1121 busca impedir.*33\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 2.\n\n38.\n\nRespondent further submits that:\n\n*la violaci\u00f3n de esta 'condici\u00f3n previa' al arbitraje invalida el consentimiento de M\u00e9xico para arbitrar la controversia, y, por consiguiente, este Tribunal carecer\u00eda de jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer del presente arbitraje.*34\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 4.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent thus argues that Article 1121(2) NAFTA, and the Claimant's waiver, would be breached if the Claimant submits to the Second Arbitration the same claims of breach, concerning the same measure, or one of the measures, that it has submitted in the present arbitration.\n\n40.\n\nTo demonstrate that this is the case, the Respondent points to para. 158 of the Claimant's Memorial in the present arbitration, where the Claimant states the following:\n\n*A non-exhaustive list of measures that form part of the dispute with the Respondent and provides the basis for the claim against the Respondent include\u2026(k) freezing bank accounts ; (l) depositing VAT refunds in frozen bank accounts thereby impeding recovery of same by PEM, and imposing restrictions and charges against other assets of PEM.*35\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 15, underlining by Respondent. The list in para.158 goes on until the letter (q).\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent sets forth next the standards which are applicable to Article 1121 NAFTA and waivers thereunder. First, ICSID arbitration is included within the expressions \"*other dispute settlement procedures\",* and \"*any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach*\". Secondly, the waiver is not just formal (depositing a statement of waiver), but has also a material aspect, in that it must be actually followed by the conduct of the claimant refraining from submitting other proceedings notwithstanding the waiver.36 If this is not the case, the breach of the waiver results in depriving the Tribunal of its jurisdiction over the pending dispute because of the consequent loss of consent by the respondent State.37\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 37.\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 45.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Respondent the subject matter or object of the two proceedings does not need to be identical. Since the purpose of Article 1121 NAFTA and of the waiver is to protect a respondent from multiple proceedings relating to the same measure, avoid contradictory decisions, and, above all, double recovery, the breach of the waiver entails the loss of the Tribunal's jurisdiction even if the triple identity test applicable to *lis pendens* and *res judicata* issues is not met. It is enough that the two proceedings be \"with respect to\" the same measures.38\n\nPreliminary Objection, paras. 36-42.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimant has breached Article 1121 NAFTA and its waiver because \"*en ambos procedimientos iniciados por la Demandante se reclama el congelamiento de cuentas y/o el dep\u00f3sito de las devoluciones del IVA en cuentos congelados, as\u00ed como da\u00f1os por la presunta interferencia*.\"39 More specifically, the Respondent submits that the blocking of PEM's accounts, causing the VAT refunds deposited therein by SAT to remain inaccessible to PEM, which is the object of the present arbitration, has also been challenged by the Claimant in the Second Arbitration.40\n\nPreliminary Objection, paras. 63-66.\n\nPreliminary Objection, paras. 39, 59-63.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent thus asks the Tribunal to \"[d]*eterminar que no tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer del Caso CIADI No. ARB/21/14 y, en la alternativa, que no tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer de la reclamaci\u00f3n relacionada con el bloqueo de cuentas y/o el acceso a las devoluciones de IVA y/o el dep\u00f3sito de devoluciones de IVA en cuentas congeladas.*\"41\n\nReply, para. 91.\n\n45.\n\nFinally, in its Reply the Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that the measures that it challenges in the two arbitrations, *i.e.* the blocking of the accounts and the deposit of the VAT refunds in such blocked accounts, are distinct. The Respondent asserts that also the deposit of VAT refunds in blocked accounts is an object of the present arbitration, pointing out that it has been mentioned in the Claimant's Memorial.42 Moreover, the Claimant has not complained in the Second Arbitration that VAT refunds have not been paid, but rather of \"*the failure of the SAT to make these refunds available to PEM*\"43. In the Respondent's view, when the Claimant complains in the Second Arbitration of SAT's refusal to let PEM access the VAT refunds, it effectively complains of the blocking of those accounts, which is a claim made in the present arbitration.44\n\nReply, para. 15, with reference to para.158(k) of Claimant's Memorial.\n\nReply, paras. 21-22 quoting para. 31 of the Request for Arbitration in the Second Arbitration, R-202.\n\nReply, paras. 29-31.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the preliminary and procedural arguments raised by the Claimant against the Preliminary Objection. The Respondent also denies that this Tribunal, in explaining the reasons for granting the provisional measure, has determined that only the enforcement measures (\"*Medidas de Ejecuci\u00f3n*) but not the entitlement measures (\"*Medidas de Derecho*\") are subject to the present arbitration. This is because, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal only referred to future VAT refunds when it determined that the prohibition of Article 1134 NAFTA was not a bar against granting the provisional measure requested by Claimant.45 In the Respondent's view, this temporal limitation is an indication that the Tribunal believed that the payment of the VAT refunds in a blocked account until January 4, 2023, was a measure challenged by the Claimant in the present arbitration against which no provisional measure is admitted in conformity with Article 1134 NAFTA.\n\nReply, para. 71.\n\n**B. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn its Response, the Claimant opposes the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction. The Claimant denies that the Second Arbitration relates to the same measure(s) that are part of the present arbitration, distinguishing between what it defines as \"enforcement measures\", which in its view are subject to the present proceedings, from \"entitlement measures\" which are subject to the Second Arbitration.46\n\nResponse, paras. 5-8.\n\n48.\n\nPreliminarily, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to dismiss the Preliminary Objection on a number of procedural grounds, namely: that the objection is \"Without Serious Merits\"; because of Res Judicata/Estoppel; and because of the Respondent's \"Vexatious Conduct\", all of them raised also in connection with the Respondent's references to the (then still pending) proceedings for the revocation of the provisional measure.47\n\nResponse, paras. 41-92, 138-166.\n\n49.\n\nOn the merits of the Preliminary Objection, the Claimant submits that Mexico's enforcement measures, that is, the imposition of the \"blocking\" and the refusal to lift the \"blocking\" of PEM's accounts, is the subject of the present arbitration only and are being adjudicated exclusively by this Tribunal.48\n\nResponse, paras. 66-67, referring to paras. 26-28 of the Request for Arbitration in the Second Arbitration, R-202.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Second Arbitration is not directed at challenging the SAT measures blocking the bank accounts:49 what the Claimant has submitted to the Second Arbitration is its entitlement to VAT refunds, a right that SAT (the Respondent) has acknowledged is unquestionably due to PEM, but that SAT is denying, by refusing to make the refunds effectively available to PEM in freely usable accounts, even to the point of refusing to comply with the provisional measure ordered by the Tribunal to this effect.50\n\nResponse, para. 68.\n\nResponse, paras. 63, 68, 75, 82, 85, 106-108.\n\n51.\n\nIndeed, according to the Claimant, the Respondent has not complied with the Tribunal's Decision recommending that VAT refunds, including future monthly payments, not be deposited in PEM's blocked accounts.51\n\nRejoinder, para. 15.\n\n52.\n\nFurther, the Claimant argues that the damages claimed in the two arbitrations are different, so that the risk of double compensation does not exist:\n\n*Whether Respondent will be required to compensate Claimant in the APA Arbitration will depend* [sic] *a number of factors including whether Claimant will succeed in relation to the unlawfulness of repudiation by the SAT of the APA, the measures of Respondent denying Claimant and PEM access to both local and international remedies, and the consistency of its enforcement measures with the applicable standards of treatment set out in Section A of Chapter 11 of NAFTA.52*\n\nResponse, para. 168.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant notes that:\n\n*On the other hand, the compensation claim and the grounds for compensation under the VAT Arbitration will focus almost exclusively on Respondent\u2019s representations, the lack of legal basis for the VAT entitlement measures, and Respondent\u2019s failure to meet its obligation in connection with Claimant\u2019s entitlement [...].*\n\n*Furthermore, the amount[s] of compensation that has been claimed in the two arbitr ations are substantially different, with more than [REDACTED] claimed in the APA Arbitration, and approximately [REDACTED] claimed under the VAT Arbitration.53*\n\nResponse, paras. 170 and 171.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that it had to file the Second Arbitration to protect its rights since the deadline to do so was expiring on June 30, 2023. These rights required protection as a result of the Respondent\u2019s refusal to deposit the VAT refunds, which it has acknowledged were due, in a freely disposable account, and of SAT\u2019s refusal to accept even the bank guarantee that PEM had offered.54\n\nResponse, paras. 184-190, 197.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant concludes by requesting that the Tribunal reject as untimely the Respondent\u2019s alternative request concerning the enforcement measures because this request should have been made in the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, and that the Tribunal deny the Objection to jurisdiction in relation to PEM\u2019s entitlement and access to VAT refunds, because the VAT entitlements measures are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the tribunal that will hear the second arbitration.55\n\nResponse, para. 203.\n\n56.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Claimant insists that \"*the measures related to the legal entitlement to receive VAT refunds, and full and free access to the VAT refunds (i.e., entitlement measures) are not measures that are at issue in this ongoing arbitration*.\" To the contrary, enforcement measures, including the rejection of the guarantees offered to SAT, the blocking of PEM's accounts and restrictions on the sale of other assets (*i.e.* enforcement measures) are (only) before this Tribunal.56\n\nRejoinder, paras. 23-24.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant challenges the Respondent's interpretation of the Tribunal's PM Decision, granting provisional measure only from January 4, 2023. According to the Claimant, the Tribunal acknowledged that it had the authority to grant such a provisional measure because it was not precluded from doing so by Article 1134 NAFTA, but set the starting date as of January 4, 2023 (when the Claimant had filed its PM Request) because of the requirements and criteria for issuing provisional measures (such as urgency, necessity, irreparable harm and maintaining the status quo) which, by their very nature cannot be retroactive.57\n\nRejoinder, paras. 38-40, 62-63.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that the measures at issue in the two arbitrations are different and that the claims are separate and distinct. This allows the two arbitrations to proceed without any impediment stemming from Article 1121 NAFTA, since some measures have been challenged in the present arbitration (the enforcement measures) and some (different ones) in the Second Arbitration (the entitlement measures), but none in both.58\n\nRejoinder, para. 90-94.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant requests therefore that the Tribunal \"[d]*etermine that the Claimant and PEM have not breached the waivers provided at the outset of this arbitration, and that the VAT entitlement measures are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the tribunal that is to be appointed in the VAT Arbitration, and are not before this Tribunal for adjudication*.\"59\n\nRejoinder, Requested Relief, para. 115 (iii).\n\n**V. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal recall first the text of Article 1121 NAFTA, according to which:\n\n*A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if:*\n\n*(a) the investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and*\n\n*(b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.*\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties agree that Article 1121 (1)(b) NAFTA lays down a condition precedent to the submission of a claim. It requires that an investor, in order to be able to submit validly an arbitration request, sign and submit a waiver of the right to initiate or continue domestic and other proceedings \"*before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116\"*, except for those mentioned in the provision.\n\n62.\n\nIt is also common ground that (a) such waiver must be complied with throughout the arbitration, (b) the provision covers also a subsequent arbitration at ICSID (such as the Second Arbitration), (c) a breach of a waiver properly submitted in accordance with Article 1121 NAFTA entails the loss of the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal hearing a dispute, and (d) that the Claimant (and PEM) have signed and attached as Annex E to the Request for Arbitration a waiver complying with the requirements of Article 1121 NAFTA.\n\n63.\n\nThe substantive issue to be decided is therefore whether the Second Arbitration is a proceeding with respect to the [same] measure(s) which the Claimant has alleged to be in breach of Mexico's obligations towards the Claimant in the present arbitration.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes at this juncture to point out that its task has not been made easier but rather more complicated by the different terminology used by the Parties \u2013 such as \"enforcement\" v. \"entitlement\" measures used by the Claimant - in their (also different) descriptions of the measures involved. The Tribunal will therefore not make use of those terms to characterize and distinguish the various measures at issue.60\n\nThe definition of \"measures\" is found in Article 201 NAFTA: \"Article 201. *Definitions of General Application* 1. *For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified: [\u2026] \"measure includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice*.\"\n\n65.\n\nIt is common ground that if a measure challenged in the present arbitration as breaching Mexico's NAFTA obligations to the detriment of the Claimant (and/or PEM) is also challenged in the Second Arbitration, then the Claimant would breach its waiver commitment under Article 1121 NAFTA. In such a case, the consequence would be that this Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over the claim that First Majestic has also submitted in the Second Arbitration.\n\n66.\n\nSince the Claimant has challenged in the present arbitration a number of different measures by Mexico's authorities as being in breach of several provisions of Chapter 11 of NAFTA on Investments, should one or more claims concerning one or more of the measures submitted in the present arbitration be found to have been submitted also in the Second Arbitration, Article 1121 NAFTA would deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction only in respect of the claims submitted in both arbitrations. In other words, this arbitration should proceed with respect to the other (non-overlapping) claims.\n\n67.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal must now identify the measure(s) which, according to the Respondent, have been submitted in both arbitrations and thus entail the loss of jurisdiction of this Tribunal over First Majestic's claims based on such measure(s). These measures are listed by the Respondent as being:\n\n(a) The freezing of certain bank accounts of PEM; and\n\n(b) Depositing VAT refunds in those frozen bank accounts thereby impeding recovery of same by PEM.61\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 15 with reference to para. 158 of the Claimant's Memorial.\n\n68.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objection, however, the Respondent focuses primarily on the second measure, thus the Tribunal will examine this measure first. The Respondent explains in this respect that:\n\n*En el contexto de este caso, la medida que se reclama en los dos procedimientos es la interferencia con el acceso a las devoluciones del IVA, con independencia de que se le describa como el congelamiento de cuentas, el dep\u00f3sito de las devoluciones en una cuenta congelada o 'medidas para restringir el acceso a los fondos'.*62\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 56.\n\n69.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the \"*interferencia con el acceso a las devoluciones de IVA*\", that is, SAT (Mexico) preventing PEM to access VAT refunds by depositing them in accounts blocked by SAT, is the measure that the Claimant has challenged in the present arbitration and also in the Second Arbitration.63 In this respect, the Respondent quotes the Request for Arbitration submitted by First Majestic in the Second Arbitration where the Claimant states that \"[w]*hile the refunds are payable and have been nominally deposited on a periodic basis by the SAT into a bank account of PEM, it is the failure of the SAT to make these refunds available to PEM that is at issue in this dispute regardless of the means used*\".64\n\nPreliminary Objection, para. 57.\n\nFirst Majestic's Request for Arbitration in the Second Arbitration, para. 31, R-202, as quoted in the Preliminary Objection, para. 58. This is also the position taken by the Respondent in the present arbitration: \"*todo indica que su reclamaci\u00f3n, en realidad, es que las devoluciones en cuesti\u00f3n se depositaron en cuentas congeladas sin la autorizaci\u00f3n o instrucci\u00f3n de PEM*.\" (PM Response, para. 34).\n\n70.\n\nFrom reading the Preliminary Objection, it is not clear whether the Respondent is also arguing that the blocking of the account, as a distinct measure, has also been submitted by the Claimant in the Second Arbitration. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls that it is common ground that SAT has blocked several bank accounts of PEM (as well as other assets) starting in April 2020, in order to secure back and accruing taxes which SAT claims PEM owes due to the invalidity of the APA and for other reasons.65\n\nSee para. 42 of the PM Decision referring to PM Request, paras. 80-81 and original footnote 26 of the PM Decision: *\" These measures are described by the Claimant at para. 97 of the Request, especially at para. 97 (ii) and (v), and appear to be the result of SAT* [REDACTED]. The *Claimant indicates that, on average, these VAT refunds payable in the future amount to* [REDACTED] .\n\n71.\n\nThe position of the Claimant, instead, is that there is no overlap (or *\"superposici\u00f3n\"* to use the Respondent\u2019s term) of the two claims in the two arbitrations. The blocking of the accounts has been challenged in the present arbitration but not in the Second Arbitration, while the impediment for PEM to access the VAT refunds (because SAT has deposited them, and continues depositing them, in a blocked account) has been challenged in the Second Arbitration but not in the present one.\n\n72.\n\nStarting with the second measure on which the Parties have focused, *i.e.,* the freezing of PEM\u2019s bank accounts, the Claimant has repeatedly insisted, especially in its briefs in the provisional measures proceedings and in those relating to the Respondent\u2019s Revocation Request, that it has submitted no claim in this arbitration concerning the inaccessibility of the deposits of VAT refunds to PEM made by SAT.\n\n73.\n\nThus, at para. 78 of its PM Request the Claimant stated:\n\n*In making the request for provisional measures (concerning payments of VAT refunds owed to PEM as of the filing of the Request for Arbitration and all future payments of the VAT refunds to be made to PEM), the Claimant has framed its request carefully taking into consideration the limitations imposed by Article 1134 of NAFTA, according to which fa] Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.\u2019*\n\n74.\n\nAt para. 80 of its PM Request, the Claimant explained that:\n\n*To be clear, the Claimant is not seeking to have the freezing of PEM's bank accounts undone including the funds that were on deposit at the time of the seizure, which could be viewed as directed at a measure being challenged in this arbitration.*\n\n75.\n\nAnd at para. 81:\n\n*Rather, it is seeking to ensure that its entitlement to the VAT refunds, which has not been the subject of a challenge under the ongoing NAFTA dispute, should not be gutted by the unauthorized deposit of the refunds by the SAT. Such unauthorized deposits of VAT refunds owing to PEM were made after the filing of the Request for Arbitration to the present date.*\n\n76.\n\nAt para. 144 of its PM Request, the Claimant explained, with reference to Article 1134 NAFTA, that it \"*has limited its request to payment of VAT refunds owed to PEM by SAT that have been deposited into its bank accounts without the authorization of PEM and future VAT refunds that have not been deposited into a frozen bank account*.\"\n\n77.\n\nAs mentioned above, after having heard the clarifications of the Parties at the hearing on the PM Request, the Tribunal was convinced that granting a provisional measure recommending Mexico that SAT makes the refunds effectively available to PEM, by paying or transferring the amounts of refunds to an unblocked account of PEM, was not contrary to Article 1134 NAFTA, since the Claimant was not challenging in the present arbitration the fact that refunds were being made in a way that deprived PEM of their use. In this context, the Tribunal notes the Claimant's statements that SAT has not complied with its requests, notwithstanding the granting by the Tribunal of the provisional measure to this effect, and notwithstanding the fact that the Claimant has indicated on which unblocked account such payments could be made.66\n\nSee Response, para. 40; Rejoinder, paras. 15-19. It does not appear that the Respondent has challenged this statement in its briefs nor that it has until now complied with the provisional measure granted by the Tribunal.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal has acknowledged in the PM Decision that the blocking of the effective enjoyment by PEM of the VAT refunds to which it was \u2013 and is \u2013 entitled, as recognized by the fact that SAT is transferring them monthly to its (blocked) accounts, is not a measure challenged in this arbitration in the following terms:\n\n*[T]he Tribunal considers that the above recommendation is not prevented by the prohibition of Article 1134 of the NAFTA against provisional measures that would 'enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117.' This is because the denial by SAT of PEM's free access to future VAT refunds is not a measure challenged by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration nor discussed in its Memorial.67*\n\nSee para.135 PM Decision, quoted above at para. 9.\n\n79.\n\nThis conclusion is not undermined by the fact that the Claimant mentions \"*depositing VAT refunds in frozen bank accounts thereby impeding recovery of same by PEM*\" in the \"non-exhaustive\" list of 17 measures in para. 158 of its Memorial, to which the Respondent refers.68 This is because, first, the Claimant indicates there that these measures \"*form part of the dispute*\" in general terms. Secondly, because the Claimant does not complain of the inability for PEM to access its VAT refunds when in its Memorial it elaborates on the blocking of the accounts being in breach of the \"Free Transfer Standard\" of Article 1109 NAFTA.69\n\nSee Preliminary Objection, para. 15, quoted above at para. 40.\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, paras. 440-452 and note 461 listing the evidence showing that SAT froze PEM's banks accounts in April 2020.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal sees therefore no reason to change its position from the one stated in its PM Decision on this point. The Tribunal therefore confirms its conclusion there that the payment of VAT refunds to PEM into blocked accounts, making them thus inaccessible to PEM, is not a measure which First Majestic is challenging in the present arbitration. The Tribunal concludes consequently that the Respondent's Preliminary Objection is in this respect unfounded.\n\n81.\n\nSince the measure relating to SAT's refusal to allow PEM to access the VAT refunds is not before this Tribunal, it is immaterial for the jurisdiction of this Tribunal that this measure is the subject matter of the Second Arbitration (including with respect to the determination of the relevant periods of time and the request for compensation of the ensuing damages).70 By submitting a claim concerning the inaccessibility of the VAT refunds to PEM in the Second Arbitration, the Claimant could not and has not breached Article 1121 NAFTA nor its waiver since it has not challenged this measure as being in breach of NAFTA nor has it submitted any claim in that respect in the present arbitration.\n\nSee First Majestic's Request for Arbitration in the Second Arbitration, R-202: \"*23. As explained further below, this claim relates to the Government of Mexico's steadfast refusal to allow PEM access to Value Added Tax (VAT) refunds which it has been entitled to since April 2020. [\u2026] 27. The matter of the imposition of the measures related to the 'blocking' and refusal and to lift the 'blocking' is the subject of an ongoing arbitration between First Majestic and the Government of Mexico (ICSID Case. No. ARB/21/14)*\" and Section V \"*Relief 86. As a result of the Government of Mexico's refusal to pay to PEM amounts equal to approximately [REDACTED] to date and amounts equal to future VAT refunds that belong to PEM, First Majestic and its investments in Mexico and its returns from its investments, have been severely injured in violation of Articles 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105, 1109, and 1110 of the NAFTA. 87. First Majestic, therefore, requests on its own behalf and on behalf of its investments, monetary compensation estimated at this time at a minimum of [REDACTED] plus interest owed to PEM by the SAT*.\"\n\n82.\n\nAs to the other measure that the Respondent has raised in connection with Article 1121 NAFTA, that is, the blocking of PEM's accounts by SAT since April 2020,71 there can be no doubt, nor is there any disagreement between the Parties, that this is a measure which the Claimant has challenged in this arbitration as being in breach of Mexico's obligations under the NAFTA.72 On the other hand, the Respondent has not alleged that First Majestic has challenged this measure (also) in the Second Arbitration, nor does it appear from examining First Majestic's Request for Arbitration in the Second Arbitration that any claim related to such measure has been made by the Claimant there. On the contrary, the Claimant has been explicit there that it is not submitting claims in respect of such measure in the Second Arbitration.73\n\nSee Preliminary Objection, sect. VI Petitorio, (ii) *\"Determinar que no tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer del Caso CIADI No. ARB/21/14 y, en la alternativa, que no tiene jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer de la reclamaci\u00f3n relacionada con el congelamiento de cuentas  y/o el acceso a las devoluciones del IVA*.\" (emphasis added)\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, para. 446 and note 461 there.\n\nSee para. 27 of First Majestic's Request for Arbitration in the Second Arbitration, R-202, quoted in footnote 70 above: \"*The matter of the imposition of the measures related to the 'blocking' and refusal and to lift the 'blocking' is the subject of an ongoing arbitration between First Majestic and the Government of Mexico (ICSID Case. No. ARB/21/14*).\"\n\n83.\n\nFinally, considering its conclusion that the Claimant is not challenging in the Second Arbitration measures that it has alleged in the present arbitration to be in breach of Mexico's obligations toward First Majestic, the Tribunal does not need to deal with the Claimant's procedural arguments referred to in para. 48 above.\n\n**I. Decision**\n---------------\n\n84.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\na. To dismiss the objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal submitted by the Respondent with its Preliminary Objection;\n\nb. To declare the Parties' requests concerning bifurcation moot in view of the decision under (a); and\n\nc. To defer to a later stage the/any decision on the costs of the present proceedings on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection.\n\nDated: December 20, 2023."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 2 - Consolidation Proceeding", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2024-08-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 2 - Consolidation Proceeding\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 March 2021, Claimant initiated an arbitration against Respondent (collectively, the \"**Parties**\") with ICSID Case No. ARB/21/14 (\"**FM 1**\") under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") and Annex 14-C of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"**USMCA**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 21 July 2023, ICSID registered another arbitration initiated by Claimant against Respondent with ICSID Case No. ARB/23/28 (\"**FM 2**\") under Chapter 11 of NAFTA and Annex 14-C of the USMCA.\n\n3.\n\nOn 12 February 2024, Respondent submitted to ICSID, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1126(3), a request for constitution of a tribunal to decide on the consolidation of claims in FM 1 and FM 2 (\"**Consolidation Request**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 May 2024, ICSID informed the Parties that the members of the Consolidation Tribunal had accepted their appointments to serve on the Consolidation Tribunal in FM 1 and FM 2 (\"**Consolidation Tribunal**\"). Accordingly, the Consolidation Tribunal was constituted on that date.\n\n5.\n\nOn 13 May 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal requested the Parties to make an advance payment to cover the costs of the consolidation proceeding.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 May 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO 1**\") and draft Terms of Appointment to the Parties for their comments.\n\n7.\n\nOn 31 May 2024, Respondent provided the Parties' joint comments on the draft PO 1 and the draft Terms of Appointment. On 4 June 2024, Claimant confirmed its agreement with the documents submitted by Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 June 2024, the first procedural meeting (originally scheduled for 5 June 2024) was postponed to give more time for payment of the advance.\n\n9.\n\nOn 25 June 2024, ICSID confirmed receipt of Respondent's share of the advance.\n\n10.\n\nOn 2 July 2024, the Parties respectively confirmed their availability for a first procedural meeting on 16 July 2024. In the same communication, Claimant indicated its intention to identify additional items for the agenda of the meeting, including \"jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal pursuant to NAFTA Article 1126, timing concerns and good faith application of the procedural rules\".\n\n11.\n\nOn 10 July 2024, Claimant requested the suspension of the consolidation proceeding on the basis that the Consolidation Tribunal was established after the 60-day period provided for in NAFTA Article 1126(5) (\"**Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 15 July 2024, Respondent provided its response to Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period.\n\n13.\n\nAlso on 15 July 2024, Claimant requested the Consolidation Tribunal to adjourn the first procedural meeting scheduled for 16 July 2024 on the basis that the tribunal in FM 1 had granted its request for admission of ancillary claims. Claimant further requested the opportunity to make full submissions on whether the out-of-time constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal can be resolved when only Respondent is willing to waive the time limit, and whether the time limit can be waived. Respondent opposed Claimant's request to adjourn the first procedural meeting on the same date.\n\n14.\n\nOn 16 July 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal informed the Parties that the first procedural meeting would take place as scheduled, during which the Parties could address the recent correspondence. During the procedural meeting, the Consolidation Tribunal decided to address Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period in an initial written phase and directed the Parties to file their respective written submissions within the timelines agreed upon during the procedural meeting.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 August 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal issued PO 1, *inter alia*, reiterating and confirming the aforesaid directions in respect of Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period in accordance with the procedural timetable set out in Annex A of PO 1. In particular, the Consolidation Tribunal fixed the deadline of 7 August 2024 for Claimant's submission on its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period and of 22 August 2024 for Respondent's response.\n\n16.\n\nOn 8 August 2024, Claimant filed its Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction dated 7 August 2024 (\"**Claimant's 60-day Submission**\"). Since Claimant's 60-day Submission was filed after the deadline specified in Annex A of PO 1, Claimant also submitted a letter dated 8 August 2024, requesting an extension of one day due to technical difficulties in uploading the documents to ICSID's filesharing platform, Box.\n\n17.\n\nOn 12 August 2024, the Consolidation Tribunal granted Claimant's request for a limited extension and proposed to extend the corresponding deadlines for Respondent's submission and the Consolidation Tribunal's decision by one day each, subject to Respondent's comments.\n\n18.\n\nOn 13 August 2024, Respondent informed the Consolidation Tribunal that it did not require an extension and would file its response to Claimant's 60-day Submission within the original deadline prescribed under Annex A of PO 1.\n\n19.\n\nOn 22 August 2024, Respondent filed its response to Claimant's 60-day Submission (\"**Respondent's 60-day Submission**\").\n\n20.\n\nIn this Procedural Order No. 2, the Consolidation Tribunal decides upon Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period.\n\n**II. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nClaimant requests that the Consolidation Tribunal \"dismiss the Respondent's Request for Consolidation\". Claimant reserves the right to claim its costs against Respondent.1\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent requests that the Consolidation Tribunal: (i) determine that it is duly constituted and has jurisdiction to decide whether to assume jurisdiction over all claims in ICSID Arbitration Nos. ARB/21/14 and ARB/23/28, and to hear and determine them; and (ii) award Respondent the legal costs and expenses related to this arbitration, considering the clear lack of merit of this preliminary objection to jurisdiction.2\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 77.\n\n**III. NAFTA ARTICLE 1126(5)**\n------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nClaimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period is based on NAFTA Article 1126(5). This provides as follows:\n\nWithin 60 days of receipt of the request, the Secretary-General shall establish a Tribunal comprising three arbitrators. The Secretary-General shall appoint the presiding arbitrator from the roster referred to in Article 1124(4). In the event that no such presiding arbitrator is available to serve, the Secretary-General shall appoint, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, a presiding arbitrator who is not a national of any of the Parties. The Secretary-General shall appoint the two other members from the roster referred to in Article 1124(4), and to the extent not available from that roster, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, and to the extent not available from that Panel, in the discretion of the Secretary-General. One member shall be a national of the disputing Party and one member shall be a national of a Party of the disputing investors.\n\n**IV. CONSOLIDATION TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn this Section, the Consolidation Tribunal sets out the issues raised by Claimant with respect to its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period, and Respondent's response thereto, and decides upon those matters. To the extent that the Consolidation Tribunal does not set out in detail every argument made by the Parties, those arguments have been closely reviewed by the Consolidation Tribunal and can be considered subsumed herein.\n\n25.\n\nClaimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period is brought on the basis of an alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal.3 The Consolidation Tribunal considers that it is empowered by NAFTA Article 1126(1) and Article 21(1) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 1976 (\"**UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules**\") to decide on Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period, and neither Party has contended otherwise. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules apply to this consolidation proceeding pursuant to NAFTA Article 1126(1). Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction\".\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\n**A. Preclusion of Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal will first consider whether Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60 Day Period is precluded, whether by estoppel, or by the principle of good faith.\n\n**(1) Claimant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n27.\n\nClaimant argues that it is not estopped from raising the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period as the requirements for estoppel are not met. Claimant identifies three conditions for estoppel to have arisen: *first*, there must be a clear and unequivocal representation previously made by it to another party, either expressly or impliedly; *second*, the other party was, in the circumstances, entitled to rely and in fact did rely on this representation; and *third*, as a result the other party has been prejudiced or the party making it has secured some benefit or advantage for itself.4\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 57-60, 73, *citing* Exhibit CL-0016, *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. The Republic of Ecuador (I)*, PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277, Partial Award on the Merits, dated 30 March 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 349, 350, 353; Exhibit CL-0017, *Government of the Province of East Kalimantan v. PT Kaltim Prima Coal and others*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/3, Award on Jurisdiction, dated 28 December 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215.\n\n28.\n\nIn respect of the first requirement, Claimant asserts that it has consistently raised its concerns regarding compliance with the 60-day time limit in its correspondence with the ICSID Secretariat dated 22 February 2024 and 1 May 2024, and before the Consolidation Tribunal through correspondence dated 2, 10 and 15 July 2024, and during the first procedural meeting. Therefore, Claimant states that it has not misrepresented its position or misled Respondent regarding the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period.5\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64, 74.\n\n29.\n\nIn this regard, Claimant further states that the draft Terms of Appointment and any alleged waiver to the jurisdictional objection contained therein is not binding on the Parties and cannot constitute a waiver of the mandatory 60-day requirement under NAFTA Article 1126(5). In any event, Claimant reiterates that it has consistently raised its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period both before and after providing its comments on the draft Terms of Appointment, and again at the first procedural meeting.6\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 65-69.\n\n30.\n\nOn the second requirement mentioned in \u00b6 27 above, Claimant states that it never made a clear and unequivocal representation that it consented to the Consolidation Tribunal's jurisdiction. To the contrary, raised its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period as a serious issue requiring rectification by Respondent. Claimant states that it would, therefore, be unreasonable and disingenuous for Respondent to claim to have relied on its \"unsubstantiated\" belief in this regard.7\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.\n\n31.\n\nIn respect of the third requirement mentioned in \u00b6 27 above, according to Claimant, Respondent has not indicated that it suffered any damage due to its reliance on Claimant's alleged conduct. Claimant states that any damage suffered by Respondent arises from its own refusal to refile the Consolidation Request, and not from Claimant's actions.8\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 72.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n32.\n\nRespondent disputes that Claimant raised its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period on time and states that Claimant filed this objection for the first time only hours before the first procedural meeting with the Consolidation Tribunal. Respondent denies that Claimant raised the issue of the Consolidation Tribunal's jurisdiction in its correspondence dated 30 April 2024. In its view, it merely urged the ICSID Secretary-General to establish the Consolidation Tribunal as soon as possible. Respondent also denies that Claimant raised the issue in its correspondence dated 1 May 2024 which, according to Respondent, only noted that the deadline had passed and expressed Claimant's view that compliance with NAFTA Article 1126(5) was mandatory.9\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 63, 66-68.\n\n33.\n\nRespondent states that, to the contrary, Claimant did not object to paragraph 3.3 of the draft Terms of Appointment circulated for comments by the Consolidation Tribunal, which recorded the Parties' agreement that the Consolidation Tribunal had been validly constituted in accordance with NAFTA Article 1126. According to Respondent, therefore, Claimant should not be permitted to go against its own statements and actions to frustrate the mandate of the Consolidation Tribunal.10\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, 69-73.\n\n**(3) Consolidation Tribunal's Analysis**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal does not disagree, in principle, with Claimant's proposed test to determine whether a procedural estoppel has arisen (see \u00b6 27 above). Respondent has not specifically commented on the criteria.\n\n35.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal agrees with Claimant that it is not estopped from raising the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period. Taking into account the record of communications by Claimant, the representations made to ICSID and to the Consolidation Tribunal were not an unequivocal acceptance of the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal after the 60-day period in NAFTA Article 1126(5).\n\n36.\n\nOn the one hand, Claimant did raise the question of the timeliness of the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal in certain communications. On 1 May 2024, it stated its view to the ICSID Secretariat and Respondent that the period was mandatory, and invited Respondent's proposal to resolve this \"critical issue\". On 2 July 2024, it indicated to the Consolidation Tribunal and Respondent its intention to add matters to the agenda for the first procedural meeting such as the \"jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal pursuant to NAFTA Article 1126, timing concerns and good faith application of the procedural rules\" (see \u00b6 10 above).\n\n37.\n\nOn the other hand, Claimant did not explicitly object to the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal on the basis of untimeliness until 10 July 2024 (see \u00b6 11 above). Moreover, on 31 May 2024 Claimant did not object to the language circulated in the draft Terms of Appointment for the Parties' consideration which stated in paragraph 3.3 that \"[t]he parties confirm that they have no objection on the basis that the period to establish the Consolidation Tribunal exceeded 60 days from the request for consolidation.\"\n\n38.\n\nWhile Claimant's explicit objection to the timing of the Consolidation Tribunal's constitution was not communicated until 10 July 2024, Claimant did timely raise concerns related to the expiry of the 60-day period and signalled that it considered some further action to be required to resolve the issue, for example in its correspondence of 1 May 2024. In these circumstances, the Consolidation Tribunal does not consider Claimant's prior statements to have conveyed a clear and unequivocal acceptance of the delay in the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal. Claimant is therefore not estopped from raising its objection when it did so, prior to the first procedural meeting.\n\n39.\n\nAlso relevant to whether Claimant's objection is precluded, Respondent invokes the principle of good faith, which in its view prevents a party from going against its own prior statements or actions when another party has relied on them.11 The Consolidation Tribunal does not accept that Claimant has acted contrary to the principle of good faith, since the different communications noted in \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 above do not demonstrate a lack of good faith. Nor is lack of good faith evident from the fact that Claimant participated in the process of appointing the Consolidation Tribunal, and in doing so requested extensions of time. The Consolidation Tribunal does not consider Respondent to have established that Claimant deliberately sought to frustrate the prompt constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal, and subsequently to object to the timeliness of its constitution or to have otherwise acted contrary to the principle of good faith.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 65.\n\n40.\n\nFor these reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal determines that Claimant is not precluded from raising the Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period, and will proceed to decide upon it.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n*(i) Mandatory nature of the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nClaimant submits that compliance with the timeline of 60 days prescribed under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is a mandatory condition for a consolidation tribunal to be validly constituted. In this regard, Claimant relies on, *first*, the language of NAFTA Article 1126(5) and specifically, the use of the word \"shall\" therein, and *second*, the alleged practice of States party to NAFTA (\"**NAFTA Parties**\"). Further, Claimant states that neither the Parties nor the Consolidation Tribunal can waive the non-compliance with the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5).12\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 16-17, 21.\n\n42.\n\nIn respect of the first submission, Claimant argues that as per Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (\"**Vienna Convention**\"), NAFTA Article 1126(5) must be interpreted in accordance with the \"ordinary meaning\" of its terms (see \u00b6 233 above).13\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\n43.\n\nClaimant states that the ordinary, dictionary meaning of the word \"shall\" indicates a \"requirement\" or \"command\" or what is \"mandatory\". Further, Claimant contrasts the use of \"shall\" with that of \"may\" in Chapter 11 of NAFTA generally and Article 1126 specifically. According to Claimant, the choice between these two words in these provisions indicates whether a directive is mandatory or not. Claimant states, therefore, that Article 1126(5) imposes a mandatory requirement or condition that must be adhered to before a consolidation tribunal can be validly constituted.14\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 10-16, *citing* Exhibit CL-0003, \"Shall,\" Black's Law Dictionary, (12th ed.), dated 2024; Exhibit CL-0004, \"Shall,\" Oxford English Dictionary, last visited 6 August 2024; and Exhibit CL-0005, \"Shall,\" Merriam-Webster, last visited 6 August 2024.\n\n44.\n\nIn respect of the second submission referred to in \u00b6 41 above, Claimant states that consistent and long-standing practice of the NAFTA Parties, including Respondent, confirms the mandatory nature of the 60-day time limit within Article 1126(5). In particular, Claimant relies on Respondent's position in *B-Mex, et al. v. Mexico*15 where, according to Claimant, Respondent took the view that the use of the word \"shall\" in NAFTA imposes a mandatory legal obligation and, therefore, the procedural requirements in NAFTA Articles 1119 and 1121 relating to the submission of a notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration were mandatory.16\n\nExhibit CL-0006, *B-Mex, LLC Deana Anthone, Neil Ayervais, Douglas Black and others v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/3, Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections, dated 30 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43.\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20, *citing* Exhibit CL-0006, *B-Mex, LLC Deana Anthone, Neil Ayervais, Douglas Black and others v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/3, Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections, dated 30 May 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43, 44.\n\n45.\n\nOn the aspect of waiver, Claimant argues that a mandatory (\"shall\") procedural requirement is established by agreement of the NAFTA Parties and cannot be modified, except through amendment, or jointly issued interpretation, agreed upon by all three NAFTA Parties.17 Claimant further states that where the NAFTA Parties intended to permit the disputing Parties to modify a default procedural rule, they indicated so expressly, by including phrases, such as \"unless the disputing parties agree otherwise.\" Claimant submits, therefore, that without the NAFTA Parties' consent, neither the disputing Parties nor the Consolidation Tribunal can change a mandatory requirement under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, including the 60-day time limit for constitution of a consolidation tribunal.18\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 21, *citing* Exhibit CL-0002, Article 24(2) and Article 40, Vienna Convention.\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n46.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent's departure in this case from its otherwise consistent position on the mandatory meaning of the word \"shall,\" cannot be the basis to disregard the mandatory 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5). Claimant relies on correspondence among the Parties and the ICSID Secretariat leading up to the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal wherein both Parties acknowledged the lapse of the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5). Claimant highlights that it had raised the issue in its correspondence dated 1 May 2024 and had invited Respondent to provide proposals to resolve it. Claimant argues, therefore, that the Parties have not and could not have waived the 60-day requirement under NAFTA Article 1126(5).19\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 23-30.\n\n*(ii) Legal effect of failure to constitute the Consolidation Tribunal within 60 days*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nClaimant submits that the consequence of non-compliance with the timeline of 60 days under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is that the Consolidation Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Claimant states that non-compliance with mandatory procedural requirements, such as pre-arbitration negotiation and litigation requirements, has been held by other investment tribunals to negate the jurisdiction of the tribunal and is not merely a matter of admissibility.20\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 31-38, *citing* Exhibit CL-0007, *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

Claimant also asserts that since NAFTA Article 1126 sets out a complete code for the adjudication of requests for consolidation, the very first step prescribed therein cannot simply be ignored. Further, Claimant states that there exists no ability here for the Parties to extend a deadline contained in an investment treaty.22\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, *citing* Exhibit CL-0014, *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, dated 26 January 2006, \u00b6 117; Exhibit CL-0015, *Enkev Beheer B.V. v. The Republic of Poland*, PCA Case No. 2013-01, First Partial Award, dated 29 April 2014, \u00b6 320.\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 39-44.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to Claimant, therefore, the establishment of a consolidation tribunal within the 60-day time limit is a condition precedent to valid jurisdiction, and distinguishable from formalities or omissions which may be remedied.23\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\n*(iii)Prejudice to Claimant if the alleged defect in jurisdiction is not cured*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nClaimant argues that non-compliance with the 60-day time limit for constituting the Consolidation Tribunal would make any subsequent award issued by the Constitution Tribunal vulnerable to challenge, which will cause grave prejudice to Claimant. Claimant alleges that Respondent has not acted in good faith during the FM1 and FM2 proceedings as well as this consolidation proceeding, and its conduct demonstrates \"the very real likelihood\" that Respondent will challenge any subsequent final award on jurisdictional grounds if this suits its purpose.24\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.\n\n51.\n\nClaimant asserts that Respondent is attempting to use this consolidation proceeding to forum-shop, delay the FM1 proceedings and avoid complying with the provisional order issued in the FM1 proceedings. Claimant states that Respondent's purported objective for filing the Consolidation Request, i.e., having all claims heard by a single tribunal, can be met through withdrawal of the FM2 proceedings now that the FM1 tribunal has admitted Claimant's ancillary claims. Claimant states that despite this, Respondent has refused to cooperate in withdrawing the FM2 proceedings and is avoiding submitting all claims to the tribunal in the FM1 proceedings, contrary to its stated objective for filing the Consolidation Request.25\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 50-55.\n\n52.\n\nClaimant states that if Respondent's actions are *bona fide*, it must refile its Consolidation Request to avoid any challenges to the resulting award. According to Claimant, Respondent's insistence on ignoring the mandatory 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is hindering the fair and efficient resolution of the disputes between the Parties.26\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 56.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n*(i) Mandatory nature of the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5) and legal effect of failure to constitute the Consolidation Tribunal within 60 days*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nRespondent argues that the 60-day timeline under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is only a procedural requirement imposed upon the ICSID Secretary-General, and not a \"condition precedent\" or \"strict requirement\", non-compliance with which would affect the Consolidation Tribunal's jurisdiction.27 Respondent disputes Claimant's interpretation of the first sentence of NAFTA Article 1126(5) in this regard.28\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37, 43.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 37, 40, 42.\n\n54.\n\nRespondent states that Claimant's interpretation erroneously focuses on only one element of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, i.e., the \"ordinary meaning\" of the word \"shall\", while ignoring the context of the provision and the \"object and purpose\" of NAFTA. Respondent does not dispute that the word \"shall\" ordinarily implies a \"mandatory\" requirement. However, according to Respondent, the relevant context, object and purpose for interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5), which include the NAFTA, ICSID Convention and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, do not support Claimant's interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5).29\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 30-33.\n\n55.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent argues, *first*, that the 60-day timeline is imposed on the Secretary-General of ICSID, which is a neutral, administrative and procedural position meant to facilitate submission of investment disputes to arbitration. Respondent states that the 60-day timeline enables the ICSID Secretary-General to follow due process by allowing parties sufficient time to comment on the proposed arbitrators. Respondent states that, consequently, the procedure is not entirely in the control of the ICSID Secretary-General and depends on the actions of the Parties. According to Respondent, this is relevant context which supports the interpretation that the 60-day time limit is only a procedural requirement which does not affect the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal.30\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n\n56.\n\n*Second*, Respondent argues that the 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5) is not a condition precedent to the Parties' consent to arbitration. Respondent distinguishes the 60-day requirement under Article 1126(5), which is applicable to the ICSID Secretary-General and does not condition the Parties' consent to arbitration, from mandatory conditions under other provisions of NAFTA which are to be fulfilled by a disputing investor before filing a claim. According to Respondent, the investment arbitration decisions cited by Claimant confirm this distinction. According to Respondent, failure to comply with the 60-day timeline is a \"technical failure\" which was cured in the present case, by establishing the Constitution Tribunal once the independence and impartiality of the three arbitrators had been confirmed.31\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 37-41, *citing* Exhibit RL-0001-ENG, *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Final Award, dated 11 October 2002, \u00b6 44.\n\n57.\n\n*Third*, Respondent argues that interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5) must be done in light of the object and purpose of NAFTA and Section B of Chapter 11 of NAFTA, which include the creation of \"effective procedures ... for the settlement of disputes\", \"equal treatment among investors\" and \"due process of law before an impartial tribunal\". Respondent further notes that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (which pre-date NAFTA), which are applicable to the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal, emphasize the requirement of impartiality and independence of arbitrators.32 Respondent submits that Claimant's interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5) is contrary to the aforesaid object and purpose for the following reasons:\n\n(i) Claimant's interpretation of NAFTA Article 1126(5), which would deny jurisdiction to a consolidation tribunal composed after 60 days, would also prevent the ICSID Secretary-General from ensuring compliance with the fundamental requirements of due process, impartiality and independence. Respondent submits that the 60-day timeline is essential to allow the ICSID Secretary-General to obtain parties' comments on the proposed tribunal and, therefore, to ensure due process and facilitate the constitution of an impartial and independent tribunal. Respondent argues that even in the present case, the delay of 26 days in establishing the Consolidation Tribunal was necessary to allow the Parties adequate time to complete their review process. Respondent accordingly states that Claimant's interpretation would render useless the objectives of due process and impartiality and independence of the consolidation tribunal and must be rejected.33\n\n(ii) Similarly, Claimant's interpretation would defeat NAFTA's stated objective of effective and efficient dispute resolution. Respondent argues that Claimant's assertion that the Consolidation Tribunal does not have jurisdiction and Respondent must file a new consolidation request due to lapse of the 60-day timeline, impedes the efficient resolution of disputes and only adds to the time and cost of the process.34 Respondent notes that Claimant's proposed solution would require Respondent to re-file its request and the Secretary-General to re-compose the same tribunal of previously appointed arbitrators leading to unnecessary procedural redundancy and delay.35\n\n(iii) The purpose of NAFTA Article 1126 has been held to be the \"avoidance of procedural harassment\" of parties. Further, the procedural rights of both sides must be balanced in consolidation proceedings. Claimant's interpretation would give parties the ability to unilaterally prevent the proper constitution of a consolidation tribunal by delaying this process, thereby rendering Article 1126 useless.36\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 42-49.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 50-53.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 54-57.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 42.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 58-62, *citing* Exhibit RL-0003-ENG, *Canfor Corporation and others v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Order of the Tribunal, 7 September 2005, \u00b6 74.\n\n*(ii) Prejudice to Claimant if the alleged defect in jurisdiction is not cured*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent denies that Claimant will suffer prejudice if its Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period is rejected. Respondent states that, practically, awards in investor-State cases have only been annulled for improper constitution of the tribunal when the defect involves a serious deviation from a fundamental rule of procedure, and non-compliance with the 60-day time limit under NAFTA Article 1126(5) would be irrelevant in this regard.37\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.\n\n59.\n\nRespondent further states that given Respondent's position in these proceedings, there would be no legal basis or reason for Respondent to go against its own actions and challenge an award on grounds of non-compliance with the 60-day time limit. Respondent has not challenged the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal and has taken the position that any technical failure to comply with the time limit was promptly remedied when the ICSID Secretary-General established the Consolidation Tribunal as soon as the impartiality and independence of the arbitrators was confirmed.38 Respondent asserts that Claimant has also not suffered any prejudice from the delay of 26 days in the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal.39\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 41.\n\nRespondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 76.\n\n**(3) Consolidation Tribunal's Analysis**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Consolidation Tribunal was constituted 26 days after the expiry of the 60-day period specified in NAFTA Article 1126(5).40\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 27; Respondent's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\n61.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal interprets NAFTA Article 1126(5) in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, i.e., in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n62.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the word \"shall\" in NAFTA Article 1126(5) indicates a mandatory requirement. However, mandatory does not mean that the requirement is properly characterized as a condition precedent to consent to the consolidation proceedings. As Respondent points out, the mandatory requirement falls upon the Secretary-General of ICSID and not upon the disputing Parties (\"the Secretary-General shall establish\", see \u00b6 23 above). Being an obligation upon a third party and outside the direct control of the Parties, the plain language does not support an interpretation that the 60-day period for establishing the Consolidation Tribunal is a condition of consent of the disputing Parties for consolidation proceedings. In this regard, the Consolidation Tribunal disagrees with Claimant that the 60-day period set out in NAFTA Article 1126(5) is analogous to certain pre-conditions for requesting arbitration, such as a mandatory requirement to exhaust domestic remedies or a mandatory period for negotiations.41 Nor is it constructed as a condition precedent to the consolidation proceedings continuing.\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission, \u00b6 32-38.\n\n63.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the purpose of NAFTA Article 1126(5) is to serve efficiency, in the sense of procedural economy. The 60-day period specified for the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal allows the consolidation proceedings to move forward with due dispatch, while preserving due process by allowing time for the Parties to provide their views on the prospective members of a consolidation tribunal. Indeed, the reason for the delay in constituting the Consolidation Tribunal was because both Parties availed themselves of the opportunity to have input on the candidates.\n\n64.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal does not consider this interpretation to be inconsistent with other uses of the word \"shall\" in different provisions of NAFTA, which relate to different requirements specified under the treaty, with distinct contexts and purposes.\n\n65.\n\nWere Claimant's interpretation to be accepted, the procedure would require Respondent to refile its Consolidation Request, and subsequently for ICSID to re-constitute a consolidation tribunal. In the Consolidation Tribunal's view, this would frustrate the efficiency objectives of NAFTA Article 1126.\n\n66.\n\nIn addition, the Consolidation Tribunal considers that the particular factual circumstances of this case confirm the view that non-compliance with the 60-day period does not constitute a bar to the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Tribunal. Specifically, the ICSID Secretary-General initiated the process for the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal promptly after the submission of Respondent's request of 12 February 2024. Ten days later, on 22 February 2024, the ICSID Secretary-General submitted a first list of potential arbitrators and requested the Parties to provide their comments by 29 February 2024. Claimant then requested the ICSID Secretary-General to extend the deadline to provide comments by 14 days, which was granted. Claimant requested a second, four-day extension of the deadline for the submission of comments, which was, again, granted. Finally, Claimant successfully requested a third, three-day extension of the deadline. On 21 March 2024 (that is, 38 days after Respondent's consolidation request), Claimant submitted its comments objecting to one of the three proposed arbitrators and Respondent requested an opportunity to react to Claimant's objection. This opportunity was granted and, on 1 April 2024, Respondent filed its comments on Claimant's objection to a proposed arbitrator.\n\n67.\n\nOn 11 April 2024, the ICSID Secretary-General submitted a revised list of arbitrators, which, this time, was met with Respondent's objection to the new proposed arbitrator. This objection was filed on 17 April 2024. Thereafter, on 25 April 2024, the ICSID Secretary-General submitted a third list of arbitrators to which none of the Parties objected. The Consolidation Tribunal was thus constituted on 8 May 2024.\n\n68.\n\nAgainst this background, it bears recalling that NAFTA Article 1126(5) significantly restricts the pool of arbitrators from which the ICSID Secretary-General may choose. One of them must be a national of the \"disputing Party\" (Respondent) and another must be a national of the disputing investor (Claimant). The Consolidation Tribunal is thus mindful of the complexity and importance of the delicate task entrusted to the ICSID Secretary-General to identify potential candidates and ensure their availability and suitability to serve on a tribunal before they can be proposed to the parties for consideration.\n\n69.\n\nDespite the several requests from the Parties, the ICSID Secretary-General was able to submit two lists of arbitrators within 60 days from the Consolidation Request. Even after the expiry of the 60-day period, the Secretariat was confronted with a further objection to a proposed arbitrator, thus requiring it to submit a third list of arbitrators for consideration. The ICSID Secretary-General thus acted actively and diligently during the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal. The delay beyond the 60-day period is rather a function of the specific circumstances of this case, which, as explained above, included requests of both Parties during the constitution process either to extend deadlines for submission of comments, object to proposed arbitrators, or to be afforded an opportunity to react to the other Party's objections. This lends further support to the conclusion that the delay beyond the 60-day period may not amount to a bar to jurisdiction, especially where the Parties' requests throughout the Consolidation Tribunal's constitution heavily contributed to this delay.\n\n70.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal considers that the 60-day period is not a requirement that has a bearing on its jurisdiction. As such, non-compliance with the 60-day period does not deprive, especially in the circumstances of this case, the Consolidation Tribunal of jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1126(5).\n\n71.\n\nSince the purpose of the 60-day period is to balance efficiency with due process, the Consolidation Tribunal accepts Respondent's submission that the successful constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal has cured the procedural defect of untimeliness, taking into account that: (i) due process was respected; and (ii) neither Party has been prejudiced by the 26-day delay in the Consolidation Tribunal's constitution.\n\n72.\n\nIn respect of prejudice, Claimant's primary argument is that an award rendered by the Consolidation Tribunal (in a scenario in which Respondent's Consolidation Request is granted) would be vulnerable to challenge in post-award proceedings.42 In support of the likelihood of this scenario, Claimant argues that Respondent's conduct lacks good faith, constitutes forum-shopping and constitutes a pattern of obstructionist behaviour.43 The Consolidation Tribunal considers this risk to be speculative and the allegations with respect to Respondent's conduct to be unproven, at least at this stage of the proceedings. The Consolidation Tribunal is not satisfied that Claimant will suffer serious prejudice as a result of the constitution of the Consolidation Tribunal after the 60-day period provided for in NAFTA Article 1126(5). On the other hand, the refiling of Respondent's Consolidation Request causes prejudice to both Parties in the form of considerable delay and additional expense.\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\nClaimant's 60-day Submission \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52, 56.\n\n73.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Consolidation Tribunal considers Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60-day Period to be without merit and rejects it. The Consolidation Tribunal confirms that its establishment after the 60-day period provided for in NAFTA Article 1126(5) does not impact its jurisdiction to decide whether to assume jurisdiction over all claims in ICSID Arbitration Nos. ARB/21/14 and ARB/23/28, and, subject to its decision on the Consolidation Request, to hear and determine them as appropriate.\n\n74.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to make any decision with respect to the costs associated with this preliminary objection at this time and reserves the issue of costs for consideration at a later stage of these proceedings.\n\n75.\n\nIn light of the Consolidation Tribunal's decision, the balance of the Procedural Timetable (Annex A to PO 1) is in effect and Respondent's Memorial of Consolidation is due on 7 October 2024, in accordance with that timetable.\n\n**V. ORDER**\n------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Consolidation Tribunal has carefully considered the positions of the Parties. As set out above, the Consolidation Tribunal:\n\n(i) REJECTS Claimant's Preliminary Objection on 60 Day Period;\n\n(ii) CONFIRMS that it is duly constituted and has jurisdiction to decide whether to assume jurisdiction over all claims in ICSID Arbitration Nos. ARB/21/14 and ARB/23/28, and, subject to its decision on the Consolidation Request, to hear and determine them as appropriate;\n\n(iii) RESERVES the issue of costs; and\n\n(iv) CONFIRMS the next steps in the Procedural Timetable as set out in Annex A to PO 1.\n\nDate: 29 August 2024"}]}
