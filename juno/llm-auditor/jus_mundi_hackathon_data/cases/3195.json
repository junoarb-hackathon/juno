Procedural background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 19, 2019, Claimants requested an extension of the deadlines for the submission of the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defense (the \"**Request for an extended briefing schedule**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn July 21, 2019, Claimants filed an Application for Interim Measures, accompanied by the following documentation: Appendices A to E, Witness Statement of Mr. Carlos Williamson-Nasi dated July 18, 2019; Witness Statement of Mr. Gonzalo Gil White dated July 18, 2019; Witness Statement of Mr. Jose A. Ca\u00f1edo-White dated July 18, 2019; Factual Exhibits C-0001 to C-0083; and Legal Authorities CL-0033 to CL-0057 (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures**\" or \"**Claimants\u2019 Application**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Claimants requested an expedited briefing schedule for the Application (the \"**Request for an expedited briefing**\").\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit comments, no later than July 29, 2019, on *(i)* Claimants\u2019 request of July 19, for an extension in the briefing schedule for the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defense; and *(ii)* Claimants\u2019 proposal of July 22, for an expedited briefing schedule for the Application for Interim Measures.\n\n5.\n\nOn July 29, 2019, Respondent submitted, among others, its comments on Claimants\u2019 Request for an extended briefing schedule of July 19, 2019 and Claimants\u2019 Request for an expedited briefing of July 22, 2019, accompanied by the following document: Annex A -Proposed Schedule and Factual Exhibits R-0001 to R-0004 (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Comments**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn August 7, 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (on the Procedural Calendar). The Tribunal decided, among others, to extend the time limit for the submission of the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defense, and invited Respondent to submit a response to Claimants\u2019 Application by September 18, 2019.\n\n7.\n\nOn September 6, 2019, Claimants submitted a letter informing the Tribunal of two recent developments that, in their view, rendered the measures requested in the Application especially urgent. Claimants informed the Tribunal that Respondent had requested and obtained Interpol Red Notices (international arrest warrants) against two Claimants and three of its witnesses. Claimants also informed the Tribunal of the *amparo* proceeding in Mexico, in which Claimants had recently obtained a recording of the hearing \"where the prosecutor requested and the judge issued the oral arrest warrants against Claimants and the witnesses.\"1 Claimants additionally sought leave to submit into the case record *(i)* the recordings of the hearing, and *(ii)* a short submission (not to exceed five pages) describing the contents of the recording.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of September 6, 2019, page 2.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit comments on Claimants\u2019 letter by September 13, 2019.\n\n9.\n\nOn September 13, 2019, Respondent submitted its observations to Claimants\u2019 letter and requests of September 6, 2019. Respondent indicated that it would not oppose Claimants\u2019 request for leave to submit the hearing recording and the transcript of the recording. Respondent requested a two-week extension of time to submit its response to Claimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of September 16, 2019, the Tribunal decided to *(1)* grant Claimants leave to submit *(i)* the recordings of the hearing with *(ii)* the transcript of the hearing, and *(iii)* a five-page letter describing the contents of the hearing to the Tribunal; and *(2)* grant Respondent a two-week extension until October 2, 2019, to submit its Response to Claimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures.\n\n11.\n\nOn September 25, 2019, Claimants submitted the recording and the transcript of the hearing, as well as a six-page submission.\n\n12.\n\nOn September 29, 2019, Respondent submitted that Claimants had not followed the Tribunal\u2019s instructions and instead filed a submission on \"new\" arguments and revelations. Respondent requested that the Tribunal grant it an additional 10 days to respond to Claimants\u2019 submissions. Respondent further requested that the Tribunal bar Claimants from making any additional submissions.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, Claimants informed the Tribunal that it was \"agnostic\" on whether the Tribunal should grant Respondent\u2019s request for an extension of time to submit its Response. Claimants additionally requested that the Tribunal issue its decision as expeditiously as possible.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 3, 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it granted Respondent a ten-day extension from October 2, 2019, to submit its Response to Claimants\u2019 Request for Interim Measures and Claimants\u2019 letter of September 25, 2019.\n\n15.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, Claimants submitted the Statement of Claim, with accompanying witness statement, expert reports, appendices and indexes of legal authorities and exhibits (the \"**Statement of Claim**\"). On October 10, 2019, Claimants submitted accompanying exhibits C-0183 and C-0216 to C-0216.30 which were audio recordings (exhibit C-0220 was intentionally omitted) (the \"**Audios**\").\n\n16.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, on October 12, 2019, Respondent submitted its Response to the Application (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Response**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn October 21, 2019, Respondent submitted that the Audios accompanying the Statement of Claim were leaked to the press, in breach of the provisions of Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 3. Respondent further submitted that as public officials they had the duty to report to the competent authorities any accusation related to corruption and, thereby, were obliged to share the Audios.\n\n18.\n\nOn November 4, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to a telephonic hearing on Claimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, which, after exchanges with the Parties was scheduled for December 3, 2019.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the Hearing on Interim Measures took place by telephone.

The Parties\u2019 positions**\n------------------------------\n\n*A. Claimants*\n--------------\n\n*(a) Respondent has engaged in a series of actions intended to persecute Claimants as retaliation for initiating these arbitration proceedings*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent has engaged in a \"relentless\" series of persecutions as \"retaliation\" for the Claimants\u2019 initiation of the present arbitration proceedings.2 These actions are presented as forcing Claimants, as well as Integradora and its subsidiaries, to spend a considerable amount of resources to respond to and defend against them.3 Claimants\u2019 application specifically refers to the following actions:4\n\n- Eight criminal investigations launched by Respondent against Integradora, Perforadora, their directors, employees and lawyers. Claimants argue that these investigations lack any legal basis and are solely motivated by the objective of taking over the Jack-Up Rigs and defaming everyone associated with them.5 Claimants describes these investigations as a \"carefully orchestrated and methodically executed effort\" to deter from further pursuing these arbitration proceedings.6 Claimants refer specifically to:\n\n**1. (** \"**The PGR Investigation**\") \u2014 an investigation following a complaint filed by the Bondholders before the *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica,* used by the Respondent \"to fabricate evidence\" against Perforadora to be used to further attack Perforadora in other criminal proceedings.7\n\n**2. (** \"**The Improper Representation Investigation**\") \u2014 an investigation for a procedural fraud *(fraude procesal)* by way of improper representation \"based on allegations that warrant no serious consideration.\"8\n\n**3. (** \"**The Sham Companies Investigation**\") \u2014 an investigation for fraudulent administration *(administraci\u00f3n fraudulenta)* focusing on Perforadora's relationship with sixteen \"sham\" or \"ghost\" companies that supposedly facilitate tax evasion.9 Claimants specifically argue that Respondent rewarded a Mexican Judge in this case \"for issuing baseless and suspicious orders by promoting him [...] from trial judge to appellate judge.\"10\n\n**4. (** \"**The Contempt Investigation**\") \u2014 an investigation against Perforadora and its employees based on a complaint that these were in contempt of the Rigs Take-Over Order.11\n\n**5. (\"The Duplicative** ***Amparos*** **Investigation\") \u2014** an investigation against Mr. Alonso Del Val for having omitted to describe all *amparos* related to the Mexican criminal investigations.12\n\n**6. (\"The Tax Evasion Investigation\") \u2014** Claimants further refer to a media report about the Mexican Ministry of Finances *(Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico)* complaint filed with the PGR against Mr. Ca\u00f1edo, the NonExecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Integradora and one of the Claimants; Mr. Gil, CEO and a director of Integradora, and Mr. Ca\u00f1edo's cousin; and Mr. Gustavo Mondragon, an employee in Integradora's tax department for an improperly claimed deduction in a 2014 tax return.13 Claimants argue that on information and belief it is the first time that such a criminal complaint is filed against directors and executives of a company for this type of deduction.14\n\n**7. (\"The First Investigation Against Quinn Emanuel\") \u2014** Claimants further refer to a media report about an ongoing investigation against Quinn Emanuel focusing on whether the firm used information obtained from another Quinn Emanuel client to prepare the Notice of Arbitration.15\n\n**8. (\"The Second Investigation Against Quinn Emanuel\") \u2014** Claimants argue that they have learned that the Bondholders were working with Mexican prosecutors in the PGJCDMX to obtain charges and obtain arrest warrants against Quinn Emanuel and its attorneys for *prevaricato,* which under Mexican law makes it a crime to represent conflicting interests in the same litigation.16\n\n- Seven tax audits against Integradora and its subsidiaries. Claimants argue that none of these audits have any merit or foundation in Mexican law.17\n\n- Pemex\u2019s continued refusal to pay Perforadora approximately USD 24 million that it owes since late 2017.18\n\n- Respondent\u2019s attempt to obtain, outside the proper course of this arbitration, the evidence underlying Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration.19\n\n- The arrest warrants issued by Mexico against two Claimants (Messrs. Ca\u00f1edo White and Williamson-Nasi) ant three of their witnesses (Messrs. Gil White, Del Val and Villegas).20\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a73.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a79 and \u00a711.\n\nAn overview of the chronology of events according to the Claimants can be found in Claimants\u2019 Appendix D and Appendix E.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a76.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a727.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a742.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a746.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a752.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a771.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a773.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a775.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a777-78.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a780.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a781-82.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a783-84.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a79 and 89-91.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a710 and 92-93.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a711 and 94-95.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a729-32.\n\n21.\n\nAs mentioned above, Claimants informed the Tribunal that after having filed their Application for interim measures, the Respondent had in the meantime requested and obtained Interpol Red Notices against two Claimants and three of their witnesses. Claimants further reported about the *amparo* proceeding in Mexico, in which the judge issued oral arrest warrants against the above-mentioned Claimants and witnesses.21\n\nSee *supra* \u00a77.\n\n*(b) This Tribunal has broad authority to issue interim measures*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nClaimants filed its request on the basis of Articles 26(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and 1134 of the NAFTA. Claimants argue that pursuant to these rules, the Tribunal enjoys wide powers to issue interim measures in support of the underlying arbitration. Claimants submit that the requested measures relate to the subject matter of the dispute as, absent such interim measures, Claimants would suffer irreparable injury to their rights.22 Claimants further seek to protect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, including their ability to pursue their NAFTA claim.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7100.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7103.\n\n*(c) Claimants\u2019 request meets the three criteria generally used by tribunals in UNCITRAL and NAFTA cases when assessing a request for interim measures*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nClaimants argue that despite the silence of Articles 26(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and 1134 of the NAFTA, tribunals in UNCITRAL and NAFTA cases generally consider three criteria when assessing a request for interim measures:24\n\n(i) whether the tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction;\n\n(ii) whether the interim measures are necessary to:\n\n- prevent acts of retaliation by the respondent State against the claimants;\n\n- protect the claimants from suffering greater injuries during the pendency of the arbitration *(i.e.,* necessary to preserve claimants\u2019 right to the *status quo*);\n\n- prevent that the claimants suffer an irreparable injury; and\n\n- protect the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, including the claimants\u2019 ability to pursue their claim; and\n\n(iii) whether there is an urgent need for the tribunal to issue the interim measures.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7105.\n\n24.\n\nClaimants submit that the three above-mentioned criteria constitute a mere guidance for the Tribunal as its power to order interim measures should be understood as discretionary in nature.25 Claimants however submit that, in any event, all of the three criteria are met in the present case to justify an order of interim measures.26\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7105.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7106.\n\n25.\n\nFirstly, Claimants submit that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction as Articles 1120, 1121 and 1139 of the NAFTA afford a basis on which the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction might be founded.27\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a7107-114.\n\n26.\n\nSecondly, Claimants argue that the requested measures are necessary to prevent further acts of retaliation and persecution by Respondent against Claimants.28 Claimants underscore that Investor-State tribunals have already granted interim measures staying criminal proceedings against a claimant.29\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a7115-116.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7115.\n\n27.\n\nClaimants further argue that the right to non-aggravation of the dispute is well established under international law and that Respondent\u2019s attacks are increasing Claimants\u2019 injuries during the pendency of the arbitration, thus altering the *status quo* and unnecessarily and improperly aggravating the dispute.30\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a7117-122.\n\n28.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argue that Investor-State tribunals have issued interim measures when, absent such measures, the claimant would have suffered an injury or harm that a monetary award could not fully and properly have compensated.31 Claimants argue that they precisely seek interim measures to prevent suffering injuries which no monetary award could properly and fully compensate.32 In their view, absent any interim measures, Respondent\u2019s acts of retaliation and persecution would likely cause the issuance of more arrest warrants against possibly other Claimants and against Integradora\u2019s and Perforadora\u2019s key employees.33\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7123.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7125.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7126.\n\n29.\n\nClaimants further argue that the requested measures are necessary to protect the integrity of the proceedings as, otherwise, Respondent would make it impossible or significantly more challenging for Claimants to pursue this NAFTA claim because key witnesses would either be imprisoned or under criminal prosecution; and key evidence could become unavailable to Claimants.34\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7128.\n\n30.\n\nClaimants further submit that Respondent has demonstrated that it will continue to injure Claimants absent an order from this Tribunal, as it failed to reply to Claimants\u2019 letters requesting that it \"cease and desist from its retaliatory and persecutory actions.\"35\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7129.\n\n31.\n\nThirdly, Claimants argue that, even if neither NAFTA nor the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules expressly require \"urgency\" for the Tribunal to order interim measures, in the present case the measures are urgently needed as Respondent will not cease its actions.36\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7133.\n\n*(d) Claimants\u2019 request meets other criteria occasionally used by tribunals in UNCITRAL and NAFTA cases when assessing a request for interim measures*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nClaimants submit that\u2014although not mandatory\u2014they also meet other criteria occasionally used by Investor-State tribunals when deciding whether to issue interim measures.37\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7134.\n\n33.\n\nClaimants submit that they established a *prima facie* case on the merits, as they are U.S. investors in Mexico who have alleged violations of NAFTA based on the conduct of the Mexican state.38\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7136.\n\n34.\n\nClaimants further submit that the interim measures will not disproportionally burden Respondent.39 Claimants specifically underscore that the requested measures are limited to the pendency of the proceedings and that Respondent would incur no loss of any kind.40\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7140.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7142.\n\n*(e) Claimants request is timely*\n---------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nClaimants submit that they acted quickly to notify Respondent of the matter. The Claimants have been sending letters to Respondent since July 2018, alerting it to each of the instances of retaliation and persecution described above, and requesting that Respondent cease attacks which are \"aggravating the dispute and threaten to irreparably injure [their] rights.\"41 In the absence of any response, Claimants argue that they have no alternative than to file this application to protect themselves from Respondent\u2019s \"abuse of its executive branch powers.\"42\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a788.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7145.\n\n36.\n\nClaimants accordingly request the Tribunal to order Respondent to:\n\n(i) refrain from arresting Claimants or the witnesses that will support their NAFTA claim during the pendency of this arbitral proceeding;\n\n(ii) confirm whether it is conducting any investigations against Quinn Emanuel or its attorneys and, if so, to immediately suspend any such investigations; and\n\n(iii) order any additional relief it deems appropriate to preserve Claimants\u2019 rights.43\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7146 (see also \u00a797). In fact, in these paragraphs, Claimants also included the request of another interim measure, namely \"that the Tribunal order M\u00e9xico to [...] cease subverting the procedures laid out in this NAFTA proceeding by using domestic proceedings to obtain evidence for use in this arbitration.\" This request was withdrawn during the Hearing on Interim Measures, on the basis of two events: (a) the evidence that Mexico was seeking-the tapes and recordings that, according to the Claimants, establish that Mexico retaliated against the Claimants and their investments for not agreeing to participate in requests for bribes that were being made by Mexican Governmental officials to Claimants-were produced in the context of the presentation of Claimants\u2019 Statement of Claim; so Mexico is already in possession of that evidence. And (b) there have not been additional efforts by Mexico to subvert the evidentiary requirements in this proceeding. Respondent took note of Claimants\u2019 withdrawal, regardless of Mexico\u2019s position on the recordings presented by Claimants.\n\n*B. Respondent*\n---------------\n\n*(a) Respondent submits that the mentioned investigations are in conformity with Mexican Law and are still pending at this stage*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nRespondent does not deny the existence of the various investigations mentioned by the Claimants; Respondent however does not admit the veracity of the facts reported in the Application for interim measures.44 Respondent further denies any participation in the ongoing disputes between the Bondholders, on the one side, and Integradora and Perforadora, on the other side.45\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a715.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a78.\n\n38.\n\nRespondent argues that the present arbitration proceedings do not provide any immunity to persons or entities participating in these proceedings.46 Respondent further submits that in Mexico, as in any other legal system committed to the rule of law, national authorities have the obligation to investigate acts (or omissions) that may constitute a crime, in accordance with the principles of presumption of innocence, access to justice, due process and legality.47\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a79.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a710.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent submits that all persons and entities under investigation are subject to proceedings in conformity with Mexican law, have access to ordinary means of defense available in such investigations and have benefited\u2014and continue to benefit\u2014from legal representation.48\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7\u00a716 and 149.\n\n*(b) Claimants fail to demonstrate the necessity, urgency and proportionality of the requested measure to order Respondent to refrain from arresting Claimants or the witnesses that will support their NAFTA claim during the pendency of this arbitral proceeding*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nRespondent argues that\u2014apart from the need to establish *prima facie* the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the existence of a right susceptible of protection\u2014the criteria for the Tribunal to take into account are:\n\n(i) the necessity of the requested measure;\n\n(ii) the urgency of the requested measure; and\n\n(iii) the proportionality of the requested measure.49\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7131.\n\n41.\n\nRespondent states that Claimants\u2019 submission fails to underscore the \"clear message\" of investor-State tribunals having been requested to order interim measures following criminal investigations. Respondent submits that in such cases a high standard is applied to justify interference with a State\u2019s sovereign police powers.50 Respondent argues that none of the three criteria are met in the present case.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7138.\n\n42.\n\nFirstly, Respondent underscores that the requested measures are not necessary to prevent an irreparable injury given that Claimants have not been prevented to pursue their claim in these proceedings during the past year. Respondent further highlights that none of Claimants live in Mexico and none is subject to arrest.51\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7\u00a7150-152.\n\n43.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that Claimants fail to concretely demonstrate the urgency of the measures.52\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7\u00a7153-157.\n\n44.\n\nThirdly, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 request is overly broad in that it fails to precisely identify the persons to protect.53 Respondent submits that the request for interim measures is used as a tool by Claimants in relation to ongoing procedures against the Bondholders and other parties.54\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7158.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7159.\n\n*(c) Claimants fail to demonstrate the necessity, urgency and proportionality of the requested measure to order Respondent to cease subverting the procedures laid out in this NAFTA proceeding by using domestic proceedings to obtain evidence for use in this arbitration*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have not submitted any information supporting their request on the necessity to prohibit the investigation of allegations of possible acts of corruption. Respondent argues that, in any case, Claimants have not reported any news on this matter since October 2018, which in itself demonstrates the absence of any urgency or necessity of protection.55\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7161. As previously mentioned *(supra* note 43), this request was withdrawn by Claimants during the Hearing on Interim Measures.\n\n*(d) Claimants fail to demonstrate the necessity, urgency and proportionality of the requested measure to order Respondent to confirm whether it is conducting any investigations against Quinn Emanuel or its attorneys and, if so, to immediately suspend any such investigations*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants request is entirely based on suppositions. The continued traveling and representation of Claimants by the lawyers in question demonstrates that the requested measures are neither necessary, urgent or proportional.56\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7\u00a7163-166.\n\n47.\n\nRespondent accordingly requests the Tribunal to dismiss the request for interim measures in its entirety.57\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7167.\n\n**III. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n*A. Introduction*\n-----------------\n\n48.\n\nAt the outset, the present case appears to be particularly complex from a variety of viewpoints. One of the obvious signs of such complexity stems from the high level of litigation between the Parties, both within and\u2014especially\u2014outside the proceedings before the Tribunal. Apart from these proceedings, the number and diversity of procedures involving the Parties are, indeed, quite significant. It must be highlighted that in several of them, in addition, intervene third parties closely linked to the underlying transactions of this arbitration, *i.e.* the Bondholders. Furthermore, such Parties' activism explains the time elapsed between the submission of Claimants' Application and the present Procedural Order.\n\n49.\n\nWhen considering a request such as the one that forms the subject of this Procedural Order, it is obvious that the Tribunal must concentrate on the legal aspects relevant to the task in front of it, in application of the rules governing the proceedings. This does not mean that no attention should be paid to the intense activity carried out by the Parties before all types of public authorities. Rather, it implies that the Tribunal must avoid entering into the substantial analysis of the various administrative, judicial and police procedures in progress, over which it most certainly lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly\u2014as a matter of principle and for present purposes\u2014it is not for the Tribunal to study or decide about the origin, justification or outcome of the ongoing or past procedures involving the Parties or other actors related to this case.\n\n50.\n\nWhat does however clearly fall within the scope of the mandate of the Tribunal is the paramount need to protect the integrity of the arbitration process and the equally important need to avoid any aggravation of the dispute. Consequently, were the Tribunal to conclude that, as a result of Respondent's actions\u2014such as those mentioned in the preceding paragraphs\u2014the integrity of the proceeding could be affected or the dispute could be aggravated, it would have to avoid it using all available measures.\n\n51.\n\nNevertheless, in order to do so, and given the seriousness of Claimants' allegations with respect to Respondent's alleged conduct, the required burden of proof shall be particularly high.58\n\nSee, in general, *Corfu Channel (UK v. Albania),* ICJ Reports 1949.\n\n52.\n\nClaimants specifically request the Tribunal to order Respondent to:\n\n(i) refrain from arresting Claimants or the witnesses that will support their NAFTA claim during the pendency of this arbitral proceeding;59 and\n\n(ii) confirm whether it is conducting any investigations against Quinn Emanuel or its attorneys and, if so, to immediately suspend any such investigations.60\n\nSee *supra* \u00a736(i).\n\nSee *supra* \u00a736(ii).\n\n53.\n\nConcerning the generic request of \"order any additional relief it deems appropriate to preserve Claimants\u2019 rights,\"61 Claimants clarified during the Hearing on Interim Measures that it is not a separate request but a way to tell the Tribunal that when it exercises its discretion in awarding any measure it might order any variation of them.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a736(iii).\n\n54.\n\nIn order to decide whether to grant Claimants\u2019 request, the Tribunal must first establish which powers are available within the framework of the applicable rules and, where appropriate, apply for each of the specific requested measures the different criteria which are nowadays routinely invoked by international courts and tribunals when deciding whether or not to adopt such measures. Before this, however, it appears necessary to consider the precise content of each of the requested measures.\n\n*B. The specific requested measures*\n------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe first requested measure62 refers to the exercise of powers of the State with respect to the investigation and prosecution of possible criminal offenses. Specifically, Claimants request that the Tribunal order Respondent to refrain from exercising said competence with respect to the persons acting as Claimants and/or witnesses in the present case. Although a request of these characteristics is not so unusual in arbitration between investors and States,63 the granting of such measures can only take place in very particular circumstances.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a736(i).\n\nSee in particular the recent empirical study conducted by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law with White & Case LLP: *2019 Empirical study: Provisional measures in investor-state arbitration.* The study found that the stay of criminal investigations or proceedings is the fourth most requested type of interim measure. https://www.biicl.org/publications/2019-empirical-study-provisional-measures-in-investorstate-arbitration\n\n56.\n\nIn order to decide on the requested measures, it must be stressed that the Tribunal is not bound by any previous decisions reached by other international courts and tribunals on the granting of interim measures. The Tribunal is however mindful of the need to take into account previous decisions, where relevant, and in particular as the Parties have extensively referred to a series of cases to argue whether or not the requested measures should be granted. Nevertheless, the Tribunal underscores that\u2014this being particularly true for requests for interim measures\u2014it needs to be mindful of the factual differences which exist between the different cases. On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that investorState tribunals, regardless of the underlying applicable legal framework, as a matter of principle, have consistently recognized the undisputed sovereign right of a State to pursue a criminal investigation within its territory. Investor-State tribunals have unmistakably indicated that this right should in no circumstance lightly be interfered. The Tribunal has no difficulty in agreeing on this point. This does not mean that the Tribunal lacks any power to appreciate the regularity of the ongoing procedures and investigations, as will be further discussed in this Procedural Order.64\n\nFor an overview of the case law, see: Cameron Miles, *Provisional measures before International Courts and Tribunals,* Cambridge University Press, 2017, spec. p. 377-382. See for instance *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures dated November 19, 2007, at \u00a762: \"[T]he Tribunal notes that it has great respect for the Ecuadorian Judiciary and that it acknowledges Ecuador\u2019s sovereign right to prosecute and punish crimes of all kinds perpetrated in its territory.\"; *Lao Holdings N.V. v.

In particular, they do not exempt suspected criminals from investigation or prosecution by virtue of their being investors.\"; *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures dated January 21, 2015 at \u00a7145: \"[T]he Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Caratube International Oil Co. LLP v. Kazakhstan* that the State\u2019s investigative powers, including in criminal matters, are \u2018a most obvious and undisputed part of [its] sovereign right... to implement and enforce its national law on its territory\u2019 and \u2018a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID Tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state\u2019.\", citing *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. The Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision Regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated July 31, 2009, at \u00a7\u00a7134-137; *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures dated March 3, 2016 at \u00a73.16: \"It is trite to say that criminal law and procedure are a most obvious and undisputed part of a State\u2019s sovereignty.\"; *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Provisional Measures dated April 8, 2016, at \u00a7185: \"The Tribunal is also aware of the decisions of other tribunals which have expressed the view that provisional measures are an extraordinary remedy and that tribunals should exercise particular caution when asked to restrain a sovereign State\u2019s exercise of its right to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to conduct within its territory. However, such powers must be exercised in good faith, respecting a claimant\u2019s rights to have its claims fairly considered and decided by an arbitral tribunal.\"\n\n57.\n\nIndeed, in addition to the common criteria used to decide whether or not to issue interim measures,65 the fact that the object of the requested measure is to order the State to refrain from exercising its prerogatives introduces an additional element to be considered by the Tribunal. Specifically, the Tribunal must analyze\u2014with all the elements available to it\u2014 whether the State is exceeding its powers and, should it find this point to be verified, the extent to which such conduct has had a detrimental impact on the arbitration procedure.\n\nSee *infra* \u00a762.\n\n58.\n\nThe second requested measure66 differs from the previous one, as it does not affect the Parties but the legal counsel of Claimants. In this sense, should Claimants\u2019 statements be confirmed, the Tribunal would face a potential serious issue that could lead to a violation of Claimants\u2019 fundamental right of access to justice.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a736(ii).\n\n59.\n\nNonetheless, it should be borne in mind that what has been requested regarding this issue is, on the one hand, the confirmation about the existence of some ongoing investigation, and, on the other hand, the immediate suspension of such investigation. This means that, as of now, the Tribunal can only consider the first of these issues *(i.e.* to request confirmation of the existence of such investigations), leaving the second *(i.e.* to order the suspension of such investigations) for a potential later stage.\n\n*C. The appropriateness of the requested measures*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nHaving thus presented the measures requested by Claimants, it becomes necessary:\n\n- firstly, to establish the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s powers under the applicable legal framework to adopt measures such as those described and,\n\n- secondly, to apply to each of those measures the criteria that allows to conclude if it is indeed appropriate to grant them.67\n\nSee *infra* \u00a762.\n\n61.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Tribunal is empowered to order interim measures under the applicable legal framework to this arbitration proceeding. Indeed, the first sentence of Article 1134 of the NAFTA states that *\"[a] Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"* For its part, Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules indicates that \"*[a]t the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute* [...].\"\n\n62.\n\nThe effective exercise of the power of this Tribunal to grant each of the requested measures depends, in essence, on the fulfillment of three conditions:\n\n(i) the danger of a risk if the requested measures are not adopted *[periculum in mora]* also sometimes mentioned as the risk of irreparable harm;\n\n(ii) the likelihood of success on the merits *[fumus boni iuris];* and\n\n(iii) the need, efficiency and proportionality of the measure.\n\n63.\n\nAlthough the criteria indicated are partially different from those described, respectively, by Claimants68 and Respondent,69 there is no doubt that they are generally admitted when it comes to determining the source of a request for provisional measures.70 Obviously, given the generality of these formulated criteria, they must be adapted to the specific characteristics of the requested measures in the context of this case, as will be done hereafter.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7105. See *supra* \u00a723.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7131. See *supra* \u00a740.\n\nSee, among many other references, Resolution on \"Provisional measures,\" IDI, Hyderabad Session (2017). In particular, see \u00a72: \"Provisional measures are available if the applicant for such measures can show that: (a) there is a *prima facie* case on the merits; (b) there is a real risk that irreparable injury will be caused to the rights in dispute before final judgment; (c) the risk of injury to the applicant outweighs the risk of injury to the respondent; and (d) the measures are proportionate to the risks\" (http://www.idi-iil.org/app/uploads/2017/08/3-RES-FINAL-EN-COR.pdf).\n\n64.\n\nRegarding measure referred in \u00a752(i), even if it were accepted that the issuance of the \"apprehension\" orders constitutes in itself an urgent situation-what Claimants posit rather than demonstrate-, it cannot be considered proven\u2014at least so far\u2014that the actions of the Mexican authorities are not based on regular procedures established in their criminal law, in particular because such actions has been taken precisely in the application of such procedures upon the action of private parties *(i.e.* the Bondholders). Lacking evidence that the Mexican judicial authorities are acting improperly, the granting of the requested measure would be inappropriate. Indeed, such granting would appear disproportionate and its efficiency could also be doubted.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal has not found any evidence in the documents presented or in the statements of the Parties during the Hearing on Interim Measures that allows inferring that these actions exceed the regular framework of State powers. For example, from the reading of the 167 pages of the transcript of the hearing held before a local Mexico City judge on July 16, 2019, it appears that all arrest warrants issued respond to the complaints made by the Bondholders; and as stated by Respondent, the Mexican authorities before which these complaints have been filed cannot do anything else than activate the judicial mechanisms to investigate such complaints.\n\n66.\n\nAccordingly, in the present context, although the Tribunal is ready to accept that a possible detention of a Claimant and/or witness could affect and ultimately endanger Claimants\u2019 rights, at this stage such detention has not taken place, not being sufficient in the eyes of the Tribunal, the damage alleged by Claimants created by the possibility that such detention would occur. The only person said to have been arrested (Mr. Del Val) is apparently free and, according to the comments offered by the Parties, said person would in principle be willing to collaborate with the Mexican authorities.71\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00a7151. During the Hearing on Interim Measures, Claimants argued that the fact that Mr. Del Val was originally ready to act as an essential witness called by Claimants and has now changed his position would demonstrate the perverse effects of Mexico\u2019s actions. However, so far there is no evidence of Mr. Del Val\u2019s original willingness to testify in favor of Claimants.\n\n67.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal has not been presented with any evidence that the directors of Oro Negro\u2014subject to the various procedures listed in the Application\u2014as well as the companies, have not been able to exercise their rights in the Mexican judicial system. To the contrary, evidence suggests they have been able to defend their rights.72\n\nClaimants themselves have recognized this. See Claimants\u2019 Application for Interim Measures, \u00a7\u00a759, 67, 75.\n\n68.\n\nIn addition, the request for assistance from Interpol and the request for the so-called Red Notices mentioned at a late stage by Claimants73 do not affect the previous considerations as they are a foreseeable consequence in the wake of criminal proceedings in respect of persons who are not within reach of the jurisdiction of the Mexican authorities.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a77.\n\n69.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that the measure requested in \u00a752(i) cannot be granted, at the present time, in the manner proposed by Claimants. However, the Tribunal, based on the risk that the activity within the powers of the State could unjustifiably prejudice the integrity of this arbitration proceeding, will consider the issuance of an order addressed to Respondent requesting its collaboration for the arbitration to take place in an effective way in order to ensure the adoption of a fair decision. In this sense, Respondent shall abstain from adopting any unjustified measure that may aggravate the dispute. A measure like this can be framed under Claimants\u2019 generic request (\"any additional relief\").74\n\nSee *supra* \u00a753.\n\n70.\n\nThe measure requested in \u00a752(ii) is, as noted above, different from the previous one. The potential curtailment of the exercise of the fundamental right of access to justice\u2014by impeding the activity of Claimants\u2019 legal counsel\u2014would be, if proven, extremely serious.\n\n71.\n\nThe evidence produced does not, at the present stage, demonstrate that Quinn Emanuel or its lawyers are currently subject to a criminal investigation in Mexico. The only evidence invoked by Claimants are media reports mentioning in potential terms that possibility, and their suspicion that the Bondholders would be working with members of the PGJCDMX to coordinate the investigation and prosecution for certain crimes against Quinn Emanuel.\n\n72.\n\nAs already stated,75 the requested measure referred to in \u00a752(ii) is composed of two successive steps. At first, Respondent should be ordered to confirm whether such investigations is taking place and, it should be added, under which circumstances these are being carried out. The suspension could, in a second step, only be ordered if such investigations are confirmed to exist.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a758.\n\n73.\n\nRegarding the first step, the Tribunal finds that the measure in question must be considered in the form of a request for information, having due regard to the sovereign prerogatives of the Mexican State, based on the potential gravity of the prosecution of lawyers and the law firm that represents Claimants, in particular if this investigation is related to the dispute in front of the Tribunal. In effect, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to grant the measure referred to, with said limitation.\n\n74.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Interim Measures, Respondent indicated that it asked two concrete judicial authorities (the *Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica* and the PGJCDMX) for the existence of the above-mentioned investigations. According to Respondent, the answer was in the negative. Considering that there is no evidence of such questions and answers, the Tribunal considers necessary to explicitly formulate the same question by means of this Procedural Order in order to receive a concrete and formal answer thereto.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal can and will only decide on the appropriate measures to be taken with respect to the second step once the response or reaction of the Mexican authorities has been received and properly assessed.\n\n76.\n\nAs a whole, this Decision is taken on the basis of the elements presented by the Parties so far. Consequently, nothing prevents the Tribunal from modifying it, if additional and relevant pieces of evidence are brought to its attention at a later stage. The Tribunal also emphasizes that the analysis carried out to adopt this decision does not in any way lead to a prejudgment which could later prevent this Tribunal from ruling on the claims before it.\n\n**IV.

The Tribunal: (i) ordered the Respondent to use its best efforts to ensure that the arbitration was conducted effectively, and to refrain from taking any unjustified measures that could aggravate the dispute; (ii) requested the Respondent \u2013 and specifically the Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica (\"FGR\") and the Fiscal\u00eda General de Justicia de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (\"FGJCDMX\") \u2013 to provide specific information on the existence of any investigation against Quinn Emanuel and/or the attorneys acting in this arbitration.\n* 47. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13 January 2020, pursuant to the request in Procedural Order No. 6, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Direcci\u00f3n General de Consultor\u00eda Jur\u00eddica de Comercio Internacional (\"CJCI\") had requested the FGR and the PGJCDMX to provide specific information to corroborate again whether there were any investigation files or court orders against any member of Quinn Emanuel.1 Respondent informed the Tribunal that as at the date of issuance of the communications from the FGR and the PGJCDMX, there were no investigation files or injunctions initiated against Quinn Emanuel or any of its members in this arbitration.\n* 48. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 16 January 2020 the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's communication dated 13 January 2020 and informed that no further decision was to be made by the Tribunal for the time being.\n* 49. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 12 February 2020, Claimants sent a letter to the Tribunal regarding Respondent's communication of 13 January 2020.

However, the Parties were still in discussions about the number of weeks of such extension, and the impact it might have on the procedural calendar.\n* 54. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 17 April 2020, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had failed to reach an agreement on the extension requested by Respondent and therefore requested the Tribunal's intervention on this issue.\n* 55. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon the Tribunal's instructions, on 19 April 2020, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties of the Tribunal's decision to extend the deadline for the submission of the Statement of Defence by three weeks from 20 April 2020, i.e., until 11 May 2020.

Claimants argued that disclosure of the information obtained in the aforementioned proceeding to any entity, person or representative would require the prior execution of two confidentiality agreements (the \"Protective Orders\"). In order to be able to use these materials in the present arbitration, Claimants requested that the Tribunal and Respondent sign the confidentiality agreements.\n* 76. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 4 and 10 March 2021, the Respondent objected to the signing of the declarations set out in the Protective Orders.

The Tribunal rejected Respondent's request that Mr. Trevi\u00f1o's two witness statements remain on the record.\n* 150. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits was held from 24-30 April 2022 in Washington, D.C.

It also informed them that the Parties should submit their cost statements within 30 days of the submission of the Post-Hearing Briefs, i.e. on 10 October 2022.\n* 155. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties filed their simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs on 9 September 2022.\n* 156. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 6 October 2022, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal on behalf of both Parties, requesting an extension of the deadline to file their cost submissions until 11 November 2022. The Respondent confirmed its agreement with the Claimants' communication on 7 October 2022.\n* 157. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 9 October 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had approved the requested extension.\n* 158. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties submitted their cost statements on 11 November 2022.\n* 159. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 23 November 2022, the Claimants sent a letter to the Tribunal, requesting leave to introduce INTERPOL's decision on Mexico's Second Red Notice Application (the \"Second INTERPOL Decision\") into the record of the arbitration pursuant to \u00a7 18.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n* 160. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 28 November 2022, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants' request by 2 December 2022.\n* 161. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 29 November 2022, the Respondent asked the Tribunal for an extension of the deadline to submit its response to the Claimants' request until 6 December 2022. The extension was authorized by the Tribunal on 2 December 2022.\n* 162. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 6 December 2022, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimants' request, arguing inter alia that the Claimants had failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances justifying adding the Second INTERPOL Decision on the record.\n* 163. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 19 December 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 30, on the Claimants' request to submit additional evidence into the record.\n* 164. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 7 September 2023, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal requesting leave to add into the record a decision issued by the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa on 2 August 2023 in Juicio 31949/21 (the \"Decision of Juicio 31949/21\"), alleging that there were exceptional circumstances and good cause justifying the inclusion of the Decision into the record in accordance with Section 18.3 of Procedural Resolution No. 1.\n* 165. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 11 September, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent's request before 15 September 2023.\n* 166. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 15 September 2023, the Claimants sent a letter to the Tribunal, objecting to the Respondent's request. In their submission, the Claimants argued that there were no exceptional circumstance or good cause that justified adding the Decision to the record, and that its inclusion would disrupt the equality of arms and prejudice the Claimants' rights to due process.\n* 167. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 3 October 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 31, on the Respondent's request to submit additional evidence into the record.\n* 168. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 10 October 2023, the Respondent saved the Decision of Juicio 31949/21 on the case's Box folder.\n* 169. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The procedure was closed on 16 August 2024.\n\n### III. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n\n### 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants' positions\n\n* ### A) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction\n\n* 170. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The claims have been brought under Article 1116(1) and 1117(1) of the NAFTA.\n* 171. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that Alicia Grace, Carolyn Grace Baring, Diana Grace Beard, Frederick Grace, Frederick Warren, Gary Olson, Genevieve Irwin, Gerald Parsky, John Irwin III, Nicholas Grace, Oliver Grace, Robert Witt, and Virginia Grace are all U.S. nationals.4\n* 172. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Claimants observe that Ampex Trust, Apple Oaks, Brentwood, Cambria, Floradale, Warren IRA, Irwin Trust, Parsky IRA, ON5, Rainbow, Witt IRA, and Vista Pros are enterprises constituted or organized under the laws of one of the states within the United States.5\n* 173. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants further stress that Mr. Williamson-Nasi is a dual national, holding US and Colombian citizenship. Still, Claimants consider this fact immaterial, especially given that the NAFTA contains no provision prohibiting dual nationals from being afforded the protection of the Treaty.6\n* 174. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A similar reasoning is put forward with regards to Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White, who holds Mexican citizenship and is a US permanent resident. According to Claimants, permanent residents would be covered by the NAFTA's protections as per its Article 201.7\n* 175. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Article 1120 of the NAFTA provides a deliberate choice between the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and UNCITRAL Rules, Claimants are of the view that the choice to proceed with this case under UNCITRAL Rules means that any potential restriction on dual nationality arising out of the ICSID regime would not be applicable.8\n* 176. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to Axis Services, Axis Holding, Clue and F.305952, Claimants consider that these entities can be covered by Article 1117. Notably, Claimants highlight that Article 1117 allows an investor to bring a claim on behalf of a company that the investor owns or controls, further noting that all of the entities above are owned or controlled by US nationals or US permanent residents \u2013 namely Messrs. Williamson and Ca\u00f1edo.9\n* 177. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants define their investment as the direct or indirect ownership of 43.2% of the shares of Integradora Oro Negro, which would be a protected investment pursuant to Article 1139 of the NAFTA.10 In this regard, Claimants would be able to bring claims directly on their behalf or indirectly on behalf of other companies holding Integradora's shares.11\n* 178. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is Claimants' argument that loss of shareholder value is sufficient to give rise to a claim under Article 1116.12 In particular, Claimants consider that it would have made little sense for the NAFTA Parties to afford the protection to shares in a local enterprise, and to have granted an investor that has made a protected investment the ability to claim for damages, if that investor was prohibited from making claims to recover for the so-called \"reflective loss.\"13\n* 179. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that they have met all temporal requirements established by Articles 1116, 1117 and 1120.14\n* 180. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Claimants affirm that they have duly observed the conditions set out in Articles 1118 and 1119.15\n* 181. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regards to the waiver requirement established in Article 1121, Claimants submitted their consent to arbitration and allegedly waived their right to initiate or continue any proceeding seeking damages against the Respondent based on the same measures underlying that investor's claim in the arbitration.16\n* 182. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, Claimants rejects Mexico's objection as to the relation between Article 1121 and ongoing US proceedings. Claimants note that Mexico is not a party in any of these US proceedings and no specific acts of Mexico are at issue in these lawsuits.17\n\n* ### B) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attribution\n\n* 183. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that PEMEX, under sworn statement before US courts, has represented that it acts on behalf of the Mexican people and that it is fully owned by the Mexican government, consisting essentially of an organ of the Mexican State.18\n* 184. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From Claimants perspective, PEMEX's actions are attributable to Mexico under rules arising both from the NAFTA and from the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\"). Notably, Article 1503 of the NAFTA and Articles 4, 5 and 7 of the ILC Articles would provide for the attribution of PEMEX's actions to Mexico.19\n* 185. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is 'Claimants' understanding that, even if Chapter 15 has created a lex specialis as to the matter of attribution, this does not mean that the ILC Articles would not be applicable. In this regard, Claimants consider that said instrument could still be applied on a subsidiary and residual basis.20\n* 186. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that PEMEX is a State Enterprise regulated by Articles 1505 and 201(1) of the NAFTA, which would have to act consistently with Mexico's obligations under the NAFTA.21\n* 187. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Claimants affirm that PEMEX always acted under delegated authority, as defined by Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA and by NAFTA Note 45.22 It is Claimants' contention that PEMEX operates under the PEMEX Law, which purpose would be inter alia to \"maximize the State's oil revenue and contribute, in this way, to the nation's development.\"23\n* 188. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drawing from case law, Claimants posit that the exercise of PEMEX's delegated governmental authority is materialized in the fact that (i) PEMEX is subject to the directions of Mexico's Minister of Energy, (ii) PEMEX has ample powers to fulfil its purpose, which includes entering into contracts, (iii) the 1938 Decree that created PEMEX declared it a public institution controlled by the State, (iv) PEMEX's Board of Directors, while being vested with ultimate decision-making authority with respect to PEMEX's operations, is a body entirely controlled by government appointees.24\n* 189. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that the obligation set forth in Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA is one of result and not of conduct, that is, a \"positive obligation.\"25 Consequently, Claimants contend that Mexico failed to meet its duty to ensure that PEMEX acted in a manner consistent with NAFTA's Chapter 11 obligations.26 In particular, Claimants consider that, by tolerating rampant corruption within PEMEX and allowing the deployment of retaliatory measures against Oro Negro, Mexico did not ensure regulatory control and supervision of PEMEX.27\n* 190. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants consider that its attribution analysis under Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA is consistent with the attribution analysis as provided in Articles 4, 5 and 7 of the ILC Articles.28\n* 191. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, Claimants argue that \"[e]ven if Pemex's conduct in imposing drastic amendments to the contracts and eventually terminating the business relationship with Claimants could be considered a seemingly commercial act, the context of the relevant conduct leads to the conclusion that this 'seemingly commercial act' serves a governmental purpose.\"29\n* 192. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, Claimants go even further by stating that \"[t]he Mexican government expected bribes from Oro Negro.\"30\n\n* ### C) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expropriation\n\n* 193. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants affirm that NAFTA's Article 1110 covers both direct and indirect expropriation, echoing case law on the matter.31 In this regard, Claimants contend that the test for indirect expropriation is to assess whether the interference with property rights was sufficiently restrictive as to be tantamount to the taking of property from the owner or has substantially deprived the investor of the benefits of their investments.\n* 194. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that indirect expropriation may take place over a period of time in an incremental way, being characterized by the fact that the measures in isolation do not amount to a breach of Treaty but when taken as a whole have the cumulative effect of expropriating the investors of their investment.32\n* 195. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants highlight that expropriation under NAFTA does not require any subjective motive, being assessed only on the basis of the ultimate and actual effects of the measures.33 It is Claimants' view that the scope of NAFTA's Article 1110 encompasses both physical assets, interests arising from contractual relationships and contractual rights per se.34\n* 196. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants state that the investment made in Oro Negro \"was based on its [Oro Negro] ability to contract with Pemex\u2014its only customer and M\u00e9xico's largest company\u2014,\"35 and that the investors were deprived of the value and benefits of their investment due to Mexico's acts and omissions.36\n* 197. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, Claimants claim that Mexico undertook a number of actions and omissions that considered together substantially deprived the Claimants of the use and enjoyment of their investment, and thus constituted an expropriation. For the Claimants, the expropriation of their investment was unlawful given that Mexico (a) did not provide compensation, (b) did not observe due process or NAFTA's Article 1105(1), (c) was discriminatory, and (d) did not have any public purpose.37\n* 198. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants affirm they have demonstrated that their investment consisted inter alia of Oro Negro shares, so the value of Claimants' investment was equivalent to the value of those shares, which is in turn based on the value of Oro Negro, its contracts, its rigs, and its reputation for future business. From Claimants' perspective, given that Oro Negro no longer has the Oro Negro Contracts or the Rigs, and its reputation would have been ruined by Mexico, Claimants consider having been substantially deprived of the use and enjoyment of their investment.38\n* 199. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From Claimants perspective, Mexico would have carried out a politically motivated campaign to destroy Oro Negro due to the latter's refusal to \"pay-to-play.\" In essence, Claimants consider that this campaign was conducted through its State-owned entity, judiciary, police, administrative officers, and the media. According to Claimants, Mexico did so, in part, to benefit certain bondholders \u2013 concretely, the creditors of the bonds first issued by the company Oro Negro Drilling on 24 January 2014 (the \"Bondholders\")\u2013 and a company who did pay bribes, Seamex, and did all this in very close coordination with the Ad- Hoc Group.39\n* 200. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that Mexico did not pay any compensation regarding the purported expropriation, which ought to be paid on the basis of the investment's fair market value.40\n* 201. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants also affirm that \"Pemex's desire to retaliate against Oro Negro for its refusal to pay bribes, and because of its desire to favour Seamex or domestic companies, is not a legitimate public purpose.\"41\n* 202. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants are of the view that Mexico did not afford procedural or substantive due process to the investors while conducting its alleged campaign against Oro Negro.42 In addition, the interference with the investors' investment would have been discriminatory, for PEMEX \"singled out\" Oro Negro and treated its competitors more favourably.43\n\n* ### D) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fair and equitable treatment\n\n* 203. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants acknowledge that Fair and Equitable Treatment (\"FET\") under the NAFTA is to be applied in light of the international law minimum standard of treatment (\"MST\"), as provided for in a 2001 note issued by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission (\"FTC\").44 Yet Claimants understand that the international law minimum standard is not static, having evolved over time to encompass broader protections than in the past.45\n* 204. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants put forward some specific factors elements that would be encompassed by the NAFTA FET clause, such as the following ones: safeguarding investors' legitimate expectations; refraining from unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory measures; providing transparency and due process; refraining from harassment, coercion and abusive treatment; and acting in good faith.46\n* 205. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants characterize the safeguard of investors' legitimate expectations as \"[a] cornerstone of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\"47 Further, Claimants affirm that \"[t]he obligation to safeguard legitimate expectations can extend to respecting contractual obligations to which the State has bound itself, particularly when the state entity is acting in a sovereign capacity.\"48\n* 206. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants do recognize that many arbitral tribunals have ruled that a breach of contract will only amount to a breach of a FET protection if said contractual breach arises from the exercise of sovereign power. Still, Claimants argue that the effects of a contractual breach are to take precedence in the analysis of an FET violation. On these grounds, Claimants affirm that \"when the State's action results in a repudiation of the contract, frustration of its economic purpose, or substantial deprivation of value, the State has committed an FET violation.\"49\n* 207. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, Claimants underscore that Mexico's conduct in relation to the Oro Negro Contracts does not consist of \"mere contractual breach,\" rather being a \"flagrant disregard of Claimants' legitimate expectations, including one in which Claimants could do business transparently with Pemex free from government-led and sponsored corruption, discrimination and reprisals for failing to accede to the government's bribe requests through known government intermediaries.\"50\n* 208. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In connection with legitimate expectations, Claimants also argue that any State conduct that is arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory is per se a FET breach.51 Similarly, Claimants argue that any conduct failing to meet standards of due process and transparency would amount to a FET violation, as NAFTA protects these principles in a number of its provisions \u2013 namely Articles 1110 and 1115.52\n* 209. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Claimants consider that disregard for due process and transparency may also be tantamount to a denial of justice.53\n* 210. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another element highlighted by Claimants in relation to the NAFTA FET clause relates to a prohibition against harassment, coercion, and abusive treatment. Indeed, Claimants affirm that the State cannot use its prerogatives to harass, coerce or abuse an investor.54\n* 211. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Claimants consider that a finding of mala fide is not a requirement for the characterization of a FET violation, they do affirm that any bad faith conduct against an investor would be a \"paradigmatic violation of the standard.\"55\n* 212. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that the United Nations Convention Against Corruption has 186 State Parties out of 195 countries in the world \u2013 including Mexico.56 Similarly, Claimants stress that Mexico criminalizes corruption domestically,57 while being also a party to the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials.58\n* 213. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, it is Claimants' understanding that Mexico is bound by a prohibition against corruption, an obligation that has its source in both domestic and international law. Accordingly, the disregard for such prohibition amounts to a FET violation, especially considering Claimants' legitimate expectations.59\n* 214. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants further reject Mexico's contentions that Oro Negro made risky business decisions. For Claimants, the economic situation in Mexico at that point in time or the drop in global oil prices during the relevant timeframe cannot justify Mexico's conduct. In this regard, Claimants contend that \"these macroeconomic issues [cannot] explain or excuse Mexico's collusion with the Ad-Hoc Group to destroy Oro Negro's business with the intention to have that business handed over to the Bondholders, including through Seamex's lease-back of the Rigs to Pemex.\"60\n* 215. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants contend that the analysis of a FET violation is fact-dependent and must take into account the cumulative effects of the conduct of the State.61\n* 216. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From Claimants' perspective, Mexico breached its FET obligation in the following ways: (a) retaliating against Oro Negro for refusing to pay bribes by imposing onerous contract terms; (b) disregarding its commitments made in relation to the Oro Negro Contracts, such as returning the contracts to the original daily rates upon expiration of the amendments and not paying the liquidated damages under the Oro Negro Contracts when such contracts were terminated; (c) colluding with the Bondholders to drive Integradora out of business and attempting to award the Oro Negro Contracts to the Bondholders; (d) discriminating against Integradora in comparison to Seamex, a competitor in like circumstances, with regard to contractual rates and termination provisions, likely in exchange for bribes as well as in comparison to ODH, a competitor in like circumstances, which obtained liquidated damages for the termination of its contract; (e) further retaliating against Claimants and their counsel for filing this NAFTA claim by pursuing numerous meritless criminal and civil investigations in Mexico and allowing these baseless investigations to continue, causing Claimants to fear for their safety; and (f) violating Oro Negro's due process rights through irregular judicial proceedings marked by indicia of corruption.62\n\n* ### E) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Full protection and security\n\n* 217. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that the Full Protection and Security (\"FPS\") standard encompasses the duty to enforce domestic law so as to deter third parties from colluding to destroy investors' investment.63 In this regard, it is Claimants' view that the FPS standard complements FET to the extent that it affords protection against acts of third parties.64\n* 218. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that FPS cannot be reduced to the physical protection of investors and investments, advocating for a broader approach to the standard. Within this framework, legal protection would also be covered by the FPS clause.65\n* 219. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The protection to be afforded under the FPS clause, Claimants argue, should not be restricted to actions of private parties, but to conduct involving the State itself. 66\n* 220. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, Claimants acknowledge that allegations related to States' encouragement of adverse actions against an investor require a certain level of direct evidence. In light of these considerations, Claimants affirm that the alleged collusion between Mexico and the Bondholders amounted to a FPS breach, for Mexico failed to provide both physical and legal protection to the investors' investments.67\n* 221. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants further note that, when FET and FPS protections are linked in the same provision, it is not necessary to draw a sharp delimitation of their scope.68\n* 222. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, Claimants argue that the FPS breach emerged out of the following situations: (a) through Mexico's launch of criminal investigations that would culminate with the seizure of all of Perforadora's cash and rigs; (b) through Mexico's failure to protect the rigs from third parties who intruded on them; (c) in the physical takeover of the rigs, which involved an officer from the Agencia de Investigaci\u00f3n Criminal flying on a helicopter and forcing to land on a rig; (d) in Pemex's and the Ad Hoc Group's attempt to take the rigs from Oro Negro and lease them back to Pemex through a competitor; (e) through Mexico's failure to stop the reputational attacks against the Claimants launched by one of the largest media conglomerates in Mexico (TV Azteca); (f) through Mexico's launch of meritless tax audits against Integradora and its subsidiaries; and (g) through Pemex's refusal to pay Perforadora the past due daily rates as provided in the Oro Negro Contracts.69\n\n* ### F) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damages\n\n* 223. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants seek full reparation for the losses allegedly suffered in the form of monetary compensation.70 The quantification of damages claimed is calculated on the basis of the fair market value of Claimants' investment, in addition to interest and tax.71\n* 224. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is Claimants' position that, under international law, they are entitled to choose the damages valuation date. From Claimants' perspective, this is a logical consequence of the standard of compensation, which presides over the quantification of damages.72\n* 225. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants note that NAFTA does not provide any standard for the valuation of compensation in case of unlawful expropriation, FET and FPS breaches \u2013 the Treaty only provide standards for compensation in case of lawful expropriations.73 Hence, Claimants argue that customary international law standards on the matter should apply.74\n* 226. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Referring to case law and to Article 34 of the ILC Articles, Claimants observe that their investment has been destroyed, the physical assets (the rigs) were taken, and their investment's reputation was ruined.75 For these reasons, it is Claimants' view that only monetary compensation can cure the wrongs committed by Mexico.\n* 227. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Claimants believe that compensation under customary international law may exceed what is provided under the NAFTA standard of compensation for lawful expropriations, Claimants are of the view that fair market value is also the starting point to quantify full compensation under customary international law.76\n* 228. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants propose the method of discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") as the proper method to assess their investments' fair market value. This calculation could be performed both on the basis of the date of the expropriation or the date of the award \u2013 a choice to be guided by the maximization of reparation.77\n* 229. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the instant case, Claimants state that \"the valuation date for the NAFTA breaches must take into account the full measure of the harm done to Claimants' investment to date.\"78\n* 230. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Referring to Article 38 of the ILC Articles, Claimants also consider that the principle of full reparation requires granting post-award interest annually compounded and calculated at a commercially reasonable rate until the actual date of payment.79\n* 231. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Claimants observe that the award should be net of tax, for Claimants ought to be placed in the financial position in which they would have been had Mexico not breached its obligations under the Treaty.80\n\n### 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent's positions\n\n* ### A) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction\n\n* 232. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, only 14 Claimants have proven to be Integradora's shareholders, namely Ampex, Apple Oaks, Cambria, Axis Oil Field Services, Floradale, Frederick J. Warren IRA, Brentwood, Gary Olson, Genevieve T. Irwin 2002 Trust, John N. Irwin III, Gerald L. Parsky IRA, ON5, Rainbow Fund, and Robert M. Witt IRA.81\n* 233. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerning the Claimants who do not directly hold Integradora's shares \u2013 those who claim to be indirect shareholders in Oro Negro \u2013, it is Respondent's position that they cannot bring a claim in their own name under Article 1116 of NAFTA for the alleged indirect expropriation of their shares. For Respondent, it is a well-established legal principle that a company has a legal personality of its own and its assets do not belong to its shareholders in a proportion equivalent to their shareholding. Even less so when that shareholding passes through various companies, trusts and other investment vehicles82.\n* 234. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Respondent submits that certain Claimants cannot bring claims in respect of their shares in Oro Negro, for these shares are held through intermediaries located in a State outside the NAFTA. This would be the situation of Alicia Grace, Carolyn Grace Baring, Diana Grace Beard, Frederick Grace, Nicholas Grace, Oliver R. Grace III and Virginia Grace, who allegedly hold shares through the Lorraine Grace Trust - Oliver 2311 and Field Nominee Limited, both incorporated in Bermuda.83\n* 235. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Respondent argues that Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White allegedly hold Integradora's shares through Oro Cooperatief, a Dutch legal entity that is controlled by Axis Services and Axis Holding.84\n* 236. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent further claims that many of the Claimants have filed claims in their own name and on behalf of some individual retirement account, known as an Individual Retirement Account (\"IRA\") or on behalf of some trust that they claim to \"own\" or control.85\n* 237. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In instances, continues Respondent, the recognised shareholder in Integradora, in light of the company's share ledger entries, is the IRA or trust in question. This would be the situation of Ms. Irwin and the Irwin Trust, Mr. Warren and the Warren IRA, Mr. Parsky and the Parsky IRA, Mr. Witt and the Witt IRA.86\n* 238. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Respondent contends that Vista Pros ceased to be an investor by selling its shares to ON5 on 1 March 2017. Therefore, it would not qualify as an \"investor of a Party\" and would not be in a position to initiate arbitration proceedings under NAFTA Article 1116.87\n* 239. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Respondent argues that the sale of Vista Pros' shares occurred many months before Oro Negro's Contracts with Pemex were cancelled or Oro Negro was declared bankrupt. Thus, Vista Pros cannot even claim that it was an investor of a Party when the main measures giving rise to this arbitration occurred or, alternatively, that its investment was expropriated prior to 1 March 2017 when it sold its shares to ON5.88\n* 240. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent also raises objections as to the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione personae in relation to Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White.89\n* 241. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent contends that nothing in NAFTA provides that dual nationals (or permanent residents) of two NAFTA Contracting States should be permitted to maintain a Chapter 11 claim against either Party. Thus, Respondent argues, the rule of customary international law that a national may not bring claims at the international level against his or her own State should prevail.90\n* 242. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, even if claims by dual nationals were in principle permitted under the NAFTA, which is not the case, arbitral tribunals should apply the well-established customary rule of dominant and effective nationality.91\n* 243. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concretely, Respondent considers puzzling the fact that Mr. Williamson-Nasi lived in Mexico until recently, exercising his citizenship rights, and now tries to distance himself from his Mexican nationality.92 In relation with Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White, Respondent notes inter alia that he is Mexican by birth and resided in Mexico from birth until 2012.93\n* 244. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Respondent is of the view that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Messrs. Ca\u00f1edo White and Williamson-Nasi's claims due to their violation of the Article 1121 waiver requirement. Messrs. Ca\u00f1edo White and Williamson-Nasi initiated and continue to pursue a lawsuit before a US Court, which would be based on some of the same grounds on which they have based their claims against Respondent.94\n* 245. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent also considers that Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White, as indirect shareholders, lack standing to bring a claim under Article 1117 because they do not meet the requirement of ownership or control of the Mexican Enterprises.95\n* 246. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues that, unlike other investment treaties, the NAFTA contains no umbrella clause; therefore, the mere breach of a commercial contract cannot give rise to an independent breach of the NAFTA. Accordingly, Respondent submits that if the Tribunal agrees that Claimants have failed to establish their allegations of corruption and collusion in accordance with the applicable high standard of proof, then there is no jurisdiction ratione materiae.96\n* 247. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, Claimants' claim is based on allegations of contractual violations. The Claimants complain about the 2015 and 2016 amendments to the Oro Negro Contracts, Pemex's efforts to negotiate the amendments in 2017, about the alleged delay in payments in their favour, and about the terminations of the Oro Negro Contracts.97\n* 248. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent also contends that the acts grounding the allegations of a NAFTA breach must have a proximate cause with the damages complained of. In this case, the Claimants would have failed to meet this condition, as they seek to hold Respondent liable for acts of private companies, falling oil prices, and poor business decisions by Oro Negro.98\n* 249. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Respondent points out that NAFTA Article 1116, unlike Article 1117, only allows claims for losses directly suffered by shareholders, and not for reflective losses such as those claimed by some Claimants in this arbitration.99\n* 250. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From Respondent's perspective, Article 1116 would be limited to situations such as a State's interference with shareholder's corporate rights, interference with the right to receive dividends, attend meetings, vote, etc. Respondent considers that Article 1117 consists of an exceptional type of derivative claim allowing investors to appear on behalf of a corporation to claim for injuries suffered by the corporation.100\n\n* ### B) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The acts of PEMEX cannot be attributed to Mexico\n\n* 251. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent rejects the application of Article 1503(2) and international law as invoked by Claimants. According to Respondent, Claimants' arguments on attribution fail to recognize that NAFTA Article 1502(3)(a) contains an exception regarding attribution of acts by public and private \"monopolies.\" Notably, PEMEX would be a monopoly whose commercial acts are not attributable to Mexico.101\n* 252. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues that NAFTA Article 1502 only attributes to a NAFTA Party discrete acts implemented in the exercise of an express delegation of governmental authority. For Respondent, PEMEX executed, modified, and terminated the Oro Negro Contracts, but in doing so did not exercise \"regulatory, administrative or other governmental functions\" under NAFTA Chapter 15.102\n* 253. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter 15 of NAFTA, Respondent contends, would establish a lex specialis for attribution of acts to NAFTA Parties. It is Respondent's view that this lex specialis displaces customary international law on attribution.103\n* 254. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet, even if NAFTA's lex specialis on attribution did not prevail over the ILC Articles, Pemex's acts cannot be attributed to Respondent. Respondent invokes Article 5 of the ILC, according to which the conduct of an entity must relate to governmental activity and not to any other private or commercial activity in which the entity may have engaged. With respect to Article 8, Respondent invokes the presumption of \"general separateness of corporate entities\" and reiterates that the fact that the PEMEX Act empowers PEMEX to conclude \"procurement contracts for the exportation and extraction of petroleum products in furtherance of the economic development of the Mexican state\" does not attribute PEMEX' acts to Respondent.104\n* 255. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the Energy Reform, Respondent affirms, modifications were made to the nature of Pemex, which is now a Empresa Productiva del Estado and carries out activities similar to that of a private company.105\n\n* ### C) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inexistence of a breach under Article 1110\n\n* 256. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, Claimants' list of claims does not describe an expropriation. It describes alleged difficulties experienced by a company that took substantial financial risks and then experienced commercial litigation with its customers and investors.\n* 257. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Respondent's account, Claimants make vague assertions about the loss of a \"bundle of rights and legitimate expectations,\" through measures that were \"creeping and indirect.\" Respondent considers that Claimants appear to assert that Oro Negro's \"ability to contract with Pemex\" is the property right at stake that was taken from them.106\n* 258. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent highlights that Claimants \u2013 a group of minority investors in Integradora \u2013 do not assert that the Respondent took any of their shares or ownership rights in Integradora. Respondent affirms that Claimants' claim is based exclusively on alleged indirect injuries directed at them that resulted from actions involving the majority Mexican-owned group of Integradora and its Mexican subsidiaries.107\n* 259. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent draws attention to the fact that Oro Negro provided dozens of guarantees to the Bondholders. As consequence, continues Respondent, when the company defaulted under the Bond Agreement, the Bondholders sought to enforce such guarantees. Accordingly, upon the initiation of the Concurso Mercantil 345/2017, the Bondholders demanded the restitution of the Oro Negro Rigs, a situation that occurred on 15 May 2019, and upon which the rigs left Mexican territory and were sold through public auction in the Bahamas.108\n* 260. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, it is Respondent's position that it never \"took\" the rigs. From Respondent's perspective, the fact that Oro Negro has lost title to these assets derives from the dozens of securities it granted to the Bondholders by way of a carte blanche.109\n* 261. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent notes that PEMEX terminated the Oro Negro Contracts in accordance with their applicable terms. In this regard, it is Respondent's position that, contrary to Claimants' assertion, there is currently no injunction or court decision that has declared the early terminations of the Oro Negro Contracts to be illegal, null or void, or to have suspended their effects. Hence, Respondent affirms that the Oro Negro Contracts were legally and validly terminated.110\n* 262. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, Respondent contends that there was no discrimination in PEMEX's treatment of its contractors. Notably, it is Respondent's view that Perforadora was the only operator of 400-feet Jack-up rigs that had five contracts with PEMEX.111\n* 263. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Respondent states that Claimants have not shown \u2013 nor could they have shown \u2013 that Oro Negro had a property right over the ability to enter into future contracts with PEMEX.112\n* 264. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, there was nothing special about Oro Negro Rigs, while there was (and there is) an oversupply of such platforms in the market, and the oil industry is subject to cyclical and severe downturns, such as those experienced in the period discussed in this arbitration.113\n* 265. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent affirms that there was no creeping expropriation either, for the alleged measures discussed by Claimants are too remote from each other. For Respondent, Claimants have not provided even prima facie evidence that the tariff reductions that Oro Negro agreed to in 2015 and 2016 are in any way related to the Oro Negro Bondholders. In this regard, Respondent consider that Claimants have merely presented a long list of actions, including actions not taken by PEMEX or any governmental authority, and speculate that they are all connected in some way, without providing any evidence of such connection.114\n* 266. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Respondent states that there was no judicial expropriation. It is Respondent's position that judicial acts may breach international obligations only in the most extreme and unusual circumstances, requiring egregious and shocking conduct.115\n\n* ### D) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inexistence of a breach under Article 1105\n\n* 267. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent observes that Article 1105 of NAFTA establishes a very specific standard of protection, which has to be analysed by reference to the customary minimum standard of treatment. A preliminary step in this regard would be for Claimants to prove the existence of a relevant rule of customary international law.116\n* 268. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Respondent considers that customary international law has established a minimum standard of treatment in a limited number of areas, such as the obligation not to deny justice \u2013 and this specific instance is only characterized when the outcome of the proceedings runs counter to a most basic sense of judicial propriety.117\n* 269. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is Respondent's view that Claimants argue vague notions such as \"politically motivated\" and \"lack of good faith\" as alleged principles of customary international law, but cite no instance of state practice, let alone one of opinio juris, as evidence of such customary international law standards.118\n* 270. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Respondent, the customary international law minimum standard prohibits an action that is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, and discriminatory if the claimant is subjected to racial or regional bias or if it involves an absence of due process leading to an outcome that offends judicial propriety.119\n* 271. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is Respondent's position that Claimants have not satisfied the high threshold for finding a violation of the customary international law standard of Minimum Standard of Treatment.120\n* 272. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regards to allegations of corruption made under Article 1105, Respondent considers that the alleged corrupt conduct must have a causal link to the alleged investment treaty violation.121In fact, Respondent considers that Claimants have not even discharged their obligation to prove the alleged corruption acts, much less that they had any relation to this arbitration.122\n* 273. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent further considers that a mere breach of contract or of alleged \"legitimate expectations,\" which presuppose a realistic assessment of risk, do not amount to a denial of fair and equitable treatment.123\n* 274. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Respondent, Claimants have presented misguided arguments, arguing that any breach of contract by a State amounts to a denial of fair and equitable treatment because of the investor's legitimate expectations of having a contract performed by the contracting State party.124\n* 275. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, it is Respondent's view that international investment treaties are in no way intended to be insurance policies against poor business decisions, to the extent that it would be illegitimate to expect the host State to be liable for losses resulting from imprudent business decisions.125\n* 276. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Respondent argues that any potentially protected investors' expectations must be informed by the specific characteristics of the host State. Notably, Respondent notes that investing in developing countries inherently involves a higher degree of risk offset by a higher rate of return.126\n* 277. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, it is Respondent's view that, even in developed countries, investors' expectations must be justified by means of a proper risk assessment. Concretely, Respondent states that Oro Negro and its investors made highly risky investments that required substantial financing from third parties, with whom they made commitments that, in the end, they did not agree to or could not honour. Moreover, there are risks in the energy industry related to possible falls in oil prices, of which Oro Negro was fully aware.127\n* 278. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relation to the allegations of discriminatory treatment, Respondent affirms that PEMEX did not give any contractor a \"better deal.\" Rather, PEMEX negotiated with each contractor taking into consideration the market situation and based on the circumstances applicable to each supplier.128\n* 279. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent highlights that Pemex treated all contractors in the same manner, stating further that, in relation to the six companies that leased 400-feet Jack-up rigs, rate reductions were negotiated during the same years that they were negotiated with Oro Negro.129\n* 280. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to Seamex, Respondent notes that its contracts were negotiated at different times and some of their terms were different, as they related to the particularities of the contractual relationship with that company. Respondent is of the view that the contractual relationship between PEMEX and Seamex was in a delicate position due to impending litigation involving large sums related to the termination of the West Pegasus semi-submersible platform, which was much more costly than the other Jack-ups in question. It is for these reasons that Respondent considers that, like any contractual relationship between two companies, the contractual situation between PEMEX and Integradora was not comparable and was naturally different from the contractual relationship between PEMEX and Seamex.130\n* 281. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Respondent draws attention to the fact that Seadrill, the holding company of Seamex, announced in June 2021 that a creditor (Fintech) had requested that the holding company of the Seamex joint venture be placed in provisional liquidation in Bermuda. In particular, Seadrill noted that \"[t]he need for the provisional liquidation and restructuring has arisen as a result of Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos ('Pemex') not having paid material receivables to SeaMex over a prolonged period of time as well as an objective to deleverage SeaMex's balance sheet.\"131\n* 282. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, it is Respondent's position that NAFTA exempts obligations of National Treatment (\"NT\") and Most Favoured Nation (\"MFN\") in procurement by a party or by a state-owned enterprise. For Respondent, Claimants try to present an NT and MFN claims disguised under the cloak of FET allegations.132\n* 283. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent further contends that that Claimants' allegations concerning due process and transparency lack substance, as the Claimants' argument fails to reconcile the alleged facts with the applicable legal standard, which the Claimants address in a single paragraph by citing two non-NAFTA awards with no apparent bearing on the present case.133\n* 284. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to alleged irregularities in criminal investigations and judicial proceedings in Mexico, Respondent considers that the allegations are general and vague. In particular, Respondent alleges that Claimants do not explain how any of these allegations could constitute a violation of a rule of customary international law.134\n* 285. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relation to the Claimants' allegations concerning the breach of the FPS standard, Respondent cautions that FET and FPS claims should not be conflated \u2013 these are two discrete standards, addressing different factual circumstances.135 Indeed, Respondent is of the view that Claimants' claim related to the FPS standard consists of the same allegations in support of their FET claim.136\n* 286. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Respondent's understanding of customary international law, the FPS principle concerns only physical security of the investor. For Respondent, restricting full protection and security to the physical security of an investor makes sense when both the FET standard and the FPS standard are incorporated under the heading of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.137\n\n* ### E) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damages\n\n* 287. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Claimants claim damages of at least USD 270 million for the alleged violation of NAFTA Articles 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment) and 1110 (Expropriation), Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to establish the existence of a sufficient causal link between the alleged treaty breaches and the damages sought.138\n* 288. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent disputes, for example, that the loss of the Oro Negro Rigs \u2013 the second source of damages identified by Claimants' damages expert \u2013 was a consequence of the renegotiation or cancellation of the contracts with PEMEX, or of PEMEX's alleged collusion with the Bondholders, or any of the other measures that Claimants have identified as violating NAFTA. Conversely, Respondent argues that the proximate causes of the loss of the Oro Negro Rigs was the oil crisis and Oro Negro's decision to file for bankruptcy, knowing that this constituted an \"event of default\" under the 2016 Bond Agreement \u2013 an event of default that would trigger the enforcement of guarantees.139\n* 289. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, Respondent questions the alleged loss of the advance payments Oro Negro made for the construction of rigs. In this regard, Respondent observes that Claimants have simply\n\nfailed to explain how, in the absence of the measures complained of, Oro Negro would have relied on these advances.140\n\n* 290. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another point of contention concerns the level of damages owed in relation to Article 1110 and 1105 of NAFTA. Respondent is of the view that neither Claimants nor their expert distinguish between the damages associated with the alleged violation of the minimum standard of treatment and those associated with the alleged expropriation. Notably, Respondent indicates that it is unclear what the damages would be if this Tribunal were to determine, for example, that there was no expropriation but a violation of the minimum standard of treatment.141\n* 291. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to these issues, Respondent also raises concerns as to double recovery. Respondent asserts that Oro Negro is challenging the termination of the Oro Negro Contracts before Mexican courts and has demanded payment of damages following such termination.142\n* 292. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, in case the Tribunal decided to award damages in Claimants' favour, Respondent consider that these damages should reflect the respective shareholding of each Claimant in Oro Negro.143\n* 293. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, in the event of a damages award related to the allegations of expropriation, Respondent considers that the Tribunal should observe the parameters set in Article 1110. In particular, it is Respondent's view that the quantification of damages should take into account the fair market value of the investment calculated immediately before the expropriation \u2013 and not at the time when the award is issued.144\n* 294. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent believes that the fair market value method is compatible with the standard of full compensation, and it would be for the Claimants to establish the existence of losses suffered over and above what is set out in NAFTA Article 1110(2).145\n* 295. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Respondent considers that Article 1110(2) establishes the measure of compensation for expropriation cases, and that such a measure is generally accepted for both direct and indirect expropriation cases under NAFTA.146\n* 296. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent observes that Claimants have not asked for consequential damages, as well as failed to establish the factual basis for any additional damages or the nature of these additional damages they allegedly suffered from the \"wrongfulness\" of the alleged expropriation.147\n* 297. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards any damages eventually awarded in relation to the minimum standard of treatment, Respondent concurs that these have to be calculated in light of the full compensation standard.148\n* 298. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent is of the view that Claimants fail to distinguish between damages arising from the alleged expropriation and those arising from the alleged violation of the minimum standard of treatment, implicitly taking the position that the violation of Article 1105 is tantamount to an expropriation under Article 1110. In these circumstances, argues Respondent, there is no reason to depart from the use of the fair market value method determined at the date of expropriation as the measure of compensation.149\n* 299. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Respondent does not object to the use of the DCF methodology employed by the Claimants' experts, however it does raise numerous objections as to concrete details of the calculation conducted.150\n\n### IV. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PARTIES'REQUESTS FOR RELIEF\n\n### 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants' request for relief\n\n300. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants request the Tribunal to:151\n\n* i. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0declare that Mexico has breached Article 1110 (Expropriation) and Article 1105 (Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security) of the Treaty;\n* ii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order Mexico to compensate Claimants for their losses resulting from Mexico's breaches of the Treaty and international law for an amount of at least USD 270 million as of October 1, 2019, to be supplemented as of the date of the hearing and/or the date that this Tribunal issues its Final Award, plus interest until payment at a commercially reasonable rate, compounded annually;\n* iii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order Mexico to pay all applicable pre- and post-Award interest;\n* iv. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0declare that: (a) the award of damages and interest be made net of all taxes; and (b) Mexico may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of damages and interest;\n* v. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0award such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n* vi. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order Mexico to pay all of the costs and expenses of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n### 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent's request for relief\n\n301. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent requests the Tribunal to:152\n\n* i. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0dismiss Claimants' claims in their entirety, either because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, or dismiss Claimants' claims as not being in violation of Chapter 11 of NAFTA;\n* ii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order Claimants to reimburse Respondent for the costs it has incurred in this arbitration, including legal costs, travel costs incurred by its legal team, witnesses and experts, and Mexico's share of the Tribunal's expenses;\n* iii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order any other relief that the Respondent may seek in the course of this arbitration and that the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n* iv. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order Claimants to act prudently in this arbitration and to comply fully with Provision 25 of Procedural Order No. 1 and Procedural Order No. 3 (on Confidentiality), in order to avoid document leaks from this arbitration to the media.\n\n302. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the alternative, if the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction and the Respondent has incurred international liability for breach of its obligations under NAFTA, the Respondent requests1 3\n\n* i. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Tribunal to determine that the Claimants have failed to prove the requisite causal nexus necessary to find their claims for damages; and\n* ii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if the Tribunal determines that the Claimants have demonstrated the requisite causal nexus, reduce the amount of damages to an amount not greater than that set forth in Respondent's Rejoinder Brief.\n\n153 See Rejoinder, \u00a7 808.\n\n### V. THE ARTICLE 1128 SUBMISSIONS\n\n### 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada 1128 Submission\n\n* ### A) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 1116 (claim by an investor of a Party on its own behalf) and 1117 (claim by an investor of a Party on behalf of an enterprise) of the NAFTA\n\n* 303. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada argues that NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 do not allow an investor of a Party to bring a claim against the same Party. In Canada's view, a claimant, whether bringing a claim on its own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise that the claimant owns or controls, cannot be of the same nationality of the Party against which the claimant brings a claim.153\n* 304. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Canada's understanding, the NAFTA's requirement for diversity of nationality in order for a claimant to have standing to bring a claim is consistent with the well-established principle of international law that an individual or entity cannot maintain an international claim against its own State (i.e. the rule of non-responsibility).\n* 305. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada contends that the NAFTA does not provide a lex specialis on the issue of dual nationals and customary law applies so that a claimant is prohibited from making a claim against its State of dominant and effective nationality.154\n* 306. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is Canada's contention that, under Article 1116, investors may only recover losses they incur, not losses their investments incur. In other terms, Article 1116 provides a right for an investor of a Party to bring a claim on its own behalf on the ground that the investor has incurred loss or damage.155\n* 307. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada further affirms that, consistent with the ordinary meaning of the provision, and general principles of corporate law recognized by domestic legal systems and customary international law, an investor can only claim under Article 1116 for losses that it has incurred, not for losses incurred by an enterprise it owns and controls.\n* 308. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regards to Article 1117, Canada is of the view that it contemplates a specific and limited derogation from the customary international law rule that a claim cannot be asserted by a shareholder for harm to the enterprise in which it holds shares. This implies that, without Article 1117, an investor that is a shareholder could not assert an indirect claim for an injury to the enterprise in which it invested.156\n\n* ### B) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1105 of the NAFTA (minimum standard of treatment)\n\n* 309. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada puts forward the view that the reference to customary international law in the FTC Note confirms that Article 1105 refers to an objective standard of treatment for investors, the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, and a disputing party alleging a rule of customary international law bears the burden of proving its existence.157\n* 310. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada contends that NAFTA Article 1105 is not an invitation for tribunals to second-guess state policy and decision-making. In particular, Canada considers that MST does not protect an investor's \"legitimate expectations.\"158\n* 311. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Canada is of the view that, absent a denial of justice, judgments of national courts interpreting domestic law cannot be challenged as a violation of international law.159\n* 312. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it is Canada's position that FPS does not extend beyond the physical protection and security of investments.160\n\n* ### C) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1110 of the NAFTA (expropriation and compensation)\n\n* 313. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada considers that the first step in analysing whether there has been a breach of NAFTA's Article 1110 is to identify the specific investment alleged to have been expropriated.161\n* 314. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, Canada believes that any expropriation analysis must begin with determining whether there is a valid property right capable of being expropriated (renvoi to domestic law). Importantly, for Canada, only legal rights that have vested under the applicable domestic law are capable of being expropriated. Consequently, a potential property right or one that is conditional, in that it may or may not materialize, is not vested and is not capable of being expropriated.162\n* 315. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within this framework, Canada affirms that there must be a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either directly or indirectly, that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of the investment. This means that, for Canada, mere interference with an investor's use or enjoyment of the benefits associated with property is insufficient to constitute an expropriation at international law as reflected in NAFTA Article 1110(1).163\n* 316. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Canada draws attention to the fact that, in considering allegations that the State has \"taken\" or \"expropriated\" the investor's property through its regulatory powers, consideration must be given to the State's police power.164\n* 317. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Canada is of the view that a domestic court's bona fide adjudication as to whether a property right exists under domestic law cannot be recast as an expropriation of that property.165\n\n* ### D) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1503 of the NAFTA (State enterprise)\n\n* 318. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada stresses that NAFTA Chapter 15 provides for a lex specialis regime in relation to the attribution of acts of monopolies and State enterprises, to the content of the obligations, and to the method of implementation.166\n* 319. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Canada highlights that the obligations in Chapter 11 apply to a state enterprise only where it acts in the exercise of delegated \"governmental authority.\" In Canada's view, the term \"governmental authority\" is not defined in the NAFTA.167\n* 320. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canada states that a NAFTA Party is not responsible for the acts or omissions of a state enterprise merely because the state enterprise has the authority to enter into contracts or may receive directions from the State government.\n* 321. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For Canada, the decisions of other tribunals as to the meaning of the term \"governmental authority\" in Article 5 of the ILC Articles can, however, be informative \u2013 e.g. a tribunal finding that \"[w]hat matters is not the 'service public' element, but the use of 'pr\u00e9rogatives de puissance publique' or governmental authority.\"168\n\n### 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0United States ofAmerica 1128 Submission\n\n* ### A) Standing to bring a claim and limitations on damages (Articles 1116 and 1117)\n\n* 322. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States of America (the \"United States\") argues that dual nationals are to be treated as having the nationality of their \"dominant and effective\" nationality for purposes of bringing a claim under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA, and that permanent residents are not considered nationals under customary international law.169\n* 323. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States further argues that, under applicable rules of international law, a State Party to the NAFTA is not responsible for a claim asserted against it under Chapter 11 by an investor of another Party who is a permanent resident of another Party but a citizen of the respondent State Party.\n* 324. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the United States highlights that, if a State enterprise is acting under authority that is not delegated (i.e., if the authority is exercised without a transfer or authorization of governmental authority by the NAFTA Party), then a Chapter 11 tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear any claim of breach of NAFTA's Article 1503(2).170\n* 325. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the United States' perspective, Article 1503(2) provides examples of \"regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority\" that may be delegated. These would include the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges.\n* 326. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the United States upholds the view that the term \"regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority\" means the authority of the NAFTA Party in its sovereign capacity.\n* 327. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the United States stresses that each claim by an investor must fall within either NAFTA Article 1116 or NAFTA Article 1117 and is limited to the type of loss or damage available under the article invoked.171\n* 328. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the United States, Article 1116(1) permits an investor to present a claim for loss or damage incurred by the investor itself, while Article 1117(1), in contrast, permits an investor to present a claim on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that it owns or controls for loss or damage incurred by that enterprise.\n* 329. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within this framework, the United States contends that Articles 1116 and 1117 serve to address discrete and non-overlapping types of injury. Notably, the United States understands that Article 1116 is available to investors when they wish to recover damages incurred directly, while Article 1117 provides for a derivative claim allowing investors to recover losses incurred by an enterprise owned or controlled by them \u2013 in this case, the investors' injury would be an indirect one.\n* 330. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the United States highlights that Article 1117 is applicable only where the loss or damage has been incurred by \"an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly.\" Consequently, it is the United States' view that Article 1117 does not apply where the alleged loss or damage is to an enterprise of a nonParty or of the same Party as the investor.\n* 331. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the United States, the element of \"control of an enterprise\" is not defined by the NAFTA, which would reflect a longstanding US practice of leaving this concept open to a case-by-case analysis.\n* 332. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States also notes that the ordinary meaning of Articles 1116 and 1117 requires an investor to establish the causal nexus between the alleged breach and the claimed loss or damage. This would allow investors to recover such damages only to the extent that they are established on the basis of satisfactory evidence that is not inherently speculative.\n* 333. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, the United States stresses that the standard for factual causation is known as the \"but-for\" or \"sine qua non\" test whereby an act causes an outcome if the outcome would not have occurred in the absence of the act.\n* 334. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the United States contends that the ordinary meaning of the term \"by reason of, or arising out of\" also requires an investor to demonstrate proximate causation. Consequently, injuries that are not sufficiently \"direct\", \"foreseeable\", or \"proximate\" may not, consistent with applicable rules of international law, be considered when calculating damages.\n* 335. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regards to the term \"Investor of a Party\", the United States advances the position that, under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA, an investor who wishes to pursue a claim must allege that \"another Party\" has breached specified obligations in the NAFTA and further that \"the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\"\n* 336. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the United States' view that, by using the words \"the investor\" and \"that breach,\" Article 1116(1) requires that the investor bringing the claim be the same investor who suffered loss or damage as a result of the alleged breach. Hence, Article 1116(1) would not authorize a different investor to bring a claim on behalf of the investor who suffered the loss or damage as a result of the alleged breach.\n\n### B) Consent and waiver (Articles 1121 and 1122)\n\n* 337. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States understands that, because the waiver requirements under Article 1121 are among the requirements upon which the Parties have conditioned their consent, a valid and effective waiver is a precondition to the Parties' consent to arbitrate claims, and accordingly to a tribunal's jurisdiction, under NAFTA Chapter 11.172\n* 338. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States affirms that compliance with Article 1121 entails both formal and material requirements. From a formal perspective, the waiver would have to be in writing, as well as clear, explicit and categorical. As to the material requirements, a claimant would have to consistently and concurrently with the written waiver abstain from initiating or continuing proceedings with respect to the measures alleged to constitute a Chapter 11 breach in another forum as of the date of the waiver and thereafter.\n* 339. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, the United States stresses that Article 1121 requires a claimant's waiver to encompass \"any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to\" in both Article 1116 and Article 1117, with certain limited, specified exceptions.\n* 340. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the United States' perspective, this requirement is to be interpreted broadly, for the waiver provision is to avoid the need for a respondent State to litigate concurrent and overlapping proceedings in multiple forums, and to minimize not only the risk of double recovery, but also the risk of conflicting outcomes.\n* 341. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the United States considers that, for a waiver to be and remain effective, any juridical person or persons that a claimant directly or indirectly owns or controls, or that directly or indirectly control the claimant, must likewise abstain from initiating or continuing proceedings in another forum as of the date of filing the waiver (and thereafter) with respect to the measures alleged to constitute a NAFTA Chapter 11 breach.\n* 342. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the United States' understanding that to allow otherwise would permit a claimant to circumvent the formal and material requirements under Article 1121 through affiliated corporate entities, thereby rendering the waiver provision ineffective. This in turn would frustrate the purpose of this waiver provision.\n\n* ### C) Expropriation and compensantion (Article 1110)\n\n* 343. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States concurs with Canada that the first step in any expropriation analysis must begin with an examination of whether there is an investment capable of being expropriated.\n* 344. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the United States draws attention to the fact that it is appropriate to look at the law of the host State for a determination of the definition and scope of the property right or property interest at issue, including any applicable limitations.173\n* 345. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States affirms that under international law, where an action is a bona fide, non-discriminatory regulation, it will not ordinarily be deemed expropriatory. That said, the United States understands that this principle in public international law is not an exception that applies after an expropriation has been found but, rather, is a recognition that certain actions, by their nature, do not engage State responsibility.\n* 346. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relation to indirect expropriations, the United States argues that the Tribunal must look at the following three factors: (i) the claimant must demonstrate that the government measure at issue destroyed all, or virtually all, of the economic value of its investment, or interfered with it to such a similar extent and so restrictively as to support a conclusion that the property has been taken from the owner; (ii) the Tribunal must engage in an objective inquiry of the reasonableness of the claimant's expectations, which depend in part on the nature and extent of governmental regulation in the relevant sector; and (iii) the nature and character of the government action must be considered, including whether such action involves physical invasion by the government or whether it is more regulatory in nature.\n* 347. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the United States is of the view that decisions of domestic courts acting in the role of neutral and independent arbiters of the legal rights of litigants do not give rise to a claim for expropriation under Article 1110.\n\n* ### D) Minimum standard of treatment (Article 1105)\n\n* 348. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States stressed that on 31 July 2001 the FTC, comprising the NAFTA Parties' cabinet-level representatives, issued an interpretation reaffirming that \"Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\"174\n* 349. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States affirms that the FTC clarified that the concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do \"not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens,\" that \"a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1)\" and that such interpretation \"shall be binding\" on tribunals established under NAFTA Chapter 11.\n* 350. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States notes that customary international law is proven by State practice qualified by opinio juris. From the United States' perspective, relevant State practice must be widespread and consistent and be accepted as law, meaning that the practice must also be accompanied by a sense of legal obligation.\n* 351. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States understands that customary international law may be proven by inter alia relevant national court decisions or domestic legislation dealing with the particular issue alleged to be the norm of customary international law, as well as official declarations by relevant State actors on the subject.\n* 352. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the United States observes that States may decide expressly by treaty to make policy decisions to extend protections under the rubric of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" beyond that required by customary international law.\n* 353. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, according to the United States, the practice of adopting such autonomous standards is not relevant to ascertaining the content of Article 1105 in which \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" are expressly tied to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.\n* 354. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the same vein, the United States highlights that any arbitral decision interpreting \"autonomous\" fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security provisions in other treaties, outside the context of customary international law, cannot constitute evidence of the content of the customary international law standard required by Article 1105(1).\n* 355. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the United States cautions that decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals interpreting \"fair and equitable treatment\" as a concept of customary international law are not themselves instances of \"State practice\" for purposes of evidencing customary international law, although such decisions can be relevant for determining State practice when they include an examination of such practice.\n* 356. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the United States, concurring with Canada, the burden is on the claimant to establish the existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international law that meets the requirements of State practice and opinio juris.\n* 357. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the United States indicates that, once a rule of customary international law has been established, the claimant must then show that the respondent State has engaged in conduct that violates that rule.\n* 358. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the United States stresses that Chapter 11 tribunals do not have an open- ended mandate to \"second-guess government decision-making.\"\n* 359. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States alleges that customary international law has crystallized to establish a minimum standard of treatment in only a few areas, notably in relation to FET and FPS obligations.\n* 360. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regards to FET protection, the United States considers that there exists an obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. A denial of justice, according to the United States, in its historical and \"customary sense\" denotes \"misconduct or inaction of the judicial branch of the government\" and involves \"some violation of rights in the administration of justice, or a wrong perpetrated by the abuse of judicial process.\"175\n* 361. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it is the United States' understanding that aliens have no cause for complaint at international law about a domestic system of law provided that the system of justice in question is composed of fair courts, readily open to aliens, administering justice honestly, impartially, and without bias or political control.\n* 362. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, a denial of justice would require that the final act of a state judiciary constitutes a \"notoriously unjust\" or \"egregious\" administration of justice \"which offends a sense of judicial propriety.\" Accordingly, the United States points out that NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals are not empowered to be supranational courts of appeal on a state court's application of domestic law.\n* 363. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the United States considers that the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" is not a component element of \"fair and equitable treatment\" under customary international law that gives rise to an independent host State obligation.\n* 364. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regards to FPS, the United States claims to have long maintained that the obligation to accord \"full protection and security\" requires that each Party provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.176\n* 365. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the United States does not consider that FPS requires States to (i) prevent economic injury inflicted by third parties, (ii) provide for legal security, (iii) provide for stability of a State's legal environment, or (iv) guarantee that aliens or their investments are not harmed under any circumstances.\n\n### VI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n### 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\n\n366. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following is a summary of the facts as pleaded by the Parties or established by the evidence, without prejudice to any legal conclusions by the Tribunal; many of them will be addressed in subsequent sections. The summary is not intended to be exhaustive, and the absence of reference to particular facts or assertions, or to the evidence supporting any particular fact or assertion, should not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal has carefully considered each one of the many arguments and evidence submitted to it in the course of these proceedings.\n\n### 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oro Negro Contracts\n\n* 367. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dispute before the Tribunal arises in connection with five contracts celebrated between PEMEX and Perforadora, namely the Primus, Decus, Laurus, Fortius and Impetus Contracts (jointly, the \"Oro Negro Contracts\").177 Each of these contracts had as its object the lease of a 400 feet Jack-up rigs, i.e., respectively, the Primus, Decus, Laurus, Fortius and Impetus Jackup rigs (jointly, the \"Oro Negro Rigs\").\n* 368. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Oro Negro Contracts operationalized the lease of the Oro Negro Rigs, these rigs themselves were not owned by Perforadora. Instead, Perforadora leased the rigs from other Oro Negro subsidiaries through bareboat charter contracts (\"Bareboat Charters\").178In reality, the five Oro Negro Rigs were each owned by a Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated in Singapore (jointly the \"Singapore Rig Owners\"), namely the Oro Negro Primus Pte. Ltd. (\"Primus SPV\"), Oro Negro Laurus Pte. Ltd. (\"Laurus SPV\"), Oro Negro Fortius Pte. Ltd. (\"Fortius SPV\"), Oro Negro Decus Pte. Ltd. (\"Decus SPV\"), and Oro Negro Impetus Pte. Ltd. (\"Impetus SPV\").179 These SPVs were controlled by another subsidiary of Integradora, namely Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. (\"Oro Negro Drilling\") \u2013 which was also incorporated in Singapore.\n\n### 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bond Agreement between Oro Negro Drilling and the Bondholders\n\n* 369. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the year of 2014, in order to acquire the Oro Negro Rigs, Integradora raised USD 900 million through the issuance of bonds by Oro Negro Drilling. On 24 January 2014, Oro Negro Drilling and the creditors of these debt instruments (the Bondholders), through Nordic Trustee ASA acting in its capacity as trustee for the Bondholders (\"Nordic Trustee\"), entered into a bond agreement to govern the bonds issued (the \"Bond Agreement\").180\n* 370. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bondholders and Oro Negro Drilling have amended and restated the Bond Agreement several times, including on 29 April 2016, 2 June 2016, 29 September 2016 and 9 November 2016.181\n* 371. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the Bond Agreement shows that the Bondholders decided on 7 November 2016 to amend the debt instrument to accommodate certain changes in the Oro Negro Contracts.182 372. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the modifications implemented, the Bondholders decided to waive events of default that had taken place prior to that amendment, such as the non-payment of amortization and interest.183 Furthermore, the amended instrument contained, among others, the following safeguards in favour of the Bondholders: the right to appoint an \"Independent Director,\" who would have to be consulted prior to the filing of insolvency proceedings involving Oro Negro Drilling and its subsidiaries;184 and the right to declare an event of default if Integradora, Perforadora, Oro Negro Drilling or the Singapore Rig Owners initiated insolvency proceedings.185\n* 373. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal also notes that, pursuant to the Bond Agreement, the occurrence of an event of default allowed Nordic Trustee to \"declare the Outstanding Bonds including accrued interest, costs and expenses to be in default and due for immediate payment\" and \"to take every measure necessary to recover the amounts due under the Outstanding Bonds and all other amounts outstanding.\"186\n* 374. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal draws attention to the fact that the Bond Agreement was brought to the file by Claimants, and the authenticity of its content was never in question.\n\n### 4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The renegotiation ofthe Oro Negro Contracts\n\n* 375. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Oro Negro Contracts were the object of several rounds of renegotiations, which took place in 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n* 376. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A first round of renegotiations of the Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus Contracts was amicably concluded on 26 June 2015 with an agreed reduction of their daily rates from USD 160,000.00 to USD 130,000.00 for the period of a year.187\n* 377. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In October 2015, further modifications to the Oro Negro Contracts were agreed upon, which led to the extension of the duration of the leases of the Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus rigs by approximately one year.188\n* 378. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the turn of 2015, on 29 and 30 December, the Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus Contracts were modified yet again in order to extend payment delays from 20 to 180 days.189\n* 379. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further modifications were implemented in November 2016. In particular, the Laurus and Primus Contracts were suspended for the period of one year, while the Fortius, Decus and Impetus Contracts had their daily rates reduced to USD 116,300.00.190\n* 380. \u00a0\u00a0A new round of renegotiations was triggered by PEMEX in 2017 (the \"2017 renegotiations\"). The amendments negotiated between PEMEX and Oro Negro at this stage were never adopted and are at the root of the present dispute.\n\n### 5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insolvency proceedings and the termination ofthe Oro Negro Contracts\n\n* 381. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is undisputed that Integradora and its subsidiaries filed for insolvency proceedings in September 2017 before Mexican courts. Notably, Perforadora filed insolvency proceedings on 11 September 2017,191 while Integradora, Oro Negro Drilling, Primus SPV, Laurus SPV, Fortius SPV, Decus SPV, and Impetus SPV followed suit and filed insolvency proceedings on 29 September 2017.192 Due to procedural irregularities related to Perforadora's filing, the insolvency proceedings were only admitted on 5 October 2017.193\n* 382. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 26 September 2017, the Bondholders declared an event of default as per clause 15.1. (g) of the Bond Agreement, i.e., a direct consequence of Perforadora's filing of insolvency proceedings.\n* 383. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 3 October 2017, PEMEX terminated the Oro Negro Contracts based on an alleged early termination clause contained in the instruments, i.e. clause 30.3.2.3 of the Impetus Contract and clause 18 of the rest of the contracts.194\n* 384. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bareboat Charter Agreements were terminated on 5 October 2017, allegedly as a consequence of the termination of the Oro Negro Contracts.195\n* 385. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PEMEX returned the five oil rigs leased by Oro Negro between October and December of 2017 (Impetus on 10 October, Laurus and Primus on 3 November, Decus on 4 November, and Fortius on 26 December),196 and Claimants acknowledge that oil rigs were indeed returned as per the return certificates issued by PEMEX.197\n* 386. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal notes that the judge in the Mexican insolvency proceedings declared Oro Negro in liquidation,198 ordering Perforadora to return the rigs to the Singapore Rig Owners on 15 May 2019.199\n\n### 6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proceedings before US Courts\n\n* 387. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first of the US proceedings related to this arbitration was launched by the Singapore Rig Owners and Oro Negro Drilling on 15 March 2018, with the filing of a petition against Perforadora before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (\"New York Court\"). This case was initiated under the Bareboat Charters and sought \"to recover five drilling vessels [the Oro Negro Rigs] wrongfully withheld by Defendant Perforadora Oro Negro.\"200\n* 388. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, a series of insolvency related petitions were filed in the United States by individuals acting as Foreign Representatives of Perforadora and Integradora. In addition, a few other US proceedings related to this arbitration have been initiated by Messrs. Gonzalo Gil White, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ca\u00f1edo White and Carlos Williamson-Nasi acting on their own behalf.\n* 389. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 20 April 2018, Mr. Alonso del Val Echeverr\u00eda, acting in his capacity as Foreign Representative of Perforadora and Integradora, filed a petition under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code before the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (\"US Bankruptcy Court\").201 This gave rise to a discovery proceeding targeting PEMEX, Bondholders, Oro Negro Drilling, the Singapore Rig Owners, Deutsche Bank M\u00e9xico, Nordic Trustee and others.202 The petition filed recorded applicants' objective in the following terms:\n\nAdditionally, I am investigating potential causes of action, including in the United States or under United States law, by Integradora Oro Negro and Perforadora Oro Negro against the Bondholders (including the Ad-Hoc Group), Deutsche Bank (including Deutsche M\u00e9xico and Deutsche U.S.) and Pemex relating to or arising from their (a) violations of orders issued by the Concurso Court; and (b) efforts (concerted or not) to harm Integradora Oro Negro and its Subsidiaries, including Perforadora Oro Negro, by (i) taking over the Jack-Up Rigs; (ii) terminating the Pemex Contracts; and (iii) misappropriating funds in the Mexican Trust or in the Singapore Entities' Accounts.203\n\n* 390. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 22 October 2018, again in his capacity of Foreign Representative of Perforadora and Integradora, Mr. del Val Echeverr\u00eda filed a petition against the Singapore Rig Owners, AMA and a series of individuals.204 This petition sought inter alia an order prohibiting the Singapore Rig Owners and Bondholders from taking over Oro Negro Rigs,205 relief that was granted on a temporary basis by the US Bankruptcy Court.206\n* 391. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 24 June 2019, in light of the documents obtained through the Chapter 15 Petition, Mr. Gonzalo Gil White, acting both in his personal capacity and as the Foreign Representative of Integradora and Perforadora, filed a complaint against the Ad Hoc Group, the Singapore Rig Owners, a Mexican law firm and a number of individuals.207 Presenting the same facts discussed in this arbitration and articulating essentially the same accusations, compensation was sought for the harm allegedly caused by the Ad Hoc Group's collusion with PEMEX to destroy Oro Negro.208\n* 392. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 10 July 2019, Mr. Gil White, again acting in his personal capacity and as the Foreign Representative of Integradora and Perforadora, filed another complaint against the Ad Hoc Group, the Singapore Rig Owners, a Mexican law firm and a number of individuals. In this case the same facts and accusations arising in this arbitration were again articulated, with compensation being sought for the harm allegedly caused to Integradora and Perforadora in that regard.209 The Tribunal notes that the complaint opens with the following statements:\n\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is an egregious tortious interference case in which a company's creditors and its only customer colluded to drive the company out of business and take over its only assets. The victim is Oro Negro, a Mexican oil services company with five state-of-the-art jack-up rigs used for offshore drilling in the Gulf of M\u00e9xico.\n\n\uff3b\u2026\uff3d\n\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ad-Hoc Group and M\u00e9xico, including through Pemex, destroyed Oro Negro because the Ad-Hoc Group wanted to, and eventually did, take over Oro Negro's only assets, the Rigs. The Rigs are valuable assets according to the Ad-Hoc Group's own estimates, even without the Oro Negro Contracts, each Rig is worth approximately $150 million.210\n\n* 393. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A further complaint was filed on 26 September 2019 by a series of individuals and Mr. Fernando P\u00e9rez Correa in his capacity as Foreign Representative of Integradora and Perforadora against the Singapore Rig Owners, members of the Ad Hoc Group, and a number of other individuals.211 In this instance, petitioners sought inter alia specific performance of a 2016 Mutual Release Agreement entered by Integradora, its shareholders and the Bondholders. Notably, petitioners applied for \"a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from any actions in violation of the 2016 Releases, including initiating or causing to initiate, or taking actions in furtherance of, criminal investigations against Oro Negro and/or its directors or employees for conduct and supposed damages that the 2016 Releases released and discharged.\"212\n* 394. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that amongst the petitioners acting on their own behalf, one finds Messrs. Gonzalo Gil White, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ca\u00f1edo White and Carlos Williamson-Nasi. Furthermore, one cannot but note that the facts leading to this filing are precisely the Mexican criminal investigations and the arrest warrants that are now discussed in this arbitration.213\n* 395. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent acknowledges that Mexico is not a party in these US proceedings.214 The Tribunal also stresses that PEMEX does not appear as a party in any of the proceedings before US courts.\n\n### 7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mexican criminal investigations and tax audits\n\n* 396. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several criminal investigations and tax audits have been launched in Mexico against Integradora, Perforadora and a series of individuals connected with Oro Negro, including some Claimants in this arbitration.\n* 397. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A first criminal complaint was filed before the FGR by the Singapore Rig Owners on 18 June 2018, which gave rise to the criminal investigation CI 864/2018.215 The complaint was filed against Integradora, Perforadora and Deutsche Bank Mexico to investigate the potential criminal offense of fraudulent administration. In particular, the facts of this complaint had to do with the alleged mismanagement of funds in the Mexican trust receiving PEMEX payments under the Oro Negro Contracts.\n* 398. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also in June 2018, another criminal complaint was lodged by the Singapore Rig Owners against Mr. Alonso del Val Echeverr\u00eda before the FGJCDMX, which led to criminal investigation CI 187/2018.216 The complaint under the FGJCDMX relates to procedural fraud allegedly committed by Mr. del Val Echeverr\u00eda, former Integradora's Chief Legal Officer. More specifically, Mr. del Val Echeverr\u00eda is accused of having tried to induce the Concurso judge in error through the simulation of a corporative act.217\n* 399. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. del Val Echeverr\u00eda is also the subject of another investigation of the FGR, initiated on 18 October 2018 and registered as CI 5523/2018.218 In this instance, he is accused of committing an offense provided in the Ley de Amparo, consisting of omitting information on ongoing criminal investigations against him when he filed an amparo in connection with one of these investigations.219\n* 400. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Singapore Rig Owners filed a second criminal complaint before the FGJCDMX on 14 September 2018, launching criminal investigation CI 787/2018.220 This investigation concerns the criminal offenses of fraudulent administration, tax evasion and abuse of trust, and targets Deutsche Bank M\u00e9xico, Messrs. Gil White, Ca\u00f1edo White, Williamson-Nasi and Villegas.221\n* 401. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is in the context of this investigation that arrest warrants were issued by Mexican authorities against Messrs. Gil White, Ca\u00f1edo White, Williamson-Nasi, del Val Echeverr\u00eda, and Villegas. In this regard, it has been established that Mexico requested Interpol Red Notices, which were rejected on the grounds that investigations were not yet on a stage were extradition could be obtained under Mexican extradition law.222 That said, Interpol considered that \"it ha[d] no reason to challenge the validity of the investigation against the Applicants.\"223\n* 402. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal also observes that Mr. del Val Echeverr\u00eda has been cooperating with Mexican authorities in this investigation.224 In particular, he informed the authorities of a number of potential wrongdoings connected with the insolvency proceedings filed by Oro Negro, including the following:\n\nTengo conocimiento, por el cargo que detentaba como Director Jur\u00eddico de PERFORADORA ORO NEGRO S. de R.L. de C.V., que dentro del concurso mercantil 345/2017 del \u00edndice del Juzgado Segundo de Distrito en Materia Civil en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, en noviembre del a\u00f1o pasado dicha empresa solicit\u00f3 un monto cercano a los $250,000,000.00 doscientos cincuenta millones de pesos 00/100 Moneda Nacional, de las cuentas del fideicomiso para pagar el Impuesto al Valor Agregado que se adeudaba. Sin embargo, por instrucciones de GONZALO GIL WHITE, dichos recursos no fueron utilizados para ser pagados al fisco federal sino dispuestos para otros fines.225\n\n* 403. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond these criminal investigations, a contempt accusation is being investigated by the FGR's office in Ciudad del Carmen, which was filed on 21 October 2018 and gave rise to criminal investigation CI 480/2018.226 This further investigation was also launched upon request of the Singapore Rig Owners and is related to Perforadora's alleged refusal to comply with a judicial order to return the Oro Negro Rigs to the Singapore Rig Owners.\n* 404. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, on 17 June 2019, upon the request of the Ministry of Finance, the FGR launched an investigation on tax evasion targeting Messrs. Gil White, Ca\u00f1edo White and Madragon.227\n* 405. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to these criminal investigations, it has been established that Mexican authorities have launched at least seven tax audits as of October 2017 in respect of Integradora and its subsidiaries.228\n\n### VII. THE ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL\n\n* 406. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This part deals with the legal analysis of the Tribunal in light of the facts and the evidence presented by the Parties. The Tribunal will first present its views on the burden and standard of proof guiding its evaluation of evidence (1), then the Tribunal will address its jurisdiction under the facts and objections raised during this arbitration (2). A final section exposes in summary form the conclusions of the Tribunal (3).\n* 407. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wherever appropriate, the Tribunal sets out the Parties' positions alongside its analysis.\n\n### 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Burden and standard ofproof\n\n* 408. \u00a0\u00a0A well-established tenet of dispute resolution is captured by the Latin maxim onus probandi actori incumbit, that is, the one who asserts must prove. Such principle is enshrined in Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to which \"[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\"\n* 409. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This provides a clear rule on the allocation of the burden of proof, which means that Parties must prove all the allegations they advance. However, the UNCITRAL Rules are not as precise in relation to the standard for discharging such burden, with its Article 25(6) stating that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.\" Consequently, the Tribunal disposes of broad discretion in its appreciation of the evidence presented by the Parties.\n* 410. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An important point of contention between the Parties concerns the standard of proof to assess evidence in support of allegations of corruption. Claimants and Respondent have extensively referred to case law in order to advance their respective proposed standards. Nevertheless, these many decisions demonstrate that the practice of investment tribunals in the assessment of evidence is subject to the circumstances of each case.\n* 411. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the case law brought to the file refers to notions such as balance of probabilities, preponderance of evidence, clear and convincing evidence and intime conviction, the reasoning adopted by arbitrators is usually grounded on the facts and the context of each case. Parties may want to draw a clear and sharp distinction between all these standards, but investment tribunals tend to be more nuanced regardless of the label they use in their evaluation of evidence.\n* 412. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that many of these decisions may describe their reasoning in the assessment of corruption related evidence as one based on the preponderance of evidence or as taking into account the method of red flags,229 as was the case in Rutas de Lima and in Union Fenosa.230 Yet, beyond general statements that circumstantial evidence may be considered in the assessment of allegations corruption, none of the referred cases actually explain how the preponderance of evidence or the balance of probabilities is established.\n* 413. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is made clear in both Rutas de Lima and Union Fenosa. In Rutas de Lima, the arbitrators decided to adopt the method of red flags to assess the preponderance of evidence, but cautioned that \"the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal applies a flexible standard of proof does not prevent it from requiring that there be sufficiently specific evidence to reasonably establish the existence of corrupt payments and their connection with the Contract or the June 2016 Minutes\" 231\u00a0The Union Fenosa tribunal was even clearer as to its considerations on the red flags method and the standard of proof:\n\nNonetheless, contrary to the Claimant's submissions, the Respondent and its legal representatives should not be criticised for raising its allegations of corruption in this arbitration in regard to Mr El Komy. These allegations were not frivolous. Several were classic \"red flags\"; but even the reddest of red flags does not suffice without proof of corruption before the tribunal. Whilst it can be relatively easy to allege corruption, it is less easy to prove it, as observed in the Metal-Tech award (2013). Suspicion is not equivalent to proof. Unanswered queries may have innocent explanations, not amounting (in the absence of explanations) to proof of corruption. With hindsight, what businesspeople agree not infrequently defies logic or common- sense to nonbusiness people, again without amounting to proof of corruption. The legal burden of proving corruption rests upon the party alleging corruption; and it is not discharged by placing the burden on the adverse party to prove the absence of corruption.232 [Emphasis added]\n\n414. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A similarly nuanced approach is found in Churchill Mining. Claimants wished to highlight that the Churchill Mining Tribunal \"applied the balance of probabilities standard to evaluate the existence of claimants' investment\" and \"rejected claimants' arguments that, due to the seriousness of respondent's allegations \uff3b\u2026\uff3d, the tribunal should apply the 'clear and convincing' evidence standard.\"233 Still, this was not exactly the ratio decidendi of the case, which is most clear on the following excerpt:\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent carries the burden of proving forgery and fraud, which proof will be measured on a standard of balance of probabilities or intime conviction taking into account that more persuasive evidence is required for implausible facts, it being specified that intent or motive need not be shown for a finding of forgery or fraud but may form part of the relevant circumstantial evidence. The Tribunal will assess all the available evidence on record and weigh it in the context of all relevant circumstances.234\n\n* 415. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The context in which the discussion above took place had to do with the question of whether or not the respondent, in proving its allegation of forgery, had also to prove mens rea \u2013 that is, intent or motive to commit the forgery. The Churchill Mining tribunal was of the view that, as it was not a criminal proceeding, intent and motive need not be proven to ascertain a treaty violation. Yet that tribunal was also clear in stating that such volitional element could be considered in the assessment of evidence. The Churchill Mining tribunal further cited other investment cases in order to support the notion that certain facts need more cogent evidence to tilt the balance of probabilities.235\n* 416. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The criminal standard of proof in common and civil law jurisdictions seems to be analogous. While common lawyers refer to the notion of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, civil lawyers refer to the Latin maxim in dubio pro reo. In both instances, the underlying idea evokes the fact that the existence of doubt must be interpreted in favour of the accused. Such a high standard of proof is related to the nature of criminal sanctions.\n* 417. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, one is not dealing with criminal sanctions nor criminal liability in investment arbitration, with evidence in these proceedings being produced for the purpose of proving treaty violations. It is for this reason that investment tribunals have favoured notions evoking the preponderance of evidence, the balance of probabilities or the adjudicator's intime conviction.\n* 418. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, likelihood and probability are relational measurements, that is, certain things are more likely or probable than others. This means that the level of persuasion that certain evidence may produce depends on the nature and seriousness of the allegations. This fundamental idea was expressed by the Churchill Mining tribunal,236 as it was expressed in the Libananco case. Indeed, the Libananco tribunal observed the following:\n\nIn relation to the Claimant's contention that there should be a heightened standard of proof for allegations of \"fraud or other serious wrongdoing\", the Tribunal accepts that fraud is a serious allegation, but it does not consider that this (without more) requires it to apply a heightened standard of proof. While agreeing with the general proposition that \"the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on\" (see paragraph 117(a) above), this does not necessarily entail a higher standard of proof. It may simply require more persuasive evidence, in the case of a fact that is inherently improbable, in order for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the burden of proof has been discharged.237\n\n* 419. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a tribunal is confronted by allegations with criminal repercussions, such as corruption, it must undertake its analysis with the utmost prudence. While the tribunal will not rule on criminal liability, one must recognize that any findings on such an issue may (and often do) reverberate at criminal fora. Although this realization should not be conducive to the transposition of the criminal standard of proof to investment arbitration, it should be taken as a word of caution in investment tribunals' assessment of corruption related evidence.\n* 420. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, regardless of the label chosen to describe the evaluation of evidence by the arbitrator (inner conviction, preponderance of evidence, the balance of probabilities or clear and convincing evidence), one must always take into account the seriousness of the allegation and the rights at stake. This was convincingly expressed by the ECE tribunal:\n\nCorruption is a serious matter and when it is alleged, a tribunal must weigh the evidence with care, both to see whether the allegation is made out (and if it is, to then determine the legal consequences that follow) and at the same time to safeguard those against whom corruption is alleged, if the allegations turn out to be unproven.\n\n\uff3b\u2026\uff3d When considering the Claimants' evidence the Tribunal has borne in mind the difficulties of obtaining evidence of corruption. It is well aware that acts of corruption are rarely admitted or documented and that tribunals have discussed the need to 'connect the dots'. At the same time, the allegations that have been made are very serious indeed. Not only would they (if true) involve criminal liability on the part of a number of named individuals, they also implicate the reputation, commercial and legal interests of various business undertakings which are not party to these proceedings and which are not represented before the Tribunal. Corruption is a charge which an arbitral tribunal must take seriously. At the same time, it is a charge that should not be made lightly, and the Tribunal is bound to express its reservations as to whether it is acceptable for charges of that level of seriousness to be advanced without \uff3b\u2026\uff3d either some direct evidence or compelling circumstantial evidence. That said, the Tribunal must of course decide the case on the basis of the evidence before it. If the burden of proof is not discharged, the allegation is not made out. The mere existence of suspicions cannot, in the absence of sufficiently firm corroborative evidence, be equated with proof.238\n\n* 421. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proving corruption is no doubt a difficult endeavour. Obviously, individuals involved in such practices are actively looking for ways of bypassing law enforcement. In reality, proving any criminal activity is a difficult task, to the extent that law enforcement is routinely presented with the need to prosecute crimes and respect the rights of the accused \u2013 and the rule of law is supposed to systematically tilt the balance towards the protection of the accused.\n* 422. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, it should not be forgotten that, while the prohibition of corrupt practices may very well constitute an element of international public policy,239 the presumption of innocence is a widely protected human right \u2013 with clear expressions in the American Convention on Human Rights240 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.241\n* 423. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within this framework, one cannot expect the standard of proof in investment arbitration to introduce a presumption of guilt in relation to corruption, nor should one expect Respondent to prove its innocence. If such propositions were to prevail, investment arbitration proceedings would be turned into an inquisitorial playground were the burden of proof is shifted merely by alleging the existence of corruption. Hence, the difficulty in obtaining compelling evidence of corruption cannot be an excuse to the subversion of the rule of law.\n* 424. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In essence, this Tribunal shares the view expressed by the Churchill Mining Tribunal when it calls to \"assess all the available evidence on record and weigh it in the context of all relevant circumstances.\"242 Certainly, parties in an investment arbitration do not need to prove all the elements of a given criminal offense (such as causation or mens rea), nor do they need to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet, precisely because all relevant facts and circumstances must be considered when assessing evidence, the seriousness of a given allegation sets the background upon which the persuasion of the evidence will be evaluated.\n* 425. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, in instances of a very serious allegation (as is the case of corruption), the Tribunal considers that the Party making such allegations has to present compelling and particularized evidence in order to discharge the burden of proof in relation to its allegations. To be sure, suspicion does not amount to conviction. Short of direct evidence of corrupt practices, a considerable accumulation of clear, convincing and particularized circumstantial evidence will be required.\n\n### 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction\n\n* ### A) Preliminary remarks: the sources for the standard of interpretation of the relevant treaty provisions\n\n* 426. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their discussion of treaty interpretation, both Parties rely heavily on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, dated 23 May 1969 (\"VCLT\"),243 with a special emphasis on its Articles 31 and 32, which are considered to reflect customary international law. The Tribunal further notes that Mexico has ratified the VCLT.\n* 427. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the many references in this regard, the relevant articles shall be transcribed below:\n\nArticle 31 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 General rule of interpretation\n\n* 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n* 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any agreement relating to the treaty, which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n* (c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\nArticle 32 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Supplementary means of interpretation\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.244\n\n* 428. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it shall be highlighted in due course, according to the Parties, the interpretation that they respectively propose is advanced as the only one in line with the principles of interpretation under the VCLT. The Tribunal is aware that, in some particular cases, there could be more than one reading consistent with this Convention. In any event, the duty of this Tribunal is to unravel the meaning of the relevant treaty rules applicable, by adopting the interpretation that it considers the most appropriate.\n* 429. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary remark, and in view of the references by the Parties to investment treaties other than the NAFTA, the Tribunal notes that, under the terms of the VCLT, the situations in which one treaty may have an impact on the interpretation of another are limited. More precisely, a treaty concluded between two States is restricted to that relationship and is not expressly recognised by the VCLT as a valid means of interpreting another treaty unless it is covered by Article 31(2). Such a circumstance is logical if one considers that treaties are the result of particular negotiations motivated by legal and political concerns and objectives peculiar to the participants in each specific negotiation.\n* 430. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the texts of other treaties, and their similarities or differences with the NAFTA, may be invoked in an attempt to demonstrate what would be the \"ordinary meaning\" of the terms used, within the meaning of Article 31(1) of the VCLT. However, the analysis of such references must always be carried out with great caution, ruling out automatic extrapolations. The invocation of the provisions of one treaty can only have an effect on the interpretation of another \u2013and thus such invocation be justified\u2013 to the extent that it is shown that there are specific and conclusive facts to raise them to the status of interpretative guidelines for the latter or to identify the intention of the respective contracting parties.\n* 431. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the same vein, the Parties have on countless occasions referred to international decisions, including arbitral decisions, in order to support their arguments and persuade the Tribunal. On some occasions the decisions have simply been referred to, on others they have been developed and analysed in great detail.\n* 432. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that in international law there is no doctrine of stare decisis. This Tribunal is independent of the tribunals that issued the decisions cited and there is no hierarchical subordination among them that could make the decision of one depend on the decisions adopted by others. Nevertheless, as a general principle, the Tribunal considers it desirable, to the extent that the circumstances of the case under analysis and the treaty at issue allow it, to encourage the development of a jurisprudence constante on the basis of previous decisions. This could provide some predictability to the disputing Parties and respond to an ongoing demand for more consistency within the international investment system, a demand rooted in the need to enhance its legitimacy. It is with this understanding that the Tribunal will base some of its findings on the content of other arbitral decisions that the Tribunal considers particularly persuasive.\n* 433. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The foregoing is by no means contradictory with the Tribunal's primary duty which is, undoubtedly, to render a decision regarding the dispute, based on all the specific factual and legal elements before it. Of course, the search for consistency based on a detailed analysis of previous decisions is, in many cases, unsuccessful. Logically, special care should always be exercised to determine the similarities or differences between the present case and those cases in which such previous decisions were adopted. The very fact that the Parties cite the same cases to propose opposing interpretations evidences the limits of the desire to have a consistent case-law within an absolutely decentralized system and reminds us to what extent the Tribunal should be careful about using case law.\n\n* ### B) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overview of jurisdictional issues\n\n* 434. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants present themselves as US investors holding, both directly and indirectly, shares of Integradora, which they have qualified as a covered investment under Article 1139 (b), (e) and (f) of the NAFTA. On the basis of Claimants' allegations, their shareholding in Integradora may be illustrated through the following diagram:\n* 435. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mexico has raised several objections regarding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In particular, Mexico has raised objections as to the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione personae and ratione materiae, as well as objections to Claimants' standing in relation to requirements in NAFTA's Articles 1116 and 1117.\n* 436. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal is aware of the very broad terms upon which NAFTA defines investors and protected investments, which requires an attentive and careful analysis of its jurisdiction to hear this case. NAFTA's Article 1139 defines the term \"investor of Party\" as \"a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.\"245 An investment is defined by the same provision as follows:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an enterprise;\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an equity security of an enterprise;\n* (c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a debt security of an enterprise (i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or (ii) where the original maturity of the debt security is at least\n\nthree years, but does not include a debt security, regardless of original maturity of a state enterprise;\n\n* (d) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a loan to an enterprise (i) where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or (ii) where the original maturity of the loan is at least three years, but does not include a loan, regardless of original maturity, to a state enterprise;\n* (e) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise;\n* (f) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of that enterprise on dissolution, other than a debt security or a loan excluded from subparagraph (c) or (d).246\n\n* 437. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1139 provides a further qualification of an investment, by noting that the term \"investment of an investor of a Party\" is to be understood as \"an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party.\"247\n* 438. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one can observe from the aforementioned provisions, the dimensions ratione personae and ratione materiae of the Tribunal's jurisdiction are inextricably interconnected under the NAFTA. In other words, the qualification of investor depends on whether or not a national or enterprise of a Party other than that of the host State can show to have made a covered investment which is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by said national or enterprise.\n* 439. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This arbitration has been initiated by 27 different claimants against Mexico, for alleged acts and omissions committed by Mexico in relation to the shares they allegedly held in Integradora. Claimants argue that they qualify as US protected investors as they have held shares, both directly and indirectly, in Integradora before the alleged acts and omissions of Mexico began interfering with their investment.248\n* 440. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within this framework, in order to ascertain its jurisdiction over Claimants' claims, the Tribunal must preliminarily assess whether Claimants qualify as nationals of a NAFTA party other than Mexico (C), and if they have made a covered investment under NAFTA, which is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by them (D). Then, the Tribunal must establish whether Claimants have standing to bring their claims under Articles 1116 and 1117 the NAFTA (E).\n\n* ### C) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants' nationality\n\n* 441. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are 13 individuals who appear as Claimants litigating exclusively under Article 1116 of the NAFTA, namely Alicia Grace, Carolyn Grace Baring, Diana Grace Beard, Frederick Grace, Frederick Warren, Gary Olson, Genevieve Irwin, Gerald Parsky, John Irwin III, Nicholas Grace, Oliver Grace, Robert Witt, and Virginia Grace.\n* 442. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All these individuals have proven to be citizens of the United States of America.249\n* 443. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are 12 legal entities that appear as Claimants litigating exclusively under Article 1116 of the NAFTA, namely Ampex Retirement Master Trust, Apple Oaks Partners LLC, Brentwood Associates Private Equity Profit Sharing Plan, Cambria Ventures LLC, Floradale Partners LLC, Frederick J. Warren IRA, Genevieve T. Irwin 2002 Trust, Gerald L. Parsky IRA, ON5 Investments LLC, Rainbow Fund LP, Robert M. Witt IRA, and Vista Pros LLC.\n* 444. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All these 12 legal entities have proven to be constituted under laws of the United States of America.250\n* 445. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No dispute arises in relation to the nationality of the above individuals and legal entities. The situation is not the same in relation to the remaining individuals and entities that appear as Claimants in this arbitration.\n* 446. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, two Claimants, namely the estate of Mr. Carlos Williamson-Nasi and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ca\u00f1edo White, advance claims under NAFTA's Article 1116 on their own behalf, as well as under NAFTA's Article 1117 on behalf of certain entities.\n* 447. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The estate of Mr. Williamson-Nasi's claims under NAFTA's Article 1117 are submitted on behalf of Axis Services, Axis Holding, Clue and F. 305952.\n* 448. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's claims under NAFTA's Article 1117 are submitted on behalf of Axis Services, Axis Holding, Clue and F. 305952.\n* 449. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Williamson-Nasi, who passed away in the course of this arbitration,251 was a citizen of Colombia, Mexico and the United States of America.252 His estate is represented by Ms. Maria Clara Lloreda Gomez, the surviving spouse of Mr. Williamson-Nasi, who granted a new power of attorney in favour of Claimants' counsel to represent Mr. Williamson-Nasi's estate in this arbitration and to continue to advance claims on behalf of Mr. Williamson-Nasi's estate.253\n* 450. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent raised certain concerns regarding the fact that no further explanation has been given as to the current situation of Mr. Williamson-Nasi's estate,254 but it did not formulate any specific objections concerning the representation of Mr. Williamson-Nasi's estate in this arbitration. In the view of the Tribunal, this specific issue does not represent an obstacle to assess the quality of investors of Mr. Williamson-Nasi or Mr. Willianson-Nasi's estate under the NAFTA.\n* 451. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White is admittedly a Mexican national,255 but is currently a United States of America permanent resident.256\n* 452. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Axis Services, Axis Holding, Clue and F. 305952 have all been constituted under Mexican law,257 for which reason they will be jointly referred as the \"Mexican Enterprises.\"\n* 453. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that, as a matter of principle, Mexico has not objected to the right of individuals to bring claims on behalf of the Mexican Enterprises under NAFTA's Article 1117. Rather, Mexico questions Messrs. Williamson-Nasi's and Ca\u00f1edo White's concrete ability to bring claims under NAFTA's Article 1117, for they would have failed to prove ownership and control of the Mexican Enterprises.258\n* 454. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before addressing this matter, the Tribunal must first address a further objection raised by Mexico, concerning the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione personae in relation to Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White.\n* 455. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues that Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White are Mexican nationals, for which reason they would not qualify as protected investors under the terms of the NAFTA.259\n* 456. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal understands that two questions must be answered in relation to this objection, i.e., (i) whether a permanent resident of a given NAFTA Party enjoys a similar level of investment protection to that of NAFTA nationals, and (ii) whether dual nationals may bring claims under NAFTA against one of the States of their nationality.\n* 457. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question to be answered concerns Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's simultaneous status as a US permanent resident and Mexican national. Claimants are of the view that Article 201 of the NAFTA would inform the interpretation of the Chapter Eleven notions of nationality, a provision establishing inter alia that, unless otherwise specified, \"national means a natural person who is a citizen or permanent resident of a Party [\u2026].\"260\n* 458. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This understanding coincides with that espoused by the United States, for whom \"[the] express terms of the NAFTA provide that both citizens and permanent residents of a Party 'may submit' a claim to arbitration on behalf of themselves (Article 1116) or an eligible enterprise of another Party (Article 1117) alleging such other Party breached a NAFTA obligation.\"261\n* 459. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal sees no great difficulty in relation to Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's status as US permanent resident, considering that his status as a permanent resident in the United States, under Article 201 of the NAFTA, is to be equated to the status of a US national. This means that, for the purposes of this arbitration, Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's status is analogous to that of a dual national holding simultaneously Mexican and US citizenship.\n* 460. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within this framework, the key element the Tribunal must assess is to what extent, if at all, a dual national may bring claims under the NAFTA against one of the States of their nationality. In clearer terms, can Messrs Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White proceed against Mexico as US nationals, regardless of their Mexican citizenship?\n* 461. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its 1128 Submission, Canada affirms that NAFTA contains a diversity of nationality rule, pursuant to which NAFTA's Articles 1116 and 1117 rely on the concept of \"investor of a Party\" bringing a claim against \"another Party.\"262 For this reason, \"a claimant, whether bringing a claim on their own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise that the claimant owns or controls, cannot be of the same nationality of the Party against which the claimant brings a claim.\"263\n* 462. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States arrives at a similar conclusion through a different reasoning. Notably, the United States submits that, considering that Article 1131(1) requires NAFTA tribunals to decide disputes in accordance with \"applicable rules of international law,\" this means that \"a State is not responsible for a claim asserted against it by one of its own nationals.\"264\n* 463. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recognized that the ability of dual nationals to bring investment claims is a controversial and delicate topic in investment arbitration, which must always take into account the terms of the relevant investment treaty. Consequently, the decision of the Tribunal in the present instance must not be read as an abstract and generalizable precedent, but rather as an application of the NAFTA provisions in light of the VCLT, and in coordination with the UNCITRAL Rules.\n* 464. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also important to stress that the case law referred to by the Parties in support of their positions demonstrate that investment tribunals have not dealt with the standing of dual nationals consistently, and some of these decisions did not aim to establish a general principle on the matter. This is the case of the Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas arbitration tribunal, which arrived at its decision upon a concrete analysis of the treaty practice involving Spain and Venezuela with regards to dual nationals. The specificity of this ruling is made clear in the following passage:\n\nThe fact that Venezuela has signed BITs with certain States in which it excluded from their application the nationals of both signatory countries and others in which it did not do so, shows that the exception to its application was always made expressly and as long as it was not part of reciprocal commitments of the signatories of the respective BITs.\n\nFor the same reason, the circumstance that in the vast majority of the BITs signed by Spain (including the BIT) in the period 1990 - 2000, protection for dual nationals had not been excepted (except in a treaty in which this solution was not adopted), shows that the denial of the benefit of the Treaty must be expressly stated in its text so that its application prevails as part of the reciprocal commitments assumed by the signatory States of the BIT.265\n\n465. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal also notes that, in the same context of the Spain-Venezuela BIT involving a claim submitted by members of the Garc\u00eda Armas family against Venezuela, another arbitral tribunal expressly deviated from the approach taken by the Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas tribunal. Notably, the Manuel Garc\u00eda Armas tribunal held inter alia the following:\n\nFinally, for the reasons set out above, in this Award, the Tribunal radically differs from the proposition accepted by the tribunal in the case Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela that BITs are not subject to the application of customary international law. By definition, every treaty is governed by general or customary international law, as has also been explained above.266\n\n466. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other instances, even when the decisions referred to by the Parties intended to make general statements concerning the impact of general international law on the standing of dual nationals, no definitive or consensual position can be found. It suffices to compare, for instance, the approaches of the Bahgat tribunal and that of the Heemsen tribunal, respectively quoted by Claimants and Respondent. While the first held that:\n\n[t]he Tribunal cannot discern from relevant jurisprudence any clear, applicable general principle of international law that would prohibit a dual national in his or her private capacity from bringing a claim against a State of his or her nationality pursuant to an investment treaty,267\n\nthe second considered that:\n\n[a]pplying by analogy the contemporary international law of diplomatic protection to investment arbitration, it would have to be considered that only the dual national who is more foreign than national can claim, that is, the investor whose dominant and effective nationality is not that of the State against which he claims.268\n\n* 467. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, NAFTA's Article 1120 provides a deliberate choice to investors allowing them to submit their claims under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and the UNCITRAL Rules.269 It is for this reason that Claimants argue that \"[g]iven that the NAFTA does not have a textual bar on claims by dual nationals and allows claims under the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal may not read new prohibitions into the UNCITRAL Rules nor into the NAFTA itself.\"270\n* 468. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal recognizes that the UNCITRAL Rules do not contain any restriction on claims submitted by dual nationals, which stands in contrast to the approach of the ICSID Convention. Still, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the UNCITRAL Rules were adopted in the context of international commercial arbitration, which could potentially explain why it did not address matters pertaining to dual nationality. Conversely, the ICSID framework was drafted and implemented as a specialized arbitration regime governing disputes between governments and private parties, which is arguably a more eloquent indication of States' intentions in relation to jurisdictional issues pertaining to dual nationality. That said, the mentioned elements per se do not provide a sufficiently solid ground to ascertain the standing of dual nationals under the NAFTA.\n* 469. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the text of Articles 1116 and 1117, these provisions establish that \"an investor of a Party\" is allowed to submit claims for breaches of NAFTA obligations by \"another Party.\" This formula is presented by Respondent as suggestive of a diversity of nationality rule, which would foreclose jurisdiction whenever a claimant holds the nationality of the respondent State. Such conclusion is, however, not convincing because, even if a claimant holds the nationality of the respondent State, it fulfils the only required rule of holding the nationality of another contracting party.\n* 470. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such situation does not pose much of a problem in a regular context where an individual holds only one nationality. The diversity of nationality requirement becomes a much more complicated issue when, as it is the case at hand, a given claimant is a dual national of two NAFTA Parties. Still, the Tribunal is not convinced that the language in Articles 1116 and 1117, by itself, prohibits dual nationals from submitting claims against one of the States of their nationality.271\n* 471. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although dual nationality is not expressly dealt by the NAFTA, the Non-Disputing Parties concur that such issues are to be decided in light of the test of the dominant and effective nationality.272 As a consequence, the Tribunal understands that the Non-Disputing Parties are of the view that a dual national can submit a claim under the NAFTA to the extent that such a claim is presented against a NAFTA Party other than that of their dominant and effective nationality.273 This position is consistent with the stance maintained by Mexico, albeit subsidiarily, in this arbitration.274\n* 472. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal finds pertinent to stress the ILC commentary on its \"Draft conclusions on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties\", which expressed the following:\n\nSubsequent practice under article 31, paragraph 3 (b), must be conducted \"in the application of the treaty\". This includes not only official acts at the international or at the internal level that serve to apply the treaty, including to respect or to ensure the fulfilment of treaty obligations, but also, inter alia, official statements, regarding its interpretation, such as statements at a diplomatic conference, statements in the course of a legal dispute, or judgments of domestic courts; official communications to which the treaty gives rise; or the enactment of domestic legislation or the conclusion of international agreements for the purpose of implementing a treaty even before any specific act of applications takes place at the internal or at the international level.275 [emphasis added]\n\n* 473. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the concurring statements submitted by the Non-Disputing Parties in the course of this arbitration alongside the positions of Mexico regarding dual nationals are to be understood as subsequent practice for the purposes of Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT. In other words, the Tribunal takes note of the existing convergent position of the NAFTA Parties regarding the application of the dominant and effective nationality test to matters of dual nationality not expressly governed by the Treaty.\n* 474. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants are adamantly against the application of the dominant and effective nationality test in relation to the claims submitted by Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White.276 At the same time, Claimants express the concern that under the Respondent's interpretation of the NAFTA \"a person holding nationalities of two Treaty Parties [\u2026] would not be a national of either Party under any circumstances.\"277 The Tribunal considers that this is an unwarranted concern if one applies the dominant and effective nationality test, which has a long and well-established application in general international law and which, in the view of NAFTA Parties, is the applicable test within NAFTA context. Accordingly, in light of the common understanding of the NAFTA Parties regarding the application of the dominant and effective nationality test, the Tribunal finds compelling to proceed with its jurisdictional analysis within this framework.\n* 475. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the Tribunal holds the opinion that, pursuant to the subsequent practice of the NAFTA Parties expressing an agreement regarding the interpretation of matters of dual nationality, the NAFTA allows dual nationals to bring investment claims as long as they prove that their dominant and effective nationality is different from that of the Respondent State. Consequently, in the case at hand, the Tribunal must assess whether Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White have proven that their dominant and effective nationality is that of the United States.\n* 476. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal also considers important to stress that, regardless of notions of nationality and citizenship often being conflated, Article 201 of the NAFTA provides in no unclear terms that permanent residents are to be considered nationals for NAFTA purposes. Consequently, the analysis of the dominant and effective nationality of Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White is not automatically determined by the fact that he does not hold US citizenship. Indeed, the Tribunal is of the view that the dominant and effective nationality test serves the function of capturing factual realities beyond formal titles. Hence, facts must take precedence over formal qualifications.\n* 477. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Tribunal observes that the United States contended that the notion of the dominant and effective nationality does not apply to permanent residents, considering that \"the NAFTA's choice of terminology does not mean that permanent residents of one Party are to be considered 'nationals' of that Party for purposes of customary international law generally or, more specifically, with respect to cases of 'dual nationality.'\"278 For the Tribunal, however, this is an unwarranted statement, as Article 201 of the NAFTA puts permanent residents on par with nationals of the NAFTA Contracting Parties for the purposes of the Treaty.\n* 478. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal will now turn to the factual analysis concerning Mr. Williamson-Nasi's nationality (a), and then it will address the facts related to Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's nationality (b).\n\n* #### a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Williamson-Nasi's nationality\n\n* 479. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Williamson-Nasi acquired both US and Mexican citizenship by naturalization, respectively in 1989 and 2002.279 He described his Mexican naturalization as a result of pragmatic considerations, affirming that \"having citizenship would simplify the process of traveling into and out of M\u00e9xico.\"280\n* 480. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that Mr. Williamson-Nasi was born in Colombia in 1960 to a Colombian father and a US mother.281 In particular, his mother was a US citizen by birth and retained her US citizenship her entire life.282 He lived continuously in Colombia from birth until he was 18 years of age, when he spent six months in the United States on an exchange program.\n* 481. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At age 23, in 1983, Mr. Williamson-Nasi moved to New York City, acquiring the status of permanent resident in 1984.283 That same year, Mr. Williamson-Nasi married Ms. Mar\u00eda Clara Lloreda, a Colombian national, who became a US permanent resident around the same time when he acquired his US citizenship, that is, in 1989.284 She has been a US permanent resident ever since.285\n* 482. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Williamson-Nasi recognized that his three children were born in Mexico between 1995 and 2005, highlighting that \"each child was born in M\u00e9xico because our primary residence was in M\u00e9xico at the relevant times.\"286 Yet, all of them also hold US citizenship due to their having been born to a U.S. citizen.287 While his daughter lives exclusively in the United States, his two sons live between Mexico and the United States.288 In addition, Mr. Williamson-Nasi had four siblings, all of whom were either US citizens or US permanent residents with their primary residence in the United States.289\n* 483. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Williamson-Nasi stated that his primary residency was currently located in Miami, Florida, United States, not having any registered addresses in Mexico since 2019.290 Yet, he acknowledged that, from 1990 to 2019, his primary residence was in Mexico.291 In this period, according to Mr. Williamson-Nasi himself, he spent approximately 40% of the year in the United States, half of the year in Mexico, and a few weeks in other countries.292\n* 484. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From a financial perspective, Mr. Williamson-Nasi argued that the centre of gravity of his finances have always been the United States. He was a US taxpayer since 1984, had all his financial accounts domiciled in the United States and most of his personal investment portfolio was comprised of US and European securities.293\n* 485. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that Mr. Williamson-Nasi's situation is a very unusual one. He was a national of three States, and one could evidently select facts to demonstrate a closer or further relation to any of the three countries. In reality, the Tribunal is concerned that Mr. Williamson-Nasi may have attempted to distance himself from his Mexican nationality as a result of \"pragmatic considerations\", as his relocation to the United States suggests \u2013 a relocation that occurred almost one year after this arbitration was initiated.\n* 486. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conversely, he has openly admitted that Mexico was his primary residence for almost 30 years. All his three children hold Mexican citizenship and two of his sons admittedly live at least 50% of the year in Mexico. In fact, having lived 23 years in Colombia and 6 years in the United States, Mexico is by far the country where Mr. Williamson-Nasi spent most of his life.\n* 487. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Williamson-Nasi's allegation that \"[his] personal investment portfolio has always been primarily invested in American and European securities, and not in Mexican securities\" is unsubstantiated, with no document being offered that would allow the Tribunal to analyse how his finances were managed and structured. For instance, Mr. Williamson-Nasi could have offered recent tax returns from Mexico and the United States, which would serve to substantiate his allegation.\n* 488. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Tribunal is faced with the contradictory situation where Mr. Williamson-Nasi claims to have always limited his exposure to Mexican assets and to the Mexican economy, while appearing in this multi-million-dollar arbitration on behalf of four Mexican investment vehicles that claim to have controlled around 30% of the shares in a Mexican company (i.e. Integradora).\n* 489. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Mexico brought to the file a wealth of information and documents demonstrating that Mr. Williamson-Nasi, until very recently, continued to enjoy and exercise the rights connected with his Mexican nationality.294 Furthermore, Mexico has also brought to the Tribunal's attention that Mr. Williamson-Nasi omitted to mention the time he acted as advisor of the Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda of the Mexican Government during the tenure of Mr. Francisco Gil D\u00edaz \u2013 the uncle of Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White and father of Mr. Gonzalo Gil White. The time served by Mr. Williamson-Nasi in the highest echelons of Mexican Government is corroborated by documents introduced into the file by Mexico.295\n* 490. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, a selection of facts could point towards relatively strong links between Mr. Williamson-Nasi and the United States, and this could not be expected to be otherwise from someone who managed to acquire US citizenship through naturalization. However, the elements on the file indicate that the strength of his ties to Mexico were much more significant than those he entertained with the United States. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that, for the purposes of this arbitration, Mr. Williamson-Nasi's dominant and effective nationality was that of the United Mexican States.\n* 491. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the above, the Tribunal considers that it lacks jurisdiction ratione personae to hear the claims submitted by the estate of Mr. Williamson-Nasi under Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA.\n\n* #### b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's nationality\n\n* 492. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's situation is even clearer than that of Mr. Williamson-Nasi. While Mr. Williamson-Nasi could show a personal and family history indicative of a connection with the United States, the reverse is true in relation to Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White. During the Hearing, Respondent established a number of facts related to Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's deep running family connection with Mexico.\n* 493. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For instance, the Tribunal learned that Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's father was a prominent Mexican businessman, who had a central role in the organization of the 1970 Football World Cup in Mexico.296 His father's notoriety in the Mexican football milieu was such that there were attempts to change the name of the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City to Guillermo Ca\u00f1edo Stadium \u2013 a tribute to Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's father.297 The Tribunal also learned that Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's brother was the president of Am\u00e9rica Football Club,298 a well-known football club in Mexico.\n* 494. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal was also informed that Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White and his family are involved in the highest echelons of the Mexican political and business life. Mr. Francisco Gil D\u00edaz, Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's uncle, and the father of Mr. Gonzalo Gil White, served as Secretary of Finance from 2000 to 2006, as informed by Claimants themselves.299 Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White himself admittedly worked for the Mexican Government, including acting as advisor to Mexican officials during the negotiation of the NAFTA,300 and has occupied the highest offices in leading Mexican companies \u2013 such as chairman of the Group Televicentro, a subsidiary of the largest Mexican multi-media company Televisa.301\n* 495. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White was born in Mexico City in 1961, being a Mexican citizen by birth.302 From ages 13 to 14, Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White lived in the United States as a student. Then, he returned to Mexico, where he primarily lived until 2012. Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White highlighted that, during this time, he continuously travelled to the United States for summer and winter holidays.303 Four of his five siblings no longer live in Mexico, with only one left living in the country.304 Out of the four siblings who live abroad, two have recently acquired US citizenship and live in Miami.305 The Tribunal was not offered any further information concerning the citizenship or domicile of the remaining two siblings of Mr. Ca\u00f1edo who live outside Mexico.\n* 496. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's wife is a United States citizen, as are his two youngest children. He also has two adult sons and one adult daughter, all of whom are Mexican citizens.306 His adult daughter currently lives in the United States, where she is completing a doctoral degree.307\n* 497. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are certain elements in the file proving that Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White has strong connections with the United States. Yet, similarly to the analysis undertaken in relation to Mr. Williamson-Nasi, the Tribunal has to assess whether his links to the United States prevail over those to Mexico. In the present instance, the Tribunal considers that the centre of gravity of Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's personal and economic affairs has been based in Mexico for most of his life.\n* 498. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was born in Mexico and only moved to the United States when he was 51 years of age \u2013 he is currently 62 years old. He and his family have been deeply embedded in the economic, political and cultural life of the country, to an extraordinary and remarkable extent. His move to the United States is a recent one and, pursuant to his own account, he kept his status as a Mexican taxpayer until 2018.308 Although two of his siblings may have acquired US citizenship, these naturalizations occurred in 2016 and 2022 \u2013 both rather recently.309\n* 499. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White's dominant and effective nationality is that of the United Mexican States. Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae to hear the claims he presented under Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA.\n\n### D) The investment\n\n* 500. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is unquestionable that directly holding shares of an enterprise qualifies as a covered investment under NAFTA's Article 1139, so much so that Mexico does not challenge this conclusion.310 In fact, Mexico argues that \"14 of the 27 Claimants appear in the shareholder book of Integradora Oro Negro and, therefore, only those 14 are shareholders of the company.\"311\n* 501. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This quotation shows that Mexico does not challenge the shareholding of 14 Claimants, namely Ampex, Apple Oaks, Cambria, Axis Services, Floradale, Frederick J. Warren IRA, Brentwood, Mr. Olson, Genevieve T. Irwin 2002 Trust, Mr. Irwin, Gerald L. Parsky IRA, ON5, Rainbow Fund and Robert M. Witt IRA.312\n* 502. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, Mexico has questioned the Tribunal's jurisdiction in relation to Vista Pros, for \"Vista Pros ceased to be an investor of a Party by selling its shares to ON5 on 1 March 1 2017.\"313However, the Tribunal considers that Mexico's position is at odds with Article 1139, which defines an investor as the national of a Party \"that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.\"314 Hence, the only necessary element to assess is whether Vista Pros had made, sought to make or was making an investment at the time when the alleged breach took place.\n* 503. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal's understanding finds echo in NAFTA case law. For instance, the Mondev tribunal held that \"[t]o require the claimant to maintain a continuing status as an investor under the law of the host State at the time the arbitration is commenced would tend to frustrate the very purpose of Chapter 11.\"315 A similar understanding was adopted by the B-Mex tribunal, which held that \"Article 1116 does not require subsistence of the investment at the time a claim is submitted.\"316\n* 504. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants' claims can be traced back to alleged Treaty breaches taking place in November 2016.317 While the concrete assessment of the occurrence of the breaches is a matter that pertains to the merits of the dispute, for jurisdictional purposes the Tribunal can ascertain that Vista Pros did directly hold Integradora's shares at the time of the facts involved in Claimants' allegations.318\n* 505. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal further recognizes that the remaining individuals and entities above have proven to directly hold Integradora's shares at the time of the alleged treaty breaches, as can be observed in Oro Negro's shareholder's log.319\n* 506. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Tribunal establishes that Ampex, Apple Oaks, Cambria, Axis Services, Floradale, Frederick J. Warren IRA, Brentwood, Mr. Olson, Genevieve T. Irwin 2002 Trust, Mr. Irwin, Gerald L. Parsky IRA, ON5, Rainbow Fund, Robert M. Witt IRA and Vista Pros have made a covered investment under the NAFTA.\n* 507. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, Mexico raises a number of objections related to indirect shareholders of Oro Negro, especially with regards to Messrs. Warren, Parsky, Witt, Ms. Irwin and to the members of the Grace Family.320 Despite the particularities of the allegations put forward by Mexico in relation to each of these Claimants, the core element of the objection has to do with the fact that these individuals do not appear in the Integradora's shareholder log.\n* 508. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal, however, does consider that these individuals have proven to have a covered investment through their indirect holding of Integradora's shares. As already discussed,321 the terms of Article 1139 are unquestionably broad, including \"an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise.\"322 Furthermore, the same provision establishes that an \"investment of an investor of a Party\" is to be understood as \"an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party.\"323\n* 509. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, when a national of a NAFTA Party, even indirectly, holds \"an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise,\" then this must be considered as \"an investment of an investor of a Party.\" Such situation is, in this case, exactly that of indirect shareholders who have structured their investment through intermediary entities.\n* 510. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to having proven to be US nationals,324 the Tribunal notes that Mses. A. Grace, C. Grace, D. Grace, V. Grace, and Irwin, as well as Messrs. F. Grace, N. Grace, O. Grace, Warren, Parsky, and Witt have all proven to be indirect shareholders of Integradora, demonstrating a shareholding chain that can ultimately be traced back to Integradora's shareholder log.325 Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that they have proven to have made a covered investment for the purposes of NAFTA.\n* 511. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal observes that objections have also been raised to the indirect shareholding of Messrs. Williamson-Nasi and Ca\u00f1edo White. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to address these objections, for the Tribunal has already established that it lacks jurisdiction in relation to all claims submitted by these two individuals.\n\n* ### E) The Claimants' standing in relation to Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA\n\n* 512. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that, albeit vested under the cloak of an investment dispute, a great number of allegations articulated by Claimants in this arbitration are related to multiple private and corporate disputes between Integradora's shareholders amongst themselves, as well as between certain of Integradora's shareholders against the Bondholders who financed its operations \u2013and who came to control some of Integradora's subsidiaries (notably Oro Negro Drilling and the Singapore Rig Owners)\u2013.\n* 513. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These disputes have as its mains locus the insolvency proceedings before Mexican courts. In these proceedings, certain Oro Negro shareholders have raised doubts as to the proper management of the group. This is the case of Banamex, the fideicommissary of Mexican pensions funds holding the majority of Oro Negro's shares,326 who has filed a request asking a Mexican court to ascertain if acts in bad faith or other illegal acts were committed by Integradora's board and executives.327 Some of these executives have testified in this arbitration or appeared as Claimants.\n* 514. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This corporate dispute is also being litigated in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which has been filed on 20 April 2018 by the foreign representative of Oro Negro under chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code.328 This has given rise to a number of ancillary proceedings, such as the ones initiated by Mr. Gonzalo Gil White and others against Alp Ercil and others,329 Gonzalo Gil White and others against Contrarian Capital Management LLC and Nordic Trustee AS,330 Perforadora Oro Negro and others against AMA Capital Partners LLC and others,331 and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ca\u00f1edo White and others against Asia Research and Capital management Ltd. and others.332\n* 515. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, on 15 March 2018, the Singapore Rig Owners and Oro Negro Drilling, one of Integradora's subsidiaries and the Singapore Rig Owner's parent company, initiated proceedings against Perforadora in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. These proceedings were brought under the Bareboat Agreements and sought \"to recover five drilling vessels [the Oro Negro Rigs] wrongfully withheld by Defendant Perforadora Oro Negro.\"333\n* 516. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parallel proceedings were also initiated in Singapore by Oro Negro Drilling and the Singapore Rig Owners before the Singapore High Court.334 In these proceedings, Oro Negro Drilling and the Singapore Rig Owners sought interim measures against Messrs. Gonzalo Gil White and Alonso del Val Echeverr\u00eda in order to bar them from acting on their behalf before Mexican Courts.\n* 517. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering the existence of the above-mentioned parallel proceedings, the Tribunal is mindful of the risk of affecting the rights of third parties as a result of a ruling which allows Claimants' claims to proceed. Similarly, the Tribunal is very much aware that issuing a decision on the merits may be conducive to an incompatible and/or contradictory outcome with regards to the ongoing insolvency proceedings described previously. It is against this complex factual and legal context that the Tribunal conducts its analysis of Claimants' locus standi.\n* 518. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above,335 the interpretation of any provision in the NAFTA is subject to Article 31 of the VCLT.336 This rule sets forth three basic elements to be taken into account by interpreters, i.e., ordinary meaning, context, and object and purpose, which are to be considered under the aegis of good faith. In addition, a number of further considerations are to be equated to the notion of context or are expressly required to be considered alongside context. This is the case, for instance, of:\n\nAny subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\nand\n\nany subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation.337\n\n* 519. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The process of interpretation under the VCLT, pursuant to the ILC itself, is to be seen as \"a single and closely integrated rule,\"338 where none of the elements enumerated in Article 31 takes precedence over each other. Importantly, Article 32 authorizes the interpreter to have further recourse to supplementary means of interpretation in order to confirm meaning reached under Article 31, or whenever the interpretive process of Article 31 leaves meaning ambiguous or obscure.339\n* 520. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Claimants argue that \"NAFTA tribunals have overwhelmingly declined to adopt the restrictive interpretation of Articles 1116 and 1117,\"340 this Tribunal draws attention to the fact that the decisions relied upon by Claimants in relation to the NAFTA date back 15 years or more. In the meanwhile, investment treaty arbitration has greatly evolved, with the development of a heightened attention to the importance of the VCLT in the interpretation of investment treaties. This element is of considerable importance, for some of the decisions cited by Claimants have not always engaged in treaty interpretation in the manner provided by the VCLT. 341\n* 521. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not superfluous to remind that Article 31 of the VCLT is binding on investment tribunals. Accordingly, the starting point of any interpretation of Articles 1116 and 1117 ought to be the text of these provisions, which read as follows:\n\nArticle 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf\n\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A,\n\nand that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\n\nArticle 1117: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise\n\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A, and that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n* 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in paragraph 1 if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.\n* 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the investor or a non-controlling investor in the enterprise makes a claim under Article 1116 arising out of the same events that gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of the claims are submitted to arbitration under Article 1120, the claims should be heard together by a Tribunal established under Article 1126, unless the Tribunal finds that the interests of a disputing party would be prejudiced thereby.\n* 4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An investment may not make a claim under this Section.342 522. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These two provisions must be considered together, for they provide an immediate context to each other. Notably, the titles of Articles 1116 and 1117 already suggest a distinction between types of discrete claims that a Tribunal can hear, i.e., those brought by an investor on their own behalf and those brought by an investor on behalf of an enterprise.\n\n* 523. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, for the purposes of this arbitration, special attention is to be given to the first paragraph of both Article 1116 and 1117. Indeed, these are the provisions that have generated most debate in the course of this arbitration.\n* 524. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that both texts of Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) are worded in a very similar way. The two provisions cover breaches under Section A of Chapter 11 and certain breaches under Chapter 15 of the NAFTA (those referring to Articles 1502(3) and 1503(2) of the NAFTA). Furthermore, Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) include the concepts of \"investor of a Party\" bringing claims \"that another Party has breached an obligation.\" This Tribunal has already discussed the terms \"investor of a Party\" and \"another Party,\" as well as the diversity of nationality rule allegedly emerging thereof, and that reasoning would be applicable here mutatis mutandi.343\n* 525. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal further considers that Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) do not pertain to the merits of the dispute, but rather to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The provisions refer to the ability to bring a claim \u201cthat another Party has breached an obligation.\" Furthermore, the surrounding provisions, Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2), introduce time limitations to an investor's standing in light of the \"alleged breach.\" Considering these elements, the Tribunal is of the view that Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) regulate Claimants' standing to bring a claim. In that regard, to assess the Claimants' standing, the Tribunal need not ascertain if the alleged breach actually occurred. Rather, it may proceed on the basis of the allegations taken at face value. In other words, the Tribunal is required to consider if the claim filed can be subsumed into either Article 1116(1) or 1117(1) \u2013 which constitutes a purely jurisdictional analysis.\n* 526. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is, however, an important difference in the texts of Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1). While Article 1117(1) contains a clause regulating claims brought \"on behalf of an enterprise,\" Article 1116(1) contains no such element. It is here that resides the core of the dispute between the interpretations put forward by the Claimants, Respondent and Non-Disputing Parties.\n* 527. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More precisely, Article 1117(1) refers to claims \"on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly.\" There is a lot to unpack in that regard. First, the sentence indicates that an investor appears before the tribunal as a representative of the enterprise (\"on behalf of\"). Then, the enterprise is qualified as being \"of another Party,\" which introduces a diversity of nationality rule between the \"investor\" and the \"enterprise.\" Finally, the sentence requires the \"investor\" to own or control the \"enterprise,\" which can occur directly or indirectly. This last element creates all sorts of questions as to what amounts to control or ownership, but this analysis does not need to be pursued at this stage.\n* 528. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The distinction between the two types of claims also finds echo in the broader context of NAFTA Chapter 11, especially in light of Article 1135(2). Indeed, this provision establishes that any compensation or restitution under Article 1117(1) is to be awarded to the enterprise and not to the investor.344 This suggests yet again that Article 1117(1) could be a special case of representation, to the extent that eventual sums recovered are to be paid to the represented entity.\n* 529. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that the object and purpose of the NAFTA are not of much assistance in the interpretation of the provisions at hand, especially considering the very particular nature of the NAFTA. Indeed, this is an extraordinary multi-lateral treaty hardly comparable to an ordinary Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"BIT\"). While BITs usually aim at the promotion and protection of investment, the NAFTA was adopted as an instrument of regional economic integration. This macro-political goal is unfolded into several different objectives focused on promoting the circulation of economic factors such as goods, services and capital.\n* 530. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Tribunal must contemplate the provisions of Chapter 11, including Articles 1116 and 1117, in light of the host of goals geared towards economic integration in the North America region. Notably, the Tribunal cannot exclusively centre its attention on one single element of Article 102 of the NAFTA, as proposed by Claimants.345 That said, the Tribunal considers that nothing in the object and purpose of the NAFTA is particularly enlightening when it comes to assessing the meaning of Articles 1116 and 1117.\n* 531. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides these elements, the Tribunal draws attention to Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, requiring that the subsequent practice of the Contracting Parties be considered in the interpretation of Articles 1116 and 1117. Notably, it is undeniable that the NAFTA Parties have consistently espoused a convergent position regarding the interpretation of Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1). This has been made abundantly clear by the Non-Disputing Parties' submissions. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that, since the early 2000's, NAFTA Parties have consistently submitted before investment tribunals that Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) respectively cover (i) direct injuries to investors and (ii) indirect injuries to an investor caused by injury to a firm in the host country that is owned or controlled by the investor.346\n* 532. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers this well-established subsequent practice of the NAFTA Parties as a most persuasive and compelling element in the interpretation of Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1). Accordingly, it is the Tribunal's understanding that these provisions establish different rules regulating an investor's standing to bring a claim under NAFTA. On the one hand, Article 1116(1) concerns the capacity of investors to appear before a NAFTA tribunal advancing claims on their own behalf, i.e., articulating allegations of direct interference with their treaty rights. On the other hand, Article 1117(1) governs the capacity of investors to appear on behalf of a specific third party (the \"enterprise of another party\" that they \"own or control directly or indirectly\"), articulating allegations that the host State has breached any of the NAFTA provisions dedicated to the protection of investments specified therein.\n* 533. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should be stressed that neither municipal nor international law ordinarily allow someone to claim on behalf of third parties. Rather, one is only allowed to appear in court claiming on one's own behalf. In other words, Article 1117(1) constitutes a case of extraordinary locus standi, while Article 1116(1) constitutes a case of ordinary locus standi.\n* 534. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards shareholders' claims, these considerations allow the Tribunal to establish that Article 1116(1) governs the shareholder's right to present claims for direct interference of the State with its protected rights and interests (e.g., State actions that expropriate shares, interfere with the payment of dividends, affect voting rights, etc.). Furthermore, Article 1117(1) governs derivative claims that may be brought on behalf of an enterprise constituted in the host State by a shareholder that can prove ownership or control of said enterprise.\n* 535. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal is aware that NAFTA's Article 1139 includes direct and indirect shareholding within the meaning of investment347, and this has been acknowledged in this Award.348Nevertheless, demonstrating that an investor has a protected investment is not the sole jurisdictional criteria that the Tribunal ought to analyse under the terms of the NAFTA. Unlike other investment treaties, Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1) introduce distinctive jurisdictional avenues for submitting investment claims, which the Tribunal cannot brush aside.\n* 536. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Tribunal does not ignore that Article 1116(1)(b) refers to loss or damages in a broad and an unqualified manner, which has led Claimants to affirm that \"[t]here is simply no basis for reading into these provisions an additional restriction preventing investors from claiming 'reflective loss'.\"349 Similarly, the Tribunal has considered Claimants allegation that \"the Non-Disputing Parties submissions cannot form a 'subsequent agreement' for the purposes of the interpretation of the NAFTA \u2013 much less one that would modify the ordinary meaning of the text.\"350\n* 537. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, the Tribunal does not find Claimants' arguments persuasive. Indeed, the VCLT establishes an interpretive process that consists of a single and integrated operation, where ordinary meaning is one of the elements of interpretation. In such integrated process, the interpreter must enrich the ordinary meaning of the text with its context, object and purpose, as well as consider the elements expressed in Article 31(3) \u2013 and each of these elements must be given the appropriate weight in light of the circumstances of the case.\n* 538. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requirement to have \"incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\" exists in both Articles 1116(1)(b) and 1117(1)(b). Yet, those requirements cannot mean the same or encompass the same type of loss or damages, for it would be illogical to have two provisions with exactly the same legal implications.\n* 539. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, given that the States are the masters of the Treaty, it would be a perilous undertaking to disregard the consistent and longstanding subsequent interpretive practice of the NAFTA Parties with regards to Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1). Although the Free Trade Commission had the prerogative to issue a binding interpretation of the NAFTA,351 in no way such power undermines the interpretive force of a subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation. As it was observed above, the ILC's \"Draft conclusions on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties\" has made clear that statements in the course of legal disputes qualify as subsequent practice falling under article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT.352\n* 540. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Tribunal, making use of its prerogative to have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation to confirm the meaning of the terms used in Articles 1116 and 1117, a prerogative provided for in Article 32 of the VCLT, refers to the Statement of Administrative Action submitted to the United States Congress in 1993 describing measures to be taken for the implementation of the NAFTA. The document contains a contemporaneous and official account of a NAFTA Party in relation to Articles 1116 and 1117, which states the following:\n\nArticles 1116 and 1117 set forth the kinds of claims that may be submitted to arbitration: respectively, allegations of direct injury to an investor, and allegations of indirect injury to an investor caused by injury to a firm in the host country that is owned or controlled by the investor.353\n\n* 541. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Tribunal is of the view that Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA consist of two different rules of locus standi, one regulating allegations of direct interference with investors' rights and the other regulating allegations of indirect interference with said rights. That said, such rules in and of themselves will not necessarily impact the damages that may or may not be recovered at the end of the proceedings, which is a question that pertains to the merits of the dispute. Furthermore, the Tribunal must caution against extrapolating its conclusions beyond the confines of the NAFTA, for Articles 1116 and 1117 have been the object of a very particular and enduring interpretive practice between the NAFTA Parties, by applying these concrete provisions, which are not present in the majority of the treaties.\n* 542. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now turning to the claims submitted, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Ca\u00f1edo White and the Estate of Mr. Williamson-Nasi are the only Claimants that have submitted claims under Article 1117 of the NAFTA.354 Yet, it has already been decided that the claims advanced by these two individuals do not fall under the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.355\n* 543. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remaining Claimants have put forward claims under Article 1116 of the NAFTA against measures that indirectly affected their rights.356 That is to say, the allegations of State\n\ninterference are purely indirect, for Claimants attribute to Mexico a series of wrongdoings committed against Oro Negro and its officers. As expressed above, Article 1116(1) is not the appropriate avenue to submit these types of claims under the NAFTA. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that Claimants' claims cannot proceed under Article 1116(1).\n\n* 544. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, Claimants do not control or own Integradora, so they could not (and they formally have not) submit a claim on behalf of Integradora under Article 1117(1). Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that Claimants' claims cannot proceed under Article 1117(1) either.\n* 545. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the above, the Tribunal declares that it lacks jurisdiction to hear all of Claimants' claims.\n\n### 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion\n\n546. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has found that it lacks jurisdiction with regards to all of Claimants' claims. The Claimants' claims are accordingly dismissed in their entirety.\n\n### VIII. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0COSTS\n\n* 547. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1135(1) of NAFTA provides that a \"tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\"\n* 548. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award\" and specifies that the term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n* (a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n* (b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n* (c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n* (d) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n* (e) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n* (f) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n* 549. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The UNCITRAL Rules, in its Article 40, further establish that \"the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party,\" while also providing that \"the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\"357\n* 550. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The UNCITRAL Rules grant the Tribunal considerable discretion in its appreciation of the reasonable apportionment of costs of the arbitration, expressly authorizing cost allocation to be modulated by the particular circumstances of each case. Within this framework, the Tribunal will now proceed to fix and then allocate the costs of this arbitration.\n* 551. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal observes that, on 25 September 2022, the Parties agreed to distinguish in their respective costs submissions four categories of expenses incurred, i.e., attorneys' fees, expert fees and related expenses, ICSID payments, and additional arbitration related expenses.\n* 552. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties submitted their Statements of Cost on 11 November 2022.\n* 553. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants informed that they incurred a total of USD 27,837,106.11 for the presentation of their case, which includes attorneys' fees, expert fees and related expenses, ICSID payments, and additional arbitration related expenses.358\n* 554. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent informed that it had incurred a total of USD 1,873,564.35 for the presentation of their defence, which includes attorneys' fees, expert fees and related expenses, ICSID payments, and additional arbitration related expenses.359\n* 555. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal draws attention to the fact that this arbitration was administered by ICSID upon agreement of the Parties.360 In this regard, ICSID has informed that administrative fees and expenses amount to USD 504,810.02.\n* 556. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fees and expenses of the Tribunal amount to USD 1,085,667.04\n* 557. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the above, the Tribunal fixes the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses at USD 1,590,477.06:\n\n  |  |  |\n  | --- | --- |\n  | Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses | |\n  | Prof. Diego F. Arroyo | USD 528,989.90 |\n  | Prof. Andr\u00e9s Jana | USD 294,306.30 |\n  | Mr. Gabriel Bottini | USD 262,370.84 |\n  | ICSID\u2019s Administrative Fees | USD 262,000.00 |\n  | Direct expenses | USD 242,810.02 |\n  | Total | USD 1,590,477.06 |\n* 558. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, the Tribunal turns to the apportionment of costs in this arbitration.\n* 559. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants and Respondent have both made requests that the other party be ordered to pay all costs and expenses in this arbitration.361\n* 560. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal holds in this award that it lacks jurisdiction to hear all of Claimants' claims. Consequently, for the purposes of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have been the unsuccessful party in this arbitration.\n* 561. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, the Tribunal draws attention to a relevant circumstance of the case, which will be taken into account in the apportionment of costs.\n* 562. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the document production phase of this arbitration, Respondent failed to produce a series of documents ordered by the Tribunal.362 At that moment, the Tribunal did not accept Respondent's justifications as to its impossibility to produce said documents.363 Yet, Respondent proceeded to ignore the Tribunal's order on the basis of the same arguments already rejected.\n* 563. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, even if those documents were not relevant for the final outcome of the case, the Tribunal considers Respondent's behaviour as a sanctionable procedural misconduct and will make use of its discretion in the reasonable allotment of costs to sanction Respondent's violation of the Tribunal's orders.\n* 564. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the Tribunal determines that each Party has to bear the costs they have respectively incurred as per Article 38(d) and (e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, excluding the fees and expenses incurred by the Tribunal as well as those incurred by ICSID in its capacity as administering authority. With regards to the costs set out in \u00a7 557, which include the fees and expenses incurred by the Tribunal and those incurred by ICSID in its capacity as administering authority, the Tribunal determines that Claimants shall bear 75% of those costs, which amounts to USD 1,192,857.8; and Respondent shall bear the remaining 25% of those costs, which amounts to USD 397,619.3.\n* 565. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that the fees and expenses of the Tribunal as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.364 Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimants to pay the Respondent USD 397,619.3 for the expended portion of Respondent\u2019s advances to ICSID.\n\n### IX. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DECISION 566. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously renders the following decision:\n\n* (1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction with regards to all of Claimants' claims; and\n* (2) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants shall bear 75% of the costs fixed in \u00a7557, which amounts to USD 1,192,857.8. Respondent, for its part, shall bear 25% of the costs fixed in \u00a7557, which amounts to USD 397,619.3. Accordingly, the Claimants shall pay the Respondent USD 397,619.3 for the expended portion of Respondent\u2019s advances to ICSID. Each Party shall bear its own fees and expenses.\n\nPlace of Arbitration: Toronto, Canada\n\n[Signed]\n\n  \n\n[Signed]\n\nAndr\u00e9s Jana Linetzky Arbitror\n\nDate: July 24, 2024\n\nGabriel Bottini\n\nArbitror\n\nDate: July 15, 2024\n\n[Signed]\n\nDiego P.
