The Scope of Consent under the NAFTA\n---------------------------------------\n\n*a) General Aspects*\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe State Parties to the NAFTA (the \"Parties\") agreed that compliance with certain procedural steps is necessary for a tribunal to have jurisdiction over \"a claim for loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, [a] breach\".1 A tribunal has no authority to consider a claim over which it lacks jurisdiction, whether for failure to meet procedural prerequisites or otherwise, nor to consider an amended claim that brings into consideration matters outside its jurisdiction.2\n\nNAFTA arts. 1116 & 1117(1).\n\nNAFTA arts. 1120(1). *See*, ICSID Convention art. 46 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1) (allowing for incidental or additional \"*provided that* they are within the scope of the consent of the parties\" (emphasis added)).\n\n3.\n\nUnder the NAFTA, an agreement to arbitrate is formed by the consent given by each State Party \"to submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement\" and the investor's corresponding consent to arbitrate in accordance with those procedures.3 The exchange of consents contemplated by Chapter 11 constitutes agreement to arbitrate under the ICSID (and other) Convention(s).4\n\nNAFTA arts. 1122(1), 1121(1)(a), & 1121(2)(a).\n\nNAFTA art.1122(2).\n\n4.\n\nNAFTA Article 1122(1) also makes clear that the *content* of such agreement under Chapter 11 includes the procedural prerequisites for submitting a claim to arbitration.5 The Parties have also agreed, and tribunals have concurred, that no Chapter 11 claim may be submitted unless the prerequisites for submitting a claim to arbitration specified in the NAFTA have been satisfied.6\n\n*See,* NAFTA art. 1122(1) (providing that consent is \"in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement\").\n\n*See,* Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States, ARB(AF)/98/2 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (June 2, 2000) (Award) (CL-0007-ENG) (concluding that NAFTA tribunals must ensure the fulfillment of the prerequisites of Chapter 11).\n\n5.\n\nIn my view, the Parties did not consent, through the NAFTA, to the automatic supplementation of the scope of arbitration unless the procedural prerequisites of Chapter 11 are satisfied for any incidental or additional claim.\n\n*b) The Parties' Intention*\n---------------------------\n\n6.\n\nPO No. 7 disregards the highly institutionalized system of arbitration under the NAFTA and, with that, the fundamental conditions for Respondent's consent to arbitrate a claim. The majority makes a far-reaching inference from the Parties not \"explicitly\" excluding Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 in the NAFTA.7 Under the majority's reading of the treaty, the Parties *intended* to allow incidental or additional claims by investors without first satisfying the procedural steps contemplated in the NAFTA.\n\nPO No. 7 \u00b6 116.\n\n7.\n\nNAFTA Art. 1120(2) is a gap-filling provision that gives prevalence to the rules of procedure in the treaty *vis-\u00e0-vis* the applicable arbitration rules. If the treaty is silent on a particular issue, it does not follow that a tribunal can leave without effect that the Parties conditioned their consent for any \"claim for loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, [a] breach\" to the application of rules and procedures to adjudicate investment disputes, including Arts. 1118 to 1121.8 Rather, the Parties excluded incidental or additional claims by establishing mandatory steps for submitting *any* claim asserted by a claimant at any point, as argued by the Respondent.9\n\n*See,* Methanex Corporation v. United States of America, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, \u00b6 120 (RL-070) (listing the necessary requirement of consent to arbitration, including the satisfaction of \"all pre-conditions and formalities required under Articles 1118-1121\" and concluding that when the \"requirements are met by a claimant, Article 1122 is satisfied; and the NAFTA Party's consent to arbitration is established.\")\n\nResponse \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\n8.\n\nIf the majority was interested in what the Parties intended, it could have used the means at the Tribunal's disposal under the treaty (*e.g.,* Art. 1128 submissions on a question of interpretation) or under the VCLT (*e.g.*, Art. 31(3)).10 Instead, reading the provisions of the NAFTA out of their context, the majority decides to exercise jurisdiction, to allow the Claimant to circumvent important procedural stages and, with that, to deny strategic decisions to the Respondent (such as the appointment of an arbitrator) for the new claim.\n\n*See*, USMCA art. 14.D.3 (C-0157-ENG) (providing that \"[a] claim asserted by the claimant *for the first time after [the] notice of arbitration is submitted* shall be deemed submitted to arbitration\u2026\" and conditioning claimant's submitting any claim to arbitration to the satisfaction with procedural prerequisites (emphasis added)).\n\n*c) The Procedural Prerequisites*\n---------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nPO No. 7 also asserts that the procedural prerequisites of Chapter 11 are automatically \"covered by compliance with those requirements in relation to the original claim\".11 The NAFTA does not give tribunals the power to disregard admissibility or jurisdictional requirements. The majority's importation of all procedural prerequisites to the new claim does exactly that. Even if the ancillary claim *were* within the scope of the consent of the parties, such automatic coverage does not logically follow from the admission of the application and raises important policy concerns.12\n\nPO No. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 119 & 149.\n\n*See,* Methanex Corporation v. United States of America, UNCITRAL, Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, (Aug. 3, 2005), \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (Part II, Ch. F) (RL-020-ENG) (expressing concerns and rejecting to construct a waiver under Chapter 11 to include \"future [measures] still to be [adopted].\") *See also*, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) (allowing preliminary objections against ancillary claims for lack of jurisdiction and competence of the tribunal).\n\nII. The Subject-Matter of the Dispute under the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe majority concludes that \"it is not feasible to separate the subject-matter\" of the claims mainly because \"the ancillary claim refers to actions and assessments\" of Respondent's federal environmental authority \"relevant to the arguments made\" in two (out of three) original claims.13 This is a low bar and disregards the fact that the additional claim arises directly out of a different measure adopted by the Respondent years after the measures in the original claims and relates to a different, self-sufficient investment. Moreover, the additional claim is made on a distinct legal and factual basis and has a particularized damages claim by reason of, or arising out of, a new alleged breach.14\n\nPO No. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 137-138.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90 & 92; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 31 73, 74-76.\n\n11.\n\nSimilarly, other considerations do not justify the majority's conclusion. In disputes under arbitration systems that contain well-functioning procedures to consolidate common and related claims, a tribunal should be sensitive to questions of fairness in applying Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40.15 In particular, a tribunal should consider that a party might be denied strategic choices by reopening the proceedings and admitting a new claim bypassing procedural steps. In such a context, like here, \"efficiency\", \"procedural economy\" and limiting the risk of \"conflicting decisions\" do not outweigh the unfairness towards the Respondent.16\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*See,* NAFTA art. 1126(2) (requiring consolidation tribunals to consider fairness in deciding applications).\n\nPO No. 7 \u00b6\u00b6 138, 146 & 149.\n\n12.\n\nAccordingly, I *dissent* from the decision to allow Legacy Vulcan to present an ancillary claim concerning Mexico's alleged wrongful shutdown of Legacy Vulcan's remaining quarrying operation in Mexico. I *concur* in all other decisions listed in paragraph 160 of PO No. 7.\n\nDate: 11 July 2022"}], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 7\n----------------------\n\n**I.** **I****ntroduction**\n---------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 May 2022, Claimant filed its Requests for Provisional Measures and for Leave to Submit an Ancillary Claim (\"**Application**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, Respondent filed its Response to Claimant's Requests for Leave to Submit an Ancillary Claim and to Grant Provisional Measures (\"**Response**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 2 June 2022, Claimant filed its Reply to Respondent's Response to its Request for Provisional Measures and for Leave to Submit an Ancillary Claim (\"**Reply**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 7 June 2022, Respondent filed its Rejoinder to Claimant's Requests for Leave to Submit an Ancillary Claim and to Grant Provisional Measures (\"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 9 June 2022, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide (i) their comments on whether the Parties' respective submissions may be deemed to be applications pursuant to paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 to admit the documents listed in the index to each of the above referred submissions; and (ii) any observations on whether such documents should be admitted to the record.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Parties' comments, on 20 June 2022 the Tribunal decided that (i) the Parties' respective submissions dated 8 and 26 May and 2 and 7 June 2022 are deemed to be applications pursuant to paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 to admit the documents listed in the index to each of the above-referred submissions; and (ii) those documents listed in each index should be admitted to the record, at this stage for the limited purpose of deciding on Claimant's requests of 8 May 2022, pending such decision.\n\n7.\n\nOn 22 June 2022, the Parties filed the documents in the indices to their submissions in accordance with the Tribunal's directions in \u00b6 6 above.\n\n8.\n\nIn this Procedural Order, the Tribunal will decide upon Claimant's Application, taking into account the detailed written submissions provided by the Parties which the Tribunal has carefully reviewed. To the extent any arguments put forward are not specifically referred to in this Order, they are to be considered subsumed in the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**II.** **R****elevant** **R****ules**\n--------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nAs reflected in Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1, these proceedings are conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, except to the extent that they are modified by Section B of NAFTA Chapter Eleven. In that respect, NAFTA Article 1120(2) provides that \"The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Section.\"\n\n10.\n\nNAFTA Article 1134 is entitled \"Interim Measures of Protection\" and states as follows:\n\nA Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.\n\n11.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n12.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n13.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Rules is entitled \"Provisional Measures\" and states as follows, in part:\n\n*(1)* At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n*(2)* The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n*(3)* The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n*(4)* The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n....\n\n14.\n\nRule 40 of the ICSID Rules is entitled \"Ancillary Claims\" and further provides:\n\n(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its observations thereon.\n\n15.\n\nFor convenience, in this Procedural Order the Tribunal uses the term \"provisional measures\" as referred to in the ICSID Rules. The Tribunal notes that NAFTA Article 1134 uses the term \"interim measures\", which the Tribunal considers to be interchangeable for present purposes.\n\n**III.** **R****equests**\n-------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIn its Application and as confirmed in its Reply, Claimant requests that the Tribunal:1\n\n*i.* Recommend as provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and NAFTA Article 1134 that Mexico take no action that denies due process to Legacy Vulcan or that might further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, including further public attacks that exacerbate the dispute between the Parties, unduly pressure CALICA or Legacy Vulcan, or render the resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult;\n\n*ii.* Permit Legacy Vulcan to present an ancillary claim concerning Mexico's wrongful shutdown of Legacy Vulcan's remaining quarrying operations in Mexico under a schedule to be discussed with Respondent and the Tribunal;\n\n*iii.* Order Respondent to pay all costs and expenses related to this additional claim, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of legal representation, plus interest thereon; and\n\n*iv.* Grant such other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the applicable law or that may otherwise be just and proper.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 51; Reply, \u00b6 63.\n\n17.\n\nIn its Response, Respondent requests the Tribunal to:2\n\n(i) desestimar la Solicitud de Medidas Provisionales presentada por la Demandante,\n\n(ii) desestimar la Solicitud para incorporar una nueva reclamaci\u00f3n presentada por la Demandante, y\n\n(iii) ordenar a la Demandante a pagar los costos y gastos en los que ha incurrido a ra\u00edz de estas Solicitudes, incluidos los honorarios y gastos del Tribunal, del personal del CIADI involucrado en la administraci\u00f3n del procedimiento y la representaci\u00f3n legal de la Demandada, m\u00e1s los intereses correspondientes.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 168.\n\n18.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent further requests the Tribunal to:3\n\n...desestimar en su integridad las Solicitudes de la Demandante.

This account is not comprehensive. The Tribunal sets out these events for the purposes of giving context to and deciding upon the requests made in the Application based on the materials on the record at this time, and not for other purposes.\n\n20.\n\nAs of 31 January 2022, Claimant argues that the President of Mexico Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador began referring to CALICA in his *Ma\u00f1aneras* (daily press conferences). One of his remarks on 31 January 2022 included:4\n\n... Como no se les ampli\u00f3 la concesi\u00f3n porque estaban incumpliendo, bueno, violando, destruyendo el territorio, se fueron a una denuncia internacional, y est\u00e1n pidiendo una indemnizaci\u00f3n, no s\u00e9, de millones de pesos, o sea, que todav\u00eda nosotros les tenemos que pagar.\n\n[E]n esa mina, que es una de las propuestas que les estamos haciendo, como ya escarbaron, el agua aqu\u00ed es turquesa por la piedra, entonces, con un poco de imaginaci\u00f3n y de talento se podr\u00eda utilizar como zona tur\u00edstica, casi albercas naturales, buscando un acuerdo, pero que ya no se siga destruyendo y que retiren su demanda, porque no tiene fundamento legal.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 13. *See also* Application, \u00b6 16.\n\n21.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the President's declarations in the press conference in relation to CALICA's extractive activities were observations derived from a flight in relation to a public investment project referred to as \"*el tren maya*\", located next to the CALICA properties. During this flight, the President noted exploitation in the CALICA lots, without being able to identify in which lot the extraction had taken place.5 According to Respondent, in his press conference the President indicated that it would be clarified if the extraction observed during the flight was being carried out in compliance with legislation, by way of an inspection and in accordance with procedures established by law.6\n\nResponse, \u00b6 61.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 62.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 April 2022, Respondent states that PROFEPA (*Procuradur\u00eda Federal de Protecci\u00f3n al Ambiente*) issued two inspection orders in relation to La Rosita, scheduled for 2 May 2022, in relation to (i) environmental impact; and (ii) forestry.7\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Claimant, on 2 May 2022 President L\u00f3pez Obrador criticized CALICA during his morning press conference and stated that he had ordered the immediate shutdown of CALICA's remaining quarrying operations in La Rosita.8 By Claimant's account, later the same day Mexican officials forcibly entered the premises of La Rosita.9 According to Respondent, the environmental authorities carried out preparatory work for this visit, which was derived from the orders of 29 April 2022 (see \u00b6 22 above) and not the orders of the President that same day.10\n\nApplication, \u00b6 6.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32; Rejoinder, \u00b6 43.\n\n24.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the circumstances of the inspection, including whether CALICA was required to cooperate and give PROFEPA access to La Rosita, and the basis for the presence of SEMAR at the site, *i.e*., federal agents of the *Secretar\u00eda de Marina*.11\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 33-37; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.\n\n25.\n\nAlso on 2 May 2022, Claimant filed an *amparo* proceeding, seeking the provisional suspension of the government's enforcement of Respondent's shutdown order.12 According to Respondent, this *amparo* 431/2022 was initially only requested in relation to El Corchalito and La Adelita, and not La Rosita.13 Claimant disagrees with Respondent's interpretation of the scope of this *amparo* proceeding, which in its view covered La Rosita as well.14\n\nApplication, \u00b6 10.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 52.\n\nReply, \u00b6 14.\n\n26.\n\nOn 3 May 2022, Respondent states that CALICA gave access to PROFEPA's inspectors, who carried out an inspection visit of 3 days, concluding on 5 May 2022.15 At the conclusion of the inspection, according to Respondent there were various findings that presupposed environmental non-compliance. PROFEPA imposed a \"total temporary closure\" on the basis of risk to natural resources.16 The technical findings by PROFEPA are, by Respondent's account, a preventive and not definitive measure, and are open in an administrative proceeding in Mexico.17\n\nResponse, \u00b6 38.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 39.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 40.\n\n27.\n\nOn 5 May 2022, a federal district court issued provisional suspension orders pending a decision on the *amparo* 431/2022 referred to in \u00b6 25 above.18 Respondent states that this suspension was only granted in respect of El Corchalito and La Adelita, and not La Rosita.19 Claimant disagrees.20\n\nApplication, \u00b6 10.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\nReply, \u00b6 14.\n\n28.\n\nAlso on 5 May 2022, Claimant states that PROFEPA ordered the shutdown of CALICA's quarrying operations, on the basis of (i) an alleged lack of environmental authorization to carry out quarrying and processing activities in La Rosita; (ii) an alleged lack of Authorization for Soil-Use Change in Forested Terrains (*Autorizaci\u00f3n de Cambio de Uso de Suelo en Terrenos Forestales*, \"CUSTF\"); and (iii) alleged harm to the environment as a result of CALICA's activities.21\n\nApplication, \u00b6 11.\n\n29.\n\nRespondent states that Claimant attempted to expand its request in *amparo* 431/2022 to include La Rosita, and on 9 May 2022 the federal judge denied CALICA's request, citing the lack of identity or relation of La Rosita with the El Corchalito and La Adelita lots, and ordered CALICA to commence separate *amparo* proceedings.22\n\nResponse \u00b6 54.\n\n30.\n\nAdditional factual matters will be discussed in the context of the discussion below.\n\n**V.** **P****rovisional** **M****easures**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal shall set out the Parties' respective positions in relation to the provisional measures sought by Claimant, before determining whether those measures will be granted.\n\n**A. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n32.\n\nIn Claimant's view, the applicable rules set out in \u00b6\u00b6 10-13 above give the Tribunal broad discretion whether to grant provisional measures.23 Claimant disagrees that NAFTA Article 1134 excludes the application of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rules on this point.24\n\nApplication, \u00b6 20; Reply, \u00b6 46.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.\n\n33.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the criteria generally accepted for awarding provisional measures are: (i) the tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to grant the requested measures, (ii) the absence of provisional measures will irreparably impair or harm a claimant's rights, and (iii) the provisional measures are urgently needed to prevent such impairment. Claimant further submits that the measures it requests will not disproportionately prejudice Respondent.25\n\nApplication \u00b6 22.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the events mentioned in its Application demonstrate Respondent's decision to aggravate the Parties' dispute. In its view, Respondent's conduct continues to threaten Claimant's rights to procedural due process and non-aggravation of the dispute, requiring the Tribunal's urgent intervention.26\n\nApplication, \u00b6 18.\n\n35.\n\n*Prima facie jurisdiction.* Claimant submits that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to grant the provisional measures because its request relates to a legal dispute between Respondent and Claimant, and arises directly out of CALICA's investments in Mexico, which are protected under the Treaty. In Claimant's view, the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent in these proceedings are not relevant to the Application.27\n\nApplication, \u00b6 23.\n\n36.\n\n*Irreparable harm.* Claimant contends that its procedural rights will be irreparably impaired by Respondent's harassment and public attacks against Claimant and CALICA, on the basis that Claimant has the right to proceed through arbitration without having the dispute aggravated, exacerbated or extended by the other party, and without having resolution of the dispute made more difficult.28\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. *See also* \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n\n37.\n\nThe necessity of the measures is established, in Claimant's view, because: (i) Respondent has ignored an order of its own judiciary that would have provisionally preserved CALICA's ability to continue operating its investment;29 (ii) Respondent's public disparagement of CALICA's operations as illegal may pave the way for further pressure on CALICA, for example through criminal proceedings against company officials;30 (iii) Respondent's public attacks during repeated press briefings are severely prejudicial to Claimant and CALICA and risk irreparable injury to their reputation and ability to continue operations in Mexico;31 and (iv) Respondent's actions threaten Claimant's ability to pursue this arbitration, due to specific public remarks regarding this arbitration which Claimant sees as an effort to strong-arm it into forfeiting its rights and to compel CALICA to transform its operation into a tourism project.32 In its Reply, Claimant further refers to (v) the threatened revocation of both CALICA's customs permit and port concession.33\n\nApplication, \u00b6 30.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 30.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 33; Reply, \u00b6 55.\n\nReply, \u00b6 45.\n\n38.\n\n*Urgency.* Claimant submits that provisional measures are urgent, in the sense that it will otherwise suffer imminent harm or harm that would arise before the award is rendered.34 In its view, the ongoing and escalating public remarks by Mexico's President have prompted Mexican agencies to take unjustified actions to shut down CALICA's remaining operations, have severely damaged Claimant's and CALICA's reputation in Mexico, and threaten to render null part of Claimant's relief sought in this arbitration.35 According to Claimant, the rhythm and speed of the actions taken by Mexico mean that the measures cannot wait until the final Award.36\n\nApplication, \u00b6 35.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 36 ; Reply, \u00b6 58.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 37.\n\n39.\n\n*Proportionality*. Claimant contends that the provisional measures requested are proportionate and would not cause any harm to Respondent. In its view, Claimant's right to non-aggravation of the dispute is compelling, while Respondent lacks a compelling reason to continue public attacks against Claimant and CALICA.37\n\nApplication, \u00b6 39; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n40.\n\nRespondent opposes Claimant's request for provisional measures. Respondent asserts that NAFTA Article 1134 has modified the procedural rules contained in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 39, excluding their application by virtue of NAFTA Article 1120(2) (see \u00b6 9 above).38\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 140, 141.\n\n41.\n\nRespondent emphasises that provisional measures are extraordinary and should not be granted lightly.39\n\nResponse, \u00b6 139.\n\n42.\n\nIn light of the statement in NAFTA Article 1134 that \"[a] Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117\", Respondent denies that the Tribunal's discretion to grant provisional measures is broad.40\n\nResponse, \u00b6 140.\n\n43.\n\nAccording to Respondent, five standards apply to determine whether a tribunal should recommend provisional measures: (i) *prima facie* jurisdiction of the tribunal; (ii) identify a right susceptible of being affected and demonstrate a *prima facie* claim; and prove that the provisional measures are (iii) necessary; (iv) urgent and (v) proportionate.41\n\nResponse, \u00b6 142; Rejoinder, \u00b6 96,\n\n44.\n\n*Prima facie jurisdiction*. While the Respondent does not dispute the Tribunal's power to recommend provisional measures in principle, Respondent argues that it is not competent to recommend the measures sought by Claimant, because the facts that Claimant refers to concern a new claim that Claimant attempts to pass off as an ancillary claim but which has no relation to the original claims.42\n\nResponse, \u00b6 143.\n\n45.\n\n*Procedural right affected*. In Respondent's view, the dispute before the Tribunal is not susceptible of being aggravated because the acts referred to in the Application have no relation with that dispute. According to Respondent, Claimant's right to the protection of due process is limited to due process in this arbitration.43\n\nResponse, \u00b6 149.\n\n46.\n\n*Urgency*. Respondent contends that provisional measures are only urgent when they cannot await the outcome of the award.44 Respondent denies that there is necessity or urgency for the provisional measures, *inter alia* on the basis that (i) the shutdown of La Rosita is not irregular but was in accordance with the applicable legal procedure; (ii) the harm alleged by Claimant is speculative in that it refers to non-existent criminal proceedings against company officials; (iii) the premise that Respondent has erected operational barriers to Claimant's investment in Mexico is false; (iv) there is no hindrance to relief in this case, which can be resolved by the Tribunal without the measures.45\n\nResponse, \u00b6 156; *citing, inter alia*, **RL-134**, C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention*, 2nd ed. CUP (2009), pp. 775-776.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 160; Rejoinder, \u00b6 56. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 104.\n\n47.\n\n*Necessity*. Respondent submits that a measure is necessary when it will protect the affected party from a clear and substantial risk of irreparable harm.46 According to Respondent, Claimant has not identified with precision its right that is necessary to protect.47 Citing ICJ jurisprudence which has been relied on by other arbitral tribunals, Respondent further contends that the \"irreparable prejudice\" to be suffered is a very high legal standard.48 Respondent submits that Claimant has failed to prove serious risk or irreparable harm, taking into account that (i) due process has already been guaranteed at all times and only the award is outstanding; (ii) due process is also afforded under national law; and (iii) Claimant's rights are fully protected and Respondent has not ignored an order of its own judiciary, contrary to Claimant's assertion.49\n\nResponse, \u00b6 152; *citing, inter alia*, **CL-184**, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, Order 6 September 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 152.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 153; *citing*, *inter alia*, **CL-177**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation y Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador*, Decision on provisional measures, 17 August 2007, \u00b6 59; **RL-133**, *CEMEX Caracas Investments B.V. and CEMEX Caracas II Investments B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* Decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, 3 March 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 38-43, 55-56.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 154-155; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 36, 101.\n\n48.\n\nRespondent further questions Claimant's account of the events relevant to the Application, on the basis that (i) PROFEPA acted within the scope of its powers to protect the environment and verify compliance with environmental obligations; and (ii) Claimant fails to mention that the President's declarations in the press conferences are limited to the negotiation process that is carried out in parallel to the arbitration.50\n\nResponse, \u00b6 18; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 32, 35, 48, 57.\n\n49.\n\nRespondent further submits that CALICA is guaranteed due process and domestic legal remedies. It will have the opportunity to bring proof to clarify or disprove the findings of the environmental authority in order to reverse its determination and potentially lift the closure, or have it overturned in a national court. In this sense, Respondent argues that CALICA has not exhausted its internal procedures related to the acts and measures taken in La Rosita, and in fact several proceedings challenging these acts are in progress.51 Respondent further identifies at least two different appeal proceedings available to be filed by CALICA against the determinations of the environmental authorities.52 As such, in Respondent's view Claimant's actions in the arbitration procedure are premature.53\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47-50, 54, 57. *See also* \u00b6 135.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 56.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 72; Rejoinder, \u00b6 93.\n\n50.\n\n*Proportionality*. Respondent argues that proportionality requires the Tribunal to balance the harm caused or imminent to Claimant and the possible effect that the provisional measure may cause to Respondent.54 In Respondent's view, the provisional measures would be disproportionate in that (i) the measures refer to facts that are not related to Claimant's original claims; (ii) none of the acts have affected the status quo of the facts originally examined by the Tribunal; (iii) Claimant has been afforded due process in all proceedings; and (iv) there is a risk that the proceedings continue indefinitely, due to parallel Mexican proceedings.55\n\nResponse, \u00b6 163.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 166.\n\n**C. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal will determine whether to grant Claimant's request for provisional measures, taking into account the Parties' positions as summarised above and as set out in their respective submissions. The Tribunal will first consider its power to recommend provisional measures, before turning to the relevant criteria, and finally deciding whether the Tribunal should make the recommendation sought.\n\n***(i) The Tribunal's Power to Recommend Provisional Measures***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal has the power to order provisional measures as set out in NAFTA Article 1134 (see \u00b6 10 above). The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's argument that NAFTA Article 1134 excludes the application of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 39, which equally govern the Tribunal's power to award such measures. In this respect, NAFTA Article 1120(2) provides that \"[t]he applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Section.\"\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no inconsistency between NAFTA Article 1134, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules with respect to provisional measures and no aspect of NAFTA Article 1134 that would require or imply the exclusion of those applicable rules. Accordingly, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 39 apply together with any modifications in NAFTA Article 1134.\n\n54.\n\nNotably, NAFTA Article 1134 includes a specification that \"[a] Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117\" (see \u00b6 10 above). The Tribunal considers this to circumscribe the Tribunal's power under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention to \"recommend any provisional measures\" (see \u00b6 12 above).\n\n***(ii) The Criteria for Recommending Provisional Measures***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nNAFTA Article 1134 provides that provisional measures may be recommended \"to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction...\" It further provides that \"[a] Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117\" (see \u00b6 10 above).\n\n56.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that the Tribunal may recommend provisional measures \"to preserve the respective rights of either party\", \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\" (see \u00b6 12 above).\n\n57.\n\nICSID Rule 39 sets out the procedure for consideration of a request for provisional measures, including that such a request \"shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures\" (see \u00b6 13 above).\n\n58.\n\nThe above provisions reflect the Tribunal's broad discretion in considering a request for provisional measures, as long as such measures do not enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach of NAFTA in the proceedings.\n\n59.\n\nIn terms of the specific criteria to be applied by the Tribunal to determine whether it should exercise such discretion, having examined the relevant rules and the criteria put forward by the Parties, which do not differ greatly (see \u00b6\u00b6 32 and 43 above), the Tribunal considers the criteria to include: (i) the *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal; (ii) a specific right to be preserved; (iii) necessity of the measures to prevent irreparable harm, including the proportionality of the measures; and (iv) urgency.\n\n60.\n\nWith regard to Respondent's submission that Claimant must also identify a *prima facie* claim with respect to its request for provisional measures,56 the Tribunal is not persuaded that this criterion is relevant to the present case. In any event, at this late stage of the proceedings the Tribunal considers that Claimant has made out a *prima facie* claim with respect to its requests for relief put forward to date, without prejudging the merits of such requests.\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 142.\n\n61.\n\nIn terms of the gravity of a recommendation of provisional measures, Respondent emphasizes that it is an exceptional remedy, not to be lightly granted. The Tribunal concurs with Respondent and with the view expressed by the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* that provisional measures are an extraordinary measure which should not be recommended lightly.57\n\n**CL-184**, *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order on Provisional Measures, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38.\n\n62.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the gravity of granting a recommendation for provisional measures is built into the criteria set out in \u00b6 59 above, in the sense that the requesting party must establish the necessity, urgency and proportionality of the provisional measures. The establishment of these elements ensures that provisional measures are not to be granted lightly. Provisional measures are granted where the Tribunal considers necessary, for the important purpose of maintaining the integrity of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal shall examine the relevant criteria in order to determine whether to exercise its discretion to recommend the provisional measures sought by Claimant.\n\n***(iii) Whether the Tribunal Should Recommend Provisional Measures***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal recommend (see \u00b6 16 above):\n\nthat Mexico take no action that denies due process to Legacy Vulcan or that might further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, including further public attacks that exacerbate the dispute between the Parties, unduly pressure CALICA or Legacy Vulcan, or render the resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider (i) the *prima facie* jurisdiction of the Tribunal, before turning to (ii) whether there is a specific right to be protected; (iii) the necessity of the measures to prevent irreparable harm, including the proportionality of the measures; and (iv) urgency.\n\n66.\n\n*Prima facie jurisdiction*. The Tribunal finds that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction for the purposes of considering the request for provisional measures. In this respect, Claimant's request concerns the rights of the disputing Parties to this arbitration. Subject to the Tribunal's considerations below with respect to the specific rights to be preserved, the Tribunal also finds that the requested measures relate to Claimant's investment in Mexico.\n\n67.\n\nRespondent objects that the Tribunal is not competent to recommend provisional measures regarding a measure that does not form part of the original claim.58 The Tribunal considers it more appropriate to discuss this issue at \u00b6 95 below. For present purposes, the Tribunal finds that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction to grant the measures which generally relate to the disputing Parties and Claimant's investment.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 133. *See also* Response, \u00b6 145; Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\n68.\n\n*Specific right to be protected*. ICSID Rule 39 provides that a party may request provisional measures for the preservation of its rights, and such a request must \"specify the rights to be preserved\" (see \u00b6 13 above). Likewise, NAFTA Article 1134 (see \u00b6 10 above), and Article 47 of the ICSID Convention (see \u00b6 12 above) refer to the preservation of the rights of a disputing party.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that an arbitral tribunal may only grant provisional measures if there are substantive and procedural rights that should be protected and preserved until the tribunal renders its award.59 As is clear from the above provisions, the right to be protected must relate to the arbitration proceeding. This necessarily entails a connection to the requesting party's claims and requests for relief in the arbitration.60\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 150.\n\n*See also* **CL-184**, *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order on Provisional Measures, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\n70.\n\nImportantly for present purposes, the requested provisional measures must relate to the existing claims before the Tribunal. While Claimant has made a request to introduce an ancillary claim in this arbitration, that request is being decided by the Tribunal in this Procedural Order No. 7, and no specific requests for relief have yet been made in relation to that claim. For the purposes of examining the specific rights to be protected, the Tribunal therefore takes into account the requests for relief made to date by Claimant in its prior submissions in this arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nAs Respondent has noted, Claimant's prior claims and requests for relief in this proceeding are directed at CALICA's La Adelita and El Corchalito lots, as well as port fees associated with the port at Punta Venado.61 Claimant makes an alternative request for relief as follows:62\n\nGiving Respondent the option to pay less than the full amount ordered above for items (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) if Mexico's instrumentalities, (x) within three months from the issuance of the Award, were to amend the POEL to expressly allow quarrying operations by CALICA in La Adelita, *and* (y) immediately close all administrative and judicial proceedings against CALICA arising out of the inspection of El Corchalito, allowing CALICA to resume operations normally with no penalties to CALICA or any of its affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents, advisors or other representatives (collectively, the \"Settlement Measures\"), in which case Respondent shall pay the damages effectively incurred up to the performance of the Settlement Measures;\n\n*See* Claimant's Memorial dated 18 May 2020 (\"**Memorial**\"), \u00b6 347; Reply, \u00b6 288.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 347(e); Reply, \u00b6 288(e).\n\n72.\n\nIn its Application, Claimant requests protection of its right to non-aggravation of the dispute, including procedural due process (see \u00b6 64 above). Contrary to Respondent's assertion, the Tribunal considers this request to be readily identifiable from Claimant's submissions on the Application.63\n\n*See* Application, \u00b6 25; Reply, \u00b6 51.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the tribunal in *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia* that the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute are self-standing rights vested in any party to ICSID proceedings.64\n\n**CL-185,** *Churchill Mining PLC v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14 on Procedural Measures, \u00b6 71 (22 December 2014).\n\n74.\n\nClaimant argues that the right to non-aggravation includes the right to due process.65 The Tribunal agrees, while confirming Respondent's view that the due process in question is Claimant's right to due process in this arbitration.66 As such, a recommendation that would purport to relate to due process to be granted in domestic administrative or legal proceedings, without connection to this arbitration, would be beyond the purview of this Tribunal.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 27; Reply, \u00b6 51.\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 149.\n\n75.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal will examine whether the provisional measures requested by Claimant are necessary to protect Claimant's right to non-aggravation of the dispute and procedural due process, specifically with respect to the dispute presently before the Tribunal as reflected in Claimant's requests for relief to date.\n\n76.\n\n*Necessity, irreparable harm and proportionality*. Claimant's request for provisional measures is founded on multiple alleged circumstances (see \u00b6 37 above), including:\n\n(i) Respondent has ignored an order of its own judiciary that would have provisionally preserved CALICA's ability to continue operating its investment, instead arbitrarily and unjustifiably shutting down CALICA's remaining operations;67\n\n(ii) Respondent's public disparagement of CALICA's operations as illegal may pave the way for further pressure on CALICA, for example through criminal proceedings against company officials;68\n\n(iii) The threatened revocation of CALICA's port concession;69\n\n(iv) The threatened revocation of CALICA's customs permit;70\n\n(v) Respondent's public attacks during repeated press briefings are severely prejudicial to Claimant and CALICA and risk irreparable injury to their reputation and ability to continue operations in Mexico;71 and\n\n(vi) Respondent's actions threaten Claimant's ability to pursue this arbitration, due to specific public remarks regarding this arbitration which Claimant sees as an effort to strong-arm it into forfeiting its rights and to compel CALICA to transform its72 operation into a tourism project.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 30; Reply, \u00b6 45\n\nApplication, \u00b6 30.\n\nReply, \u00b6 45.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 45.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 33; Reply, \u00b6 55.\n\n77.\n\nBased on the materials presented to the Tribunal for the purpose of deciding on the Application, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the risk of irreparable harm in relation to item (i) in \u00b6 76 above has been made out. Specifically, while the Tribunal does not find any misrepresentation by Claimant, there is insufficient evidence that Respondent has ignored a decision of its own judiciary that would have provisionally preserved CALICA's ability to continue operating its investment. The Tribunal observes that the Parties disagree on the scope of application of the court order in question,73 and at least one Mexican court has issued an order that would appear to contradict Claimant's argument that the order on which it seeks to rely covered CALICA's La Rosita lot.74 In addition, Claimant has insufficiently established a connection to its relief requested to date in these proceedings (see \u00b6 71 above).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 134; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Rejoinder, \u00b6 37.\n\n*See* **R-131**, *Juzgado S\u00e9ptimo de Distrito en el Estado de Quintana Roo, Amparo Indirecto* 431/2022, *Acuerdo*, 9 May 2022, p. 2.\n\n78.\n\nWith respect to the risk of criminal proceedings in item (ii) of \u00b6 76 above, the alleged harm remains speculative at this time, since no such proceedings have been initiated. The same applies to the alleged threatened revocation of CALICA's port concession in item (iii) of \u00b676.\n\nReply, \u00b6 53.\n\n79.\n\nAs for the potential revocation of Claimant's customs permit (item (iv) of \u00b6 76 above), Respondent confirms that proceedings for the suspension and cancellation of CALICA's export permit are underway.75 While Claimant's export permit is undoubtedly of relevance to its investment in Mexico, to issue provisional measures with respect to ongoing proceedings before the Mexican authorities would be a very serious matter. The Tribunal declines to do so based on the materials before it and at this stage.\n\n80.\n\nIn relation to item (v) of \u00b6 76 above, Claimant refers to the public remarks made by the President L\u00f3pez Obrador, which in its view affect the ability of CALICA and Claimant to resume operations and cause injury to their reputations across Mexico.76 According to Respondent, a risk to reputation cannot be a basis for provisional measures because it is not a procedural right related to the integrity of the proceedings, nor is it a right in dispute.77\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 99. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 102, 105.\n\nReply, \u00b6 53.\n\n81.\n\nThe Mexican President's public remarks are also the basis for item (vi) of \u00b6 76 above, which Claimant sees as an effort to strong-arm it into forfeiting its rights and to compel CALICA to transform its operation into a tourism project.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that a risk to Claimant's reputation is not, as such, a right to be protected by way of provisional measures, since it is not a right in dispute before the Tribunal. However, public remarks regarding ongoing arbitration proceedings by the disputing parties may impact upon the integrity of the proceedings and have the potential to aggravate the dispute.\n\n83.\n\nIn this respect, the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* noted:78\n\nIt is self-evident that the prosecution of a dispute in the media or in other public fora, or the uneven reporting and disclosure of documents or other parts of the record in parallel with a pending arbitration, may aggravate or exacerbate the dispute and may impact upon the integrity of the procedure. This is all the more so in very public cases, such as this one, where issues of wider interest are raised, and where there is already substantial media coverage, some of which already being the subject of complaint by the parties\n\n**CL-188**, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3 on Provisional Measures, 29 September 2006, \u00b6 136.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs that the parallel prosecution of an ongoing dispute in public fora may exacerbate the dispute before the Tribunal. The Tribunal recognizes the value of public dissemination of information about an ongoing arbitration proceeding under NAFTA, as also recognized in the form of various transparency measures under NAFTA. The importance of public access to information is consistent with the need to ensure the integrity of the arbitral proceedings. At the same time, this Tribunal is mandated to decide upon the Parties' dispute and must ensure the integrity of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal expresses its concern that public statements by President L\u00f3pez Obrador made specifically in relation to this arbitration are likely to aggravate the Parties' dispute. In particular, on 31 January 2022 the President remarked in his press briefings (see also \u00b620 above):79\n\n... Como no se les ampli\u00f3 la concesi\u00f3n porque estaban incumpliendo, bueno, violando, destruyendo el territorio, se fueron a una denuncia internacional, y est\u00e1n pidiendo una indemnizaci\u00f3n, no s\u00e9, de millones de pesos, o sea, que todav\u00eda nosotros les tenemos que pagar.\n\n... en esa mina, que es una de las propuestas que les estamos haciendo, como ya escarbaron, el agua aqu\u00ed es turquesa por la piedra, entonces, con un poco de imaginaci\u00f3n y de talento se podr\u00eda utilizar como zona tur\u00edstica, casi albercas naturales, buscando un acuerdo, pero que ya no se siga destruyendo y que retiren su demanda, porque no tiene fundamento legal.\n\n**C-176**, Transcript of President's Morning Press Conference, 31 January 2022, p. 22.\n\n86.\n\nIn addition, on 1 February 2022, the President stated:80\n\nLo mismo en el caso del muelle, tenemos que llegar a un acuerdo y ya se est\u00e1 viendo... . Pero, adem\u00e1s, demandan al Gobierno de M\u00e9xico, quieren no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1ntos millones de d\u00f3lares, porque no respetan ninguna ley, ning\u00fan contrato.\n\n**C-177**, Transcript of President's Morning Press Conference, 1 February 2022, p. 16.\n\n87.\n\nIt should be noted that the above statements clearly refer to these pending arbitration proceedings, and therefore to Claimant's existing claims before the Tribunal. The Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent's suggestion that these facts are unrelated to the original claims made by Claimant.81\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 136, 137, 146.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the President's declarations take place in the context of a negotiation between the President and high officials of Claimant.82 Claimant disputes the assertion that the President's statements are limited to informing the public about recent negotiations.83 The fact of ongoing negotiations between the Parties does not alter the Tribunal's duty to ensure the integrity of the proceedings. Nor does it justify public comments such as those set out at \u00b6\u00b6 85-86 above in relation to the merits of the dispute currently before this Tribunal.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 65. *See also* Response, \u00b6 67\n\nReply, \u00b6 9.\n\n89.\n\nThe fact of the late stage of the arbitration proceedings does not, in the Tribunal's view, render this provisional measure less necessary or lessen the harm suffered to the aggravation of the dispute.84\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 148.\n\n90.\n\nNor is it relevant that the President's declarations are made at press conferences for public communication purposes and are not an administrative act.85 To cause irreparable harm, it is not necessary that aggravation of the dispute modifies Claimant's or CALICA's legal situation.86\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 70.\n\n91.\n\nAs part of its analysis on necessity, the Tribunal must also consider the proportionality of the provisional measure, *i.e.*, to balance the respective harms caused to the Parties by granting or refraining from a recommendation.87 The Tribunal in *Caratube II v. Kazakhstan* found this to require that measures are \"appropriate\", including \"not to unduly encroach on the State's sovereignty and activities serving public interests\".88 Respondent submits that provisional measures granted against a sovereign State put it at a disadvantage to an investor, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances.89\n\n*See* **CL-178**, *Quiborax S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 158.\n\n**RL-125**, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP & Mr.* *Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, 4 December 2021, \u00b6 121.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 165.\n\n92.\n\nState sovereignty in respect of activities serving public interests is an important consideration which has been given due weight by the Tribunal. The Tribunal considers that a recommendation made in relation to public comments about the dispute and disputing parties pending before this Tribunal does not unduly encroach on Respondent's sovereignty or interfere in the exercise of public authority. In particular, the wording of the Tribunal's recommendation is limited to what is necessary to maintain the integrity of these proceedings and not more.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that public comments made by Mexico's President on Claimant's claims and damages sought in these proceedings jeopardise the integrity of the arbitral process and are tantamount to prosecution of the dispute in the media and other public fora, contrary to the non-aggravation of the dispute. Such harm is irreparable, in the sense that it cannot be compensated by damages. Subject to its considerations on urgency below, the Tribunal therefore finds it necessary to issue a recommendation in relation to this item.\n\n94.\n\nLikewise unhelpful to the resolution of this dispute is the resort to armed forces for the purposes of entering CALICA's premises*,* and other disparaging public comments by the President in press conferences with respect to Claimant and CALICA, which appear to refer to CALICA's operations as a whole, including the La Adelita and El Corchalito lots.90\n\n*See,* e.g., **C-196**, Transcript of President's Morning Press Conference, 25 May 2022, pp. 16, 17; **C-168**, Transcript of President's Morning Press Confernece, 2 May 2022, p. 14.\n\n95.\n\nIn their submissions on the Application, the Parties have addressed at length the actions taken by Mexican authorities in relation to CALICA's lot La Rosita. The factual matters associated with the Application are highly disputed between the Parties, including the legal basis for actions taken by the Mexican authorities with respect to La Rosita.91 As already noted, the Tribunal's recommendation of provisional measures is based on the requests for relief made to date in this arbitration, which do not include claims with respect to La Rosita. While it cannot be excluded that actions taken with respect to La Rosita would be relevant for the non-aggravation of the dispute, for the purposes of this decision on provisional measures, the Tribunal does not consider is necessary or appropriate to address ongoing administrative and legal proceedings in relation to La Rosita which are the subject of the ancillary claim.92 Indeed, Claimant has not made any request that the Tribunal issue a recommendation with respect to such proceedings, beyond its general request for due process and non-aggravation. It suffices to note that based on the materials presented and at this time, the Tribunal does not consider that the actions taken by Mexican authorities pursuant to applicable law are an aggravation of the dispute before this Tribunal.\n\n*See,* e.g., Response, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 24-25, 41; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10-12; Rejoinder, \u00b6 6, 34, 40-42, 46-52. 6, 40-42.\n\n*See,* e.g., Response, \u00b6\u00b6 22-29, 45; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44-45, 57, 62-65.\n\n96.\n\n*Urgency*. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that \"[t]he condition of urgency is met when the acts susceptible of causing irreparable prejudice can 'occur at any moment' before the Court makes a final decision on the case...\"93 On the other hand, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary that a matter concerns a case of imminent execution of persons condemned to death in order to be considered urgent.94 The type of urgency will depend on the matter under consideration in any particular case.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 159; *quoting* **RL-137**, *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v. Myanmar)*, Decision(s) of the Court, International Court of Justice, 23 January 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6 158; *citing* **RL-136**, *LaGrand Case (Germany v. United States of America)*, ICJ, Order, 3 March 1999, \u00b6 26.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal considers its recommendation in \u00b6 93 above to be urgent, in the sense that the acts susceptible of causing irreparable prejudice have already occurred and, in the absence of the Tribunal's recommendation, may continue to occur before the Tribunal's award in this case. In this respect, the President's press conferences commenting on CALICA and its operations have continued even while this Application is pending.\n\n98.\n\n*Conclusion*. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal recommends as a provisional measure pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and NAFTA Article 1134 that Respondent take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, including further public attacks that exacerbate the dispute between the Parties, unduly pressure CALICA or Legacy Vulcan, or render the resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal has granted Claimant's request in the terms in which it was sought, save for the exclusion of the words \"that denies due process to Claimant\", since the Tribunal has not found Claimant's due process rights in this arbitration to be specifically implicated by Respondent's conduct.\n\n100.\n\nWhile expressed in general terms, the Tribunal does not consider its recommendation to be overly broad. It has been granted in the light of the specific circumstances mentioned at \u00b6\u00b693, 94 and 97 above. Moreover, the aggravation of a dispute can take many forms, all of which are to be avoided by the disputing parties.\n\n**VI.** **A****ncillary** **C****laim**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n101.\n\nClaimant argues that its ancillary claim is admissible and timely under ICSID Rule 40(1) (see \u00b6 14 above).95 Claimant denies that ICSID Rule 40(1) is modified by NAFTA.96\n\nApplication, \u00b6 41.\n\nReply, \u00b6 21.\n\n102.\n\nFor Claimant, the ancillary claim falls within the scope of the Parties' consent and is within ICSID's jurisdiction. Claimant argues that Respondent's consent in NAFTA Article 1122 and Claimant and CALICA's consent in their Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA Chapter 11 serve for this purpose.97\n\nApplication, \u00b6 45.\n\n103.\n\nClaimant further submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, *ratione personae*, and *ratione voluntatis*, since the dispute is (i) a legal dispute (ii) that arises directly out of Claimant's investment in the Project in Mexico (iii) between Mexico (Contracting State of the ICSID Convention) and Claimant (a national of the United States).98\n\nApplication, \u00b6 46.\n\n104.\n\nFor Claimant, the ancillary claim is timely since it arises from new facts which post-date the written and oral phases of this arbitration.99\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49; Reply, \u00b6 37.\n\n105.\n\nClaimant submits that the wrongful shutdown of CALICA's operations at La Rosita arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, being Respondent's interference with Claimant's investments in the Project in violation of NAFTA.100 In Claimant's view, La Rosita is a core part of the integrated Project at issue in this arbitration, and the ancillary claim would not transform the dispute before the Tribunal into a fundamentally different one.101\n\nApplication, \u00b6 42.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n106.\n\nSince it arises directly from the subject-matter of the dispute, Claimant argues that the ancillary claim is not subject to the required cooling-off period and formalities of new claims.102\n\nReply, \u00b6 35.\n\n107.\n\nClaimant contends that the principles of economy, efficiency and finality support hearing and deciding all aspects of the Parties' dispute in one proceeding.103 Claimant argues that Respondent would have adequate opportunity to address the ancillary claim and would benefit from the cost and other efficiencies of doing so in one arbitral proceeding by a tribunal that is already well-versed on the Parties' dispute.104\n\nApplication, \u00b6 50; *quoting* Schreuer, ICSID Commentary, Art. 46, \u00b6 1.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 50.\n\n**B. Respondent's Submission**\n------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nRespondent argues that there is no basis in Chapter 11 of NAFTA to present an ancillary claim based on a measure that did not form part of the original claim. In this regard, Respondent contends that NAFTA Articles 1119 (Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration), 1120 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) and 1121 (Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) have modified the ICSID Rules which do provide for such an option. Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1120(2), the arbitral procedural rules only apply to the extent modified by Section B of Chapter 11 of NAFTA.105\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78; Rejoinder, \u00b6 69.\n\n109.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the new claim sought to be put forward by Claimant is not ancillary but is an entirely new claim with no factual or legal relationship with the facts and claims originally presented. In this regard, Respondent submits that Claimant should be required to indicate which of the previously identified measures the ancillary claim is \"additional\" to and demonstrate a close relationship to it. Respondent further denies that the Tribunal needs knowledge of the ancillary claim to be able to resolve the original dispute between the Parties, which in its view is a requirement of admitting the ancillary claim.106\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 112; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8, 66, 74, 77.\n\n110.\n\nIn order to prove that a claim is ancillary, Respondent submits that Claimant should be required to prove: (i) that the new claim is effectively subordinate to one of the three originally-formulated claims; (ii) the object or theme of the dispute is the same; (iii) there is a close connection between the principal and accessory claims, such as the Tribunal cannot decide on the first without resolving the second; (iv) the new claim is within the limits of consent of the parties; and (v) the claim has been presented within the required legal period.107\n\nResponse, \u00b6 106; Rejoinder, \u00b6 67.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent argues that to allow Claimant to present an ancillary claim at this stage of the proceedings would be contrary to the finality and predictability of the proceedings.108\n\nResponse, \u00b6 103; Rejoinder, \u00b6 83.\n\n112.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the principles of economy, efficiency and finality are not decisive to determine whether an ancillary claim should be admitted.109 The *Itera v. Georgia* tribunal stated, in this regard, that the requirement is that the subject matter is the same, rather than efficiency considerations alone.110\n\nResponse, \u00b6 125.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 126; *quoting* **RL-116**, *Itera International Energy LLC and Itera Group NV v. Georgia I*, Decision on the Admissibility of Ancillary Claims, 4 December 2009, \u00b6 100.\n\n**C. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n113.\n\nClaimant requests leave to present an ancillary claim concerning \"Mexico's wrongful shutdown of Legacy Vulcan's remaining quarrying operations in Mexico under a schedule to be discussed with Respondent and the Tribunal.\"111 To decide on this request, the Tribunal will consider below (i) the Tribunal's power to admit an ancillary claim; (ii) the relevant criteria; (iii) whether the Tribunal should admit the ancillary claim; (iv) procedural implications; and (v) the potential counterclaim.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 51(ii).\n\n***(i) The Tribunal's Power to Admit an Ancillary Claim***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the potential ancillary claim before it is not a modification of Claimant's original relief sought. The ancillary claim is sought to be made in addition to the original claims, in relation to Claimant's \"remaining quarrying operations in Mexico\" (see \u00b6 113 above).\n\n115.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal is not empowered to admit an ancillary claim to this arbitration, on the basis that NAFTA Articles 1119 (Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration), 1120 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) and 1121 (Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) have modified the ICSID Rules which do provide for such an option.112 According to Respondent, a claim under NAFTA is one subject to certain formalities, including (i) the requirement of at least 90 days of written notice; (ii) the expiry of at least six months from when the acts took place; (iii) the investor's written consent to submit to arbitration and waiver of any proceedings before national authorities.113 For Respondent, the ICSID Rules cannot modify the requirements for its consent to arbitrate under NAFTA.114 Respondent argues that these conditions have not been fulfilled and Mexico has therefore not consented to arbitrate this claim.115\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78; Rejoinder, \u00b6 69.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 83.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 69.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 114-115; Rejoinder, \u00b6 2.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Respondent's contention that NAFTA has excluded Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 40 to be without merit. NAFTA Articles 1119, 1120 and 1121 do not purport to modify the possibility granted under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention to \"determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\". The Tribunal finds no contradiction between the possibility to admit an additional claim which arises \"directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\", and NAFTA's procedural requirements to submit the original claim to arbitration. In the absence of an inconsistency, if the NAFTA parties had intended to modify that aspect of the ICSID Rules, they would have done so explicitly.\n\n117.\n\nThis finding is consistent with that of the prior NAFTA tribunals cited by Claimant,116 including *Feldman v. Mexico*117 and *Metalclad v. Mexico* (in the related context of amendments to previously submitted claims and consideration of new facts and events).118 The Tribunal does not consider the case of *Methanex v. Mexico* or *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P v. Government of Canada* to add to this analysis, insofar as they restate (in different contexts and in relation to the specific facts before them) that the requirements of consent must be fulfilled under NAFTA, including formalities under NAFTA Articles 1118-1121.119\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n**CL-196**, *Feldman v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000, \u00b6 54: \"the issue of ancillary claims remains untouched by Section B of Chapter Eleven\".\n\n**CL-019**, *Metalclad v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000, \u00b6 67.\n\n**RL-120**, *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/01, Decision on a Motion to Add a New Party, 31 January 2008, \u00b6 28; **RL-070**, *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, \u00b6 120. *See* Response, \u00b6 1113.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent's argument that it has not consented to the admission of an ancillary claim in this arbitration. Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1120, Respondent consented to application of the procedural rules under the ICSID Convention, which in this respect have not been modified by any provision in Section B of Chapter 11 of NAFTA.\n\n119.\n\nAs such, in circumstances where an ancillary claim is admitted pursuant to the applicable criteria (and conditional on such criteria being met), the requirements of written notice of a claim, the expiry of a six-month period and the investor's consent and waiver are covered by compliance with those requirements in relation to the original claim. The Tribunal emphasises, in this respect, that any potential ancillary claim must be examined closely to determine whether it meets the specific requirement of arising \"directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\", which is the key basis of admission and for the understanding that NAFTA's procedural requirements have already been complied with.\n\n***(ii) The Criteria to Admit an Ancillary Claim***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 40 apply to determine whether an ancillary claim may be admitted (see \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 14 above). Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 40 refer to \"incidental or additional\" claims, \"arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\". Such additional claims must be within scope of the consent of the Parties and otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n121.\n\nAs for the timing of admission of an ancillary claim, ICSID Rule 40 states that such a claim:\n\nshall be presented not later than in the reply... unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\n\n122.\n\nSeveral arbitral tribunals have referred to Note B(a) to ICSID Rule 40 when setting out the relevant test:120\n\nThe test to satisfy this condition is whether the factual connection between the original and the ancillary claim is so close as to require the adjudication of the latter in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute, the object being to dispose of all the grounds of dispute arising out of the same subject-matter.\n\n*See* **CL-010**, *ADF v. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, n. 151; **CL-162**, *CMS v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, \u00b6 116; **CL-190**, *Mobil v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/16, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 10 April 2013, \u00b6 118. *See* Application, \u00b6 42.\n\n123.\n\nAccording to Claimant, this involves an analysis of whether the facts underlying the party's ancillary claim are sufficiently connected to the investor's claims and the matrix of facts already present in the dispute.121\n\nApplication, \u00b6 42.\n\n124.\n\nClaimant also relies on the commentary of Prof. Schreuer, who states that the idea is \"to deal with closely-related claims in one set of proceedings\", and that tribunals should avoid \"parallel or consecutive proceedings relating to different aspects of the same dispute[, which] are not only costly and inefficient but are also liable to lead to conflicting outcomes.\"122\n\nApplication, \u00b6 50; *quoting* Schreuer, ICSID Commentary, Art. 46, \u00b6 1.\n\n125.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, relies on the decisions of other arbitral tribunals to submit that Claimant should be required to prove: (i) that the new claim is effectively subordinate to one of the three originally-formulated claims (*Lotus Holding v. Turkmenistan*); (ii) the object or theme of the dispute is the same (*Itera v. Georgia*); (iii) there is a close connection between the principal and accessory claims, such as the Tribunal cannot decide on the first without resolving the second (*ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America; Itera v. Georgia*); (iv) the new claim is within the limits of consent of the parties; and (v) the claim has been presented within the required legal period.123\n\nResponse, \u00b6 106; Rejoinder, \u00b6 67; *citing* **RL-119**, *Lotus Holding Anonim Sirketi v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/17/30, Award, \u00b6 192; **RL-116**, *Itera International Energy LLC and Itera Group NV v.

United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, \u00b6 144.\n\n126.\n\nBased on the text of the applicable rules (see \u00b6\u00b6 120 and 121 above), the Tribunal finds that the criteria to admit the ancillary claim are that it (i) arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute; (ii) is within scope of the consent of the Parties and otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre; and (iii) is timely presented or the Tribunal authorizes its later presentation.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal considers criteria (i)-(iii) put forward by Respondent in \u00b6 125 above to be different expressions of the requirement that an ancillary claim arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute. The Tribunal endorses the (undisputed) requirement that the original and ancillary claim must be closely connected, in the sense that the Tribunal cannot decide on the first without resolving the second.124 This being a strict requirement, the Tribunal does not consider that the other proposed criteria add to the analysis.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 42; Rejoinder, \u00b6 110.\n\n***(iii) Whether the Tribunal Should Admit Claimant's Ancillary Claim***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal shall apply the above criteria to determine whether Claimant's ancillary claim with respect to its \"remaining quarrying operations in Mexico\" (see \u00b6 113 above) should be admitted.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that this part of the Order in relation to the admission of Claimant's ancillary claim is issued by majority of the Tribunal.125 The majority of the Tribunal has reviewed the draft dissent of Professor Puig, which does not give it reason to change its views, in particular since this Order is issued on the basis of what the Parties have submitted to the Tribunal for the purposes of this Application. References to the Tribunal in this sub-section should be understood as references to the majority of the Tribunal.\n\nSee dissenting opinion to Procedural Order No. 7 of Professor Puig.\n\n130.\n\n*Arises Directly out of Subject Matter*. The Parties fundamentally disagree on whether the ancillary claim sought to be filed by Claimant arises directly out of the subject matter of the Parties' dispute. Claimant argues that the \"subject matter\" of the dispute is \"Mexico's wrongful interference with Legacy Vulcan's investments in the Project, which encompasses four lots: El Corchalito, La Adelita, La Rosita, and Punta Venado\".126 Accordingly, in its view an ancillary claim \"concerning Mexico's wrongful shutdown of Legacy Vulcan's remaining quarrying operations in Mexico\" falls within the existing subject matter.\n\nReply, \u00b6 32.\n\n131.\n\nRespondent submits, on the other hand, that there is no close connection between the ancillary claim and the original claims.127 Respondent asserts that the present arbitration concerns El Corchalito and La Adelita and the ancillary claim is about La Rosita and is not related to those excavation sites.128 For Respondent, the \"CALICA Network\" is a controversial concept invoked by Claimant, which cannot be used to create a non-existent relationship between the original claims and the ancillary claim.129\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 95. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 9, 12-14.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 95.\n\n132.\n\nAs further evidence that the ancillary claim is a separate and new claim, Respondent relies on the fact that (i) the ancillary claim results in a separate loss and would require an independent valuation of damages;130 and (ii) La Rosita is governed by a separate legal instrument to La Adelita and El Corchalito.131\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90, 92; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 31 73, 74.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Respondent's characterisation of the subject matter of the Parties' dispute too narrow. In this regard, the subject matter of the dispute is to be distinguished from the original claims made.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal considers there to be a close connection between the ancillary claim and the existing dispute between the Parties. The existing claims before the Tribunal relate to the quarrying lots of La Adelita and El Corchalito, and to the port at Punta Venado.\n\n135.\n\nLa Rosita is one of three lots owned by CALICA for quarrying operations, the other two (La Adelita and El Corchalito) being the subject of the original claims. The original claims filed by Claimant include (i) the alleged repudiation of agreements to alter a local environmental regulation (*Programa de Ordenamiento Ecol\u00f3gico Local*) applicable to Adelita, having allegedly prevented CALICA from quarrying that lot;132 and (ii) the allegedly unlawful shutdown of CALICA's operations at El Corchalito, based on the findings of an inspection by PROFEPA.133 Notably, the subject-matter of the ancillary claim is the alleged wrongful shutdown of Claimant's operations in La Rosita following an inspection by PROFEPA.134\n\n*See* Memorial, \u00b6 112.\n\n*See* Memorial, \u00b6 159.\n\n*See* Application, \u00b6 51(ii): \"...ancillary claim concerning Mexico's wrongful shutdown of Legacy Vulcan's remaining quarrying operations in Mexico...\"\n\n136.\n\nThe interconnection between La Adelita, El Corchalito and La Rosita as a matter of fact is evident from the record of these proceedings. \u00b6 2 of the Request for Arbitration introduced the \"Project\" as \"a major joint-venture project to extract limestone for export to the United States\".135 \u00b6 3 of the Request for Arbitration further describes the Project as including \"the construction of a deep-sea port to export the production and other substantial infrastructure to conduct quarrying operations in a lot that Claimant acquired for that purpose.\"136 The original lot referred to is La Rosita, which contains a limestone quarry and processing plant. The \"Project\" described by Claimant includes \"Claimant's Extraction Plant, Port Terminal and fleet of vessels to export the petrous materials quarried at La Rosita, El Corchalito, and La Adelita.\"137\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 2.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 3.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 31.\n\n137.\n\nWithout prejudging its decision on the scope of Claimant's investment under NAFTA or ascribing any legal significance to Claimant's description of the \"Project\", it is clear that the La Rosita lot forms part of the same quarrying operation and therefore the same subject matter, with the purpose of quarrying limestone from adjoining sites and exporting materials from Mexico. La Rosita has been frequently referred to throughout this arbitration as a part of CALICA's operations in Mexico. The Tribunal does not consider it feasible to separate the subject matter of the ancillary claim about La Rosita from the dispute already before the Tribunal in relation to Punta Venado, La Adelita and El Corchalito.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds there to be a close connection between the ancillary claim and the original claims. The Tribunal further finds that the connection between the two is so close as to require the adjudication of the ancillary claim in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute, in order to dispose of all the grounds of dispute arising out of the same subject-matter. Indeed, to separate the disputes would, in the Tribunal's view, potentially lead to conflicting decisions on the same subject-matter. In this regard, the ancillary claim refers to actions and assessments made by PROFEPA with respect to La Rosita which are relevant to the arguments made before this Tribunal in relation to La Adelita and El Corchalito.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, at that this point, that the question whether it will be appropriate to admit such a claim to ongoing arbitration proceedings will very much depend on the circumstances of the case. It is for each tribunal to assess whether that is warranted. In this regard, several previous arbitral tribunals have had to consider whether a claimant may make an ancillary claim on the basis of the same facts that were the basis of the original claims. In the present case, on the other hand, the potential ancillary claim concerns a new alleged measure regarding the same project of quarrying operations that has taken place while this arbitration remains pending. The ancillary claim is based on an alleged further measure with respect to Claimant's quarrying operations, on grounds that are closely connected to the alleged measures with respect to La Adelita and El Corchalito.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the assertion that the ancillary claim is \"fundamentally different\" from the primary dispute.138 Nor does the ancillary claim concern an \"other project\" distinct from the one in dispute.139 The fact that La Rosita is a separate lot, or that it may be subject to different environmental regulations, does not redefine the subject matter of the dispute as set out at \u00b6 137 above.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 109; *quoting* **RL-119**, *Lotus Holding Anonim Sirketi v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/17/30, Award, \u00b6\u00b6 192, 193.\n\n*See* **CL-010**, *ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award, 9 January 2003, \u00b6 143; Response, \u00b6 96.\n\n141.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal does not consider it an issue that the ancillary or additional claim may require separate valuation.\n\n142.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's contention that Claimant is estopped from arguing that La Rosita forms part of the original dispute, because it is inconsistent with its actions and submissions in these proceedings.140. The Tribunal finds no inconsistency in the positions taken by Claimant, in particular since the ancillary claim concerns the same project.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20-23.\n\n143.\n\nIn reaching this determination, the Tribunal does not consider that Claimant is evading the conditions of consent under NAFTA, or preventing Respondent's authorities from ensuring compliance with the law.141\n\nResponse, \u00b6 88.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that its decision to admit the ancillary claim is not based on Claimant's reservation of rights to expand its claim, and does not consider it necessary to further address that point.142\n\nReply, footnote 69; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 78, 87-90.\n\n145.\n\nIn terms of Respondent's argument that Claimant's claim is premature,143 the Tribunal confirms that it does not consider itself to act as an appeal mechanism for ongoing administrative or legal proceedings in Mexico. Subject to compliance with the waiver requirements under NAFTA, the Tribunal does not consider this to be an obstacle to admission of the ancillary claim.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 92.\n\n146.\n\nWhile not the prevailing consideration for deciding whether to admit the ancillary claim, the Tribunal also considers that time, cost and procedural efficiency favours the consideration of the ancillary claim together with the original claims. In this regard, it is in the interests of both Parties that a Tribunal is already composed to hear the ancillary claim and is well-versed in the underlying facts of the case. The fact that consideration of the ancillary claim will require additional procedural steps still offers greater efficiency than composition of a new tribunal to hear the dispute, which entails the additional risk of conflicting decisions referred to in \u00b6 138 above.\n\n147.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal takes note of Respondent's argument that the ancillary claim would require reopening the proceedings, at a time when they were practically concluded and the award is awaited.144 However, this does not outweigh the considerations in \u00b6 146 above.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 98.\n\n148.\n\n*Scope of Consent and Jurisdiction*. Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 40 require that an ancillary claim is \"within scope of the consent of the parties and ... otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\" (see \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 14 above).\n\n149.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it has not consented to arbitrate the ancillary claim regarding La Rosita.145 The Tribunal has already rejected Respondent's argument that it has not consented to the admission of an ancillary claim in this arbitration at \u00b6 118 above. In addition, in circumstances where an ancillary claim is admitted, as stated at \u00b6 119 above, the Tribunal understands that the requirements of written notice of a claim, the expiry of a six-month period and the investor's consent and waiver fully apply and are covered by compliance with those requirements in relation to the original claim. Any dispute with respect thereto can therefore be considered in conjunction with the original claims. In the Tribunal's view, to decide otherwise would lead to the absurd result of further delays to the same dispute between the parties, contrary to procedural economy.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 84.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal otherwise considers the ancillary claim to be within the scope of the consent of the Parties and within the jurisdiction of ICSID. In this regard, NAFTA Article 1122(1) provides for Mexico's consent: \"[e]ach Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in [NAFTA]\". The Tribunal considers the procedures set out in NAFTA to have been complied with as set out in \u00b6 149 above.\n\n151.\n\nNAFTA Article 1122(2) further states that \"[t]he consent given by [Article 1122] paragraph 1 and the submission by a disputing investor of a claim to arbitration shall satisfy the requirement of: (a) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre)...\" Claimant provided its consent under this provision by submitting its original Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration,146 as reiterated in its instrument of consent and waiver dated 3 December 2018 and the Request for Arbitration.147\n\n**C-007**, Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA Chapter 11, dated 3 September 2018.\n\n**C-008**, Legacy Vulcan LLC's and Calizas Industriales del Carmen, S.A. de C.V.'s executed instrument of consent and waiver pursuant to NAFTA Article 1121, dated 3 December 2018; Request for Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28.\n\n152.\n\nWith respect to the jurisdiction of ICSID in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,148 the Tribunal considers that the ancillary claim is a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment (*i.e*., CALICA) between a Contracting State (Mexico) and a national of another Contracting State (Claimant), which the parties to the dispute have consented in writing to submit to the Centre (see \u00b6\u00b6 150-151 above).\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides: \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n153.\n\n*Timeliness.* In terms of the timeliness of the ancillary claim, while the default is that it must be submitted at the latest at the time of the Reply, ICSID Rule 40 contemplates the potential admission at a later stage subject to the Tribunal's authorization, which request is being considered in this Order. The fact that the ancillary claim was not filed with the Reply therefore does not exclude it from consideration.149\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102; *quoting* **RL-117**, *Metalclad v. Mexico,* \u00b6 68; Response, \u00b6 117.\n\n154.\n\nIn all the circumstances, and specifically because the ancillary claim arises from new facts directly related to the subject matter of the original dispute, as well as the considerations mentioned at \u00b6\u00b6 137-146 above, the Tribunal authorizes its admission to this arbitration.\n\n***(iv) Procedure***\n--------------------\n\n155.\n\nRespondent originally asserted that the fact that ICSID Rule 40(3) only permits Respondent to make observations on the ancillary claim confirms that it is not a basis to admit entirely new claims.150 A truly ancillary claim, in its view, would be resolved in the same procedure and result as the originally formulated claims.151\n\nResponse, \u00b6 122.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 123.\n\n156.\n\nClaimant denies that its ancillary claim would be decided by the Tribunal based only on its submissions and Respondent's observations to date in respect of the ancillary claim. In Claimant's view, adjudication of this claim will require further written submissions, evidence, witness declarations, expert reports, and possibly a brief hearing.152\n\nReply, \u00b6 41.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that consideration of the ancillary claim shall be carried out respecting due process for both sides, including at a minimum further written submissions and evidence, and not based on the observations made to date. The Tribunal considers it appropriate to determine this procedure in consultation with the Parties in due course.\n\n***(v) Potential Counterclaim***\n--------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal admits the ancillary claim, Respondent reserves the right to submit a counterclaim directly related to the dispute, which it argues is within the scope of ICSID Convention Article 46.153 According to Claimant, the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction over a counterclaim submitted by Respondent under NAFTA Chapter 11.154\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130; *quoting* **RL-121**, *Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v.

The Tribunal is open to considering any such application for leave by Respondent, which Respondent is at liberty to file. The Tribunal shall decide upon any application for leave to submit a counterclaim in accordance with the procedural rules, after giving Claimant the opportunity to comment.\n\n**VII.** **D****ecision**\n-------------------------\n\n160.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Tribunal hereby decides as follows:\n\n(a) RECOMMENDS as provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and NAFTA Article 1134 that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, including further public attacks that exacerbate the dispute between the Parties, unduly pressure CALICA or Legacy Vulcan, or render the resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult;\n\n(b) By majority,155 PERMITS Legacy Vulcan to present an ancillary claim concerning Mexico's wrongful shutdown of Legacy Vulcan's remaining quarrying operations in Mexico under a schedule to be discussed with Respondent and the Tribunal;\n\n(c) DEFERS any decision on any counterclaim to be presented by Respondent, subject to a reasoned application for leave by Respondent;\n\n(d) RESERVES the matter of costs related to the Application; and\n\n(e) REJECTS any remaining requests.\n\nDate: 11 July 2022\n\nSee dissenting opinion to Procedural Order No. 7 of Professor Puig."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2023-07-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9\n----------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 14 June 2023, the Tribunal received correspondence from Mr. Quetzal Tzab Gonz\u00e1les on behalf of \"hundreds of residents from marginalized and indigenous communities in Playa del Carmen, state of Quintana Roo, Mexico\", forwarded to the Parties the following day.\n\n2.\n\nUpon invitation of the Tribunal, on 22 June 2023, the Parties provided comments on the correspondence of Mr. Tzab.\n\n3.\n\nOn 24 June 2023, the Tribunal informed Mr. Tzab that the potential for *amicus curiae* or non-disputing party (\"**NDP**\") participation in this arbitration is governed by Section 27 of Procedural Order No. 1 dated 26 November 2019, ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), and the NAFTA Statement of the Free Trade Commission on Non-Disputing Party Participation of 7 October 2003(\"**FTC Statement**\"), providing links to the relevant documents online, and informing Mr. Tzab of the deadline of 30 June 2023 for filing applications for leave to file NDP submissions.\n\n4.\n\nOn 30 June 2023, Mr. Tzab filed an \"Application seeking authorization for Mr. Quetzal Tzab Gonz\u00e1lez, in representation of communities from Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico, to act as amicus curiae in Arbitration proceedings Legacy Vulcan, LLC v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB/19/1)\" (\"**Letter of 30 June 2023**\"). Attached to the Letter of 30 June 2023 was a document being a class action filed before the Mexican courts by Mr. Tzab in the matter *Quetzal Tzab Gonz\u00e1les y Otros, Todo Integrantes de la Colectividad Actora vs Calizas Industriales del Carmen, S.A. de C.V. (SAC TUN) y Rancho Piedra Caliza S.A. de C.V.* (\"**Class Action Filing**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 7 July 2023, the Parties provided their comments on the Letter of 30 June 2023 and Class Action Filing.\n\n**II. Applicable Rules and Discussion**\n---------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nAs reflected in Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1, these proceedings are conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, except to the extent that they are modified by Section B of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n7.\n\nWith regard to the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 37(2) provides:\n\n*(2) After consulting both parties, the Tribunal may allow a person or entity that is not a party to the dispute (in this Rule called the \"non-disputing party\") to file a written submission with the Tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute. In determining whether to allow such a filing, the Tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which:*\n\n*(a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties;*\n\n*(b) the non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;*\n\n*(c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding.*\n\n*The Tribunal shall ensure that the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party, and that both parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the non-disputing party submission.*\n\n8.\n\nWith respect to *amicus curiae* participation, Procedural Order No.1 provides at Section 27.1 and 27.2 as follows:\n\n*27.1 If a request for the submission of an amicus curiae brief is filed by the date indicated in Annex A, the Tribunal will give the appropriate directions in the exercise of its powers under Arbitration Rule 37(2) and take into consideration the recommendation of the North American Free Trade Commission on non-disputing party participation of 7 October 2003.*\n\n*27.2 By the relevant dates indicated in Annex A, the disputing parties shall have the opportunity to: (1) make submissions on any request for the submission of an amicus curiae brief; and (2) file simultaneous observations on issues raised in any amicus curiae brief submitted pursuant to a decision of the Tribunal.*\n\n9.\n\nIn exercise of its powers under the above provisions, the Tribunal shall take into consideration the recommendation of the North American Free Trade Commission on non-disputing party participation of 7 October 2003 which sets out considerations on the interpretation of NDP participation.\n\n10.\n\nClaimant opposes the admission of the Class Action Filing as an NDP submission, arguing that the criteria for its admission are not fulfilled. In support, Claimant specifically refers to: (i) an unfair prejudice against Claimant should it be admitted, as Claimant will lack an opportunity to controvert it; (ii) the lack of proof of Mr. Tzab's independence from Respondent; and (iii) the lack of a significant interest of Mr. Tzab in the arbitration. According to Claimant, the Class Action Filing would not bring any unique or different perspective, nor does it fall within the scope of the dispute.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent argues in favor of admitting the Class Action Filing, contending that all formal requirements are fulfilled, including that the Class Action Filing falls into the scope of the dispute. According to Respondent, Mr. Tzab has a significant interest in this arbitration, since the legitimacy of the collective action presented by the local communities he represents has been discussed in this proceeding. Respondent denies any unfair burden on Claimant, since the Class Action Filing contains information that already forms a part of the record. In Respondent's view, the Class Action Filing brings new perspectives on the relevance of international human rights and environmental law.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it necessary or appropriate to admit the Class Action Filing as an NDP submission under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) and the FTC Statement, as it already figures among the exhibits on the record of the proceedings (see C-0283-SPA).\n\n13.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal does consider it appropriate to admit the Letter of 30 June 2023 as an NDP submission for the following reasons: (i) the Class Action Filing has been referred to by both Parties in their prior submissions, and as such, the Letter of 30 June 2023 describing its context falls within the scope of the dispute; (ii) as a representative of the local communities in the proximity of Claimant's operations in Mexico, Mr. Tzab has a significant interest in the proceedings; (iii) as the community representative that filed the Class Action Filing, Mr. Tzab brings a particular perspective on the Class Action Filing that neither of the Parties to this arbitration provides; (iv) while Mr. Tzab is a former official of the Municipality of Solidaridad, the Tribunal does not consider that to constitute a current direct or indirect affiliation with the Parties; (v) there is no unfair burden or prejudice on the Parties, since they will both be afforded the opportunity to provide written comments on the Letter of 30 June 2023 within the existing procedural calendar, which the Tribunal considers to be sufficient to protect the Parties' rights; and (vi) the Letter of 30 June 2023 otherwise satisfies the formal requirements of Section B.3 of the FTC Statement.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that as per item XV of the Parties' comments on various procedural and organisational matters conveyed to the Tribunal on 7 July 2023, the Parties agree on a deadline of 24 September 2023 for comments on any NDP submissions (both relating to NAFTA Article 1128 submissions and *amicus* submissions). Accordingly, the Parties will be entitled to provide their written comments on the Letter of 30 June 2023 by that date.\n\n**III. Decision**\n-----------------\n\n15.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Tribunal hereby decides as follows:\n\n(a) The application for leave to file the Letter of 30 June 2023 as an NDP submission is granted.\n\n(b) The Parties may provide any written comments on the Letter of 30 June 2023 on 24 September 2023, in accordance with the procedural calendar.\n\nDate: 13 July 2023"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 11", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2023-12-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 11\n-----------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 11 July 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (\"**PO 7**\") wherein it, *inter alia*, recommended \"as provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and NAFTA Article 1134 that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, including further public attacks that exacerbate the dispute between the Parties, unduly pressure CALICA or Legacy Vulcan, or render the resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult\".1\n\nPO 7 \u00b6 160(a).\n\n2.\n\nOn 11 October 2023, Claimant requested leave to submit into the record the transcript and an excerpt of the video of President Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez Obrador's *Conferencia de Prensa Matutina* or *La Ma\u00f1anera* (daily morning press conference) dated 6 October 2023. Upon leave from the Tribunal of 12 October 2023, Respondent communicated on 16 October 2023 that it did not object to Claimant's request, provided the full video and transcript were introduced into the record. In addition, Respondent stated that \"*el Presidente en ning\u00fan momentoreiterated his intent to convert CALICA's lots into a protected natural area by decree before leaving office next year'\".2*\n\nRespondent letter dated 16 October 2023, p. 1.\n\n3.\n\nOn 24 October 2023, Claimant requested the Tribunal (i) for leave to submit into the record the transcript and an excerpt of the video of President Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez Obrador's *La Ma\u00f1anera* dated 20 October 2023 (\"**20 October 2023** ***Ma\u00f1anera***\"), pursuant to paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, and (ii) in light of the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera*, to reiterate its order in PO 7 recommending \"that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute\".3 In Claimant's view, the President's publicly made statements at the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* were alleged attacks and threats to Claimant and CALICA in relation to this arbitration, which constitute a violation of PO 7.4\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023, p. 1.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023, p. 2\n\n4.\n\nOn 30 October 2023, Respondent replied that it did not object to Claimant's request to admit into the record the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera*, provided the full video and transcript were introduced into the record. Respondent requested the Tribunal to reject Claimant's allegations regarding Respondent's alleged breached of PO 7.5\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 2.\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 November 2023, Claimant commented on Respondent's letter of 30 October 2023, maintaining its request for the Tribunal to reiterate its provisional-measure order in PO 7, recommending that Respondent refrain from further aggravating the dispute.6\n\nClaimant's letter dated 2 November 2023, p. 2.\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 November 2023, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal that Respondent \"has further aggravated the dispute by publishing in the Official Gazette [on 8 November 2023] a notice commencing the process to declare CALCIA's lots as a natural protected area\" (\"**Notice**\").7 Claimant requested the Tribunal (i) for leave to submit the Notice into the record; and (ii) to reiterate the Tribunal's order in PO 7, recommending that Respondent refrain from further aggravating the dispute.8\n\nClaimant's letter dated 9 November 2023, p. 1.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 9 November 2023, p. 2.\n\n7.\n\nOn 10 November 2023, upon the Tribunal's leave of 8 November 2023 to admit the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* into the record, Claimant submitted the complete transcript and video of said *Ma\u00f1anera*.\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 November 2023, Respondent replied that it did not object to the Notice being introduced into the record, provided that certain other documents that Respondent refers to in its 16 November 2023 letter are introduced into the record.\n\n9.\n\nOn 27 November 2023, the Tribunal admitted the Notice into the record and requested Respondent to submit it, which Respondent did on the next day. On 12 December 2023, the Tribunal issued directions in relation to Respondent's request of 16 November 2023 for introduction of documents into the record.\n\n**II. Requests**\n----------------\n\n10.\n\nHaving dealt with Claimant's requests for introducing the video and transcript of the 20 October *Ma\u00f1anera* and the Notice, there are currently two requests outstanding, which the Tribunal shall address in this Procedural Order:\n\n(a) In relation to the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera*, Claimant requests a reiteration of the Tribunal's order in PO 7 recommending \"that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute\";9 and\n\n(b) In relation to the Notice, Claimant requests the Tribunal to reiterate its order in PO 7, \"recommending that Respondent refrain from further aggravating the dispute\".10\n\nSee \u00b6 3 above.\n\nSee \u00b6 6 above.\n\n**III. Parties' Positions**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nClaimant argues that President L\u00f3pez Obrador, in the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera*, disparaged Claimant and CALICA and threatened to declare the CALICA lots as a natural protected area.11 According to Claimant, the President's remarks and threats were made as Claimant had rejected the President's purported proposal, made on television, to buy CALICA's assets for approximately USD 355 million and to use the lots as a tourism project and natural park.12 Claimant submits that the President has affirmed that he will \"not leave [office] without resolving this issue, and [that] the best way to resolve it is to declare everything a protected natural area.\"13\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023, p. 1; *citing* **C-371**, **C-372**.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023, p. 2; *quoting* **C-372**; *see also* **C-371**.\n\n12.\n\nClaimant further contends that the President's public statements contradict Respondent's representation in its letter dated 16 October 2023, referred to in \u00b6 2 above, that the President \"*en ning\u00fan momentoreiterated his intent to convert CALICA's lots into a protected natural area by decree before leaving office next year'\".14*\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023, p. 2; *quoting* Respondent's letter dated 16 October 2023, p. 1.\n\n13.\n\nClaimant submits that the President's public attacks, threats and specific references to this arbitration in the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* undermine the integrity of this proceeding and Claimant's ability to pursue this arbitration.15 According to Claimant, Respondent is strong-arming it into surrendering its investments and claims for a fraction of their value. In Claimant's view, these attacks constitute a further violation of PO 7.16\n\nClaimant's letters dated 24 October 2023, p. 2 and dated 2 November 2023, p. 2.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 24 October 2023, p. 2.\n\n14.\n\nClaimant also rebuts Respondent's contention that it initiated serious negotiation efforts and denies that Claimant had commented about this case to the press.17\n\nClaimant's letter dated 2 November 2023, p. 1.\n\n15.\n\nClaimant further submits that, if adopted, Respondent's declaration of CALICA's lots as a natural protected area would constitute an expropriation of Claimant's investments, thereby further aggravating and extending the ongoing dispute between the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nClaimant maintains that the threatened measure is not \"speculative\", as the President has reiterated that he will declare CALICA's lots as a natural protected area if Claimant does not accept the President's proposal.18 In support, Claimant also relies on a newspaper article, stating that the President has \"reportedly signed a decree to this effect already\".19\n\nClaimant's letter dated 2 November 2023, p. 2.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 2 November 2023, p. 2; *citing* Nido de V\u00edboras, Luces del Siglo (1 November 2023), https://lucesdelsiglo.com/2023/11/01/nido-deviboras-editorial-694/.\n\n17.\n\nClaimant disputes Respondent's contentions that the provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal under PO 7 were limited to the original proceedings and cannot be invoked by Claimant in relation to the ancillary proceedings. Claimant maintains that the President's remarks pertained to this arbitration and that Claimant is entitled to request a reiteration of the non-aggravation order in PO 7.20\n\nClaimant's letter dated 2 November 2023, p. 2.\n\n18.\n\nMoreover, Claimant refers to the Notice, which, according to Claimant, constitutes the first formal step for a Presidential decree to declare CALICA's lots as a natural protected area.21 Claimant argues that while the Notice does not mention CALICA or expressly identify the properties subject to the measure, it covers CALICA's lots as it refers to an area of 2,387 hectares located in the municipalities of Solidaridad and Cozumel and CALICA's lots have approximately that area and are located in those municipalities.22\n\nClaimant's letter dated 9 November 2023, p. 1; *citing*, **C-0373-SPA**.\n\nClaimant's letter dated 9 November 2023; *citing* Notice on Official Gazette, **C-0373-SPA**.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n19.\n\nRespondent submits that while the Tribunal's recommendation for provisional measures in PO 7 was pursuant to statements by the President that clearly referred to this arbitration, the President's statements in the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* relate to the negotiation proposal made to Claimant as opposed to the pending arbitration proceedings.23 According to Respondent, those statements do not constitute a threat.24\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, pp. 1-2; *citing* **C-372**.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 2.\n\n20.\n\nRespondent submits that one of the purposes of the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* is to inform and respond to public inquiries on issues relevant to Mexico, one of which is the alleged exploitation and disposal of Mexico's natural resources.25 Respondent contends that the President's statements are a consequence of the media coverage caused by Claimant who had approached the international media to comment on the development of this arbitration and to discredit the negotiation efforts initiated by Mexico.26 For Respondent, Claimant has breached PO 7.27\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 1.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 1; *citing* Ver Bloomberg, Vulcan Seeks Biden's Protection Against Mexico Port Seizure, 19 de octubre de 2023.

AMLO responde a Vulcan: anticipa declarar a Calica como \u00e1rea natural protegida (bloomberglinea.com).\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 1.\n\n21.\n\nRespondent contends that, similar to the measures addressed by the Tribunal in \u00b6 78 of PO 7, Claimant's assertion regarding Respondent's alleged intention to issue a \"declaration of CALICA's lots as a natural protected area would constitute an expropriation of [Claimant's] investment\" is speculative.28\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 2.\n\n22.\n\nWith respect to the Notice, Respondent argues that it is an informative and preliminary act that makes a study conducted by *Comisi\u00f3n Natural de \u00c1reas Naturlaes Protegidas* (CONANP) available to the general public and is intended to gather various opinions. Respondent contends that it does not constitute a Presidential decree declaring the intended hectares as a natural protected area.29 Respondent further contends that the Notice is subject to numerous steps and deadlines within a legal procedure for declaring a natural protected30 area.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 16 November 2023, p. 1.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 16 November 2023, p. 1.\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the fact that this dispute exists, does not exempt Mexican environmental authorities from fulfilling their obligation to exercise their functions in protecting the human right of every person to a healthy environment for his or her development and well-being, as well as the obligation to promote sustainable development, address climate change, and preserve the environment in Mexico.31\n\nRespondent's letter dated 16 November 2023, pp. 1-2.\n\n24.\n\nRespondent contends further that if the process subsequent to the Notice concludes in the issuance of a decree declaring a protected natural area, Mexican law provides Claimant with defenses that it can rely on.32\n\nRespondent's letter dated 16 November 2023, p. 2.\n\n25.\n\nRespondent contends that, in any event, \u00b6 95 of PO 7 establishes that the provisional measures recommended in PO 7 were limited to the original proceedings. According to Respondent, PO 7 cannot be used as a justification for introducing additional evidence in the ancillary proceedings or extending the object of the provisional measures to measures of a speculative nature.33\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 2.\n\n**IV. Tribunal's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n26.\n\nClaimant's requests, referred to in \u00b6 10 above, concern a reiteration of the Tribunal's recommendation in PO 7. In PO 7, the Tribunal, *inter alia*, recommended that \"Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties, including further public attacks that exacerbate the dispute between the Parties, unduly pressure CALICA or Legacy Vulcan, or render the resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult\".34\n\nPO 7 \u00b6 160(a).\n\n27.\n\nThe above-stated provisional measures recommended by the Tribunal in PO 7 are also applicable to the ancillary claim in this arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is not being requested to recommend further provisional measures going beyond the recommendation of provisional measures made in PO 7, as quoted in \u00b6 1 above. Rather, Claimant only requests the Tribunal to reiterate the provisional measures recommended by it in PO 7 in light of Respondent's actions, referred to in Claimant's letters of 24 October and 9 November 2023. Accordingly, the Tribunal shall determine whether any of the circumstances that Claimant has referred to in relation to its reiteration requests fall within the ambit of the Tribunal's earlier recommendation.\n\n**A. Claimant's Request regarding the 20 October 2023** ***Ma\u00f1anera***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nClaimant requests in relation to the President's 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* that the Tribunal reiterates its order in PO 7, recommending \"that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute\".\n\n30.\n\nThe relevant passages of the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* that Claimant refers to as containing threats, which are allegedly made in reference to the present arbitration proceedings, are quoted below:35\n\n**PREGUNTA :** \u00bfCu\u00e1nto ped\u00edan ellos ?\n\n**PRESIDENTE ANDR\u00c9S MANUEL L\u00d3PEZ OBRADOR :** No, nada, ellos no quieren nada, ellos lo que quieren es que se termine el gobierno para volver a explotar.\n\n**PREGUNTA:** Ellos demandaban por mil 900 millones de d\u00f3lares.\n\n**PRESIDENTE ANDR\u00c9S MANUEL L\u00d3PEZ OBRADOR:** S\u00ed, s\u00ed, y hay un litigio de esta naturaleza. Pero yo quiero decirles aqu\u00ed a todos los mexicanos que yo no me voy a ir sin resolver esto y la mejor forma de resolverlo es que se declare zona natural protegida todo, y que se les pague de conformidad con la ley la indemnizaci\u00f3n correspondiente.\n\n**PREGUNTA:** \u00bfQu\u00e9 recursos ocupar\u00eda?\n\n**PRESIDENTE ANDR\u00c9S MANUEL L\u00d3PEZ OBRADOR:** Sencillamente se declara \u00e1rea natural protegida.\n\n**PREGUNTA:** \u00bfPor decreto?\n\n**PRESIDENTE ANDR\u00c9S MANUEL L\u00d3PEZ OBRADOR:** Por decreto. Si no hay respuesta de parte de ellos, si no quieren ayudar, esa va a ser la decisi\u00f3n.\n\n**PREGUNTA:** \u00bfUn plazo?\n\n**PRESIDENTE ANDR\u00c9S MANUEL L\u00d3PEZ OBRADOR:** No, vamos a esperar, nada m\u00e1s antes de que yo me vaya. Ya se les va a depositar en un juzgado los seis mil, siete mil millones de pesos, y vamos a emitir el decreto para destinar toda el \u00e1rea a la protecci\u00f3n del medio ambiente; no se va a poder construir nada, va a ser para conservaresta reserva.\n\n**C-371, p.15**.\n\n31.\n\nA delicate balance needs to be maintained by the Tribunal to ensure that the integrity of the proceedings is not violated by a party's (here Mexico's) actions, and at the same time, to not unduly encroach on the State's sovereignty.\n\n32.\n\nIn PO 7, the Tribunal regarded certain presidential statements regarding Claimant's claims and damages sought in the original claims phase of the arbitration, as \"jeopardis[ing] the integrity of the arbitral process\" and tantamount to \"prosecution of the dispute in the media and other public fora\".36 On this basis, the Tribunal recommended the provisional measures in PO 7.\n\nPO 7, \u00b6 93.\n\n33.\n\nWith respect to the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera*, the Tribunal concurs with Respondent that the presidential statements quoted in \u00b6 30 above, relate to the negotiation proposal by Respondent. In the Tribunal's view, these presidential statements do not give rise to the same level of seriousness as the facts underlying the provisional measures recommended in PO 7. While the presidential statements relate to matters in the arbitration, the Tribunal considers that they are more of an informative rather than a threatening nature as alleged by Claimant.\n\n34.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that a reiteration of its recommendation in PO 7 \"that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute\", is warranted in view of the presidential statements in the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera*.\n\n35.\n\nIn this respect, at this point, it is irrelevant to address whether, as Respondent contends, the President's statements are a consequence of the media coverage caused by Claimant who allegedly approached the international media to comment on the development of this arbitration and discredited the negotiation efforts initiated by Mexico.37\n\nRespondent's letter dated 30 October 2023, p. 1.\n\n**B. Claimant's Request regarding the Notice**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nClaimant requests in relation to the Notice that the Tribunal reiterates its order, recommending that Respondent refrain from further aggravating the dispute.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal is not in a position to determine at this stage and based on the materials before it whether the issuance of the Notice may be considered an action by Respondent that will further aggravate or extend the dispute between the Parties.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the Notice is the \"first formal step for a Presidential decree to declare CALICA's lots as a natural protected area\".38 It does not appear to be Claimant's argument, and, in any event, Claimant has not substantiated, that the declaration of CALICA's lots as a natural protected area is the automatic outcome following the issuance of the Notice. Respondent has not denied that the Notice initiates the formal process for decreeing the CALICA lots as a natural protected area. It has, however, also stated that this Notice constitutes an \"*acto informativo y preliminar*\" and that \"*el Aviso est\u00e1 sujeto a numerosos pasos y plazos dentro de un procedimiento legal de declaratoria de \u00e1rea natural protegida*\".39\n\nClaimant's letter dated 9 November 2023, pp. 1-2.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 16 November 2023, p. 1.\n\n39.\n\nAs such, it appears to the Tribunal that the Notice is subject to a procedure with an uncertain outcome. In light of this, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Notice, in and of itself, leads to a further aggravation or extension of the present dispute.\n\n40.\n\nAlso coupled with the President's statements, it remains speculative whether a decree will follow with certainty to declare the CALICA lots as a natural protected area. While Respondent's representation in its correspondence dated 16 October 2023 that \"*el Presidente en ning\u00fan momentoreiterated his intent to convert CALICA's lots into a protected natural area by decree before leaving office next year'\"40 seems to be contradicted by the President's statements, the President's intention is not made out.*\n\nRespondent's letter dated 16 October 2023, p. 1.\n\n41.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the issuance of the Notice in and of itself warrants a reiteration of the Tribunal's recommendation in PO 7 that Respondent refrain from further aggravating the dispute. However, in the event that circumstances further develop with more clarity, Claimant is at liberty to make a corresponding request.\n\n**V. Decision**\n---------------\n\n42.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Tribunal hereby decides as follows:\n\n(a) REJECTS Claimant's request in relation to the 20 October 2023 *Ma\u00f1anera* that the Tribunal reiterates its order in PO 7, recommending \"that Mexico take no action that might further aggravate or extend the dispute\".\n\n(b) REJECTS Claimant's request in relation to the Notice that the Tribunal reiterates its order in PO 7, recommending that Respondent refrain from further aggravating the dispute.\n\n(c) RESERVES the matter of costs related to Claimant's requests; and\n\n(d) REJECTS any remaining request.\n\nDate: 19 December 2023"}]}
