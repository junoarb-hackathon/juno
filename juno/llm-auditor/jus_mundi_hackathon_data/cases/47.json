INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted pursuant to Articles 1116(1), 1117(1) and 1120(1)(c) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 December 1976 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"). By agreement of the Parties, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") serves as the administering authority for this proceeding.\n\n2.\n\nThe claims in this arbitration were initially brought by Mr. Joshua Dean Nelson (\"**Mr. Nelson**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), and Mr. Jorge Blanco (\"**Mr. Blanco**\"), both natural persons having the nationality of the United States of America. Mr. Blanco later withdrew from this arbitration as claimant.1\n\n*See* \u00b6 66 below.\n\n3.\n\nMr. Nelson brings his claims on his own behalf and on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V. (\"**Tele F\u00e1cil**\"), a corporation organized under the laws of the United Mexican States, which Mr. Nelson alleges is majority owned and controlled by him.\n\n4.\n\nThe respondent is the United Mexican States (\"**Mexico**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n5.\n\nClaimant and Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n6.\n\nThis dispute arises from an investment that Claimant alleges to have made in Mexico's telecommunications sector. Claimant alleges that a series of measures by Mexico's telecommunications regulator, the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (\"**IFT**\" for its acronym in Spanish), have destroyed Claimant's investment and all prospects of entering the Mexican telecommunications market, in violation of the protections afforded to U.S. investors under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA.\n\n7.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the IFT measures that breached Chapter Eleven of NAFTA are three: (i) the confirmation of criteria proceedings initiated by the Compliance Unit of the IFT; (ii) Decree 77 issued by the IFT on 8 April 2015 (\"**Decree 77**\") and; (iii) Resolution 127 issued by the IFT as well, on 7 October 2015 (\"**Resolution 127**\").\n\n8.\n\nClaimant further alleges that two decisions from the Mexican courts breached Chapter Eleven of NAFTA. Particularly, Claimant alleges that the Specialized Telecommunications Court that decided Tele F\u00e1cil's *amparo* action against Decree 77 acted with gross incompetence and that the Appellate Court unjustifiably denied Tele F\u00e1cil access to justice.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Claimant delivered a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration (\"**Notice of Intent**\") to Respondent. On 26 April 2016, Respondent acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Intent via email.\n\n10.\n\nOn 26 September 2016, Claimant commenced this arbitration by filing a Notice of Arbitration (\"**NoA**\"), pursuant to Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules and NAFTA Articles 1116(1), 1117(1), and 1120(1)(c).\n\n**A. Constitution of the Tribunal and Administration of the Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nAs envisaged in NAFTA Article 1123, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nOn 31 October 2016, Claimant appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. On 23 December 2016, Respondent appointed Mr. Mariano Gomezperalta Casali, a Mexican national, as arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nOn 9 January 2017, Claimant requested that the ICSID Secretary-General appoint the third, presiding arbitrator pursuant to NAFTA Article 1124.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 17 January 2017, the Secretary-General accepted Claimant's request and proposed a ballot process to assist the Parties in selecting a mutually agreeable presiding arbitrator. On 24 January 2017, the Parties accepted the Secretary-General's proposal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 27 February 2017, in accordance with the Parties' agreed procedure, the Secretary-General provided the Parties with a list of seven candidates. Each Party submitted its completed ballot on 13 March 2017.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter on 14 March 2017, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the ballot process did not result in the selection of a mutually agreeable candidate and that, accordingly, the Secretary-General would proceed to appoint the presiding arbitrator following the list-procedure established under Article 6.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules, selecting all candidates from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1124(3).\n\n17.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the Secretary-General provided the Parties with a list of three candidates. Both Parties submitted their completed lists on 11 April 2017.\n\n18.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the list-procedure had not been successful in the selection of a mutually agreeable candidate, and that as a result, and pursuant to the Parties' agreement, the Secretary-General would exercise her discretion in appointing the Presiding Arbitrator among the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n19.\n\nOn 1 May 2017, the Secretary-General appointed Mr. Eduardo Zuleta as the third and presiding arbitrator, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1123 and Article 6.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID of 20 June 2017, the Parties requested that ICSID provide full administrative services in this arbitration. On 21 June 2017, the Secretary-General confirmed that ICSID would provide such services and sent the terms thereof. On 26 June 2017, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the terms of the administration services of ICSID.\n\n**B. The First Procedural Hearing and the Confidentiality Order**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, the Tribunal held a first procedural hearing with the Parties via conference-call.\n\n22.\n\nFollowing this first procedural hearing, on 18 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\"), embodying the agreements of the Parties and the decisions of the Tribunal on disputed procedural matters. PO1 provided, *inter alia,* that the applicable arbitration rules would be the UNCITRAL Rules, except to the extent that they are modified by Section B, Chapter 11 of NAFTA, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceedings would be Toronto, Canada. PO1 also established rules on the confidentiality and publication of documents (which would be developed in a subsequent procedural order), the procedural calendar and a document production schedule. The Parties also confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that neither party had an objection to the appointment of any of its members.\n\n23.\n\nAs envisaged in PO1, on 11 August 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal on the Confidentiality Order. On 30 August 2017, the Parties submitted a joint proposal on the Confidentiality Order reflecting the agreements and disagreements between the Parties. On 7 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**Confidentiality Order**\"), indicating the procedures governing the designation of confidential information and the preparation of redacted copies of documents for publication.\n\n**C. The Parties\u2019 First Round of Written Pleadings and Document Production Requests**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn accordance with the document production schedule included in PO1, and following exchanges between the Parties, on 12 September 2017, Claimant filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents (\"**Claimant\u2019s First Request for Documents**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn 28 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"**PO3**\"), deciding on Claimant's outstanding document production requests. In PO3, the Tribunal accepted a number of Claimant's requests and asked Respondent to confirm that it had undertaken and would undertake a good faith effort to search for the documents responsive to certain others.\n\n26.\n\nOn 25 October 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the IFT had completed a new search diligently and in good faith without finding other responsive documents. Respondent made additional observations regarding PO3.\n\n27.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's invitation, on 1 November 2017, Claimant sent his comments on Respondent's communication of 25 October 2017, stating that Respondent had failed to comply with PO3. Claimant also indicated that Respondent's officials had intimidated one of Claimant's witness and requested a procedural hearing to evaluate Respondent's conduct. In light of these allegations and Claimant's request for a procedural hearing, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide comments.\n\n28.\n\nOn 7 November 2017, pursuant to the procedural calendar established in PO1, Claimant filed his Statement of Claim (\"**Statement of Claim**\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 15 November 2017, Respondent denied having failed to comply with PO3. Respondent also stated that it was not aware of any witness interference and offered to conduct a more thorough investigation should the Tribunal request it.\n\n30.\n\nOn 23 November 2017, the Tribunal asked Respondent to provide answers to a list of issues that were still unclear for the Tribunal. On 30 November 2017, Respondent provided such answers.\n\n31.\n\nOn 6 December 2017, at the Tribunal's request, Claimant submitted his comments on Respondent's answers of 30 November 2017, explaining that Respondent had provided incomplete answers because it did not comment on relevant IFT internal regulations. The Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on these internal regulations and Claimant to submit a brief comment afterwards.\n\n32.\n\nIn the aforementioned communication of 6 December 2017, Claimant reiterated his request to hold a procedural hearing and stated that he could share more information on the allegations of witness interference through an *in-camera* process. The Tribunal invited Claimant to provide more details and Respondent to comment on Claimant's requests afterwards.\n\n33.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's invitation, the Parties submitted their final comments on the above referred issues on 18 and 22 December 2017.\n\n34.\n\nOn 2 January 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO4**\") where, *inter alia*, the Tribunal: (i) asked Respondent for additional information regarding the search conducted to find the documents requested by Claimant; (ii) deemed unnecessary to schedule a separate hearing to discuss document production as well as an *ex parte* hearing *in camera* regarding the alleged interference with a witness; and, (iii) directed Respondent to produce a draft of Decree 77, or explain why it could not be produced.\n\n35.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, Respondent filed its response to the Tribunal's request in PO4. On 22 January 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide additional information on whether it conducted a search or requested responsive documents within the IFT Plenary, the IFT Commissioners and their offices and what was the result of such search or request. Respondent filed its response on 26 January 2018 and on 1 February 2018, the Tribunal ordered Respondent to produce all responsive documents found in the IFT Commissioner's offices.\n\n36.\n\nIn accordance with the document production schedule, and following exchanges between the Parties, on 5 January 2018, Respondent filed its first request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents (\"**Respondent's First Request for Documents**\").\n\n37.\n\nClaimant objected to a number of documents requested by Respondent on the basis of Article 9(2)(b) of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (\"**IBA Rules**\"), and invoked both provisions of U.S. and Mexican law on privilege.\n\n38.\n\nOn 12 January 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to submit by 17 January 2018 a brief with his comments on (i) the criteria to select the applicable law to the issue of privilege (Mexican or U.S. law); and (ii) Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Mexican and U.S. law on privilege. The Tribunal also invited Respondent to submit its comments on Claimant\u2019s brief by 23 January 2018. The Tribunal also directed Claimant to prepare a privilege log for each document in respect of which he claimed privilege and to share it with Respondent. Respondent was granted an opportunity to respond to the privilege log.\n\n39.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, on 17 January 2018, Claimant submitted his views on applicable law on issues of privilege, and his comments on Mexico\u2019s responses on interpretation of Mexican and US law on privileges. On 23 January 2018, Respondent submitted its comments in response. A second round of written comments was submitted by the Parties on 29 January 2018 and 1 February 2018, respectively. Additionally, on 2 February 2018, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal Claimant\u2019s Privilege Log with Respondent\u2019s comments.\n\n40.\n\nOn 13 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, on Respondent\u2019s First Request for Documents.\n\n41.\n\nOn 21 February 2018, Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal asking for a one-month extension for the filing of its Statement of Defense. By email of 23 February 2018, Claimant agreed to a two-week extension which was confirmed by the Tribunal on 6 March 2018.\n\n42.\n\nOn 14 March 2018, and in accordance with the agreed two-week extension, Respondent filed its Statement of Defense (\"**Statement of Defense**\").\n\n**D. The Parties\u2019 Second Round of Written Pleadings and Document Production Requests**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 1 May 2018, Claimant submitted to the Tribunal his second request for production of documents (\"**Claimant\u2019s Second Request for Documents**\").\n\n44.\n\nOn 9 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on Claimant's Second Request for Documents.\n\n45.\n\nOn 24 May 2018, the Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement to extend the deadline for the submission of Claimant's Reply to Respondent's Statement of Defense (\"**Reply**\").\n\n46.\n\nOn 5 June 2018, Claimant filed his Reply.\n\n47.\n\nOn 8 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 clarifying the deadline for the submission of the Redfern Schedules to the Tribunal and amending Section 18.11 of PO1 accordingly.\n\n48.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties, on 17 July 2018, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal its second request for production of documents (\"**Respondent's Second Request for Documents**\").\n\n49.\n\nOn 9 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (\"**PO8**\") on Respondent's Second Request for Documents.\n\n50.\n\nOn 14 August 2018, with a view to maintain an orderly conduct of the proceedings, the Tribunal proposed to amend the procedural calendar in order to (i) include a deadline for the submissions of non-disputing NAFTA Parties; (ii) set the new deadline for the submission of Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits (\"**Rejoinder**\"); and (iii) fix the dates for the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits (the \"**Hearing**\").\n\n51.\n\nOn 16 August 2018, Respondent requested a three-week extension for the filing of its Rejoinder based on different grounds, including the fact that Claimant had yet to produce the Call Detail Records (\"**CDRs**\") in accordance with the terms set forth in PO8.\n\n52.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the United States of America requested an extension of the deadline for the filing of non-disputing Party submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128.\n\n53.\n\nOn 22 August 2018, Claimant objected to Respondent's request for an extension to file the Rejoinder and explained, among other things, that the Parties had not reached an agreement regarding the production of the CDRs.\n\n54.\n\nOn 27 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, suspending the deadline for filing the Rejoinder, inviting the Parties to reach an agreement on the applicable procedure to produce the CDRs, and informing the Parties that in the absence of an agreement, the Tribunal would make the corresponding decisions.\n\n55.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, the Parties reported to the Tribunal that they had reached an agreement on the terms of production of the CDRs and on the deadline for the submission of the Rejoinder. They also requested the Tribunal to formalize the Parties' agreement in a procedural order and confirmed that on that same date the CDRs had been transferred to Respondent.\n\n56.\n\nOn 4 September 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, which: (i) formalized the Parties' agreement on the terms of production of the CDRs and the deadline for the submission of the Rejoinder; (ii) lifted the suspension for filing the Rejoinder; (iii) granted the deadline extension requested by the United States of America and set the date for filing non-disputing Party submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128; and (iv) amended the procedural calendar accordingly.\n\n57.\n\nOn 10 September 2018, pursuant to the amended procedural calendar, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder, accompanied, *inter alia*, by an expert report of Dr. Paolo Buccirossi (the \"**Buccirossi Report**\").\n\n58.\n\nOn 28 September 2018, Claimant requested the Tribunal to reject the Buccirossi Report on the grounds that it (i) violated PO1 and (ii) contravened Claimant's rights to equal treatment and a full opportunity to present his case. Pursuant to the Tribunal's invitation, Respondent submitted its comments to Claimant's request on 5 October 2018.\n\n59.\n\nOn 22 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (\"**PO11**\"), granting Claimant an opportunity to reply to the Buccirossi Report and to submit evidence, but solely to rebut the new material contained in the Buccirossi Report and referring to earlier reports submitted by Claimant with his Statement of Claim.\n\n60.\n\nOn 8 November 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Secretariat had not received non-disputing party applications or non-disputing NAFTA Party submissions in connection with this arbitration.\n\n61.\n\nOn 27 November 2018, in accordance with PO11, Claimant submitted the expert reports of Dr. Christian Dippon from NERA Economic Consulting, and Dr. Elisa Mariscal from Global Economic Group in response to the Buccirossi Report.\n\n**E.The Organization of the Hearing and Mr. Blanco\u2019s Withdrawal as Claimant**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nOn 9 January 2019, pursuant to the procedural calendar as amended by agreement of the Parties, both Parties submitted their respective lists of the witnesses and experts they intended to call for cross-examination at the Hearing.\n\n63.\n\nIn accordance with Section 21.3 of PO1, on 30 January 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it wished to question Dr. Pablo Buccirossi, expert for Respondent, during the Hearing. On this same day, Respondent informed the Tribunal of its decision not to cross-examine certain witnesses.\n\n64.\n\nPursuant to Section 22 of PO1, on 1 February 2019, the Tribunal notified the Parties of its availability to conduct a pre-hearing conference call and circulated a draft agenda, inviting the Parties to submit a joint proposal advising the Tribunal of any agreements they were able to reach. On 5 February 2019, the Tribunal also invited the Parties to submit the lists of witnesses or experts they intended to call for direct examination at the Hearing.\n\n65.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, on 12 February 2019 the Parties submitted the lists of witnesses and experts that each one intended to call for direct examination, and on 20 March 2019, the Parties submitted their joint proposal on the draft agenda for the pre-hearing conference call, which included their agreement to submit a joint chronology of events (\"**Joint Chronology of Events**\") before the Hearing. As the Parties had reached an agreement on almost all relevant issues, on 25 March 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the pre-hearing conference call foreseen in PO1 was deemed unnecessary and was therefore cancelled.\n\n66.\n\nOn 26 March 2019, Claimant's counsel notified Respondent and the Tribunal of a finding that Mr. Jorge Luis Blanco filed for bankruptcy in 2011 under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and that Mr. Blanco inadvertently failed to disclose his interests at the time in Tele F\u00e1cil. Claimant's counsel further informed that, as a result of such filing and the circumstances surrounding it, Mr. Blanco was not, as of the date of Claimant's counsel letter, the owner of his original shareholdings in Tele F\u00e1cil and that the steps required to remedy the situation created by the filing for bankruptcy could not be completed during the time available before the Hearing. Claimant's counsel stated that Mr. Blanco did not want to unnecessarily delay or complicate the arbitration and, consequently had instructed counsel to withdraw Mr. Blanco as a claimant in these proceedings. However, Mr. Blanco would continue to participate as a fact witness in support of Mr. Nelson and Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\n67.\n\nBy letter dated 27 March 2019, Respondent posed various questions to Claimant regarding Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy filing. Claimant responded to such questions by letter dated 29 March 2019.\n\n68.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the Centre transmitted to the Parties a communication on behalf of the U.S. Government requesting to attend the Hearing, together with the affirmative response sent on behalf of the Tribunal.\n\n69.\n\nBy letter of 3 April 2019, Respondent indicated that it was likely that it would have to change its defense on jurisdiction based on the new facts regarding the bankruptcy of Mr. Blanco that was only informed to the Tribunal and Respondent in Claimant's letter of 29 March 2019. Respondent also indicated that it may have to initiate judicial proceedings seeking the annulment of the transfer of shares of Tele F\u00e1cil to Mr. Nelson made on 26 March 2016, unless Claimant was willing to accept that on the date of the NoA Mr. Nelson's participation as shareholder in the capital of Tele F\u00e1cil was 40%.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter dated 5 April 2019, Claimant's counsel alleged, *inter alia*, that Mr. Blanco's withdrawal as claimant in this arbitration would not affect the status of Mr. Nelson's 60% shareholding because his share increase occurred through a transaction that did not involve Mr. Blanco and that was done in accordance with Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws. Claimant's counsel further indicated that Mr. Blanco's withdrawal as claimant has no impact whatsoever on Mr. Nelson's standing to claim in this arbitration and on Respondent's position in the arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nRespondent replied on 8 April 2019 requesting authorization to amend its defense to include new jurisdictional objections based on the new facts regarding the bankruptcy and requested that the Tribunal either postpone submissions on jurisdiction until after the Hearing or postpone the Hearing.\n\n72.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties submitted the Joint Chronology of Events.\n\n73.\n\nBy letter of 9 April 2019, Claimant' counsel reiterated that Mr. Blanco's current status has no bearing on Mr. Nelson's standing to claim on his own behalf or on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil and that the issue of whether or not additional briefings on the matter were required should be decided at the close of the Hearing. Finally, Claimant' counsel indicated that Mr. Blanco withdrew as claimant to minimize any potential disruption to the Hearing and that, to the extent that the Tribunal permits Respondent to present a new defense, Mr. Blanco reserved his right to be reinstated as a claimant if and when the bankruptcy court abandons Mr. Blanco's shares back to him.\n\n74.\n\nOn 10 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 concerning the organization of the Hearing.\n\n75.\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to issue an order for the termination of the proceedings with respect to Mr. Blanco, pursuant to Article 34.2 of the UNCITRAL Rules. On the same date, Claimant's counsel replied referring to the reservation of rights made in their letter of 9 April 2019 and requested that the Tribunal's order terminating the proceedings with respect to Mr. Blanco be made either conditionally or be delayed until the course of action with respect to the treatment of Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy is determined at the end of the Hearing.\n\n76.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, Respondent reiterated the need to file additional jurisdictional objections and opposed to Claimant's proposal that the Tribunal's order terminating the proceedings with respect to Mr. Blanco be made conditionally or be delayed until Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy is resolved. Respondent added that the withdrawal of Mr. Blanco as a claimant was unconditional and must be treated as such. According to Respondent, if Mr. Blanco was no longer being withdrawn as a claimant, or was conditionally withdrawn or if the election to withdraw him as a claimant was deferred to the end of the Hearing, this would cause serious prejudice to Respondent. A fundamental right of Respondent is to know who is or are the claimant parties before the Hearing. If Claimant\u2019s requests were granted, then Respondent would be denied procedural fairness. Respondent concluded that if the issue of Mr. Blanco\u2019s status as a claimant was not defined before the Hearing, Respondent would not agree to proceed to the Hearing on the merits prior to the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Respondent stressed that it categorically opposed allowing Mr. Blanco\u2019s status as a claimant to continue as an outstanding issue to the detriment of Respondent\u2019s defense.\n\n77.\n\nOn 17 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, accepting Mr. Blanco\u2019s withdrawal as co-claimant in this arbitration, and notifying the Parties that the consequences of Mr. Blanco\u2019s withdrawal would be addressed by the Tribunal with the Parties at the Hearing. Consequently, Mr. Blanco was removed from the list of claimants.\n\n**F.

However, the Parties did not agree on the scope of the submission regarding the withdrawal. Respondent intended to address: (a) whether the transfer of the shares to Mr. Nelson dated 29 March 2016 is valid in light of the circumstances that resulted in Mr. Blanco's withdrawal and the implications of the foregoing for this arbitration (the \"**Share Transfer Issue**\"); and (2) whether *de facto* control suffices as a matter of law for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117 and whether Mr. Nelson has *de facto* control of Tele F\u00e1cil (the \"***De Facto*** **Issue**\"). Claimant in turn considered that Respondent only needed to address the Share Transfer Issue because the *De Facto* Issue had already been thoroughly briefed in this process.\n\n82.\n\nOn 17 May 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (\"**PO14**\") where it decided: (i) to approve the agreement of the Parties on one round of simultaneous post-hearing briefs and one round of consecutive submissions on Mr. Blanco's withdrawal; and (ii) to allow the Parties to address the *Share Transfer Issue* as well as the *De Facto Issue* in their submissions regarding Mr. Blanco's withdrawal.\n\n83.\n\nIn accordance with PO14, on 13 June 2019 Respondent filed its submission on Mr. Blanco's withdrawal. This submission was Respondent's Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal (\"**Jurisdictional Objection**\").\n\n84.\n\nOn the same date, and within the agreed deadline, the Parties submitted the Joint Chronology of *Amparos* requested by the Tribunal at the Hearing.\n\n85.\n\nOn 1 July 2019, Claimant informed the Tribunal about a disagreement between the Parties regarding the procedure and timing of the post-hearing submissions related to Mr. Blanco's withdrawal. On 3 July 2019, Respondent replied to Claimant's request.\n\n86.\n\nOn 9 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (\"**PO15**\") which, *inter alia*, provided that (a) if Claimant intended to present arguments and evidence on Mr. Blanco's withdrawal not in the evidentiary record at the time of issuance of PO14, the Parties had to confer and agree on a new procedural calendar by 22 July 2019; and (b) if Claimant did not intend to submit new arguments and evidence on Mr. Blanco's withdrawal, the procedural calendar determined by the Tribunal in PO14 would be maintained.\n\n87.\n\nOn 15 July 2019, Claimant informed the Tribunal and Respondent about his intention to submit arguments and evidence on Mr. Blanco's withdrawal not in the evidentiary record at the time of issuance of PO14.\n\n88.\n\nOn 16 July 2019, Claimant reported areas of agreement and disagreement between the Parties on the new procedural calendar and requested the Tribunal's intervention to resolve the disagreements. On 19 July 2019, Respondent submitted its comments on Claimant's report.\n\n89.\n\nOn 24 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 (\"**PO16**\") deciding on the disagreement between the Parties, in the following terms:\n\na) Claimant could, no later than 15 August 2019:\n\ni. Submit new arguments and evidence regarding the bankruptcy order of 29 May 2019 issued by the Judge for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in relation to Mr. Blanco (the \"**Bankruptcy Order**\").\n\nii. Submit, in connection with the *De Facto* and the Share Transfer Issues, factual documents that were previously produced in this arbitration, though not submitted as exhibits into the record of this arbitration, and expert reports as well as legal authorities on the matter, provided that they are based on the evidentiary record existing at the time PO14 was issued.\n\nb) Respondent could, no later than 19 October 2019:\n\ni. Submit new arguments and evidence regarding the Bankruptcy Order in response to Claimant's submission of August 15, 2019.\n\nii. Amend its jurisdictional objections to (i) include the Bankruptcy Order and submit new arguments and evidence regarding the Bankruptcy Order; and (ii) address the *De Facto* and the Share Transfer Issues and introduce in connection therewith factual documents that were previously produced in this arbitration, though not submitted into the record of this arbitration, and expert reports as well as legal authorities, provided that they are based on the evidentiary record existing at the time PO14 was issued.\n\nc) Claimant could submit his response to the amended objections on jurisdiction no later than 8 December 2019.\n\nd) No new arguments or evidence not related to the above issues could be submitted without previous authorization from the Tribunal.\n\n90.\n\nIn accordance with PO15, on 15 August 2019 both Parties submitted their post-hearing briefs (\"**Post-Hearing Briefs**\") and, in accordance with PO16, Claimant filed his Response to Respondent's Objection to Jurisdiction (\"**Response to the Jurisdictional Objection**\").\n\n91.\n\nIn accordance with PO16, on 19 October 2019, the Respondent submitted its Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (\"**Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection**\") and, on 27 November 2019, the Claimant submitted his response to Respondent's Amended Jurisdictional Objections (\"**Response to the Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection**\").\n\n92.\n\nOn 15 January 2020, the Parties submitted their respective statements of costs (\"**Statements of Costs**\").\n\n93.\n\nBy letter of 9 March 2020, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties of the passing of Mr. Veeder on 8 March 2020. The remaining arbitrators, Dr. Zuleta and Mr. Gomezperalta, invited the Parties to hold a conference call to discuss the next steps in the proceeding, which was held on 20 March 2020.\n\n94.\n\nDuring the conference call of 20 March 2020, Dr. Zuleta and Mr. Gomezperalta explained that: (a) after the Hearing on jurisdiction and the merits held on 22 \u2013 26 April 2019, the Tribunal deliberated in person and by email and reached a unanimous decision; (b) a draft award was circulated on 21 February 2020; (c) Mr. V.V. Veeder approved the circulated award as drafted on 3 March 2020; (d) after the passing of arbitrator Mr. V.V. Veeder on 8 March 2020, one of the remaining arbitrators considered that some adjustments should be made to the draft award to clarify specific sections of the text; and (e) such adjustments do not change the unanimous decision taken in the deliberations or the main rationale and the decision contained in the draft award approved by Mr. V.V. Veeder.\n\n95.\n\nDuring the conference call, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the following alternatives to continue this arbitration and issue the corresponding award:\n\n(1) The two remaining arbitrators would introduce the adjustments proposed by one of them to clarify specific sections of the draft award and thereafter the remaining arbitrators, Dr. Zuleta and Mr. Gomezperalta, would sign the award. Pursuant to Article 32(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the award will indicate that Mr. V.V. Veeder approved the decision but passed away before signing the award; or\n\n(2) The Tribunal would be reconstituted, a new arbitrator would be appointed by the Claimant, and the Tribunal so reconstituted would decide, in consultation with the Parties, the stage at which the new Tribunal would resume proceedings and conclude the arbitration.\n\n96.\n\nThe discussions held during the conference call were recorded in a letter sent to the Parties on 24 March 2020, in which the remaining arbitrators reiterated their invitation for the Parties to agree on one of the alternatives and proposed a second conference call in which the Parties would inform as to whether an agreement was reached.\n\n97.\n\nFurther to the aforesaid letter, the Parties and the Arbitral Tribunal held a second conference call on 26 March 2020. During this second conference call the Parties informed the Arbitral Tribunal that they had agreed with Option 1 of the letter of 24 March 2020. The terms of the Parties' agreement were summarized in a letter to the Parties dated 31 March 2020 as follows:\n\n*1. The two remaining arbitrators, Messrs. Eduardo Zuleta and Mariano Gomezperalta, will introduce in the award the adjustments proposed by one of them after the passing of arbitrator V.V. Veeder to clarify specific sections of the draft award.*\n\n*2. The adjustments will be introduced in footnotes that will identify each one of them. Correction of typographical errors will be made directly in the text of the award.*\n\n*3. After completing the adjustments and the Spanish version of the award, containing the same adjustments in footnotes, the remaining arbitrators, Messrs. Eduardo Zuleta and Mariano Gomezperalta, will sign the award.*\n\n*4. Pursuant to Article 32(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the award will indicate that Mr. V.V. Veeder approved the decision but passed away before signing the award.*\n\n*5. The Tribunal confirms that it is agreeable, upon request by either Party, to sharing a copy of Mr. V.V. Veeder's email to the President of the Tribunal of March 3, 2020 confirming his approval to the draft award.*\n\n98.\n\nBy emails of 4 and 7 April 2020, the Parties confirmed that the 31 March 2020 letter reflected the agreement reached by the Parties on the treatment of the award after Mr. Veeder's passing.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n99.\n\nMr. Joshua Dean Nelson and Mr. Jorge Luis Blanco, nationals of the United States of America, together with Mr. Miguel Sacasa, a national of Mexico, wanted to enter and participate in the telecommunications market of Mexico.2 For such purposes, on 7 January 2010, they incorporated Tele F\u00e1cil under the laws of, and domiciled in, Mexico.3\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding by and between Jorge Blanco, Joshua Nelson and Miguel Sacasa (20 July 2009) (\"**Memorandum of Understanding**\"); NoA, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18; Amended NoA, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, 23; Statement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 50; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 1.\n\n**C-014**, Public Deed No. 16,778 containing Tele F\u00e1cil's incorporation (7 January 2010).\n\n100.\n\nBy 2010, the Mexican Federal Telecommunications Law (\"**FTL**\") restricted foreign ownership of telecommunication concessions to 49%.4 Therefore Mr. Nelson, Mr. Blanco and Mr. Sacasa agreed on the following:\n\na) Mr. Nelson and Mr. Blanco would own respectively, 40% and 9% of Tele F\u00e1cil and Mr. Sacasa would own 51%.5\n\nb) Mr. Nelson would be the primary financial investor in the company and in exchange for his investment he would receive 60% of the profits.6\n\nc) Mr. Nelson would assume majority control of Tele F\u00e1cil once Mexican law permitted him to do so.7\n\n**CL-001**, FTL (7 June 1995), Article 12 (stating that \"[\u2026] concessions referred to in this Law shall only be granted to individuals and entities of Mexican nationality. The participation of foreign investment, in no case will exceed the 49 percent, except for mobile telephony. For this case, a favorable resolution by the National Commission of Foreign Investment will be required, so that the foreign investment may participate in a larger percentage.\").\n\n**C-014**, Public Deed No. 16,778 containing Tele F\u00e1cil's incorporation (7 January 2010), First Transitory Clause; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 1.\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding (20 July 2009), pp. 1-2.\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding (20 July 2009), p. 1; **C-001**, Witness Statement of Joshua Dean Nelson (2 November 2017), \u00b6 31; **C-002**, Witness Statement of Jorge Blanco (3 November 2017), \u00b6 20; **C-003**, First Witness Statement of Miguel Sacasa (3 November 2017) (\"**Sacasa First Statement**\"), \u00b6 18; **C-004**, First Witness Statement of Carlos Bello (6 November 2017) (\"**Bello First Statement**\"), \u00b6 18.\n\n101.\n\nOn 25 August 2011, Mr. Blanco filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida without identifying his shares in Tele F\u00e1cil as an asset of the bankruptcy estate.8 On 2 December 2011, Mr. Blanco was discharged of the bankruptcy proceeding.9\n\nClaimant's communication of 29 March 2019; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 1. *See also*, **R-86**, Claimant's correspondence to Tribunal (26 March 2019).\n\nClaimant's communication of 29 March 2019; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 1.\n\n102.\n\nUnder Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, once Mr. Blanco filed for bankruptcy, an estate was created and all of Mr. Blanco's legal and equitable interests, whether disclosed or not, became property of that estate.10 Mr. Blanco's shares in Tele F\u00e1cil became part of the bankruptcy estate, but because they were not disclosed in the bankruptcy proceedings, they could not be administered by the appointed trustee and abandoned back to Mr. Blanco once discharged of the proceedings. As such, they remained the property of the estate even after the case closed, on 2 December 2011.11\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 9.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 9.\n\n103.\n\nOn 21 February 2012, Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy proceeding was closed and Ms. Marcia T.

Under Mexican law, interconnection of telecom networks, interconnection rates and interconnection's terms and conditions are of public interest (\"*orden p\u00fablico e inter\u00e9s social*\").16\n\n**CL-004**, FTBL, Article 125.\n\n107.\n\nTele F\u00e1cil decided to interconnect with Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico and Tel\u00e9fonos del Noroeste (jointly, \"**Telmex**\"), the largest telecommunications carrier in Mexico, on an indirect interconnection basis so that Tele F\u00e1cil could route its traffic through a larger carrier, which had already established sufficient capacity with Telmex and was able to lease excess capacity to Tele F\u00e1cil to indirectly deliver traffic to Telmex. Tele F\u00e1cil selected Nextel to indirectly interconnect to Telmex's network through Nextel.17\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 11.\n\n108.\n\nTele F\u00e1cil therefore prearranged an indirect interconnection scheme.18 This scheme required \"one direct interconnection with one of the concessionaires [\u2026] to use its network and circuits in order to reach the rest of the concessionaires 'indirectly.'\"19 Tele F\u00e1cil commenced negotiations with Nextel and simultaneously requested interconnection with Telmex.20\n\n**R-003**, Letter explaining Tele F\u00e1cil's interconnection scheme (8 November 2013), pp. 1-2.\n\n**R-003**, Letter explaining Tele F\u00e1cil's interconnection scheme (8 November 2013), p. 1.\n\n**C-058**, Request to initiate negotiations of interconnection submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil to Telmex (7 August 2013); **C-003**, Sacasa First Statement (3 November 2017), \u00b6 59; **C-004**, Bello First Statement (6 November 2017), \u00b6 61.\n\n109.\n\nOn 11 June 2013, Mexico enacted several amendments to the Mexican Constitution on telecommunication matters.

According to Respondent, under NAFTA Article 1117, Claimant had to control Tele F\u00e1cil, direct or indirectly, when he submitted the claim to arbitration, but that was not the case.\n\n148.\n\nOn this basis, Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\na) \"Determine that Mr. Nelson has no procedural legitimacy to file a claim on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil and, reject the claim submitted under Article 1117 in its entirety;\n\nb) Order the Claimant to indemnify the Respondent for the costs incurred at this jurisdictional stage.\"97\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 83. *See also* Jurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 86.\n\n**(2) Claimant's response on jurisdiction and request for relief**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nOn the matter of jurisdiction, Claimant alleges that he has standing to claim under Article 1117 because he had legal control of Tele F\u00e1cil by the time he submitted the claim to arbitration and in any case, he also had *de facto* control of the company.\n\n150.\n\nOn this basis, Claimant requests the following relief, as regards jurisdiction:\n\na) a decision that Respondent's original and amended objection to jurisdiction is dismissed on all counts; and\n\nb) an award of costs in favor of Claimant in connection with its response to Respondent's original and amended objection to jurisdiction.98\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6 74. *See also* Response to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 91.\n\n**B. PARTIES' CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF ON THE MERITS**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimant's claims on the merits and request for relief**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nOn the merits, Claimant alleges that Respondent expropriated his investments in breach of NAFTA Article 1110. Claimant groups his investments in two different types, namely (i) corporate rights, defined as the right to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate of USD 0.00975; and (ii) shareholders rights, understood as his rights of share ownership and to a return on Tele F\u00e1cil's profits.99\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 365.\n\n152.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the measures that resulted in the expropriation are three: (i) the confirmation of criteria proceedings initiated by the Compliance Unit of the IFT that allegedly avoided the enforcement of Resolution 381; (ii) Decree 77 through which Resolution 381 was allegedly repudiated and; (iii) Resolution 127 that according to Claimant imposed a new rate detrimental to Tele F\u00e1cil but favorable to Telmex. These three measures are seen by Claimant as a three-part scheme which deprived Claimant's investments of all economic viability.\n\n153.\n\nClaimant also alleges that Respondent breached its obligation under NAFTA Article 1105 to grant investors a fair and equitable treatment. Claimant contends that both the IFT and the Mexican courts acted in an unfair and inequitable way towards his investment.\n\n154.\n\nAs far as the IFT is concerned, Claimant alleges that the confirmation of criteria requested by its Compliance Unit and the *Pleno* 's Decree 77 were arbitrary and lacked due process. Claimant also adds that Decree 77 was discriminatory. Finally, Claimant refers to IFT's Resolution 127 as a \"direct consequence of the IFT's arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele F\u00e1cil\" and \"derivatively [also in breach of] Article 1105.\"100\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 597.\n\n155.\n\nRegarding the Mexican courts, Claimant alleges that the Specialized Telecommunications Court that decided Tele F\u00e1cil's *amparo* action against Decree 77 acted with gross incompetence101 and that the Appellate Court unjustifiably denied Tele F\u00e1cil access to justice.102\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 613-628.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 629-640.\n\n156.\n\nOn this basis, Claimant requests the following relief:\n\na) A final declaration that Respondent has breached its obligations to Claimant under NAFTA;\n\nb) An order that Respondent pays Claimant compensation for his losses that by the time the Statement of Claim was filed, were quantified at USD 472,148,929;\n\nc) An order that Respondent pays Claimant pre-award compound interest, at a commercially reasonable rate or such other rate determined by the applicable law;\n\nd) An order that Respondent pays Claimant post-award compound interest, at a commercially reasonable rate or such other rate determined by the applicable law, until the date the compensation is actually paid;\n\ne) An order that Respondent pays the costs of this arbitration proceeding, including the costs of the Tribunal and the legal and other costs incurred by Claimant, on a full indemnity basis, together with interest on such costs, in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal; and\n\nf) Such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n**(2) Respondent's defenses on the merits and request for relief**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nRespondent denies a breach of NAFTA Article 1110 for several reasons. Respondent contends that Claimant's alleged rights are not protected under NAFTA, Claimant can only challenge the measures taken by the IFT as a denial of justice under Article 1105 and, in any case, Claimant did not show a radical deprivation of the economic value of his rights.\n\n158.\n\nRespondent also denies a breach of NAFTA Article 1105 for various reasons. First, Respondent's position is that Claimant can only challenge the IFT measures under a denial of justice claim. In any case, Respondent denies that the IFT acted in an arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele F\u00e1cil and that its courts incurred in denial of justice.\n\n159.\n\nOn this basis, Respondent requests the Arbitral Tribunal to dismiss all of Claimant's claims, in their entirety, and order Claimant to indemnify Respondent for the arbitration costs, including travel expenses of its legal team, witnesses and experts.\n\n160.\n\nThe respective positions of the Parties in relation to the issues presented in the arbitration, both on matters of jurisdiction and merits, will be synthesized throughout this decision and as the issues raised are resolved by the Tribunal. The Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has considered all of the Parties' arguments, both written and oral. The fact that an argument is not expressly summarized in the synthesis of the Parties' positions should not be considered as an indication that the Tribunal has not considered such argument.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n161.\n\nRespondent objects the Tribunal's jurisdiction to decide the claim submitted by Claimant on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil103 under NAFTA Article 1117. Respondent understands the word \"owns\" in NAFTA Article 1117 as \"full ownership\"104 and the word \"controls\" as only covering \"legal control of the enterprise\",105 meaning that *de facto* control is excluded. As further explained below, Respondent's position is that Claimant neither owned nor legally controlled Tele F\u00e1cil at the time the arbitration claim was filed and therefore lacked standing to sue Mexico. Respondent also alleges that assuming the word \"controls\" also covers *de facto* control, Claimant did not have it either.106\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 1.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 67. *See also*, Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 71; Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 64.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 3, 68; Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 82.\n\n162.\n\nFor Respondent, \"full ownership\" of an enterprise means having 100% of its shares.107 Since Claimant did not own 100% of the shares in Tele F\u00e1cil when the arbitration claim was submitted, Respondent's position is that under NAFTA Article 1117 Claimant did not have \"full ownership\" of Tele F\u00e1cil.108\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 67.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 67.\n\n163.\n\nFurther, for Respondent \"legal control of the enterprise\" means legal corporate control of a company under the *lex situs* (*i.e*., Mexican law in this case). Therefore, if Article 178 of the Mexican General Law of Mercantile Companies (\"**GLMC**\") states that legal control of an anonymous corporation \u2014 such as Tele F\u00e1cil \u2014 resides in the General Shareholders Meeting,109 whoever controlled the General Shareholders Meeting of Tele F\u00e1cil at the time the arbitration claim was submitted had control of the enterprise under NAFTA Article 1117. Mr. Nelson, however, did not control Tele F\u00e1cil's General Shareholders Meeting at the time the arbitration claim was submitted because he was a minority shareholder \u2014 with only 40% of the company's shares \u2014.110\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 71-75.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 53.\n\n164.\n\nAlthough in the extraordinary shareholders meeting of 29 March 2016, Messrs. Blanco, Nelson and Sacasa intended to approve a corporate restructuring to increase Mr. Nelson's shareholding from 40% to 60% \u2014 what would have caused Mr. Nelson to have legal control of the company \u2014, Respondent states that this meeting was null and of no legal effect.111 According to Respondent, Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy petition of 25 August 2011 caused him to lose his shares and, as a result, since that day, he lost his right to vote in the shareholders meetings.112\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 6, 41, 44, 47-49, 52; Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 6. *See also*, Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 45.\n\n165.\n\nRespondent obtained an expert report from Mexican legal expert Mr. Rodrigo Buj to address whether the increase of Mr. Nelson's shares on 29 March 2016 was valid under Mexican law. Buj's conclusion is that it was not. *First*, the procedure provided for in the Eleventh Clause of Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws establishes that shares of restricted circulation can only be transferred with the shareholders' approval.113 However, the Third Clause of the Transfer of Shares Contract shows that the approval was granted by the Board of Directors, not the shareholders.114*Second*, GLMC Articles 186, 187 and 188 require that prior to an ordinary shareholder meeting, a summon be published 15 days in advance. This requirement does not apply only when all shareholders are present (*i.e.*, a \"totalitarian meeting\"). On 29 March 2016, Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy estate was Tele F\u00e1cil's shareholder, not Mr. Blanco himself. Therefore, the 29 March 2016 shareholders meeting was not a meeting in which all shareholders were present and consequently, a prior summon would have been necessary.115 In his fourth report, Mr. Buj underlines an additional ground on which the transfer of shares should be deemed as null and of no legal effect. According to Mr. Buj's fourth report, Tele F\u00e1cil's Shareholders' Registry Corporate Book does not demonstrate that the notification requirements set forth in the Eleventh Clause of Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws were complied with.116\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 48.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 49.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 52.\n\nAccording to Mr. Buj and Respondent, Clause 11 of Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws established that, prior to the transfer of shares, the shareholders had to notify the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors had to notify the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation. *See* Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n166.\n\nAs stated above, Respondent argues that the term \"controls\" in NAFTA Article 1117 does not encompass *de facto* control, *inter alia*, because the term is \"highly subjective\" and \"introduces uncertainty and ambiguity.\"117 However, assuming that this word does encompass *de facto* control, Respondent submits that Claimant did not have such type of control over Tele F\u00e1cil at the time the arbitration claim was submitted.118 Respondent acknowledges that the tribunal's decision in *Thunderbird v. Mexico* (\"***Thunderbird***\"),119 in which Claimant relied, stated that a showing of *de facto* control was sufficient for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1117.120 However, according to Respondent, the facts upon which *de facto* control was found in *Thunderbird* and the requisite evidentiary threshold applied in that case (*i.e.*, \"beyond any reasonable doubt\") are absent in this case.121 According to Respondent, the record shows that Mr. Nelson did not exercise *de facto* control because: (i) his responsibilities in Tele F\u00e1cil were limited to providing initial funding to the company, providing technical and engineering support and providing useful technology;122 and (ii) he did not have day-to-day \"managerial control\"123 or an extensive control over the operations of Tele F\u00e1cil.124\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 66.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 16.\n\n**CL-049**, *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA) (Award, 26 Jan. 2006) (van den Berg, Portal Ariosa, W\u00e4lde) (\"***Thunderbird v. Mexico***\").\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 81; Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 16.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 17. *See also* Jurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 21 (stating that \"Mr. Nelson confirmed that he did not 'make or send' Tele F\u00e1cil's Concession Application\"); \u00b6 23 (stating that \"Mr. Nelson did not participate in negotiations between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex\"). Jurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 38-40 (explaining that in 2013, Mr. Nelson made multiple requests to change the ownership structure of Tele F\u00e1cil but such requests did not materialize until two years and a half later, in March 2016).\n\n167.\n\nRespondent holds that the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings had automatic effects in Mexico. Therefore, it is Respondent's position that (i) the appointed trustee in the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings did not take legal action to dispose of the shares in Tele F\u00e1cil because Mr. Blanco did not disclose the existence of the shares, not because the bankruptcy proceedings did not have automatic effects in Mexico;125 (ii) Article 13 of the Mexican Federal Civil Code states that legal situations validly created in a foreign State must be recognized in Mexico, without having to initiate judicial recognition proceedings;126 and (iii) in any case, Title Twelve of the Mexican Law on Commercial Bankruptcy does not purport to recognize foreign bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico but rather to solicit a \"Mexican court [to] act in cooperation with the foreign court.\"127\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 28.\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 29.\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 30.\n\n168.\n\nRespondent, based in Mr. Buj's opinion, also stresses that the Shareholders' Registry Corporate Book did not determine the ownership of the shares. Accepting the contrary \"would imply granting undue protection to a person who, by their omission, prevented the corresponding entries in the Shareholder's Book and gave legal effect to acts performed by such person as a shareholder of Tele F\u00e1cil without having that status on the date on which those acts were carried out\".128\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 43.\n\n169.\n\nWith respect to Claimant's *nunc pro tunc* argument, Respondent asserts that it is irrelevant.129 According to Respondent, \"the question for this Tribunal is not who should be considered today as the owner of the shares, but who was the owner of those shares when the NOA was filed and when the Totalitarian Assembly took place.\"130 Respondent also claims that the *Eurogas* case brought up by Claimant \"differs materially\" from the present case.131\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 50-63.\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 54 (\u00e9mphasis in original).\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 61.\n\n**(2) Claimant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n170.\n\nClaimant considers that Respondent's objection is unfounded132 because the word \"controls\" in NAFTA Article 1117 includes both, legal and *de facto* control133 and under this provision Mr. Nelson could file an arbitration claim on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil because he had both: (i) legal; and (ii) *de facto* control of Tele F\u00e1cil.134\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 1.\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 26.\n\n171.\n\nAccording to Claimant, under the by-laws of Tele F\u00e1cil and Mexican corporate law, Mr. Nelson had legal control of Tele F\u00e1cil because once Mr. Blanco filed his bankruptcy petition he did not cease to: (i) be a shareholder in Tele F\u00e1cil and, (ii) have the authority to approve the share transfer from Mr. Sacasa to Mr. Nelson.135 Claimant's position is based on three main arguments: (i) that the forfeiture of Mr. Blanco's shares in the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings did not automatically translate into a denial of Mr. Blanco's standing as a shareholder in Tele F\u00e1cil; (ii) that the 2016 share transfer was valid under Mexican law and Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws; and (iii) in any event, Mr. Blanco's share ownership was restored by way of a *nunc pro tunc* order of a U.S. court, thus any possible defect in the 2016 share transfer was repaired.136\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 12, 30.\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 30.\n\n172.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Mr. Blanco's U.S. bankruptcy proceedings did not have automatic effects in Mexico.137 Relying in his legal expert, Mr. Oscar Vasquez, Claimant explains that transnational bankruptcy matters are governed by Article 292 of the Mexican Law of Commercial Bankruptcy, providing for specific judicial proceedings on recognition, which should have been carried out to cause Mr. Blanco to lose his status as a shareholder of Tele F\u00e1cil, as a matter of Mexican law.138\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 31-37.\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 32. *See also* Response to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 27-39.\n\n173.\n\nMoreover, Claimant alleges that the transfer of shares from Mr. Sacasa to Claimant was valid under Mexican law and Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws. Claimant explains that because the results of Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy proceedings were never implemented into the Mexican legal system, the question of Mr. Blanco's status as a shareholder in Tele F\u00e1cil is governed exclusively by Mexican law. Applying the GLMC to the facts, Claimant alleges that there were no defects in the process by which Claimant became the majority shareholder of Tele F\u00e1cil and acquired its legal control because on 29 March 2016 (i) Mr. Blanco was registered as the owner of shares in Tele F\u00e1cil' Shareholders' Registry Corporate Book; (ii) Mr. Blanco possessed the corporate rights allowing him to vote in favor of that transfer, and (iii) since all of Tele F\u00e1cil's shareholders were present the requirement of the prior summon was unnecessary. Further, even if the Tribunal were to accept that Mr. Blanco's U.S. bankruptcy had an effect in Mexico, under Mexican law, company acts are not void simply because they fail to comport with required formalities but rather voidable; for the act to be void a court must determine that it fails to comply with the pertinent requirements.139 In its response on jurisdiction, Claimant also addressed the alleged fourth ground on which the transfer of shares is not valid under Mexican law (*i.e.*, that the notification requirements set forth in the Eleventh Clause of Tele F\u00e1cil's by-laws were not complied with), pointing out Tele F\u00e1cil's Notice of Restructuring and arguing that the transfer of shares was \"duly and timely\" notified to the IFT.140\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 41. *See also* Response to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 40-51.\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6 51.\n\n174.\n\nIn any event, Claimant states that by order of a U.S. bankruptcy judge, Mr. Blanco now owns his shares in Tele F\u00e1cil *nunc pro tunc* (*i.e.*, as of the date of his original bankruptcy petition). This means that as a matter of U.S. law, Mr. Blanco's ownership of Tele F\u00e1cil's shares has existed uninterruptedly and in its entirety since their issuance on 7 January 2010. Thus, the transfer of shares to Claimant is unassailable.141 Based on the *Eurogas v. Slovakia* decision, Claimant maintains that the legal effect of a U.S. bankruptcy order restoring ownership to a debtor *nunc pro tunc* has been recognized in investor-State arbitration.\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 44-53.\n\n175.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserts that the facts in this case also demonstrate that Mr. Nelson exercised *de facto* control over Tele F\u00e1cil at all relevant times during his dispute with Mexico. To justify its position, Claimant first explains why the word \"controls\" in NAFTA Article 1117 can be interpreted to include *de facto* control. According to Claimant, under the principles in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), the term \"control\" includes *de facto* control because: (i) no textual evidence in NAFTA supports a restricted and specialized interpretation of the word \"control\" and therefore it should be interpreted based on its ordinary meaning; (ii) context also confirms that it should be broadly interpreted; (iii) tribunal practice confirms that a showing of *de facto* control is sufficient (citing *Thunderbird*); (iv) moreover, the term \"controlled\" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has been interpreted to mean \"both actual exercise of powers or direction and the rights arising from the ownership of shares\" and; (v) NAFTA Parties have not expressed their agreement with Respondent's interpretation.142\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 55-68; Response to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 54-62.\n\n176.\n\nThen, Claimant refers to Respondent's assertion that *de facto* control must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and states that: (i) there is no provision in NAFTA indicating that this standard applies; and (ii) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules say nothing about the strictness of that burden.\n\n177.\n\nFinally, Claimant refers to the evidence to show that he exercised *de facto* control over Tele F\u00e1cil at all relevant times.143 Based on the definition of *de facto* control in *Thunderbird* (*i.e.*, \"the ability to exercise significant influence on the decision-making\" and being \"the consistent driving force behind [the enterprise's] business\"),144 Claimant sustains that the facts in this case meet such standard because: (i) not only Claimant was the sole financer of Tele F\u00e1cil but in that role, he also provided capital on an iterative basis which means that Tele F\u00e1cil could not act before Claimant's funds were sent; (ii) Mr. Nelson was the exclusive provider of all critical technology for the venture, which means that from a technical perspective, Tele F\u00e1cil could not function without his equipment and know-how. According to Claimant, the fact that the transfer of shares did not take place in 2013, when Claimant requested it, does not mean that there was no *de facto* control; during the Hearing it was demonstrated that the transfer of shares was a simple formality that did not affect Mr. Nelson's interests. Claimant also alleges that the fact of not being in the day-to-day management of the company did not affect his *de facto* control.145\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 65.\n\n**CL-049**, *Thunderbird v. Mexico*, \u00b6 107.\n\nResponse to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 82; Response to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 63-72.\n\n178.\n\nClaimant argues that the argument of Respondent's expert, Mr. Buj, to the effect that U.S. bankruptcy proceedings had automatic effects in Mexico under Article 13 of the Mexican Civil Code is disproved by Claimant's expert, Mr. V\u00e1squez.146 Claimant criticizes as a \"false counterfactual\" Respondent's premise that if Mr. Blanco had disclosed his Tele F\u00e1cil shares in the bankruptcy, such shares would have been disposed of by the bankruptcy estate's trustee.147 Based on his U.S. bankruptcy expert, Ms. Cyganowski, Claimant submits that by the time the bankruptcy petition was filed \"Tele F\u00e1cil was nothing more than a paper company and Mr. Blanco's shares in the company lacked any value\"148 therefore, \"Mr. Blanco's trustee would not have taken the costly steps of selling off his Tele F\u00e1cil shares which had no value to the bankruptcy estate.\"149 Moreover, Claimant also criticizes Respondent's position on the *nunc pro tunc* order stating that \"Respondent wants to have it both ways\" because \"when the results of the U.S. bankruptcy appear to be good for Respondent's case [\u2026] Respondent embraces the alleged automatic effect of the process\" but \"when the results are bad [\u2026] Respondent denies any automatic effect of the bankruptcy in Mexico.\"150\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6 11.\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 13-18.\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6 16.\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6 18.\n\nResponse to Supplemented Jurisdictional Objection (27 November 2019), \u00b6 20.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe issue on jurisdiction before this Tribunal is whether under NAFTA Article 1117 Mr. Nelson could file a claim on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil. As stated above, Respondent's position is that under NAFTA Article 1117 Mr. Nelson does not have standing to assert a claim on behalf of this company. On the contrary, Claimant asserts that he does.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal will first review NAFTA Article 1117, particularly as to the meaning and scope of the term \"controls\" and subsequently, based on such meaning and scope, the Tribunal will determine whether Mr. Nelson actually exercised control over Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\n**(1) Meaning and scope of the word \"controls\" in Article 1117**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nNAFTA Article 1117(1) in its relevant part provides as follows:\n\n*Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise*\n\n*1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation under:*\n\n*(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or*\n\n*(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A, and that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.*\n\n182.\n\nAs stated above, the Parties dispute the meaning and scope of the word \"controls\" in NAFTA Article 1117(1).\n\n183.\n\nTo determine the meaning and scope of the word \"controls,\" the Tribunal will rely on the general rule of interpretation provided for in VCLT Article 31. The Parties seem to agree with this approach and both referred to this rule.151\n\n*See i.e.*, Jurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 62; Response to Jurisdictional Objection (15 August 2019), \u00b6 56.\n\n184.\n\nAccording to VCLT Article 31(1) \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"152\n\nVCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal views VCLT Article 31 as a set of elements for interpretation that are to be appreciated in the context and circumstances of the particular case. This implies that Article 31 as a whole \u2014including all of its paragraphs and not limited to the standpoint of Article 31(1) \u2014 is an integral single rule for interpretation of treaties. This is underscored by the fact that Article 31 is entitled the \"General Rule [in the singular] of Interpretation\".\n\n186.\n\nThis means that the interpreter shall consider the ordinary meaning of the words, in their context, and considering the object and purpose of the treaty. Hence, the starting point of interpretation is the elucidation of the meaning of the text. In this case, the Parties seem to accept, and the Tribunal agrees, that dictionary meanings are of assistance in this process. If the meaning of the text does not reveal a single meaning, the Tribunal must then consider the context of the treaty, its object and purpose.\n\n187.\n\nThe Parties agree that the word \"controls\" encompasses legal or corporate control. However, NAFTA does not define this term. Thus, the Tribunal may resort to the definitions found in dictionaries.\n\n188.\n\nThe Black's Law Dictionary defines \"corporate control\" as:\n\n*1. Ownership of more than 50% of the shares in a corporation. -Also termed effective control; working control.*\n\n*2. The power to vote enough of the shares in a corporation to determine the outcome of matters that the shareholders vote on.*153\n\n**R-92**, Black's Law Dictionary, 10th Edition for the iPhone and iPad, version 1.4; Thomson Reuters (2014).\n\n189.\n\nTo determine whether in this case Claimant had legal control of Tele F\u00e1cil, the Tribunal will refer to the definition of \"corporate control\" in the Black's Law Dictionary. However, that is not enough.\n\n190.\n\nBased on this definition and other definitions of \"control\" according to English and Spanish language dictionaries, Respondent sustains that the meaning of corporate control must be determined considering the *lex situs* (*i.e*., in this case Mexican law).154\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 68-71.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent in that, in the case of a company such as Tele F\u00e1cil, the determination of whether or not Claimant has \"corporate control\" of the corporation is also a matter of Mexican law.\n\n192.\n\nAccording to Respondent, under Mexican law, \"legal corporate control\" of a company refers to \"the investor's power to decide on substantive matters, such as: the appointment and removal of the company's directors and officers, the approval and amendment of the company's by-laws, the transfer of shares or admission of new partners, or the dissolution of the company.\"155\n\nJurisdictional Objection (13 June 2019), \u00b6 71.\n\n193.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that under Mexican law Mr. Nelson has, and had at the time of submitting the arbitration claim, corporate control of Tele F\u00e1cil and therefore had control of Tele F\u00e1cil for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117.\n\n194.\n\nAt this stage, it is important to highlight that in addition to legal control, Claimant maintains that the word \"controls\" in Article 1117 also encompasses situations of *de facto* control. Claimant cites to *International Thunderbird v. Mexico* in support of his interpretation. However, based on the facts and the evidence submitted by the Parties and considering the circumstances of the instant case, the Tribunal finds that it is not necessary to enter into the debate as to whether the term \"control\" is limited to corporate control or may be extended to include *de facto* control.\n\n**(2) Did Mr. Nelson legally control Tele F\u00e1cil for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe agreement between Claimant, Mr. Sacasa and Mr. Blanco, contained in the Memorandum of Understanding, dated 20 July 2009, outlined the parties' \"understanding of the structure of ownership of the proposed Mexican Telecom Project [which turned to be Tele F\u00e1cil] and the scope of responsibilities by each of the individuals/groups which are party to the Project.\"156 Acknowledging that Mexican law in force at that time did not allow Claimant a majority shareholding of the project, the parties in any case agreed that Claimant \"will have a majority interest as well as majority control equal to [\u2026] 60%\" and that Mr. Sacasa and Mr. Blanco could not \"sell their shares without offering [Claimant] the Right of First Refusal.\"157\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding (20 July 2009), p. 1.\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding (20 July 2009), p. 1.\n\n196.\n\nUnder Mexican law, the Memorandum of Understanding is a shareholder's agreement binding for the signatory parties.158\n\n**C-004**, Bello First Statement (6 November 2017), \u00b6 18.\n\n197.\n\nBased on the definitions of corporate control, both under the Black's Law Dictionary and the definition of corporate control provided by Respondent, Claimant had corporate control of Tele F\u00e1cil according to the Memorandum of Understanding of 20 July 2009. The Memorandum of Understanding clearly stated that Mr. Nelson had \"majority interest as well as majority control equal to [\u2026] 60%\" of Tele F\u00e1cil.159 This means that he had the power to vote enough of the shares to determine the outcome of matters that the shareholders vote on. This also means that he had power to decide on substantive matters, such as the appointment and removal of the company's directors and officers, or the approval and amendment of the company's by-laws. A clear manifestation of this is that the Memorandum of Understanding explicitly said that the transfer of shares or admission of new partners required Mr. Nelson's approval since he had the Right of Refusal.160\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding (20 July 2009), p. 1.\n\n**C-013**, Memorandum of Understanding (20 July 2009), p. 1.\n\n198.\n\nMoreover, it is undisputed by the Parties that majority ownership is a manner of legal control for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117.161 Claimant's position is that on 29 March 2016, as a result of Mr. Sacasa's transfer of shares, he gained majority ownership of Tele F\u00e1cil (with 60% of the shares).162 Respondent's position is that Mr. Sacasa's transfer of shares to Mr. Nelson is invalid and of no legal effect, which would mean that Mr. Nelson's never became the majority owner of Tele F\u00e1cil.163\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 163, 173 above.\n\n*See* \u00b6 173 above.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 164-165 above.\n\n199.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Mr. Sacasa's transfer of shares is invalid because the shareholders' meeting in which the transfer was approved does not comply with certain legal requirements under Mexican law, mainly derived from the fact that under U.S. law, Mr. Blanco ceased to be a shareholder of Tele F\u00e1cil when he filed for bankruptcy, on 25 August 2011.\n\n200.\n\nThis Tribunal is not convinced that the transfer of shares is invalid. *First*, Respondent failed to prove that Mr. Blanco's bankruptcy petition in the U.S. had automatic legal effects in Mexico. Respondent referred to Article 13 of the Mexican Federal Civil Code to argue that \"legal situations validly created in a foreign State must be recognized in Mexico\"164 without providing further analysis or interpretation. As shown by Claimant, Article 8 of the Mexican Law of Commercial Bankruptcy preempts the application of Article 13 because the Mexican Law of Commercial Bankruptcy specifically regulates the recognition of foreign bankruptcy proceedings.165*Second*, even if the approval of the transfer of shares lacked certain legal requirements under Mexican law, such approval would be at most voidable, not invalid *per se*.166 This means that the nullity of the transfer would have to be declared by a court and therefore, that shareholders' approval would be \"effective until a judge declares the corresponding nullity.\"167*Third*, even on Respondent's case, if the initial order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court had automatic effects in Mexico, then the *nunc pro tunc* order from the same court had also automatic effects, which would mean that Mr. Blanco owns his shares in Tele F\u00e1cil uninterruptedly and in its entirety since their issuance, on 7 January 2010.168\n\nSupplemented Jurisdictional Objection (19 October 2019), \u00b6 29.\n\n**C-148**, Second Expert Report of Oscar Vasquez del Mercado Cordero (27 November 2019) (\"**Vasquez Second Report**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 40-46.\n\n**C-143**, First Expert Report of Oscar Vasquez del Mercado Cordero (13 August 2019) (\"**Vasquez First Report**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 59-64; **C-148**, Vasquez Second Report (27 November 2019), \u00b6 73.\n\n**C-143**, Vasquez First Report (13 August 2019), \u00b6 63.\n\n**C-147**, Supplemental Expert Report by Melanie L. Cyganowski (Ret.) (26 November 2016), \u00b6 14.\n\n201.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the share transfer is null and void. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Nelson acquired majority ownership of Tele F\u00e1cil on 29 March 2016 and since that date, had legal control for purposes of NAFTA Article 1117.\n\n202.\n\nThe evidence on the record as to corporate control resulting from the ownership of the majority and the decisive vote of the shareholders of Tele F\u00e1cil is more than sufficient to conclude that Mr. Nelson had legal control of Tele F\u00e1cil. But, the Tribunal notes that, in addition, Mr. Nelson was the sole financer of Tele F\u00e1cil during the critical start-up period, allowing the company, *inter alia*, to hire staff, lawyers and accountants, to obtain a telecommunications concession, pay the rent and litigate Tele F\u00e1cil's interests.169 Mr. Nelson's funding was provided on an iterative basis,170 which could permit Mr. Nelson to control the money spending and correlatively the company's actions. Moreover, Mr. Nelson was the sole provider of crucial technology for Tele F\u00e1cil's corporate purpose (*v. gr.*, Genband softswitch and related items, A/C power equipment, Cambium Network wireless broadband Point-to-Multipoint radios and related equipment, Ethernet cabling, IP network equipment, servers, equipment racks, and various other tools and wiring).171\n\n**C-001**, Witness Statement of Joshua Dean Nelson (2 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 59-63.\n\n**C-141**, List of wire transfers made by Mr. Nelson (produced in 22 April 2017 by Miguel Sacasa).\n\nTr. Day 2 325:8-14.\n\n203.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, under any standard, Mr. Nelson exercised legal (corporate) and *de facto* control over Tele F\u00e1cil at all relevant times. Consequently, Mr. Nelson had standing to file a claim on behalf of Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\n**VI. LIABILITY**\n-----------------\n\n**A. DID RESPONDENT BREACH NAFTA ARTICLE 1110?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n204.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent unlawfully expropriated Claimant's investments in breach of NAFTA Article 1110.172\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 342.\n\n205.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the Tribunal must follow a three-prong test to determine whether there was an unlawful expropriation in this case.173 The three prongs are (i) whether there is an investment capable of being expropriated; (ii) whether that investment has in fact been expropriated \u2014 which in turn requires applying the substantial deprivation test based on the severity of the economic impact and its duration174 \u2014 and; (iii) whether the conditions set forth in Article 1110(1)(b)-(d) have been satisfied. For Claimant, the test is satisfied in this case.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 345.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 367-370.\n\n206.\n\n*First*, Claimant contends that he had investments capable of being expropriated.175 The investments were: (i) the right to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017), which were established through Tele F\u00e1cil's contract with Telmex, and administratively confirmed by the IFT;176 and (ii) his rights of share ownership and to a return on Tele F\u00e1cil's profits.177\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 346.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 350.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 365.\n\n207.\n\n*Second*, Claimant alleges that by repudiating Tele F\u00e1cil's interconnection rights with Telmex, the IFT destroyed Tele F\u00e1cil's ability to operate in Mexico and Claimant's ability to earn a commercial return on his investment.178 According to Claimant, Respondent's expropriation was implemented in a three-plot scheme: (i) the IFT's refusal to enforce Resolution 381;179 (ii) the repudiation of Resolution 381;180 and (iii) IFT's Resolution 127 which established a new interconnection rate between Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil.181 In Claimant's words, \"[w]ithout enforcement of Resolution 381 and, hence without an interconnection agreement with Telmex, Tele F\u00e1cil was, as a matter of fact, simply incapable of earning any revenue in Mexico.\"182 Moreover according to Claimant, the economic impact was permanent because Tele F\u00e1cil's window of opportunity to earn meaningful profits was time-limited (until the end of 2017) by the terms of the interconnection, and therefore, each day that the IFT refused to enforce Resolution 381 was \"a day of high revenues for Tele F\u00e1cil that was forever lost.\"183\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 346.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 378-382.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 383-397.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 398-400.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 408.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 412-413.\n\n208.\n\n*Third*, Claimant states that the IFT's expropriation was unlawful because it failed to pay compensation to Claimant, discriminatorily targeted Tele F\u00e1cil, proceeded without due process, and contradicted the public interest.184 Claimant also adds that in this case there is no regulation of general application in play, which means that there should not be any questioning \"about where the line falls between unlawful expropriation and legitimate regulation.\"185\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 346; 417-429.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 430-434.\n\n209.\n\nIn his Reply, Claimant addressed Respondent's argument denying the existence of an expropriation. *First*, Claimant explained that Tele F\u00e1cil's rights under the interconnection agreement clearly constitute an investment under NAFTA Article 1139. According to Claimant, these rights qualify either as \"intangible property\"186 or as \"interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory.\"187 Moreover, Claimant's position is that the definition of investment in NAFTA Article 1139 does not exclude rights running between an investor and a third party.188 Nothing in this provision can be reasonably interpreted as excluding agreements that create rights or interests between private parties189 and other investments tribunals have already rejected the premise that contracts between private parties are not investments.190 Also, based on the text of NAFTA Article 1110 and other international courts and tribunals' decisions, Claimant alleges that rights between private parties can also be expropriated.191\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 177-182.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 183-185.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 186-197.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 188-192.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 193-197.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 198-207.\n\n210.\n\n*Second*, Claimant disputes Respondent's argument that Claimant cannot allege an unlawful expropriation of Tele F\u00e1cil's assets. Claimant cites to NAFTA Article 1117, which entitles an investor to claim on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, and claims that this provision's requirements are met in this case.192 Claimant also refers to NAFTA Article 1116 and investment-arbitration cases to maintain that under this provision, investors may claim in relation to losses of their investment, which is what precisely happened in this case.193\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 209-215.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 216-222.\n\n211.\n\n*Finally*, with respect to Respondent's argument that Claimant may only assert a denial of justice claim, Claimant asserts that he is entitled to claim separately for separate wrongful acts committed by the IFT and by the telecommunication courts194 and that he is not alleging that Mexico's specialized courts expropriated his investment.195\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 223-251.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 252-254.\n\n212.\n\nIn the Reply, Claimant also insisted on the substantial deprivation in the value of his investment.196 For Claimant, because neither the IFT nor the specialized courts found the rate to be inconsistent with the new telecommunications law, the argument that Tele F\u00e1cil would never have been able to benefit from the high rate because it was invalid is unavailing.197 Moreover, even if Tele F\u00e1cil's bulk of profits were time-limited, Claimant alleges that a large part of those profits could have been reinvested in order to sustain the company's growth.198 Finally, Claimant asserts that Tele F\u00e1cil \"dire situation\" following Resolution 381 prevented the company from continuing to offer its services199 and adds that there was no legal obligation on Tele F\u00e1cil to condone Respondent's actions to accept a fraction of what it was legally entitled to.200\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 258-269.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 262-263.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6 264.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6 265.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 267-269.\n\n213.\n\nClaimant also re-examines the argument that Respondent did not act for a public purpose and insists on the fact that by reversing Resolution 381, the IFT acted firmly against the public interest.201\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 270-273.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nRespondent denies that there is an expropriation and therefore a breach of NAFTA Article 1110. Respondent's defense lies mainly in three arguments: (i) that besides the shares in Tele F\u00e1cil, Claimant did not own assets protected under Article 1110202; (ii) that the measures at issue do not amount to an unlawful expropriation203 and; (iii) that, in any case, these measures could be justified as *bona fide* regulation in the public interest.204\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 262.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 267.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 270.\n\n215.\n\nRespondent's first argument rests on the premise that NAFTA \"covers only the assets and economic interests enumerated in Article 1139's definition of investment\" which is \"a closed list.\"205 According to Respondent, only Claimant's shares in Tele F\u00e1cil qualify as an investment under Article 1139.206 With respect to this investment, Respondent alleges that \"[t]he only conceivable expropriation claim [\u2026] would have to be based on an allegation that unlawful interference by the Mexican State was so invasive and devastating that Tele F\u00e1cil was rendered incapable of carrying on business and became effectively worthless,\" which Claimant failed to establish.207 Moreover, Respondent alleges that because \"Article 1110 does not protect *the investments of an investment* of an investor of a Party\", Claimant cannot allege unlawful expropriation over Tele F\u00e1cil's assets.208 However, even if it could, Respondent's position is that the interconnection rights do not fall under the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1139.209\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 261.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 262.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 264-266.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 262. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 263.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent's second argument is that the measures in question cannot amount to an unlawful expropriation because they \"can only be addressed in terms of denial of justice at customary international law.\"210 That is because Resolution 381, Decree 77 and Resolution 127 aimed at resolving a dispute between Tele F\u00e1cil and a third party (Telmex) which went on to Mexico's specialized tribunals.211\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 269.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 267-269.\n\n217.\n\nFinally, Respondent's third argument is that the measures at issue can be justified as *bona fide* regulation in the public interest due to Mexico's long history of regulation in the public interest in the field of telecommunications.212 These regulations have sought the reduction of interconnection fees in the interest of promoting competition.213\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 270-271.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 271.\n\n218.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent maintains that \"there isn't an example of a Tribunal that have [*sic*] agreed that a claim can be filed for the alleged expropriation of an asset that is 'investment of an investment' of an investor, unless the effects of the measure in question have been so drastic that they eliminated the value of the investor's investment.\"214 Therefore, according to Respondent, the only claim Claimant can file under Article 1110 is an indirect expropriation which requires him to prove: \"(i) that the rights in question existed [\u2026]; (ii) that the State interfered with these rights [\u2026]; and (iii) that the effects of this interference were equivalent to an expropriation of Tele F\u00e1cil.\"215 Respondent denies Claimant's contention that the IFT destroyed Tele F\u00e1cil's business contending that \"Tele F\u00e1cil's right to provide any of the [telecommunication] services [\u2026] has not suffered any changes, and the rate regime based on costs [\u2026] did not interfere with the business.\"216\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 186.\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 188-189.\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 191.\n\n219.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent also insisted that Claimant's alleged interconnection rights are not an investment under NAFTA Article 1139.217 Respondent asserts that Claimant relies on \"non-NAFTA jurisprudence\" for the contention that contractual rights can be the subject of expropriation.218 Based on the terms of Article 1139, Respondent contends that the interconnection rights are not \"intangible property\" because they cannot be bought, sold or pledged219 nor they can be \"interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory\" because they \"have no relation whatsoever with capital contribution in any form, and least of all with the participation that results from the contribution of other 'resources' according to the circumstances described in Article 1139(h)(i) or (ii).\"220\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 193-199.\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 193.\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 196.\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 197-198.\n\n220.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that an expropriation claim cannot be filed against the IFT's measures because the IFT acted in this case \"as a quasi-judicial entity\"221 and \"judicial and quasi-judicial decisions [\u2026] taken in the course of resolving a dispute between private parties cannot be held to amount to expropriation under Article 1110.\"222\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 204.\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 200-201.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nUnder NAFTA Article 1110(1),\n\n*1. No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an investment (\"expropriation\"), except:*\n\n*(a) for a public purpose;*\n\n*(b) on a non-discriminatory basis;*\n\n*(c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and*\n\n*(d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 6.*\n\n222.\n\nTo determine the existence of an unlawful expropriation in breach of NAFTA Article 1110(1), the Tribunal will follow a three-prong test that consists in asking: \"(i) whether there is an investment capable of being expropriated, (ii) whether that investment has in fact been expropriated, and (iii) whether the conditions set [forth] in Article 1110(1)(a)-(d) have been satisfied.\"223 Claimant asked the Tribunal to follow this test.224 Respondent did not oppose to this approach and the Tribunal agrees that it is the proper approach in this case.\n\n**CL-027**, *Chemtura Corporation v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL (Award, 2 August 2010) (Kaufmann-Kohler, Brower, Crawford), \u00b6 242.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 345.\n\n***a. Is there an investment capable of being expropriated?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute, and for the Tribunal is clear, that for purposes of NAFTA Article 1139 there is an enterprise (Tele F\u00e1cil) that constitutes an investment, there are shares held by Claimant in such enterprise that also constitute an investment and a concession agreement of Tele F\u00e1cil that is likewise an investment. However, the Parties heavily debated as to whether other investments, as alleged by Claimant, constituted an investment capable of being expropriated.\n\n224.\n\nIn the Statement of Claim, Claimant alleged that two type of assets were expropriated: (i) the \"rights [\u2026] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017)\"225 and (ii) the rights of share ownership together with the rights to a return on Tele F\u00e1cil's profits.226\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 350.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 365.\n\n225.\n\nDuring the course of the arbitration, Claimant varied this description, to an extent that the Tribunal in the Hearing had to ask the specific question of what was the investment that according to Claimant was subject to expropriation or to unfair and unequitable treatment.227\n\n*See* Tr. Day 5 1245:10-13 (noting that the first question posed by the Tribunal to Claimant was \"[w]hat is the Investment that according to Claimant was expropriated or subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment, both for Mr. Nelson and for Tele F\u00e1cil?\").\n\n226.\n\nIn his response, Claimant indicated that:\n\n*First, Claimants'* [*sic*] *claims on the basis of Tele F\u00e1cil's rights under the Interconnection Agreement as determined by the IFT in Resolution 381. [T]hese rights constitute intangible property and interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a party to economic activity in such territory.*\n\n*Second, because the IFT's destruction of Tele F\u00e1cil's interconnection rights under Resolution 381 caused the destruction of the entire business venture, Claimant also claims for the loss of Tele F\u00e1cil, which meets the definition of \"enterprise\" under the* [*sic*] *NAFTA.*  \n*Claimant also has standing to claim in relation to other assets owned by the enterprise that were neutralized by the IFT's conduct, including the company's Concession and the company's lost business income.*228\n\nTr. Day 5 1248:18 - 1249:13.\n\n227.\n\nTherefore, according to Claimant, Tele F\u00e1cil, Claimant's shares in Tele F\u00e1cil, the Concession, Tele F\u00e1cil's business income and other assets were destroyed as a result of the destruction of \"Tele F\u00e1cil's rights under the Interconnection Agreement as determined by the IFT in Resolution 381\"229 or, in the words of the Statement of Claim, Claimant alleges that Mexico expropriated the \"rights [\u2026] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017).\"230\n\nTr. Day 5 1248:19-20.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 350.\n\n***b. Did Claimant have rights under the interconnection agreement as determined by Resolution 381?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nBefore determining whether the interconnection rights alleged by Claimant and described in the preceding paragraph constitute an investment under NAFTA, the Tribunal must determine (i) whether Tele F\u00e1cil had such rights; (ii) if so, what type of rights were they. This is an inquiry that must begin with an analysis of Mexican law.231 The alleged rights under the interconnection agreement as determined by Resolution 381 derive from Mexican law. Both the alleged interconnection agreement between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex and any alleged rights under Resolution 381 are governed and derive from Mexican law. Therefore, Claimant has the burden to prove that, under Mexican law, Tele F\u00e1cil had the rights that Claimant considers were expropriated. The Parties do not dispute this approach.\n\n**CL-036**, *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL (Award, 3 February 2006) (Crawford, Grigera Na\u00f3n, Thomas), \u00b6 184.\n\n229.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, these rights derive from the combination of: (i) the alleged agreement between Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil on certain terms of a standard interconnection agreement proposed by Telmex (and among these terms the term related to the applicable rates is of particular relevance) and; (ii) the IFT's Resolution 381.\n\n(i) The alleged interconnection agreement\n-----------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nUnder Mexican law, as in most civil law jurisdictions, a contract is formed if there is object and consent.232 In the case of an offer to execute a contract, consent arises from an offer and the acceptance thereof.233\n\nFirst Expert Report by Rodrigo Buj Garc\u00eda (12 March 2018) (\"**Buj First Report**\"), \u00b6 23 (citing Article 1794 of Mexico's Federal Civil Code).\n\nBuj First Report (12 March 2018), \u00b6 26.\n\n231.\n\nArticle 42 of the FTL adds to this general rule of contracts an additional edge in the case of interconnection agreements. If an interconnection contract between telecommunication network carriers cannot be formed within 60 calendar days after one of the carrier requests interconnection to the other, the IFT shall resolve the terms on which the parties could not agree, at the request of one of the carriers.234 In other words, if within 60 calendar days after an interconnection request is made, the telecommunication carriers cannot execute an interconnection contract, the IFT can intervene to decide the disputed terms and mandate the parties to execute it.235 Once the IFT resolves the disputed terms, the parties are obliged to execute the interconnection contract236 which is composed of the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties to the interconnection agreement and the disputed terms as decided by IFT.237\n\n**CL-001**, FTL (7 June 1995), Article 42.\n\nTr.

The issue is relevant because if the letter constitutes an acceptance, it would mean that there was consent on all of the terms and conditions of the interconnection agreement between Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil, including the rates but excluding indirect interconnection and portability, as of the date of the acceptance. If the letter does not constitute an acceptance, it would mean that there was no consent on the terms and conditions of interconnection and therefore no agreement on the rates.\n\n235.\n\nThe reference included in Tele F\u00e1cil's letter of July 2014 to Telmex is \"Comments on the draft local interconnection agreement\" and it reads as follows:\n\n*In follow-up to the various negotiation meetings held at your clients' office, between the staff of Tele F\u00e1cil, S.A. de C.V. (hereinafter \"Tele F\u00e1cil\") and of Tel\u00e9fonos de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. and Tel\u00e9fonos del Noreste, S.A. de C.V. (hereinafter both referred to as \"Telmex\"), and in order to reach an agreement for the interconnection of the corresponding public telecommunications networks of both companies, attached please find Tele F\u00e1cil's comments on the draft framework agreement for the provision of fixed local interconnection services between Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil that you kindly sent us on August 26, 2013 and that we have already been reviewing with you.*\n\n*Likewise, we ask that you sign the same agreement with the company, Tel\u00e9fonos del Noreste, S.A. de C.V., to whom we also call upon to initiate negotiation of the interconnection agreement of August 7, 2013.*\n\n*We appreciate you taking into consideration our comments and modify the version we have received so that Tele F\u00e1cil may be in a position to sign the draft agreement.*244 (Emphasis added)\n\n**C-024**, Comments to the draft local interconnection agreement sent by Tele F\u00e1cil to Telmex (7 July 2014), p. 1.\n\n236.\n\nThe second page of the letter contains the comments of Tele F\u00e1cil to the draft interconnection agreement, which are preceded by the following text: \"[a]fter discussing our concerns with you and after reviewing the draft agreement, Tele F\u00e1cil has the following comments and suggestions, which we would appreciate to be included in order to sign the interconnection agreement*.*\"245 Thereafter Tele F\u00e1cil made several comments on the text of the draft, particularly on indirect interconnection and portability, and suggested the modification of certain clauses and the elimination of others.\n\n**C-024**, Comments to the draft local interconnection agreement sent by Tele F\u00e1cil to Telmex (7 July 2014), p. 2; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 3.\n\n237.\n\nNothing in the text of the letter suggests that Tele F\u00e1cil is accepting the draft interconnection agreement, either conditionally or unconditionally. On the contrary, the letter clearly indicates that Tele F\u00e1cil is requesting modifications, that the agreement needs to be signed, and that for Tele F\u00e1cil to be in a position to sign the interconnection agreement the modifications would have to be included in the agreement.\n\n238.\n\nThe Parties dispute if under Mexican law this letter constitutes a counteroffer. They also dispute whether there was a legal term to accept the offer and if so, whether Tele F\u00e1cil gave its acceptance after the expiration of such term. The Tribunal does not consider necessary to enter into these debates because the plain and clear text of the July 2014 letter indicates that it does not constitute a letter of acceptance, but a letter with comments to the draft provided by Telmex, acknowledging that the agreement must be signed and that Tele F\u00e1cil will sign the agreement if the changes are made. It is clear, and no contemporaneous evidence on the record suggests otherwise, that Tele F\u00e1cil would only accept an agreement containing the modifications requested and that the signature of the agreement was required to conclude the agreement.\n\n239.\n\nBut Tele F\u00e1cil did not wait for Telmex's comments or signature. On 11 July 2014, three days after having sent the letter to Telmex requesting modifications to the draft for it to be signed, Tele F\u00e1cil initiated disagreement proceedings under FTL Article 42 before the IFT to resolve the divergences between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex over: (i) indirect interconnection and; (ii) portability charges.246 It is undisputed that Telmex never signed the draft interconnection agreement that it sent to Tele F\u00e1cil on August 2013. It is also undisputed that Tele F\u00e1cil later submitted to the IFT that same unsigned draft with the request to initiate disagreement proceedings only as regards the aforementioned two divergences.247\n\n**C-025**, Interconnection disagreement procedure submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT (10 July 2014); Joint Chronology of Events, p. 4.\n\n**C-025**, Interconnection disagreement procedure submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT (10 July 2014); Joint Chronology of Events, p. 4.\n\n240.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal considers that Claimant has not proven, for purposes of its claim in this arbitration, that under Mexican civil and commercial law there was an agreement on the rates between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex resulting from the draft submitted by Telmex on August 2013.\n\n241.\n\nIt is undisputed that after Telmex\u00b4s draft agreement of August 2013 containing a USD 0.00975 rate, a new rate regime applicable to Telmex, as the economic preponderant agent, entered into force.248 Under this new regime, Telmex could not charge a rate of USD 0.00975.249 This new legal and regulatory framework would have required Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil to agree on a new rate. Claimant alleged, but was not able to prove, that under this new legal framework Telmex renewed its USD 0.00975 rate offer of August 2013. There is no contemporaneous document evidencing the purported renewal of the offer and Claimant\u2019s witnesses were unconvincing and contradictory in this regard. The Tribunal finds it difficult to believe that an alleged agreement to renew the offer of what Claimant considers the key business of Tele F\u00e1cil was never documented by a letter or email. Given that Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil did not reach an agreement within the terms of FTL Article 42, Telmex could then request the IFT\u2019s intervention to decide on the rates. The IFT decided on the applicable rate through Resolution 127.250\n\n*See* \u00b6 111 above. This paragraph originally started with the following line: \"Even assuming, *arguendo*, that there was an interconnection agreement, including an agreement on rates, between the Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil,\". This line was removed because the remaining arbitrators consider that the evaluation of such assumption was unnecessary and added nothing to the conclusion.\n\n**CL-004**, FTBL, Article 131(a).\n\nTr. Day 1 203:2-9.\n\n242.\n\nIn the absence of convincing evidence as to the existence of an interconnection agreement between Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil, the inevitable conclusion is that Tele F\u00e1cil had no \"rights under the Interconnection Agreement\" that could have been determined by Resolution 381.\n\n243.\n\nBut even if Tele F\u00e1cil had a valid and binding interconnection agreement with Telmex under Mexican law resulting from the draft of August 2013 in combination with the letter of July 2014, or from any alleged renewal of the offer resulting from such draft, the question remains as to whether Resolution 381 granted interconnection rate rights to Tele F\u00e1cil that were later on expropriated or subjected to treatment that amounts to the violation of NAFTA.\n\n(ii) Resolution 381\n-------------------\n\n244.\n\nResolution 381 \"by which the plenary of the [IFT] determine[d] the disputed interconnection terms between Tele F\u00e1cil M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V. and the companies Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, S.A.B. de C.V. and Tel\u00e9fonos del Noroeste, S.A. de C.V.\" was approved by the Plenary of the IFT in its XVII Ordinary Session held on 26 November 2014, by the unanimous vote of the Commissioners present at the Session.251\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 18.\n\n245.\n\nResolution 381 was issued \"pursuant to the twentieth paragraph, subsection I and II, and the twenty first paragraph of article 28 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States; articles 7, 16, and 45 of the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law; as well as articles 1, 7, 8 and 12 of the Organic Statute of the Federal Telecommunications Institute, through Resolution P/IFT/261114/381.\"252\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 18.\n\n246.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the IFT is an organ of the Mexican State, created through an amendment of the Mexican Constitution253 and that under Article 42 of the FTL, the IFT had authority to \"resolve the [interconnection] conditions that could not be agreed [by the public telecommunications network carriers] within [\u2026] 60 calendar days,\" counted from \"the moment one of the parties request so.\"254\n\n**CL-002**, Decree by which several provisions are amended and added to the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, in telecommunications matters (11 June 2013), Article 28.\n\n**CL-001**, FTL (7 June 1995), Article 42.\n\n247.\n\nUnder the new FTBL, the IFT retained the powers and authorities related to the resolution of divergences in the interconnection conditions not agreed upon by the carriers.255 Article 7 of the FTBL provides as follows as regards the IFT:\n\n*The Institute is an autonomous public agency, independent regarding its decisions and functioning, with legal status and own resources, and has the purpose of regulating and promoting competition and efficient development of telecommunications and broadcasting in the scope of the powers conferred by the Constitution and in the terms specified in this Law and other applicable legal provisions.*\n\n*The Institute is responsible for the regulation, promotion and supervision of the use, enjoyment and exploitation of radio spectrum, orbital resources, satellite services, public telecommunication networks and broadcasting and telecommunication services provision, as well as access to active and passive infrastructure and other essential goods, without prejudice to the powers corresponding to other authorities in accordance with the corresponding laws.*\n\n*Moreover, the Institute is the authority in terms of economic competition in broadcasting and telecommunication sectors, for which it shall exclusively exercise the powers, set forth in article 28 of the Constitution, this Law and the Federal Economic Competition Law.*\n\n*The Institute is the authority in terms of technical guidelines related to infrastructure and equipment connected to telecommunications networks, as well as for the homologation and conformity assessment of such infrastructure and equipment.*\n\n*The officers of the Institute shall be guided by the principles of autonomy, legality, objectivity, impartiality, certainty, efficiency, efficacy, transparence and accountability.

The draft submitted by Telmex to the IFT did not include portability charges and allowed indirect interconnection.260 However, Telmex argued that the parties had a disagreement on the applicable rates and requested the IFT to determine the rates.261\n\n**C-027**, Telmex's reply to the interconnection disagreement procedure submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT (26 August 2014); Joint Chronology of Events, p. 4.\n\n**C-027**, Telmex's reply to the interconnection disagreement procedure submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT (26 August 2014), \u00a7 IX; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 4.\n\n**C-027**, Telmex's reply to the interconnection disagreement procedure submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT (26 August 2014), \u00a7 X. *See also*, **C-028**, Telmex's closing arguments to the interconnection disagreement procedure submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT (24 September 2014), \u00a7 Sixth; Joint Chronology of Events, p. 4.\n\n251.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the IFT decided on the divergences submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil (indirect interconnection and portability charges). The issue is whether Resolution 381 upheld the rates contained in the draft presented by Telmex to Tele F\u00e1cil on 26 August 2013 and if so, whether as a result thereof, Resolution 381 granted Tele F\u00e1cil the right to a particular rate and to earn revenues based on such rate.\n\n252.\n\nClaimant considers that Resolution 381 granted Tele F\u00e1cil the \"rights [\u2026] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017).\"262 This rate granted Tele F\u00e1cil, according to Claimant, a competitive advantage. Without such advantage, says Claimant, Tele F\u00e1cil could simply not survive.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 350.\n\n253.\n\nClaimant considers further that the operative part of Resolution 381, properly interpreted in conjunction with section Fifth thereof, clearly granted Tele F\u00e1cil a right to charge and being charged specific interconnection rates: on the one hand, to charge the interconnection rate of USD 0.00975 allegedly agreed by Telmex, and on the other hand, being charged the lower rate determined for Telmex as a preponderant agent. Respondent, in turn, considers that Resolution 381 did not decide on the applicable interconnection rates but simply dismissed Telmex's request to decide on the rates because Telmex did not prove that a dispute on the rates existed.\n\n254.\n\nThe operative part of Resolution 381 provides as follows:\n\n*FIRST.- Within 10 (ten) business days following the date in which the notification of this Resolution is effective, Tele F\u00e1cil Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and the companies Tel\u00e9fonos de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. and Tel\u00e9fonos del Noroeste, S.A. de C.V. must interconnect their telecommunications networks and initiate the provision of the corresponding interconnection services. In that same term, such companies must execute the interconnection agreement of their telecommunications networks pursuant to the terms and conditions determined in the FIFTH Consideration section of this Resolution. Once the corresponding agreement has been executed, they must submit jointly or individually an original or certified copy of the agreement to the Federal Telecommunications Institute, within the 30 (thirty) business days following its execution, in order to register it in the Public Telecommunications Registry.*263\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), pp. 16-17.\n\n255.\n\nThe relevant portion of the Fifth Consideration referred to in the operative part of Resolution 381 and invoked by Claimant reads as follows:\n\n*[T]he Institute considers Telmex and Telnor's arguments to be inadmissible, given the fact that the interconnection rates were completely determined by Telmex and Telnor in the draft interconnection agreement sent to Tele F\u00e1cil on August 26, 2013, and which Tele F\u00e1cil had full knowledge of and consented to the same.*\n\n*Consequently, Telmex and Telnor's argument in connection with an alleged disagreement on interconnection rates is dismissed, since the aforementioned rates were defined in the draft agreement for the provision of fixed local interconnection services and its exhibits, sent by Telmex and Telnor to Tele F\u00e1cil, and which are part of the evidence in this record, particularly the ones indicated in Background IX of this Resolution.*\n\n*Therefore, the only interconnection conditions not agreed upon by the parties in the process of negotiating to execute the corresponding interconnection agreement are those which are expressly cited in the Fifth Consideration section of this resolution.*\n\n*Furthermore, there is no document in the record that proves that Telmex and Telnor claimed to be in disagreement with the interconnection rates during the time the parties held negotiations to execute the corresponding interconnection agreement.*\n\n*This is, Telmex and Telnor's request for the Institute to determine interconnection rates that were not agreed with Tele F\u00e1cil, does not meet the legal premise established in article 42 of the FTL, since from reviewing the evidence in the record of this proceeding, there is no evidence that Telmex and Telnor expressed their disagreement with the interconnection rates, nor that a formal request to begin negotiations regarding the aforementioned interconnection rates was performed and that in fact, the 60 (sixty) day period established in article 42 of the FTL has elapsed without the aforementioned concessionaires reaching an agreement on the rates, therefore Telmex and Telnor's request is dismissed.*\n\n*In the following paragraphs, the Institute, under the terms established in article 42 of the FTL, strives to resolve the points of disagreement in interconnection matters that were submitted for its consideration, and which according to its judgment result admissible from Tele F\u00e1cil, Telmex and Telnor.*264\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), pp. 13-14.\n\n256.\n\nAt the outset the Tribunal notes that the text of the relevant part of Resolution 381 on which Claimant bases his claim is poorly drafted and may result in confusions and differences of interpretation. As mentioned in the Hearing, the drafting is at least \"unfortunate.\"265\n\nTr. Day 3 827:17 \u2013 828:7.\n\n257.\n\nHowever, Resolution 381 cannot be interpreted by taking in isolation the literality of certain sections. First, an interpretation of Resolution 381 requires the analysis of Resolution 381 in context, that is to say, considering the entire text of the Resolution and not isolated sections thereof. Second, the interpretation requires a consideration of the provisions of Mexican law applicable to Resolution 381 and particularly those that define the powers of the regulator (the IFT). Resolution 381 was issued in furtherance to the powers granted to the IFT by the Mexican Constitution and the legal provisions of Mexican law, particularly the FTL and the FTBL. Those provisions define the scope and limits of the powers and authorities of the IFT and therefore, the IFT's decisions could not exceed such limits and powers. Third, as several tribunals have indicated, this Tribunal must grant some deference to the regulator in technical matters such as the ones subject matter of the FTL and Resolution 381.266\n\n*See i.e.*, **CL-061**, *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL (Partial Award, 13 November 2000) (Hunter, Schwartz, Chiasson), \u00b6 263; **CL-043**, *GAMI Investments, Inc. v. The Government of the United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL (Award, 15 November 2004) (Paulsson, Reisman, Lacarte) (\"***GAMI v. Mexico***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.\n\n258.\n\nIt is correct, as submitted by Claimant, that Resolution 381 provided that Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex \"must interconnect their telecommunications networks and [\u2026] execute the interconnection agreement of their telecommunications networks pursuant to the terms and conditions determined in the FIFTH Consideration section of this Resolution.\"267 It is also correct that the Fifth Consideration provides that \"the interconnection rates were completely determined by Telmex and Telnor in the draft interconnection agreement sent to Tele F\u00e1cil on August 26, 2013, and which Tele F\u00e1cil had full knowledge of and consented to the same\"268 and that the same Fifth Consideration adds that \"Telmex and Telnor's argument in connection with an alleged disagreement on interconnection rates is dismissed, since the aforementioned rates were defined in the draft agreement for the provision of fixed local interconnection services and its exhibits, sent by Telmex and Telnor to Tele F\u00e1cil, and which are part of the evidence in this record, particularly the ones indicated in Background IX of this Resolution.\"269\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), pp. 16-17.\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 13.\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 13.\n\n259.\n\nBut is the aforementioned language, as read and interpreted by Claimant, sufficient and clear enough to grant Tele F\u00e1cil the right to charge a specific rate? The answer, in the view of the Tribunal, is clearly in the negative for the reasons explained below.\n\n260.\n\nIn Resolution 381 the IFT makes a clear distinction between \"the points of disagreement in interconnection matters that were submitted for its consideration, and which according to its judgment result admissible\"270 and those points submitted to the IFT that are not admissible. In the words of the IFT:\n\n*[T]here is no document in the record that proves that Telmex and Telnor claimed to be in disagreement with the interconnection rates during the time the parties held negotiations to execute the corresponding interconnection agreement.*\n\n*This is, Telmex and Telnor's request for the Institute to determine interconnection rates that were not agreed with Tele F\u00e1cil, does not meet the legal premise established in article 42 of the FTL, since from reviewing the evidence in the record of this proceeding, there is no evidence that Telmex and Telnor expressed their disagreement with the interconnection rates, nor that a formal request to begin negotiations regarding the aforementioned interconnection rates was performed and that in fact, the 60 (sixty) day period established in article 42 of the FTL has elapsed without the aforementioned concessionaires reaching an agreement on the rates, therefore Telmex and Telnor's request is dismissed.*271\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 14.\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), pp. 13-14.\n\n261.\n\nThe reason for considering inadmissible the submission by Telmex on the alleged dispute on the rates was that, according to the IFT, there was no evidence of a dispute on the rates. The IFT assumed that such dispute did not exist because the rates were defined in the August 2013 draft agreement for the provision of fixed local interconnection services and its exhibits, sent by Telmex to Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\n262.\n\nIn Resolution 381 the IFT clearly expressed that under the terms established in Article 42 of the FTL*,* the IFT \"strives to resolve the points of disagreement in interconnection matters that were submitted for its consideration, and which according to its judgment result admissible from Tele F\u00e1cil, Telmex and Telnor.\"272 Therefore, Resolution 381 undoubtedly decided only on the issues that were submitted for consideration of the IFT and which the IFT considered admissible. Those issues are exclusively the indirect interconnection and portability. The alleged dispute on the rates submitted by Telmex was not decided because it was considered inadmissible.\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 14.\n\n263.\n\nConsidering that Telmex had submitted a new draft in which it accepted the issues of indirect interconnection and portability, the IFT did not have to decide on those issues and therefore ordered Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex to interconnect. The text of the reasoning of Resolution 381 leaves no doubt on the point:\n\n*From reviewing the parties' positions, it is concluded that Tele F\u00e1cil as well as **Telmex and Telnor expressed their will to execute the local interconnection agreement including the provision of indirect interconnection service** and the modifications required to the corresponding definitions. Likewise, **Telmex and Telnor accepted to eliminate from the agreement the portability clause** as requested by Tele F\u00e1cil. The previous modifications were reflected in the interconnection agreement draft which was presented as evidence in Telmex and Telnor's Reply, which has evidentiary value in terms of articles 197 and 200 of the Federal Code of Civil Proceedings (hereinafter, the \"CFPC\"), of supplemental application pursuant to article 8 section V of the FTL.*\n\n*By virtue of the parties being in agreement with the interconnection terms and conditions, the corresponding draft agreement would allow compliance with the FTL, pursuant to articles 1792, 1794, 1803 and 1807 of the Federal Civil Code that is supplemental to the FTL pursuant to article 8, section IV of the FTL.*\n\n*Consequently, **having dismissed Telmex's arguments, and there existing an agreement between Tele F\u00e1cil, Telmex and Telnor to formalize the Agreement for the Provision of Local Interconnection Services offered by Telmex and Telnor as evidence in Telmex and Telnor's Reply**, such concessionaires are obligated to grant the interconnection requested by Tele F\u00e1cil*.273 (Emphasis added)\n\n**C-029**, Resolution 381 (26 November 2014), p. 15.\n\n264.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that a reading of Resolution 381 in context leads to the following conclusions:\n\na) Tele F\u00e1cil submitted for resolution only the issues on indirect interconnection and portability.\n\nb) In its response, Telmex accepted to grant indirect interconnection and to eliminate portability charges, but Telmex submitted that there was a dispute on the rates.\n\nc) The IFT considered that the dispute on the rates was inadmissible and in doing so, it justified the inadmissibility by indicating that there was no evidence of a dispute on the rates and assumed that the rates had been agreed upon by the parties according to the draft submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\nd) The IFT considered that since there was an agreement on the pending issues (indirect connection and portability) and the alleged dispute on the rates was inadmissible because it was already agreed upon, the parties had to proceed with the interconnection.\n\ne) Nowhere in Resolution 381 did the IFT decide a dispute on the rates. On the contrary, it clearly indicated that in its view there was no dispute because, according to IFT, the rates had been agreed, and that therefore, the dispute, as submitted by Telmex, was inadmissible. The only basis for the IFT to consider that the rates had been agreed was the draft submitted to Tele F\u00e1cil, the August 2013 draft that Telmex never signed.\n\n265.\n\nThe IFT dismissed Telmex's request for the resolution of an alleged dispute on the rates because, according to IFT, there was no dispute on the rates between Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil. The Tribunal must then determine whether the IFT's conclusion resulted in the granting of rights to Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\n266.\n\nAs mentioned before, in interpreting Resolution 381, the Tribunal must consider which are the powers of the IFT under Mexican law. The IFT must perform its duties under the FTBL in the scope of the powers conferred by the Constitution and in the terms specified in this law and other applicable legal provisions.\n\n267.\n\nThe interpretation proposed by Claimant would mean that even though the IFT expressly dismissed and declared inadmissible Telmex' submission on the rates because no dispute was proven, the reference to the purported agreement on the rates had the same effects as if the IFT had issued a decision on a dispute on the rates. It would also result in that the reference to Telmex's draft of interconnection agreement in Resolution 381 would grant such draft the effects of a full final agreement, even if the parties had not agreed on certain terms and conditions that nevertheless were not presented to the IFT as disagreements.\n\n268.\n\nIt is undisputed that, under Mexican law, the powers of IFT as regards interconnection disputes are limited. The FTL grants the IFT the authority to decide on interconnection disputes submitted to it. It also has the authority to dismiss a dispute if it considers that the applicant did not prove the existence of the dispute. But nowhere in the FTL or in other provisions of Mexican law is the IFT authorized to decide or grant rights over terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement if such terms and conditions have not been submitted as disputed terms. Moreover, there is no evidence that the IFT has the legal authority to determine whether or not the draft agreement submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil was a full and final agreement binding on Telmex.\n\n269.\n\nIn Resolution 381 the IFT dismissed, on grounds of inadmissibility, the dispute on the rates submitted by Telmex. According to Resolution 381, the reason for the dismissal was that, according to the IFT, Telmex had not proven that there was a disagreement on the rates. The IFT considered that there was an agreement on the rates based on its assumption or understanding that the draft submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil contained a full agreement on all terms and conditions, except for indirect interconnection and portability. But there was not such agreement. An IFT's declaration that there is no dispute on the rates because they had been agreed does not decide a dispute on the rates and does not grant rights to Tele F\u00e1cil.274 The interpretation proposed by Claimant would result in an absurdity and in the IFT acting *ultra vires*. It would be an absurdity because it would mean that the dispute on the rates is at the same time dismissed and decided (*i.e.*, notwithstanding the dismissal of the dispute on the rates, a decision is made on such rates). It would also mean that the IFT would be acting *ultra vires* because it would be granting rights over rates that are not disputed and validating and giving effects to an unproven contract that one of the parties (Telmex) disputed.\n\nThis sentence originally started with the text \"And even if there was,\". The remaining arbitrators consider that including such assumption (*arguendo*) was unnecessary as it added nothing to the conclusion. The introductory words were therefore removed.\n\n270.\n\nIn sum, Resolution 381 did not decide a dispute on the rates because it considered that there was no dispute. The IFT has no authority to decide whether or not the parties to an interconnection agreement have agreed on certain terms and conditions, it only has the authority to decide on those terms and conditions that are disputed and submitted for its consideration.275\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the remaining arbitrators wish to stress that even though the IFT also has authority to decide whether or not there is a dispute as to a rate, that does not change the conclusion that the IFT does not have the authority to decide whether or not an agreement on certain terms and conditions legally exists between the parties.\n\n271.\n\nThe IFT may have erred in drafting Resolution 381 and indicating that Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex had agreed on the rates. Clearly the IFT could have done better. But a party cannot attempt to benefit from such errors, much less when the party's interpretation based on those errors would be contrary to Mexican law as it would result in the regulator clearly exceeding its powers.\n\n272.\n\nFrom the facts of the case and the considerations above, the Tribunal concludes that Tele F\u00e1cil opportunistically foresaw a business window and attempted to take advantage of the same. Tele F\u00e1cil received a draft interconnection agreement from Telmex and inexplicably waited for almost eleven months with no further action on the draft. The draft interconnection agreement contained reciprocal interconnection rates of USD 0.00975. But when Telmex was declared a predominant agent and forced to charge a lower interconnection rate (USD 0.00172), Tele F\u00e1cil rushed to send comments to Telmex on the draft interconnection agreement, did not wait for Telmex's reaction to its comments, and submitted a dispute to the IFT on the indirect interconnection and portability charges. Tele F\u00e1cil's bet was that if the dispute on indirect interconnection and portability was decided in its favor, as it was, then Tele F\u00e1cil could claim that it had an agreement where it could charge the interconnection rate reflected in Telmex's draft of August 2013, but Telmex could only charge the maximum rate allowed as from 26 March 2014, that is to say, an interconnection rate of MXN 0.2015, approximately USD 0.00172.276 This would have given an important margin to Tele F\u00e1cil until 31 December 2017.\n\nJoint Chronology of Events, p. 3.\n\n273.\n\nTele F\u00e1cil based this business opportunity on several assumptions. It assumed, incorrectly, that it had a valid and binding agreement with Telmex. The Tribunal has already explained that there is no evidence of such an agreement before this Tribunal. On the contrary, the evidence shows that there was no agreement on the rates and Telmex challenged the existence of such agreement before the IFT. Tele F\u00e1cil further assumed that even though the alleged agreement between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex contained reciprocal rates, by operation of the new regulations applicable to Telmex as a preponderant agent a differential rate would be applicable. But there is no convincing277 evidence that Telmex maintained the original terms of the draft of August 2013 after the amendments in the legislation or that it ever agreed to such differential rates or that such differential rates would apply by operation of law. Tele F\u00e1cil also assumed that, as a result of the unfortunate drafting of certain sections of Resolution 381, such Resolution granted Tele F\u00e1cil rights over certain rates despite the fact that, on the one hand, it is clear that under Mexican law the IFT did not have the power or the authority to decide whether or not there was a binding agreement on the rates between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex and, on the other, Resolution 381 dismissed Telmex's submission that there was a dispute on the rates but did not solve such dispute.\n\nThe word \"convincing\" was added by the two remaining arbitrators.\n\n274.\n\nIn sum, the IFT was legally authorized only to decide interconnection disputes between the parties. Tele F\u00e1cil did not submit a dispute on the interconnection rates. Telmex submitted that there was a dispute on the interconnection rates but the IFT dismissed this claim because it assumed, incorrectly, that there was an agreement on the rates. In fact, the IFT ordered Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil to interconnect referring to the \"rates\" as if there was a final and binding agreement between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex on all matters, including rates. However, the IFT did not have the authority to determine whether or not there was a valid and binding agreement between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex on all matters, including rates. Tele F\u00e1cil attempted and now Claimant is attempting to take advantage of a text that, that even though poorly drafted, cannot be interpreted in a sense that results in a violation of Mexican law.\n\n275.\n\nNeither Tele F\u00e1cil nor Claimant may interpret an act of the IFT in a sense that would result in the IFT acting *ultra vires* and pretend to derive rights from such an interpretation. The IFT's intervention was limited to resolving the two disputed terms Tele F\u00e1cil invoked. Therefore, Resolution 381 cannot be interpreted as providing a decision on the rates.278\n\nTr. Day 1, 64:9-14; 94:1-5; 103: 12-16.\n\n276.\n\nIf the IFT did not have the authority to rule on whether or not there was an agreement between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex and could only decide on the disputes submitted to it, the confirmation of criteria that resulted in Decree 77 is fully justified. Tele F\u00e1cil requested the IFT to enforce Resolution 381 interpreting that such resolution had approved the rates contained in the August 2013 draft agreement originally submitted by Telmex. Telmex, in turn had challenged such an agreement on the rates by requesting the IFT to decide the dispute on the rates. The confirmation of criteria was aimed at whether, in addition to deciding on the dispute submitted to the IFT and compelling interconnection, the IFT had the power to compel the execution of an interconnection agreement in the forms and terms determined in Resolution 381.279\n\n**C-040**, Confirmation of Criteria submitted by the Compliance Unit to the Legal Unit of the IFT (10 February 2015); Joint Chronology of Events, p. 7. For consistency with the evidence on record, the remaining arbitrators deleted the text \"decide on a dispute on the rates and\", which was included after the words \"the IFT had the power to.\"\n\n277.\n\nOn 8 April 2015, the IFT issued Decree 77 which stated what, in the Tribunal's view and according to the evidence submitted in this arbitration, is clear: that the IFT's powers were restricted to resolving the conditions not agreed upon by Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex, indirect interconnection and portability charges, and that no decision had been issued on the rates.280 Decree 77 simply clarified what would have resulted from an interpretation in good faith and in context of the wording of Resolution 381. Neither Tele F\u00e1cil nor Claimant can validly claim that a clarification of Resolution 381, the effect of which is to specify that an interpretation of Resolution 381 cannot result in the IFT exceeding its powers, is a violation of rights that were never granted.\n\n**C-051**, Decree 77 (8 April 2015), p. 13.\n\n278.\n\nFinally, through Resolution 127, the IFT decided the dispute on the rates submitted by Telmex as to the interconnection rates and determined a rate of MXN 0.004179 (USD 0.000253).281 Again, in Resolution 381 the IFT had dismissed the dispute on the rates submitted by Telmex. Therefore, Resolution 127 is the decision on a matter that was pending: the dispute on the rates.\n\n**C-061**, Resolution 127 (7 October 2015), p. 35, First Decision.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that (a) Resolution 381 did not grant rights to Tele F\u00e1cil; (b) Tele F\u00e1cil simply made a bet, based on incorrect assumptions and interpretations, that Resolution 381 had upheld an interconnection rate, which it did not; (c) through Decree 77, the IFT had every right to interpret Resolution 381 in accordance with Mexican law: \u2014 acknowledging that it had limited powers when resolving disputed terms \u2014. This interpretation was not only confirmed by the experts in this case, but also consistently by Mexican courts.282 Finally, (d) the IFT had the obligation to decide the dispute on the interconnection rate through Resolution 127.\n\nTr. Day 1, 16:13-17; Tr. Day 3 668: 7-11.\n\n280.\n\nThe analysis above leads to the inevitable conclusion that Tele F\u00e1cil had no \"rights under the Interconnection Agreement as determined by the IFT in Resolution 381.\" Thus, Claimant cannot claim that a right it does not have under Mexican law is capable of being expropriated.\n\n281.\n\nAs stated above, Tele F\u00e1cil had, at best, a business opportunity, a bet based on its own interpretations and speculations, that was proven wrong. The speculative nature of the business opportunity that Claimant unsuccessfully attempts to qualify as \"rights\" at the core of the business of Tele F\u00e1cil is further confirmed by the overwhelming evidence on the record. This alleged opportunity and the income related thereto were never included in any business plan prepared by Tele F\u00e1cil283. There is no explanation for the delay in accepting Telmex's offer for interconnection and then Tele F\u00e1cil's rush once Telmex was declared a preponderant agent. The main source of income of Tele F\u00e1cil, according to the evidence on the record, did not depend on the alleged \"rights\" purportedly granted by Resolution 381. On the contrary, the vast majority of the income depended on different lines of business, unrelated to these \"rights\", lines of business that Tele F\u00e1cil could have pursued but it decided not to.284 Claimant cannot ask this Tribunal to find Respondent liable for Tele F\u00e1cil having failed on a bet supported on assumptions and speculations that were proven incorrect.\n\nTr. Day 1 244: 2-9, 246:6-17.\n\nTr. Day 1 257:17; 265:1.\n\n282.\n\nIn addition to the alleged interconnection rights with Telmex defined under Resolution 381, Claimant also claims for the expropriation of Tele F\u00e1cil and of the shares held by Claimant in Tele F\u00e1cil. According to Claimant, those investments were destroyed as a result of the actions of Mexico through the IFT and the destruction of the rights under Resolution 381, to an extent such that both Tele F\u00e1cil and Mr. Nelson's shares in Tele F\u00e1cil lack any value.\n\n283.\n\nConsidering that the Tribunal has already concluded that Resolution 381 did not grant rights on interconnection rates to Tele F\u00e1cil, there could have been no impact on Tele F\u00e1cil or its shares as a result of the actions following Resolution 381. Moreover, as already mentioned in paragraph 281 above, there is no evidence whatsoever that the income of Tele F\u00e1cil or the value of its shares were depending on the existence of such alleged rights. On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of the evidence on the record suggests that the main lines of business of Tele F\u00e1cil, as planned from the conception of the investment in Mexico, were unrelated to a difference in the rates. Moreover, there is no evidence that after Telmex was declared a preponderant agent and the opportunity to take advantage of the difference in the interconnection rates arose, the business plans of Tele F\u00e1cil changed. The main lines of business of Tele F\u00e1cil were completely unrelated with what Claimant now portraits as the core business of Tele F\u00e1cil (the differential in the rates) and Tele F\u00e1cil simply decided, with no reasonable business explanation, to abandon such main lines of business. If Tele F\u00e1cil or the shares lost value, such loss is the result of a business decision of Tele F\u00e1cil and its shareholders and not of actions or omissions of Respondent.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that there is no violation of NAFTA Article 1110.\n\n**B. Did Respondent breach Article 1105 of NAFTA?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Claimant\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------\n\n285.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the IFT\u2019s three measures purportedly aiming at repudiating Resolution 381 also violated NAFTA Article 1105.285 Claimant contends that the IFT \"arbitrarily, discriminatorily and secretly repudiated the interconnection terms established in Resolution 381 with the effect of gutting Claimants' investments in Mexico.\"286\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 436.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 436.\n\n286.\n\nFocusing first in the text of NAFTA Article 1105 and NAFTA Free Trade Commission Notes of Interpretation regarding this provision, Claimant concludes that the concept of \"fair and equitable treatment\" in Article 1105's first paragraph \"is part of the customary international minimum standard of treatment and, thus, its content is defined exclusively by customary international law.\"287\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 438-441.\n\n287.\n\nRegarding the standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\", Claimant refers to the formulation of such standard in the *Waste Management v. Mexico* decision. After citing the award, Claimant explains that under this decision, different types of State misconduct may fall below the minimum standard of treatment and they fall into three categories: (i) arbitrariness, (ii) lack of due process; and (iii) discrimination.288\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 442-444.\n\n288.\n\nIn Claimant's view, \"a State acts arbitrarily, in violation of international law, when it conducts itself not on the basis of a system of law, but rather based on its own unrestricted will.\"289 Claimant infers this definition from the *Cargill v. Mexico* award, which cited the judgment of a chamber of the International Court of Justice in the *ELSI* case.290 In this sense, Claimant cites to NAFTA cases to imply that a State's measure is not based on a system of law when there is \"an abrupt change in the treatment of a foreign investor contrary to law\"291 or when it is \"unsupported by a reasonable and established policy rationale.\"292 Claimant also refers to CAFTA-DR cases to strengthen his interpretation.293\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 454.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 453.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 456 (citing **CL-043**, *GAMI v.

Mexico* case to explain \"if the relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue delay, or if they administer justice in a seriously inadequate way\" to conclude that this standard cover at least \"two types of misconduct where the State engages in unfair discrimination or commits gross incompetence in the administration of justice.\"298\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 466.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 466.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 469.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 475 (citing **CL-060**, *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v.

In this respect, Claimant referred to Mr. Gorra's witness statement, which attempted to show that the *Pleno* regularly issues decrees like Decree 77 and explained that the decrees brought up by Mr. Gorra are distinguishable.317 Claimant also emphasized that prior to Decree 77, Tele F\u00e1cil was never provided a meaningful opportunity to be heard.318\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 312-323.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 324-339.\n\n299.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserted that Respondent could not defend the District Court's *amparo* decision regarding Decree 77319 and qualified this decision as \"judicial opinion devoid of any application of legal principles or substantive reasoning.\"320 Claimant also contended that Respondent could not defend the Appellate Court's denial of Tele F\u00e1cil's Right of Appeal321 arguing that the court \"unjustifiably rejected\" it, \"having previously been accepted.\"322\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 344-355.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6 345.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 356-385.\n\nReply (5 June 2018), \u00b6 358.\n\n***b. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nRespondent asserts that the IFT's measures challenged by Claimant under NAFTA Article 1105 \"pertain to the adjudication of a dispute between *Tele F\u00e1cil* and *Telmex* with respect to the terms of interconnection that each says should apply in the commercial relationship between them\" therefore, Claimant can only assert a claim of denial of justice \"which has a more onerous set of requirements.\"323 Respondent cites extensively to the United States submission under NAFTA Article 1128 in the *Eli Lilly* case324 and later concludes that \"none of the required elements of denial of justice at customary international law have been established with respect to any of the impugned administrative resolutions or court decisions.\"325 Further, Respondent refers to the IFT's measures and the Specialized Courts' judgments as stated below.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 275 (Emphasis in the original); Rejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 208-211.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 276; Rejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 306.\n\n301.\n\nRegarding Resolution 381, Respondent asserts that the IFT concluded that there was no disagreement on rates and therefore, requirements set forth in article 42 of FTL were not met. According to Respondent \"[t]he meaning and effect of Resolution 381 became the subject of conflicting submissions to the IFT by both Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex.\"326 Nonetheless, \"there was no denial of justice to Tele F\u00e1cil in the proceedings [that followed] Resolution 381, or in IFT's alleged failure to enforce said resolution.\"327\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 281.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 282.\n\n302.\n\nWith respect to Decree 77, Respondent relies on Mr. Gorra's witness statement, which explains that in a criteria confirmation request, the parties are not asked to state their positions, it does not generate rights or obligations and in this case, Decree 77 was only a clarification of the scope of Resolution 381.328 Respondent indicates that the finding in Decree 77 is \"entirely within the realm of reason\" and that \"given the consistency of the court decisions, one can only conclude that Decree 77 was legally correct.\"329 Respondent also asserts that under the FTL, every concessionaire has a right to request a hearing with the IFT and that in this case Tele F\u00e1cil presented four written submissions and met with the head of the IFT's Compliance Unit and before the *Pleno* of the IFT,330 therefore, \"[t]here was no denial of justice to Tele F\u00e1cil.\"331 Respondent notes that Tele F\u00e1cil challenged Decree 77 through an *amparo* proceeding.332\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 283.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 311.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 284.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 285.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 286.\n\n303.\n\nAs long as Resolution 127 is concerned, Respondent states that the IFT resolved the disagreement on the rates \"based on the Regulated Rates 2015 published on December 2014 in accordance with Article 137 of the FLTB through the Rate Agreement of 2015.\"333 Respondent concludes that through Resolution 127 the IFT did not deny justice to Tele F\u00e1cil because the latter \"had notice of the proceeding and made submissions\" and \"[t]he IFT's decision was reasoned and fully transparent.\"334 Respondent also observes that Tele F\u00e1cil challenged Resolution 127 through an *amparo* proceeding and later withdrew from it.335\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 288.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 289.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 290.\n\n304.\n\nOn the *Amparo* proceedings 351/2014 filed by Telmex against Resolution 381, Respondent indicates that Tele F\u00e1cil participated in each stage of this proceeding, provided evidence, pleadings and appealed the judgment (which was later withdrawn), as an interested party.336 Accordingly, Respondent contends, \"Claimant cannot affirm seriously that access to justice has been denied.\"337\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 291, 294.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 294.\n\n305.\n\nOn the *Amparo* proceedings 1381/2015 filed by Tele F\u00e1cil against Decree 77, Respondent notes that \"Tele F\u00e1cil sought to challenge the 1381/2015 judgment through appeal 35/2016, which was rejected by the First Collegiate Court because its submission was untimely.\"338\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 297.\n\n306.\n\nFinally, on the *Amparo* proceedings 1694/2015 filed by Tele F\u00e1cil against Resolution 127, Respondent recalls that the Second District Judge denied it and that Tele F\u00e1cil appealed the judgment but later withdrew from it.339\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 300-301.\n\n307.\n\nWith respect to these measures, Respondent considers that as \"adjudicative bodies \u2014 the *Pleno* and the specialized tribunals \u2014 considered the arguments of both parties and gave reasons for their decisions.\"340\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 306; Rejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 212.\n\n308.\n\nRespondent refers to the *Azinian* decision, which held that \"holding a State internationally liable for judicial decisions does not [\u2026] entitle a claimant to seek international review of the national court decisions\" and that a claimant \"must show either a denial of justice, or a pretence of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end.\"341\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 303 (citing **CL-060**, *Azinian v. Mexico* (1 November 1999)).\n\n309.\n\nMoreover, Respondent points out to certain paragraphs of the Statement of Claim that show that Claimant \"have spun a series of allegations amounting to collusion between IFT and Telmex to ensure that Telmex would defeat Tele F\u00e1cil in their ongoing interconnection rate dispute.\"342 On this regard, Respondent alleges that Claimant's allegations \"are based solely on the illogical premise that IFT would wish to favor the interests of Telmex, recently declared a PEA and subject of a zero rate over the interests of a new entrant in the market\"343 and that \"[r]emoving this allegation of collusion or conspiracy, one is left with specialist decision-makers arriving at decision on a 4-3 majority vote that Tele F\u00e1cil simply does not like.\"344\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 307.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 308.\n\nStatement of Defense (13 March 2018), \u00b6 310.\n\n310.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent emphasizes that: (i) the concept of denial of justice applies to administratively adjudicatory proceedings as well as court proceedings; (ii) the thresholds to establish a denial of justice is very high; (iii) it does not suffice to establish that domestic adjudicators have erred, misapplied or misinterpreted domestic law; and; (iv) a claim of denial of justice can only be based on adjudicative measures that are final, which means that a claimant must exhaust its rights of appeal unless obvious futility or manifest inefficiency.345\n\nRejoinder (10 September 2018), \u00b6 211.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nAs stated previously, Claimant alleges that Respondent breached its obligation of according fair and equitable treatment. Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1105(1),\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n312.\n\nFrom the text of the treaty, it is clear that the obligation of fair and equitable treatment is limited to the treatment of \"investments of investors\". Therefore, before reviewing Claimant\u2019s allegations of unfair and inequitable treatment, the Tribunal must first clarify what is the investment that, according to Claimant, suffered from unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n313.\n\nAs stated above, the expropriation claim assumed that Claimant had an investment consisting of \"rights [...] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017)\"346 until 31 December 2017. The Tribunal, however, has found that Tele F\u00e1cil did not have such rights under Mexican law and therefore, no expropriation occurred.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 350.\n\n314.\n\nHowever, the claim raised by Claimant under NAFTA Article 1105 is slightly different. Claimant does not refer to \"rights [\u2026] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017)\" as the investment that suffered unfair and unequitable treatment. According to Claimant, the investment that was not granted fair and equitable treatment is Tele F\u00e1cil. The Parties do not dispute that Tele F\u00e1cil is an investment protected by NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n315.\n\nDespite its difference with the expropriation claim as to the specific investment affected by the measures of Mexico, Claimant basically challenges the same measures as in the expropriation claim. The alleged unfair and unequitable treatment of Tele F\u00e1cil results from the treatment granted in the issuance of the measures that allegedly destroyed interconnection rights recognized by Resolution 381.347 Therefore, the conclusions of the Tribunal as regards Resolution 381 in the expropriation claim analysis are also relevant to decide Claimant's claim under NAFTA Article 1105.\n\nAlthough Claimant questions additional measures (*i.e.*, two decisions of the Mexican courts), these measures are substantially related to the IFT's measures. Through them, the Mexican courts confirmed and validated Decree 77.\n\n316.\n\nConsidering, on the one hand, the Tribunal's findings that Tele F\u00e1cil had no interconnection rights under the August 2013 draft agreement sent by Telmex to Tele F\u00e1cil and no rights were created in favor of Tele F\u00e1cil by Resolution 381, and on the other, that the claims of Claimant as regards the alleged violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment refer to acts and omissions of Mexico in connection with Resolution 381, the Tribunal could dismiss, without further analysis whatsoever, the claim for violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment348.\n\nThis sentence originally contained the text \"that, even if it had\", right after \"the Tribunal's findings that Tele F\u00e1cil had no interconnection rights under the August 2013 draft agreement sent by Telmex to Tele F\u00e1cil and.\" The remaining arbitrators consider that including such assumption (*arguendo*) was unnecessary as it added nothing to the conclusion. The text was therefore removed.\n\n317.\n\nHowever, given the different characterizations and descriptions that Claimant gave to his investment throughout this arbitration and the fact that the allegations related to the violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment do not refer to \"rights [\u2026] to interconnect with Telmex and to earn revenues based on the interconnection rate (USD 0.00975 per minute of use through 2017)\" or to the rights under the interconnection agreement as determined by Resolution 381, but to Tele F\u00e1cil as an investment of Claimant, the Tribunal considers necessary to determine whether Tele F\u00e1cil received treatment by Mexico, other than treatment related to Resolution 381, that could amount to a violation of NAFTA Article 1105(1).\n\n***a. The standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment under NAFTA Article 1105(1)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nIn this case, Claimant contends that both the IFT and the Mexican courts acted in an unfair and inequitable manner in connection with his investment (Tele F\u00e1cil). According to Claimant, the confirmation criteria requested by the IFT's Compliance Unit and the *Pleno* 's Decree 77 were arbitrary349 and lacked due process.350 Claimant also adds that Decree 77 was discriminatory.351 Finally, Claimant refers to IFT's Resolution 127 as a \"direct consequence of the IFT's arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele F\u00e1cil\" and \"derivatively [also in breach of] Article 1105.\"352\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 493-506, 530-563.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 507-516, 564-578.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 579-586.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 597.\n\n319.\n\nWith respect to the Mexican courts, Claimant alleges that the Specialized Telecommunications Court that decided Tele F\u00e1cil's *amparo* action against Decree 77 acted with gross incompetence due to the fact that it confirmed the decision taken in Decree 77353 and that the Appellate Court unjustifiably denied Tele F\u00e1cil access to justice when it dismissed Tele F\u00e1cil's appeal against the *amparo* decision regarding Decree 77.354\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 613-628.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 629-640.\n\n320.\n\nAccording to the notes of interpretation of NAFTA's Free Trade Commission, adopted on 31 July 2001:\n\n*Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.*\n\n*The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*\n\n*A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).*\n\n321.\n\nIn order to define the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, Claimant invokes the *Waste Management v. Mexico* tribunal who stated that:\n\n*the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.*355\n\n**CL-071**, *Waste Management v. Mexico* (30 April 2004), \u00b6 98.\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant in that the *Waste Management* standard has been widely accepted and followed by other NAFTA tribunals that have addressed fair and equitable treatment claims.356 Moreover, the Tribunal also agrees with Claimant in that \"different types of State misconduct\" may fall below the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.357 Indeed, according to the formulation of the standard in *Waste Management,* a claimant can show a breach of the minimum standard of treatment if it establishes State misconduct that is (i) arbitrary, (ii) grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic; (iii) discriminatory or; (iv) absent of due process.\n\n*See, e.g.*, **CL-072**, *Bilcon v. Canada* (17 March 2015), \u00b6\u00b6 427, 442; **CL-043**, *GAMI v. Mexico* (15 November 2004), \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 444.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the use of language such as \"gross,\" \"manifest,\" and \"complete lack\" indicates that the threshold for showing a breach of this obligation is particularly high.\n\n***b. The request for Confirmation Criteria and Decree 77***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Arbitrariness\n-----------------\n\n324.\n\nWith respect to arbitrariness, the International Court of Justice, in the *ELSI* case, defined this concept as \"something opposed to the rule of law\" rather than \"something opposed to a rule of law.\"358 This definition has been accepted by at least two NAFTA Parties359 and prior NAFTA tribunals.360\n\n**CL-034**, *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A (ELSI) (United States v.

United States***\"), \u00b6 625.\n\n325.\n\nThe implication of the *ELSI* standard is that arbitrariness requires more than a showing of illegality under domestic law. Besides illegality, arbitrariness also demands a showing that the challenged State measure \"manifest[ly] lack[s] of reasons\"361 or seeks an \"ulterior motive.\"362 Thus, the arbitrariness analysis consists in reviewing the stated purposes of a certain measure and whether the measure effectively addresses the stated purposes. Other NAFTA tribunals have approached the arbitrariness analysis in these terms. The *Glamis* tribunal, for example, approached arbitrariness by inquiring into the motives behind the challenged measure and the relationship between the measure and the stated motives.363\n\n**CL-044**, *Glamis v. United States* (8 June 2009), \u00b6 803.\n\n**CL-026**, *Cargill v. Mexico* (18 September 2009), \u00b6 293.\n\n**CL-044**, *Glamis v.

Canada* decision.364 The *Bilcon* tribunal found that the Canadian authorities' decision to reject the Whites Point project was arbitrary because it \"effectively created, without legal authority or fair notice to Bilcon, a new standard of assessment rather than fully carrying out the mandate defined by the applicable law\".365 The Tribunal later insisted that \"the approach of the JRP departed in fundamental ways from the standard of evaluation required by the laws of Canada\"366 and that \"[t]he Tribunal's concern is actually that the rigorous and comprehensive evaluation defined and prescribed by the laws of Canada was not in fact carried out.\"367\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 461-462.\n\n*See, e.g.*, **CL-072**, *Bilcon v. Canada* (17 March 2015), \u00b6 591.\n\n*See, e.g.*, **CL-072**, *Bilcon v. Canada* (17 March 2015), \u00b6 594.\n\n*See, e.g.*, **CL-072**, *Bilcon v. Canada* (17 March 2015), \u00b6 598.\n\n327.\n\nFor the reasons developed below, the Tribunal concludes that even if it were to apply the *Bilcon* tribunal standard, the claim of arbitrariness under NAFTA Article 1105 by Claimant will fail as the IFT neither created a new standard of assessment, much less departed from the standard of evaluation required under Mexican law.\n\n328.\n\nClaimant alleges that the confirmation criteria was arbitrary because it was misused to \"allow Telmex to challenge and ultimately reverse critical aspects of Resolution 381, to Tele F\u00e1cil's great detriment.\"368 In other words, Claimant alleges that helping Telmex to reverse Resolution 381 was the ulterior motive for requesting the criteria confirmation.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 498.\n\n329.\n\nClaimant further claims that Decree 77 was arbitrary because it (i) contradicted Resolution 381;369 (ii) was inconsistent with fundamental norms of Mexican telecom law and policy;370 (iii) leads to truly absurd results wholly inconsistent with recent Mexican telecommunications reforms;371 and (iv) blatantly violated Mexican administrative law.372\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 533.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 538.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 545.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 555.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the IFT did have authority under Mexican law to decide Telmex's alleged dispute on rates, that the IFT dismissed Telmex's alleged dispute on the rates on grounds of admissibility and that Resolution 381 could not grant rights on specific rates to Tele F\u00e1cil. The Tribunal also found that the language of Resolution 381 could not be interpreted as proposed by Tele F\u00e1cil before the IFT and the Mexican courts and by Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n331.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Mexican law allows requests for confirmation criteria and that the IFT has the right to issue confirmation criteria. Claimant challenges, however, the form and purpose of the confirmation criteria and the issuance of Decree 77 in response to the request for confirmation criteria.\n\n332.\n\nAfter the issuance of Resolution 381, Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil debated as to the interconnection agreement that had to be executed. Tele F\u00e1cil referred to the draft agreement originally submitted by Telmex on 26 August 2013 because that was one of the agreements referred to in Resolution 381.373 Telmex in turn considered that an agreement on the rates had to be reached as a result of the change in legislation, particularly the characterization of Telmex as a preponderant agent and the subsequent limitation on the interconnection rates applicable by Telmex.\n\nThe words \"one of the agreements\" were included by the remaining arbitrators (replacing \"the agreement\") to clarify that the draft agreement originally submitted by Telmex on 26 August 2013 was not the only agreement referred to in said Resolution.\n\n333.\n\nThe sequence of events and submissions resulting in Decree 77 is stated in the IFT's Legal Unit request for Confirmation of Criteria as follows:\n\n*By letter received by this Institute on December 10, 2014, Telmex/Telnor exhibited each of the interconnection agreements to be executed between Telmex, Telnor and Tele F\u00e1cil, with the purpose for Tele F\u00e1cil to execute the interconnection agreements referred to in the Institute. It should be noted that these agreements present changes with respect to the main body and exhibits of the proposed agreements that were presented by Telmex/Telnor in the disagreement procedure that resulted in the Resolution.*\n\n*In its case, Tele F\u00e1cil submitted in writing before the Plenary session of this Institute on December 19, 2014, documentation arguing that on December 9, 2014 Telmex/Telnor convened a meeting to be held on the same day for the execution of the interconnection agreements, not recognizing the terms and conditions of the Resolution. Based on the foregoing, Tele F\u00e1cil reported that on December 16, 2014, it presented to Telmex/Telnor a letter with the local interconnection agreement and appendices contained in the file of the proceedings of disagreement.*\n\n*By application recorded on January 28, 2015, Tele F\u00e1cil presented to this Compliance Unit and against Telmex/Telnor, a complaint for failure to comply with the Resolution, claiming that interconnection has not been implemented and requesting that the actions necessary to ensure that Telmex/Telnor comply with the Resolution, and that they proceed with the immediate execution of the respective agreements.*374\n\n**C-040**, Confirmation of Criteria submitted by the Compliance Unit to the Legal Unit of the IFT (10 February 2015).\n\n334.\n\nIn its request for confirmation of criteria of 10 December 2014, Telmex referred to Tele F\u00e1cil's delay in reverting on the draft agreement presented by Telmex on 26 August 2013; to the amendments in the law after the draft was sent, to the impossibility of maintaining the original rates considering the changes in the law; and concluded that Telmex:\n\n[\u2026] *expressly stated that they did not agree with the rates contained in the agreement, as had been told to Tele F\u00e1cil's personnel in the last meeting held in Telmex and Telnor's offices, which was dismissed with further reasoning by the IFT and without considering the new legal framework that is widely known by the IFT, which makes the resolution that was issued for the interconnection disagreement initiated by Tele F\u00e1cil to be contrary to law.*375\n\n**C-041**, Confirmation of Criteria submitted by Telmex to the IFT (18 February 2015), p. 7.\n\n335.\n\nTelmex requested the IFT to confirm Telmex's criteria:\n\n[\u2026] *in the sense that the agreement that they must execute with Tele F\u00e1cil must reflect the terms and conditions contained in the currently effective legal framework.*\n\n*The above, in the understanding that the IFT may not partially resolve, since the terms and conditions of the draft agreement sent by my principals in 2013 are contrary to the currently effective legal framework because the interconnection agreement that the parties should execute must contain the interconnection rates that Telmex and Telnor must pay for termination of their traffic in Tele F\u00e1cil, as well as the origination and transit rate that Tele F\u00e1cil must pay Telmex and Telnor for these concepts for the term of January 1 to December 31, 2015.*376\n\n**C-041**, Confirmation of Criteria submitted by Telmex to the IFT (18 February 2015), p. 8.\n\n336.\n\nTele F\u00e1cil, in turn, in its submission of 25 January 2015 rejected Telmex's assertion that there was no agreement on the rates, stressed that the parties agreed on all the terms and conditions of the interconnection agreement, except for the indirect interconnection and portability charges, and after quoting Resolution 381 concluded that:\n\n[\u2026] *there was no dispute concerning the interconnection tariffs and that such terms and conditions should be part of the interconnection agreement that the Institute has ordered the execution of in the Interconnection Resolution.*\n\n*Consequently, considering that the above-mentioned Interconnection Resolution was notified to Tele F\u00e1cil on December 3, 2014 and to Telmex/Telnor on December 4, 2014, we can see that the legal deadline of 10 (ten) working days has elapsed without, on such date, the Resolution terms and conditions being complied with.*377\n\n**C-038**, Notice of Breach by Telmex to Interconnection Resolution submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the Compliance Unit of the IFT (28 January 2015), p. 5.\n\n337.\n\nIn the relevant part of its submission regarding the alleged agreement on the rates, Tele F\u00e1cil requested the IFT to conduct a verification visit to Telmex to confirm that interconnection with Tele F\u00e1cil's network had not been implemented in accordance with the indirect interconnection requested to NEXTEL and the method decided by the *Pleno* ; and to undertake the actions necessary for Telmex to comply with Resolution 381, that is to say:\n\n[to] *immediately sign the agreements that my client hereby provides once again, duly signed and the terms of which are in accordance with the Interconnection Resolution (Annex 15) and to implement the indirect interconnection under the terms requested by Tele F\u00e1cil (Annex 11).*378\n\n**C-038**, Notice of Breach by Telmex to Interconnection Resolution submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil before the Compliance Unit of the IFT (28 January 2015), p. 8.\n\n338.\n\nFrom the evidence on the record it is clear to the Tribunal that Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex had a dispute as to whether there was an agreement on the interconnection rates. Tele F\u00e1cil held that both parties had reached an agreement contained in the draft interconnection agreement submitted by Telmex to Tele F\u00e1cil in 2013. According to Tele F\u00e1cil, the existence of such agreement was confirmed by Resolution 381 and therefore, the IFT should order Telmex to sign it. Telmex's position was that no such agreement existed because as a result of the changes in the law, the declaration of Telmex as a preponderant agent and the new provisions on interconnection rates, it would be illegal for Telmex to charge the rates contained in the draft agreement.\n\n339.\n\nThe Compliance Unit's question before the *Pleno* of the IFT was whether it had the authority to decide such dispute and particularly, whether it could order Telmex to sign the draft agreement submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil \u2013 initially in 2014 and again with the January 2015 submission \u2013 which Tele F\u00e1cil claimed was the valid and binding agreement between the parties and whether Resolution 381 could be interpreted as an order for Telmex to sign such draft. This was not a dispute on the rates but on whether Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil had an agreement on the rates and if so, whether the IFT had the authority to decide that there was an agreement and order Telmex to sign such agreement.\n\n340.\n\nThe text of the criteria on which confirmation is being sought by the Compliance Unit provides as follows:\n\n*In accordance with the provisions of articles 52 and 53, section VI of the Organic Statute of this Institute, I submit this to see if the Compliance Unit, based on the complaint of Tele F\u00e1cil, can require Telmex/Telnor compliance with the Resolution, in the terms requested by the complainant, that is, to require said concessionaires both to comply with the interconnection of their networks and to execute the respective interconnection agreement, within the terms contained in the Resolution.*\n\n*Therefore, this Legal Unit is requested to confirm the legal criterion consisting in the authority of the lnstitute's Plenary to require concessionaires that submitted a disagreement of interconnection to the Institute, includes not only the interconnection but also the execution of the corresponding agreement, in the form and terms determined in the resolution of disputes submitted for the lnstitute's consideration.*379\n\n**C-040**, Confirmation of Criteria submitted by the Compliance Unit to the Legal Unit of the IFT (10 February 2015), pp. 2-3.\n\n341.\n\nDecree 77, issued in response to the request for Confirmation Criteria, rejects both Tele F\u00e1cil's request to order Telmex to sign the 2013 draft agreement and Telmex's request to declare that the rates contained in said draft were contrary to the legal provisions in effect as regards interconnection rates. The reasoning of the IFT in Decree 77 is simple and straightforward: the FTBL grants the IFT the authority to decide on disputes on interconnection rates submitted to it; the only disputes submitted were indirect interconnection and portability charges; the IFT cannot decide non-disputed terms and therefore the IFT cannot decide which interconnection agreement the parties must sign nor whether the parties had a valid agreement on the interconnection rates.\n\n342.\n\nThe IFT concludes by indicating in Decree 77 that the First operative part of Resolution 381:\n\n[\u2026] *is an order issued by the authority that must be complied with by Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex/Telnor, in the understanding that said document must invariably consider the indirect interconnection and omit any reference to portability costs, the only points over which the Plenary of the IFT referred to and regarding which it has the power to obligate the parties involved.*\n\n*Regarding the other terms and conditions of the interconnection agreement that the parties must execute, taking into consideration that this collegiate body did not address the provisions contained in the draft agreement included in the file as it was not a matter of disagreement and therefore it was not a matter of its competence, it is clarified that the rights of the parties regarding the aspects that were not a subject matter of the Interconnection Resolution remain untouched. The above, since the will of the parties is what governs the execution of an interconnection agreement.*380\n\n**C-051**, Decree 77 (8 April 2015), p. 12.\n\n343.\n\nThe evidence of the record does not support Claimant's conspiracy theory to favor Telmex or a plot to deprive Tele F\u00e1cil from the rights that it allegedly had under Resolution 381. As already concluded by the Tribunal, Tele F\u00e1cil opted for an interpretation of Resolution 381 that would result in the IFT exceeding its powers. Under this interpretation, Tele F\u00e1cil requested the IFT to enforce Resolution 381 as if it had recognized that there was a valid agreement on the rates and that Resolution 381 had ordered Telmex to execute the 2013 draft agreement submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil to the IFT within the disagreement proceedings. Telmex in turn had a different interpretation and requested confirmation that there was no agreement on the rates and that the rates purportedly agreed with Tele F\u00e1cil were illegal. The IFT clarified Resolution 381 thorough Decree 77 by indicating that the IFT had only decided on the disputes submitted to it \u2013 indirect interconnection and portability \u2013 and that the other terms with respect to which no dispute was submitted were for the parties to agree.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no arbitrariness in the request for Confirmation Criteria or in Decree 77. A legitimate doubt arose as to the interpretation of Resolution 381 given the specific and limited powers and authorities of the IFT.381 The doubt arose as a result of Tele F\u00e1cil's request for the IFT to order Telmex to sign a specific interconnection agreement that Telmex disavowed. Decree 77 was issued within two months following the request for confirmation criteria and confirmed what was clear in the FTBL: that the IFT could not, without exceeding its powers, decide on disputes that were not proven and order Telmex to sign a specific interconnection agreement. It could only order Telmex and Tele F\u00e1cil to sign an agreement providing for indirect interconnection and not providing for portability. The other terms and conditions could not be the subject matter of a decision.\n\nThe two remaining arbitrators consider that, in addition to the confusion arising because of the powers of IFT, it was also unclear which agreement had to be signed by the parties: (i) Resolution 381 refers to the 2nd version of the agreement (which has no rate); (ii) Tele F\u00e1cil alleges that it should have been comprised by the body of the 2nd version of the agreement and the rates/annexes from the 1st version. Mr. Canchola (who wrote the request for confirmation criteria) provides good testimony on this issue at page 539 of the transcript:  \n[*\u2026*] *And I should clarify here that, in an incredible act that I never had seen in my time at IFT or at COFETEL, I'd never seen a petition such as this situation in which there was apparently a meeting of the minds that did not exist as such. I had never seen that in all my time at the Institute, neither when I was in litigation or in supervision, where on the one hand one says there is an agreement, and the other says not all the conditions are there, so that for me was a problem because in order to be able to enforce the Agreement in the interconnection, I needed to know what the Agreement was. And given that distinct position of each of the two parties, in the use of my authority, I asked the legal office to render an interpretation for us, which could then be submitted to the Plenary.\"* Tr. Day 2 539:1-16.\n\n345.\n\nThe conspiracy theories submitted by Claimant and based on allegations such as (i) the instructions purportedly given in mid-January 2015 by the IFT's Chairman, Mr. Gabriel Contreras to Mr. Sanchez Henkel, head of the IFT's Compliance Unit, not to enforce Resolution 381, (ii) that Decree 77 only considered the Compliance Unit's arguments, and (iii) that Telmex contacted the IFT before filing its own confirmation criteria at the time the Compliance Unit filed its request, are mere speculations and the evidence submitted in no way supports the serious accusation that the IFT and Telmex colluded to avoid enforcement of Resolution 381.\n\n346.\n\nThe IFT acted within its powers and authority in interpreting Resolution 381 and decided through Decree 77 the scope and extent of Resolution 381 given the doubts raised as a result of the different interpretations of Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex. The decision itself simply stresses both the limitations of the powers of the IFT and the fact that no dispute on the rates was ever submitted to the IFT.\n\n347.\n\nClaimant alleges that the decision contained in Decree 77 will generate a \"never ending story\"382 that will allow one of the parties to stretch negotiations with the intention of preventing other carriers from entering and competing in the market. The Tribunal disagrees. Under FTL Article 42, the IFT can only rule on disputed terms submitted to it. This means that the IFT has no authority to alter the terms on which the parties have already reached an agreement or to decide on terms not agreed upon, but not submitted to the IFT.383 Terms that are not submitted to the IFT, under Article 42, are not necessarily agreed terms.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the remaining arbitrators consider useful to add that recourse to civil courts prevents the \"never-ending story\" from occurring. In the opinion of such arbitrators, recourse to such courts reinforces that the IFT is not the competent authority for determining the existence of an agreement.\n\n*See i.e., \u00b6\u00b6* 246, 255, 262 above.\n\n348.\n\nFinally, the fact that Decree 77 was not a unanimous decision has no relevance whatsoever for the purposes of showing arbitrariness. It is undisputed that under Mexican law, a majority decision of the IFT's *Pleno* is as valid and binding as a unanimous one.\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Claimant's alleged violations of the obligations of fair and equitable treatment to Tele F\u00e1cil refer to measures affecting Resolution 381, which granted no rights to Tele F\u00e1cil, that there is no evidence supporting that either the request for confirmation criteria or Decree 77 were arbitrary.\n\n(ii) Grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic\n--------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nThe IFT acted within its powers and authority under Mexican law and nothing in the record suggests that its actions were grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic.\n\n(iii) Discrimination\n--------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Parties invoke the standard of the tribunal in *Waste Management* according to which \"the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct [\u2026] is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice.\"384 Subsequent NAFTA tribunals have found, under this standard, that discrimination exists if the State willfully targets the investor.385\n\n**CL-071**, *Waste Management v. Mexico* (30 April 2004), \u00b6 98.\n\n**CL-026**, *Cargill v. Mexico* (18 September 2009), \u00b6\u00b6 2, 300, 550; **CL-130**, *Eli Lilly and Company v. The Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL (Award, 16 March 2017) (van den Berg, Born, Bethlehem), \u00b6 440 (\"Claimant does not allege that the promise utility doctrine discriminates against foreign patent holders on its face, or that Canadian courts have shown any intent to discriminate against foreign patent holders\").\n\n352.\n\nTo identify whether the State willfully targeted the investor, Tribunals have looked into whether there is a legitimate justification for such targeting. In *Cargill,* for example, respondent alleged that claimant's targeting was based on \"legitimate countermeasures under international law.\"386\n\n**CL-026**, *Cargill v. Mexico* (18 September 2009), \u00b6\u00b6 379, 382.\n\n353.\n\nClaimant did not even make a *prima facie* case that the request for confirmation criteria or Decree 77 were discriminatory. Claimant's simply stated that Decree 77 singled out his investment (*i.e.*, Tele F\u00e1cil) supposedly because the IFT treated the company in an unprecedented manner.\n\n354.\n\nHowever, Claimant was unable to point at a case in which an investor or an investment had been treated differently in like or comparable circumstances or that there was a precedent in the treatment of an investment of an investor that was disregarded by the IFT. Claimant cited a number of cases in an attempt to show a difference in treatment. However, none of such cases evidences that the telecommunication carriers involved had been in the same position of Tele F\u00e1cil. Claimant itself admitted that this case was unique.\n\n355.\n\nThe uniqueness of this case lies in that, as admitted by Claimant and sustained by the IFT, generally the parties to an interconnection agreement submit to the IFT only the disputed terms of the interconnection agreement after having agreed on all other terms. In this case, however, Tele F\u00e1cil submitted to the IFT a dispute on indirect interconnection and portability charges, without carrying out a real negotiation before with Telmex. As the IFT explained, the dispute resolution proceedings under Article 42 were initiated without the parties having agreed on all the interconnection terms.\n\n356.\n\nThis case was unique and therefore there was no precedent. The uniqueness of the case was the result of Tele F\u00e1cil having submitted a dispute on only two issues (indirect interconnection and portability) when it knew or should have known either that there was no agreement on the other terms and conditions of the interconnection agreement or that there was a substantial risk of Telmex challenging the existence of such agreement. After unjustifiably delaying for around 10 months a response to Telmex's proposed draft interconnection agreement, immediately after the amendments in the law affecting the ability of Telmex to charge the rates contained in the draft, Tele F\u00e1cil rushed to provide comments on the draft and without waiting for a response to such comments, it submitted the dispute to the IFT. If the IFT assumed that all the other terms and conditions had been agreed upon, as it had been generally the case, this was the result of Tele F\u00e1cil's own acts and assumption of the risk that it had a valid and finalized agreement with Telmex, except for the two issues submitted to the IFT. The unprecedent situation was created by Tele F\u00e1cil's conduct and the risks it decided to assume to bet for a business opportunity.\n\n357.\n\nClaimant therefore did not prove that either the request for confirmation criteria or Decree 77 were discriminatory, much less that Tele F\u00e1cil was treated unfairly or inequitably with respect to measures other than the ones affecting a resolution - Resolution 381 - under which he has no rights.\n\n(iv) Due process\n----------------\n\n358.\n\nLack of due process may occur in the context of judicial and administrative proceedings.387 However, the standard is different in each scenario. The lack of due process has to lead: (i) \"to an outcome which offends judicial propriety [\u2026] in judicial proceedings\" or \"to [\u2026] a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.\"388\n\n**CL-071**, *Waste Management v. Mexico* (30 April 2004), \u00b6 98 (stating that \"the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct [\u2026] involv[ing] a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2014 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in ***judicial proceedings*** or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an ***administrative process***.\"). (Emphasis added).\n\n**CL-071**, *Waste Management v. Mexico* (30 April 2004), \u00b6 98.\n\n359.\n\nIn the field of administrative proceedings, the standard is a \"a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.\"389 On this point, few decisions have been on the point. The *Metalclad* tribunal although did not expressly examine a lack of due process claim, considered that Mexico had breached its fair and equitable treatment obligation in accordance with NAFTA because it failed to ensure a \"transparent and predictable framework\" to the investor regarding a rule applicable to the requirement or not of a municipal construction permit.390\n\n*See* \u00b6 321 above.\n\n**CL-053**, *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1 (Award, 30 August 2000) (Lauterpacht, Civiletti, Siqueiros) (\"***Metalclad v. Mexico***\"), \u00b6 99.\n\n360.\n\nAccording to the *Metalclad* tribunal, \"transparency\" is \"prominent\" under NAFTA. Thus, if State authorities \"become aware of any scope for misunderstanding or confusion [in connection with all legal requirements for the purposes of initiating, completing and successfully operating an investment] it is their duty to ensure that the correct position is promptly determined and clearly stated\".391 In the *Metalclad* tribunal's finding, it was central the fact that for a long time the investor relied on federal government officials' reiterative representations that a municipal construction permit was unnecessary to build a hazardous waste landfill but later the municipality required such permit and did not grant it on grounds unrelated to the physical construction.392\n\n**CL-053**, *Metalclad v. Mexico* (30 August 2000), \u00b6 76.\n\n**CL-053**, *Metalclad v. Mexico* (30 August 2000), \u00b6\u00b6 79-101.\n\n361.\n\nThe *TECO v. Guatemala* tribunal, in applying a similar minimum standard of treatment provision in CAFTA-DR, stated that \"[i]n assessing whether there has been [\u2026] a breach of due process, it is relevant that the Guatemalan administration entirely failed to provide reasons for its decisions or disregarded its own rules.\"393 For this Tribunal, the holding in *TECO* is relevant insofar as a lack of due process can be established only if the administration has *entirely* disregarded the procedural rules that it must follow within a particular process.\n\n**CL-066**, *TECO v. Guatemala* (19 December 2013), \u00b6 457.\n\n362.\n\nClaimant alleges that the IFT Compliance Unit's request \"was conducted for months in secrecy, without involving Tele F\u00e1cil or affording the company any due process.\"394 Claimant further alleges that \"[a]pplying the unilateral 'confirmation of criteria' process to resolve a bilateral interconnection dispute is fundamentally unfair and denies the absent party the procedural protections guaranteed under Mexican law.\"395\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 507.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 511.\n\n363.\n\nAs stated previously, in administrative proceedings Claimant must prove a complete lack of transparency and candour to establish a breach of Respondent's fair and equitable obligation for lack of due process.\n\n364.\n\nClaimant's case draws from the basis that there was a dispute pending before the IFT and therefore the IFT had to apply the disagreement proceedings set forth in FTL Article 42 instead of the confirmation of criteria. According to Claimant there was a \"direct conflict between two providers' interests.\"396 That is contradictory not only with the findings of the Tribunal in this case but also with Claimant's own narrative. There was no dispute on the rates. The conflict between Tele F\u00e1cil and Telmex was a conflict as to whether they had entered into a valid and binding agreement on the rates. The IFT did not have the power or the authority to decide such conflict and therefore Resolution 381 could not be interpreted as deciding on rates or as accepting that all the terms and conditions in the draft agreement submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil had been agreed upon. The IFT could only decide on the issues submitted by Tele F\u00e1cil: indirect interconnection and portability charges.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 510.\n\n365.\n\nThe disputes on the rates before the IFT were: the one initially submitted by Telmex and dismissed by the IFT in Resolution 381 on grounds of admissibility and the one submitted by Telmex and resolved by the IFT with Resolution 127. Consequently, Claimant cannot validly allege a violation of due process merely because he considers that the IFT should have followed disagreement proceedings to resolve a dispute that Claimant himself alleges that at the time did not exist, instead of the corresponding proceedings for interpreting a resolution (*i.e.*, Resolution 381). The confirmation criteria proceedings were carried out under the applicable rules. In fact, Claimant does not question that the IFT properly followed such applicable rules and the legal experts explained that these rules do not provide, as do the rules governing the disagreement proceedings, for a specific opportunity to be heard. In any event, the record also evidences that Tele F\u00e1cil did have the opportunity to present its case to the IFT's *Pleno* session of 5 March 2015, before Decree 77 was issued.397\n\n**C-043**, Transcript of Audio Recording of Plenary Meeting No. 2015-03-05-1239-SP- 18 with Tele F\u00e1cil (5 March 2015).\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds, first, that Claimant is not claiming a violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in connection with investments other than the ones allegedly arising from Resolution 381 and second, that in the request for confirmation criteria the IFT did not violate Tele F\u00e1cil\u00b4s right to due process.\n\n367.\n\nAs regards Decree 77, Claimant complains that it \"compounded the IFT's complete denial of due process to Tele F\u00e1cil.\"398 Claimant alleges that through Decree 77, the IFT's *Pleno* erred in three ways: (i) condoning and perpetuating all of the process errors committed by the Legal Unit;399 (ii) disingenuously representing that Tele F\u00e1cil's views had been taken into consideration;400 (iv) not accounting for Tele F\u00e1cil's views.401 None of these premises are correct.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 564.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 565.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 572.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 576.\n\n368.\n\nFirst, as stated previously, the confirmation criteria proceedings were conducted in accordance with the applicable law.402 Neither the Compliance Unit nor the Legal Unit or the *Pleno* erred in applying the corresponding rules. The rules that Claimant claims as applicable correspond to the ones that the IFT must follow to decide a dispute, which was not the case.\n\n*See* \u00b6 365 above.\n\n369.\n\nSecond, in Decree 77, the *Pleno* did not represent that Tele F\u00e1cil's views had been taken into consideration. Claimant's allegation is based on the following text of Decree 77:\n\n*In order to address the referred requests and confirmations of criteria and with the purpose of effectively enforcing the Interconnection Resolution [381], it is necessary for the IFT Plenary to analyze said resolution in order to determine its scope through the issuance of this Decree.*403\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 572 (citing Decree 77).\n\n370.\n\nNothing in this passage supports Claimant's claim. It merely states that the *Pleno* reviewed the text of Resolution 381 in order to determine its scope and extent. There is no representation regarding Tele F\u00e1cil.\n\n371.\n\nThird and last, Claimant complains that Tele F\u00e1cil views were not considered. The claim is not supported by the evidence. Tele F\u00e1cil requested enforcement of Resolution 381 and explained its interpretation as to the scope and extent of the resolution starting from the premise that there was an agreement on the rates. Telmex had a completely different interpretation, considered that there was no such agreement and requested the IFT to decide that the alleged agreement on the rates claimed by Tele F\u00e1cil was illegal. In Decree 77, the IFT summarizes the issues at stake, the requests from both parties and decides, correctly, that it only has authority to decide on disputed terms and conditions that the network carriers submit for its decision but not on disputed issues not submitted to the IFT nor on whether the parties have agreed or not on certain terms and conditions.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is no allegation of the violation of due process to Tele F\u00e1cil in connection with rights other that the ones allegedly conferred by Resolution 381 and that, in any event, due process was not violated in the issuance of Decree 77.\n\n373.\n\nMoreover, Claimant contends that \"Resolution 127 is a direct consequence of the IFT's arbitrary, secretive and discriminatory scheme to save Telmex from its deal with Tele F\u00e1cil. Therefore, derivatively, it also breaches Article 1105.\"404 However, having concluded that neither the request for confirmation criteria nor Decree 77 breached NAFTA Article 1105, Resolution 127 cannot \"derivatively\" breach NAFTA Article 1105.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 597.\n\n***c. The decisions of the Mexican courts***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nUnder the denial of justice claim, Claimant challenges two decisions of the Mexican courts. *The first decision* is the one issued by the First District Court for Administrative Matters, specialized in Economic Competition, Broadcasting and Telecommunications on 22 January 2016, which denied Tele F\u00e1cil's *amparo* action challenging the constitutionality of Decree 77.405*The second decision* is the Circuit Court's decision of 21 April 2016 that dismissed Tele F\u00e1cil's appeal, with prejudice, and without addressing the substance of Tele F\u00e1cil's claim406.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 615.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 629.\n\n375.\n\nAgain, both decisions allegedly affect the rights that Claimant considers were conferred by Resolution 381 and the Tribunal has already concluded that Tele F\u00e1cil had no such rights under Mexican law. In any event, the Tribunal finds no denial of justice for the reasons explained below.\n\n376.\n\nAs regards the First District Court\u00b4s Decision of 22 January 2016 that decided on the *amparo* against Decree 77, the Tribunal finds that the criticisms of Claimant to this decision are not sufficient to establish a breach of NAFTA Article 1105. Claimant disagrees with the reasoning of the Court and with the fact that the Court dismissed Tele F\u00e1cil's arguments and criticizes, with no evidence or support, what it perceives as a lack of preparation of the Mexican courts to deal with telecommunications matters. But a mere disagreement with the reasoning does not amount to a lack of reasoning nor does it allow this Tribunal to consider that the Court administered justice in a seriously inadequate way or that it clearly and maliciously misapplied the law.\n\n377.\n\nIt is not for this Tribunal to second-guess the decisions made by domestic courts or to act as a court of appeals. Claimant's allegations do not evidence a serious flaw or malice in the application of the law but simply a disagreement on the reasoning.\n\n378.\n\nWith respect to the Circuit Court's decision of 21 April 2016 dismissing Tele F\u00e1cil's appeal, the evidence before this Tribunal overwhelmingly proves that Tele F\u00e1cil acted imprudently, assumed risks and disregarded the most basic diligence in the filing of the appeal, and now attempts to avoid the consequences of its own acts.\n\n379.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the ten-day term to file the appeal expired at midnight on 11 February 2016. Mr. Bello, a witness in this proceedings and counsel for Tele F\u00e1cil at the time, explained that on 11 February 2016, his colleague Diana Margarita Mayorga Rea, \"left at 11:00 pm to submit the appeal to the specialized Court of Appeals\" and due to \"terrible traffic on the road [she] arrived later than expected at the courthouse, but still on time [\u2026] at 11:58 [pm].\"407. The same witness subsequently indicated that \"the security officer prevented my attorney from entering and asked her to wait until they contacted the person in charge of the Office of Correspondence\" who later appeared and told her \"that he would not receive any other documents because it was already past midnight.\"408 Claimant alleges that \"[i]n an unprecedented event, the courthouse security guard denied counsel's access to the court's filing office.\"409\n\n**C-004**, Bello First Statement (6 November 2017), \u00b6 140.\n\n**C-004**, Bello First Statement (6 November 2017), \u00b6 141.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 631.\n\n380.\n\nHad Tele F\u00e1cil acted with a minimum degree of diligence in the appeal of a decision related to Decree 77 that allegedly destroyed the value of its investments, it would have not waited until the eleventh hour to file the appeal and there would not have been a debate on the decision of the Circuit Court's not to admit the appeal for being extemporaneous.410\n\nThe remaining arbitrators consider useful to add that counsel for Tele F\u00e1cil not only appeared at the court at 11:58 p.m. on the last date of the term for filing, that is, two minutes before the deadline, but also failed to file at 9:00 a.m. the next day as allowed and required by Mexican jurisprudence. In other words, Tele F\u00e1cil not only put itself at risk by attempting to file at the eleventh hour, but also through its own mistakes and fault, failed to file the next day after the term expired all of which caused the filing to be extemporaneous.\n\n381.\n\nClaimant has two criticisms on the decision not to admit the appeal. *First* that the Chief Justice of the Circuit Court admitted the appeal on 9 March 2016 but, despite this prior decision, on 21 April 2016, \"the Circuit Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, dismissed Tele F\u00e1cil's appeal.\"411 The second criticism is that the Circuit Court's dismissal was \"without any reasonable justification.\"412\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 633-634.\n\nStatement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6 634.\n\n382.\n\nAs to the first criticism, it is undisputed that under Mexican law, the decision of 9 March 2016 issued by one judge was not a final decision and therefore could eventually change if the panel of three judges were to disagree with the first decision. Claimant therefore cannot hold to the first and not final decision to claim that there was a denial of justice.\n\n383.\n\nThe second criticism is based on an examination by Claimant of the reasoning of the Circuit Court to dismiss the appeal and alleges that such facts and norms could have been interpreted differently.413 Again, a mere disagreement with the reasoning of the court does not amount to a denial of justice.\n\n*See, i.e.*, Statement of Claim (7 November 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 634-635.\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that Tele F\u00e1cil was not denied justice.\n\n385.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons, the Tribunal does not find that Respondent breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment under NAFTA Article 1105.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Claimant argues that Respondent should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimant414, including legal fees and expenses totaling USD 6,406,160.63, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tribunal and ICSID Costs | USD 575,000 |\n| Legal Representation \u2013 Fees & Expenses | USD 4,776,095.98 |\n| Other Assistance \u2013 Expert Fees & Expenses | USD 987,339.14 |\n| Other Assistance \u2013 Translation & Hearing Preparatory Costs | USD 52,705.74 |\n| Witness Expenses Related to the Hearing | USD 15,019.77 |\n| GRAND TOTAL | USD 6,406,160.63 |\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs (15 January 2020), p. 1.\n\n387.\n\nClaimant makes this claim on the basis of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Cost Submissions**\n------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Respondent submits that Claimant should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses totaling USD 2,525,014.36, broken down as follows:415\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Outside Consultants | USD 1,362,517.20 |\n| Experts | USD 586,192.38 |\n| ICSID Payments | USD 550,000 |\n| *Per Diem* Costs of Mexico's Representatives | USD 26,304.78 |\n| GRAND TOTAL | USD 2,525,014.36 |\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs (15 January 2020), p. 2.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n390.\n\nArticle 40(1) and (2) of the Arbitration Rules provide that:\n\n*Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.*\n\n*With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.*\n\n391.\n\nThese provisions give the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention establishes that \"the Tribunal [\u2026] shall decide how and by whom [the arbitration costs] shall be paid\". Article 40(1) of the Arbitration Rules states that although \"the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party [\u2026] the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case\" and Article 40(2), which refers to the reasonable costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party claimed during the arbitral proceedings \u2014 as stated in Article 38(e) \u2014 reiterates that the tribunal \"taking into account the circumstances of the case\" is \"free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\"\n\n392.\n\nIn the present case, the arbitrators' fees and expenses and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses | 691,058.65 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 116,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 141,316.38 |\n| **Total** | **948,375.03** |\n\n393.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.416 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 474,187.51.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n394.\n\nClaimant has failed in all his claims before this Tribunal and even though it is true that Respondent failed in its jurisdictional objection, the changes and delays in the jurisdictional objections and the need to submit additional jurisdictional objections resulted from the late information submitted by Mr. Blanco as to his bankruptcy, his subsequent withdrawal from the case and the new position of Mr. Nelson as sole Claimant.\n\n395.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal, in exercise of its discretion, has decided that Claimant should (a) bear the arbitrators' fees and expenses and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, for a total amount of (USD 948,375.03); (b) bear 80% of the costs of Respondent in the amount of USD 1,580,011.49;417 and (c) bear his own costs.\n\nRespondent's costs, excluding the item for costs of the proceeding (USD 550,000), amount to USD 1,975,014.36. 80% of this amout is USD 1,580,011.49.\n\n**VIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n396.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) Denies Respondent's objection to jurisdiction based on NAFTA Article 1117;\n\n(2) Denies Claimant's claim of unlawful expropriation based on NAFTA Article 1110;\n\n(3) Denies Claimant's claim of unfair and inequitable treatment based on NAFTA Article 1105;\n\n(4) Determines Claimant to pay Respondent the amount of USD 2,054,199418 for arbitration costs.\n\nThis amount is the result of adding 80% of Respondent's costs (USD 1,580,011.49) plus the costs of the arbitration that were advanced by Respondent (USD 474,187.51)."}, {"Title": "Corrections to the Final Award of 5 June 2020", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2020-07-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Corrections to the Final Award of 5 June 2020\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 June 2020, the Tribunal rendered the final award in this arbitration (the \"**Award**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 4 July 2020, Claimant requested the Tribunal to make certain \"*technical corrections*\" to the Award (the \"**Request**\"), pursuant to Article 36 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 December 1976 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"). In his Request, Claimant expressly \"*consent*[ed] *to the authority of the truncated Tribunal to make such corrections*.\"\n\n3.\n\nUpon the Tribunal's invitation, on 10 July 2020, Respondent submitted its comments to the Request and, on 16 July 2020, confirmed that it had no objections to the Request being decided by the remaining Members of the Tribunal.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S REQUEST**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) First Request**\n---------------------\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to Article 38(a) of the UNCITRAL Rules, Claimant requests that rather than including a single lump sum figure indicating the fees of the Tribunal, paragraph 392 of the Award include a breakdown of the fees of each arbitrator.\n\n**(2) Second Request**\n----------------------\n\n5.\n\nClaimant requests corrections in connection with the use of the terms \"cost submission\" and \"submission on costs\" in the Award. Specifically, Claimant claims that on 24 September 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult with each other and to submit (if possible) a joint proposal on the timing and the format of the pleadings on costs, including whether the Parties wished to submit such pleadings as submissions on costs, *i.e*., including arguments as to who should bear the costs, or merely statements on costs. The Parties did not agree and on 8 October 2019, Claimant indicated his choice to make a submission on costs, *i.e*., a pleading including arguments. On 19 October 2019, the Tribunal ordered the Parties to submit statements of costs.\n\n6.\n\nClaimant indicates that on 15 January 2020, he submitted his Statement of Costs with the following introductory paragraph:\n\n*Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1 and the Tribunal's instructions provided on October 9, 2019 that the parties should submit a Statement of Costs, as opposed to an argumentative Submission on Costs, Claimant hereby lists his costs incurred in connection with these proceedings in accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. This Statement of Costs is accompanied by statements by the representatives of each firm for the limited purpose of attesting to the veracity of the amounts billed. Supporting documentation is available upon the Tribunal's request. For the avoidance of any doubt, Claimant takes the position that Respondent should bear all of Claimant's costs.*\n\n7.\n\nAccording to Claimant, even though under the heading \"Procedural History,\" the Award correctly indicates that on 15 January 2020, the Parties submitted their respective statements of costs (\"**Statements of Costs**\"), under paragraphs 386, 387 and 388 the Award incorrectly indicates that Claimant made a submission on costs and suggests that Claimant argued on costs even though Claimant was not permitted to make arguments. Claimant therefore requests that:\n\na) The terms \"cost submissions\" and \"submission on costs\" as used in the Award be replaced with the terms \"cost statements\" and \"statement on costs\";\n\nb) The word \"argues\" in paragraph 386 be replaced with the word \"submits\" for accuracy and for alignment with the description of Respondent's statement on costs in paragraph 388; and\n\nc) Paragraph 387 be stricken from the Award.\n\n**(3) Third Request**\n---------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimant requests the Tribunal to delete all refences to the ICSID Convention from paragraphs 389 and 391 of the Award, related to the decision on costs, because these proceedings are conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, except to the extent that they are modified by Section B, Chapter 11 of NAFTA, but not by the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(1) First Request**\n---------------------\n\n9.\n\nRespondent does not oppose to the inclusion in the Award of a breakdown of each arbitrators' fees.\n\n**(2) Second Request**\n----------------------\n\n10.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal to recall the context in which it ordered the Parties to present their statements of costs. On 8 October 2019, Claimant informed the Tribunal on behalf of the Parties that they had exchanged proposals on the form and timing of their statements/submissions on costs. Claimant's proposal was that the Parties file submissions on costs, including arguments of the Parties on who should bear the costs of the proceeding, and Respondent's position was that it did not consider it necessary that the Parties make such arguments. The Parties jointly requested the Tribunal's ruling on the matter.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent also recalls the decision of the Tribunal on the matter dated 9 October 2019, in which the Tribunal stated:\n\n*The Tribunal has reviewed and considered the positions of the Parties expressed in the said communications. The Tribunal is of the view that the Parties have already indicated their positions as to costs in the various submissions in this arbitration. Therefore, the Parties shall only present a statement of costs, with no further allegations, on or before January 15, 2020.*\n\n12.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the above decision from the Tribunal confirms that the Parties in their submissions presented their positions on costs, which were not complicated: costs follow the event, except in exceptional circumstances that do not exist in this case. Respondent further indicates that, despite the instructions from the Tribunal, in his Statement of Costs of 15 January 2020, Claimant made an additional argument: \"*For avoidance of any doubt, Claimant takes the position that Respondent should bear all of Claimant's costs*\".\n\n13.\n\nBased on the above, Respondent considers that:\n\na) if the intent of the Tribunal when referring to \"submissions on costs\" was to include only the \"statements of costs\" presented on 15 January 2020, then Respondent would not oppose the requested correction; but if the intent of the Tribunal was to refer to the statements of cost and the submissions on costs presented by the Parties throughout the arbitration, then no correction should be made.\n\nb) the word \"agues\" should not be replaced by the word \"submits\" because Claimant elected to include arguments in its statement of 15 January 2020. The change of the word \"argues\" for \"submits\" is not an \"error in computation\", \"a clerical or typographical error\" or an \"error of a similar nature\" in the sense of Article 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules, but a request for the Tribunal to ignore that Claimant included arguments in its Statement of Costs. Respondent therefore opposes the requested correction.\n\nc) There is no basis for the elimination of paragraph 387 of the Award. Claimant elected to refer to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules in his Statement of Costs of 15 January 2020 and the fact that he did not accurately describe the \"purpose\" of such reference to Article 38 is not an error of the ones provided for under Article 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Respondent therefore opposes the requested correction.\n\n**(3) Third Request**\n---------------------\n\n14.\n\nAccording to Respondent, even though the proceedings are governed by the UNCITRAL Rules, nothing prevents the Tribunal from referring also to the ICSID Convention. If the references to the ICSID Convention were a mistake, rather than eliminating such references, the Respondent suggests that the Tribunal consider replacing them with references to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S CONSIDERATIONS ON THE REQUEST**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nArticle 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:\n\n*Within thirty days after the receipt of the award, either party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct in the award any errors in computation, any clerical or typographical errors, or any errors of similar nature. The arbitral tribunal may within thirty days after the communication of the award make such corrections on its own initiative*\n\n16.\n\nThe Request was submitted by Claimant within the thirty-day term provided for under Article 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and therefore is timely.\n\n17.\n\nThe aforementioned provision clearly refers to \"errors\" and to the fact that the purpose of the procedure is to \"correct\" such errors. The correction procedure applies to \"errors\", such errors must be \"in the award\" and must be computational, clerical, typographical or have a \"similar nature\" to a computational, clerical or typographical error.\n\n18.\n\nArticle 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides, on the one hand, for the powers of the Tribunal and, on the other, for a limitation of such powers as regards correction. It expressly authorizes the Tribunal to rectify errors, but such power extends only to the correction of errors that are computational, clerical, typographical or have a \"similar nature\". Therefore, the procedure for correction does not encompass any alleged mistake of law or any factual determination or discretionary assessment made by the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore needs to determine whether that which the Claimant seeks to be corrected are errors of the type mentioned in Article 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**(1) First Request**\n---------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Award includes the total amount paid to the Tribunal and ICSID as a lump sum but not a discrimination of the breakdown of the amounts paid. The tribunal considers that strictly this request does not relate to the correction of an error that is computational, clerical, typographical or of a similar nature but rather to the Tribunal's appreciation of a rule of law set forth in Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules. However, both Parties agree on the correction and the Tribunal has no objection to proceed with the requested amendment.\n\n**(2) Second Request**\n----------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the reasons submitted by Claimant are no grounds for correction. The Parties discussed whether to present their submissions on costs including arguments as to which party should bear the costs or to file a mere statement of costs. The Tribunal decided that the Parties should present only a statement of costs because the view of the Tribunal was that \"*the Parties ha*[d] *already indicated their positions as to costs in the various submissions in this arbitration.*\"\n\n22.\n\nRather than a correction, Claimant seems to be making a claim that he was not granted the opportunity to submit his position on costs and that the Award should reflect such allegation. As indicated in the decision of 9 October 2019, the Tribunal had received allegations on costs in the various submissions made by the Parties during the proceedings and considered that no further allegations were necessary. The Claimant, still, indicated in his Statement of Costs of 15 January 2020 that for the avoidance of doubt his position was that Respondent should bear all costs.\n\n23.\n\nThe Award therefore refers to \"submission on costs\" and to arguments by the Parties to reflect the position taken by each Party throughout the proceedings and not only in the Statements of Costs of 15 January 2020.\n\n24.\n\nBased on the above conclusions, the Tribunal finds no reason to modify paragraphs 386 and 388 of the Award or to strike paragraph 387 from the Award.\n\n**(3) Third Request**\n---------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the reference to the ICSID Convention is irrelevant given the reference made in the Award to Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, as a ground for the Tribunal's decision on costs. In any event, it is a clerical error that qualifies as an error under Article 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules Convention.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON THE REQUEST**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal decides to correct the Award as follows:\n\na) Paragraph 392 of the Award shall read:\n\n*392. In the present case, the arbitrators' fees and expenses and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD)*\n\n*Arbitrators' fees and expenses*\n\n*Dr. Eduardo Zuleta (Presiden* [REDACTED]\n\n*Mr. Mariano Gomezperalta* [REDACTED]\n\n*Mr. V. V. Veeder QC* [REDACTED]\n\n*ICSID's administrative fees 116,000.00*\n\n*Direct expenses 141,316.38*\n\n***Total** **948,375.03***\n\nb) Paragraph 389 of the Award is deleted in its entirety and left blank; and\n\nc) Paragraph 391 of the Award shall read:\n\n*391. This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration. Article 40(1) of the Arbitration Rules states that although \"the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party [\u2026] the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case\" and Article 40(2), which refers to the reasonable costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party claimed during the arbitral proceedings \u2014 as stated in Article 38(e) \u2014 reiterates that the tribunal \"taking into account the circumstances of the case\" is \"free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\"*\n\n27.\n\nAll other requests for correction are denied."}]}
