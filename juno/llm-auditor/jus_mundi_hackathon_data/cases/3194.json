PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn May 26, 2020, the Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties. During the First Session the Parties debated issues arising from Claimants' submission in one single writ of claims by six claimants with different investments under four different treaties (\"**Treaties**\"). The Parties also debated Respondent's other jurisdictional objections.\n\n2.\n\nFurther to the Parties' exchanges during the First Session, the Tribunal directed the Parties to make two rounds of written submissions on the following issues: (1) bifurcation, and (2) whether the present proceeding is a multiparty arbitration or a consolidation of claims and any procedural or substantive implications.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 and deferred its decision on the applicable arbitration rules and the procedural timetable.\n\n4.\n\nPer the briefing schedule set by the Tribunal on May 26, 2020, the Parties made the following written submissions:\n\na. On June 10, 2020, Respondent filed its written submission on bifurcation together with Exhibits R-001 through R-009 and Legal Authorities RL-001 through RL-029 (\"**Bifurcation Application**\").\n\nb. On June 24, 2020, Claimants submitted the Claimants' Written Submission in Opposition to Bifurcation and Brief in Support of a Multiparty Proceeding together with Legal Authorities CLA-001 through CLA-050 (\"**Claimants' Opposition**\").\n\nc. On July 1, 2020, Respondent presented its Reply to the Claimants' Bifurcation Application together with Exhibit R-010 and Legal Authorities RL-030 through RL-040 (\"**Respondent's Bifurcation Reply**\").\n\nd. On July 8, 2020, Claimants filed their Rejoinder in Opposition to Bifurcation and in support of a Multiparty Proceeding together with Exhibit C-036 and Legal Authorities CLA-051 to CLA-057 (\"**Claimants' Opposition Rejoinder**\").\n\n5.\n\nThis Procedural Order sets out the Tribunal's decision on Respondent's Bifurcation Application.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal should decide on the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter. Respondent argues that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules have a presumption in favor of bifurcation, which is commonly used for procedural efficiency.1\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21 (citing, *e.g.* RL-003, *Mesa Power Group LLC v. Canada*, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Procedural Order No. 2, January 18, 2013).\n\n7.\n\nRespondent mentions three criteria for a tribunal to consider when deciding on bifurcation:\n\n(i) If the objection, *prima facie*, is serious, substantial, and not frivolous;\n\n(ii) Whether, if the tribunal grants bifurcation, there would be a material reduction in the next phase of the proceeding; and\n\n(iii) Whether the objection is closely related to the merits.2\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 (citing RL-005, *Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Limited v. Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2016-39, Procedural Order No. 2, January 31, 2018; RL-002, *Glamis Gold Ltd v. USA*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (revised), May 31, 2005).\n\n8.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this dispute and raises objections *ratione voluntatis*, *ratione temporis*, *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae*. First, Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* because it did not consent to the \"auto-consolidation\" of this arbitration, involving four treaties with differing offers to arbitrate, five States, six investors and alleged government actions occurring at different times and places.3 Additionally, Respondent submits that the Treaties prohibit self-consolidation, which conflicts with the concepts of *pacta sunt servanda* and *pacta tertiis*, and such self-consolidation is *de jure* inadmissible and involves fundamental questions of international law and treaty interpretation.4\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33, 36, 46.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6 34 (also citing the Vienna Convention Law of Treaties*,* Arts. 31, 32, 33, 26, 34, 35 and 36).\n\n9.\n\nRespondent asserts that ultimately it is the State that decides whether to consolidate arbitrations in accordance with the relevant treaty provisions.5 In the present case, three of the Treaties (the Argentina-Mexico BIT, the Mexico-Portugal BIT and the NAFTA) explicitly establish the scope of Respondent's consent to join separate arbitrations, which distinguishes this case from others, like *Alemanni v. Argentina*, where no such consolidation provision existed.6 If the Tribunal considers that the Treaties allow for \"self-consolidation\", Respondent argues, that, in order to be valid, all the treaty requirements to submit a claim to arbitration must be met, which Respondent underscores is not the present case.7\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6 38.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43 (citing RL-018, *Giovanni Alemanni and others v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/8, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Concurring Opinion of Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, QC, November 17, 2014).\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 44, *et seq.*\n\n10.\n\nIn addition, Respondent asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* as the Treaties have an express limitation period to submit a claim to arbitration. Similarly, Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* as Claimants have not demonstrated that they have an \"investment\" under the Treaties. Respondent emphasizes that Claimants bear the burden of proof with respect to jurisdiction.8 Respondent makes the following specific jurisdictional objections:9\n\na. With respect to the Mexico-Argentina BIT applicable to Mr. Sastre, CETSA-Tierras del Sol and HLSA and Hamaca Loca, Respondent submits that the treaty requirements of \"domicile\", \"investor of Argentina\", \"statute of limitations\"; legality of the investment and notice of intent were not met.10\n\nb. Under the NAFTA, Respondent asserts that the Claimants, Ms. M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos and Mr. Graham Alexander, were not \"investors\" during all the relevant times and there is no consent as the notice of intent was defective.11\n\nc. Respondent submits that Mr. Renaud Jacquet was not a qualified \"investor\" under the Mexico-France BIT during all the relevant times.12\n\nd. Respondent argues that Mr. Eduardo Nuno Vaz Osorio dos Santos Silva and Ms. Margarida Oliveira Azevedo de Abreu did not qualify as \"investors\" under the Mexico-Portugal BIT during all the relevant times nor did the alleged investment comply with the BIT's legality requirements.13\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 52-139.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 52-108.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 109-122.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 123-127.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 128-139.\n\n11.\n\nIn the Reply to the Request for Bifurcation, Respondent explains that the Tribunal can only exercise jurisdiction if each investor demonstrates on the balance of probabilities that it is a qualified \"investor\" of a qualified \"investment\" on the dates of the alleged treaty violations. Claimants' contradictory, ambiguous and unspecific evidence fails to prove these elements.14 Additionally, Respondent argues that its objections based on legality, domicile and statute of limitations are not intertwined with the merits. Finally, Respondent submits that if its jurisdictional objections were granted there would be a substantial reduction in the merits phase.15\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n\n12.\n\nContrary to Claimants' assertions, Respondent emphasizes that its jurisdictional objections are not \"frivolous\" or \"vexatious.\"16 In fact, Respondent explains that this is the first self-consolidated arbitration initiated without its consent, so its *ratione voluntatis* objection has a significant impact for future arbitrations.17 Furthermore, Respondent notes that Claimants do not contest that each Claimant has to comply with the relevant treaty requirements for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this arbitration.18 According to Respondent, it is evident that the multiple treaty requirements have not been met, and, therefore, it is essential that the Tribunal bifurcates the proceedings to deal with the jurisdictional objections as a preliminary manner.19\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6 1.\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5.\n\nIn Respondent's Bifurcation Reply, the Respondent notes that it uses the term \"multi-party arbitration\" to simplify the discussion on its objection, but the Respondent uses this term to describe the joining of two or more arbitration into one, which Mexico described as \"self-consolidation\" since its first communication. Respondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6 3.\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6 8.\n\n13.\n\nRespondent also disputes Claimants' argument that joining two or more arbitrations is a procedural question governed by the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules and policy considerations. Respondent underscores that this is a question of consent as the arbitration agreement is only formed when the State's and Claimants' consent match. Moreover, in three of the four Treaties, there are specific consolidation provisions, which show that other forms of joinder are prohibited. Therefore, Respondent concludes there is no arbitration agreement in the present case.20\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.\n\n14.\n\nWith respect to the burden and standard of proof, Respondent argues that the \"Higgins Test\" does not apply to its jurisdictional objections. Claimants have the burden to establish jurisdictional facts, and the standard is the balance of probabilities, not the lower standards of \"*prima facie*\", \"plausible\" or \"capable of constituting a BIT violation\" that apply to the merits. Furthermore, the need to consider facts, even complicated facts, to decide jurisdictional questions, is not a reason to deny bifurcation. In the present case, a rigorous jurisdictional phase is justified given the nature of the jurisdictional objection.21\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-17 (citing RL-032 (*B-Mex, LLC and others v. Mexico*) and RL-034 (*Theodoros Adamakopoulos and others v. Cyprus*) to demonstrate that prior cases have included rigorous jurisdictional phases with document production, witness statements and procedural applications).\n\n**B. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n15.\n\nClaimants oppose Respondent's Bifurcation Application. Contrary to Respondent's assertion, Claimants argue that the Tribunal has *ratione voluntatis* jurisdiction over this multiparty arbitration.22\n\nClaimants' Opposition, Section II.\n\n16.\n\nFirst, the Treaties governing this arbitration permit Claimants to arbitrate their claims under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.23 Moreover, in contrast to Respondent's earlier submissions, Claimants note that the \"*Respondent's submission refers only to Article 21(4) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules*\", without referring to the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules. Claimants therefore request that the Tribunal issue an order establishing that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules govern these proceedings.24\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 18.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 13.\n\n17.\n\nClaimants submit that Article 15.1 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules gives the Tribunal authority to manage the proceeding as it considers best.25 It is Claimants' position that the multiparty arbitration should be allowed in this case as it has been allowed in prior investor-State arbitrations, even in cases involving multiple treaties and investors.26 Moreover, policy considerations, such as access to justice, favor hearing the claims together, as the claims share many of the same issues of fact an law (*i.e.* similar investments in Tulum acquired in the same *Ejido*, involving treaty-breaching conducts undertaken between October 31, 2011 to June 17, 2016).27 Given the similarities, Claimants also underscore that consistency in awards and avoiding parallel proceedings is desirable.28\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 19.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28 (citing *e.g.* CLA-041, *Suez and others v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Award, April 9, 2015).\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 34.\n\n18.\n\nClaimants further submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* as Respondent made a standing offer to consent to arbitration in the Treaties, which each Claimant perfected.29 According to Claimants, \"[o]*nce a qualifying Claimant with a qualifying investment crosses the consent threshold by accepting a standing offer to arbitrate pursuant to the Treaty, consent is complete*\"30, \"*Respondent's 'subsequent' consent is neither relevant nor required in advance of proceedings to which Respondent already consented in the Treaties*.\"31 Claimants argue that this is not a case of \"auto-consolidation\" as there are not \"two or more pending claims\", and when the Amended Notice of Arbitration (\"**NOA#2**\") was filed, amending Mr. Sastre's claims and adding those of the remaining Claimants, no arbitrator had been appointed. In fact, this Tribunal is the only one that has ever been appointed to hear these claims.32\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 40 (specifying the required steps taken by each Claimant under the relevant Treaty).\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 5.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 42.\n\n19.\n\nWith respect to the standard of proof, Claimants argue that the Tribunal should follow the \"Higgins Test\" used by prior tribunals, and, contrary to Respondent's assertions, Claimants need not \"prove\" every jurisdictional allegation at this early stage.33\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 54, *et seq.* (citing *e.g.* CLA-021, *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005; CLA-004, *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, November 14, 2005).\n\n20.\n\nClaimants submit that neither the Treaties nor the UNCITRAL Rules favor bifurcation.34 In Claimants' view, \"[a]*t worst*\", the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules \"*creates a 'soft' presumption toward bifurcation*subject to*a case-specific analysis by the Tribunal using the* Glamis Gold *test* [\u2026] *to determine the most procedurally efficient course*.\"35 Claimants assert that the first of the three-prong *Glamis Gold* test is not met as the Respondent's objections are frivolous or vexatious. To demonstrate this, Claimants counter each of Respondent's purported jurisdictional objections *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* and further argue that Respondent's notice of intent objections are not serious or substantial.36 Claimants moreover submit that the remaining jurisdictional objections are inextricably intertwined with the merits, failing the second criterion.37 Claimants also argue that the merits phase will not be substantially reduced.38\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 67, *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 70 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 66-95.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 77-82.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 104-109.\n\n21.\n\nClaimants submit that in its Bifurcation Reply Respondent has \"*all but abandoned its earlier position that this is an 'auto-consolidation'*\" and dispute \"*that the Treaties contain an 'inherent consent limitation' against multiparty arbitration*.\"39 According to Claimants, Respondent misconstrues how consent is perfected in multiparty treaty arbitration. Citing prior investor-State tribunals, Claimants submit that in multiparty proceedings involving common issues of law and fact and multiple treaties, consent is perfected if each claimant accepts Respondent's offer to arbitrate, but if one claim does not meet the Treaty requirements, only that claim fails, \"*not the entire multiparty proceeding.*\" Moreover, Claimants posit that limiting multiparty arbitration \"*would be an improper modification of the consent provisions in each of the Treaties*.\"40 Claimants also point out that Respondent fails to disprove that each Claimant perfected its consent nor did it address Claimants' arguments regarding procedural efficiency and access to justice.41\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 2.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 10-26 (citing CLA-019, *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC v. Bolivia*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2011-17, Award, January 31, 2014; RL-034, *Theodoros Adamakopoulos and others v. Cyprus*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/49, Decision on Jurisdiction, February 7, 2020.).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 30-39.\n\n22.\n\nClaimants emphasize that Respondent has failed to meet its burden to show that bifurcation is warranted in this case.42 With respect to the standard of proof, Claimants reiterate that the Tribunal should follow the majority of tribunals using the \"*Higgins Test's presumption upon Claimants' presentation of a* prima facie *showing of jurisdiction*\", but, in any case, Claimants' Amended Notice of Arbitration demonstrates that Claimants met the necessary jurisdictional elements.43 According to Claimants, the Parties have agreed that the *Glamis Gold* test provides the bifurcation framework and Respondent has not contested that all three legs must be met for a Tribunal to bifurcate a proceeding. In Claimants' view, Respondent has failed to meet its burden for bifurcation.44\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, Section III.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 40-45.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 61-71.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all the relevant factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written submissions. The fact that any argument, allegation, or specific piece of evidence is not mentioned in the analysis below does not mean that the Tribunal has not considered it.\n\n24.\n\nThe decision in this Procedural Order only relates to bifurcation. Moreover, the Tribunal's considerations and decisions regarding bifurcation do not prejudice any future decision the Tribunal will make with respect to the substance of Respondent's preliminary objections or the Parties' submissions on the merits.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal must (A) evaluate whether Respondent's preliminary objections can be analyzed in one single proceeding, (B) establish the applicable standard on bifurcation, and (C) analyze the preliminary objections raised under the Treaties.\n\n**A. WHETHER RESPONDENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS CAN BE ANALYZED IN ONE SINGLE PROCEEDING**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn June 14, 2019, Claimants appointed Dr. Charles Poncet through NOA#2 as arbitrator in these proceedings.45 On October 7, 2019, by communication to the Secretary General of ICSID, Respondent appointed Mr. Christer S\u00f6derlund as arbitrator in these proceedings.46 On February 11, 2020, the Parties agreed to appoint Prof. Eduardo Zuleta as President of the Tribunal.47\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6 9.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6 13.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 of May 28, 2020, Section 1.3.\n\n27.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the arbitrators were properly appointed, and the Tribunal was validly constituted. Neither Party has questioned the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide on bifurcation or to hear and decide the preliminary objections submitted by Respondent. The Tribunal therefore has the authority to decide on the preliminary objections regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to decide whether or not to hear such objections as a preliminary matter or together with the merits. The latter is an obvious consequence of the *kompetenz-kompetenz* rule.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Parties have not objected to the Tribunal dealing with all of the preliminary objections presented by Respondent, including the so-called \"self-consolidation\", in a concurrent fashion.\n\n29.\n\nThere is no doubt that under both the UNCITRAL Rules of 1976 and the UNCITRAL Rules of 2010, the Tribunal has the obligation to conduct the proceedings in an efficient manner. Thus, in order to decide on the preliminary objections submitted by Respondent, the Tribunal may hear all such objections in one single proceeding, as opposed to holding multiple separate proceedings related to the preliminary objections under each applicable treaty.\n\n30.\n\nOther considerations favor the Tribunal deciding on Respondent's Bifurcation Application and preliminary objections in one single proceeding. First, Respondent's objections appear to include: (A) objections that are particular to a given treaty; (B) objections that share issues of law or fact with more than one treaty; and (C) objections that have common issues of law or fact among the Treaties, particularly the objection regarding the so-called \"self-consolidation\" of the arbitration. Second, hearing all the objections together will result in significant time and cost savings.\n\n31.\n\nFor the reasons elaborated above, the Tribunal will decide the dispute on bifurcation regarding all the preliminary objections in one procedural order, and thereafter will hear all the objections filed by Respondent that comply with the requirements for bifurcation set out below in one single proceeding.\n\n**B. THE APPLICABLE STANDARD ON BIFURCATION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The UNCITRAL Rules**\n-------------------------\n\n32.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the applicable procedural rules are the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Yet, during the First Session, the Parties disagreed as to whether the 1976 or 2010 version of those rules applied.\n\n33.\n\nArticle 21(4) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides that:\n\nIn general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. However, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and rule on such a plea in their final award.\n\n34.\n\nArticle 23(3) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules provides that:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 2 either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. The arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award, notwithstanding any pending challenge to its jurisdiction before a court.\n\n35.\n\nRespondent's view is that Article 21(4) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides a presumption that objections to jurisdiction should be resolved as preliminary questions, before consideration of the merits.48 On the other hand, Claimants assert that Article 21(4) creates a \"soft\" presumption on bifurcation *subject to* a case-specific analysis by the Tribunal in order to determine the most procedurally efficient course.49 According to Claimants, none of the procedural guidelines set forth in the Treaties refer to the concept of bifurcation.50\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6 18.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 70.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 67.\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal has the power to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, under both the 1976 and the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, it has ample discretion to decide whether to deal with jurisdictional objections first or join them with the merits in view of the specific circumstances of this dispute. What is paramount in exercising this discretion is to conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the Parties' dispute.51\n\nRL-002, *Glamis Gold Ltd v. USA*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (revised), May 31, 2005, \u00b6 11; RL-007, *Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) v. India*, PCA Case No. 2016-7, Procedural Order No. 4, April 19, 2017, \u00b6 74.\n\n**b) The Three-Prong Test on Bifurcation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Parties agree that efficiency is a key factor in determining whether the Tribunal should rule on objections that may affect its jurisdiction as a preliminary matter. For that purpose, the Tribunal must look for procedural economy, and the significant savings in time, energy and costs that would be involved in avoiding entering the merits of the controversy.52\n\nCLA-0035, *Rand Investments Ltd. and others v. Serbia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/8, Procedural Order No. 3, June 24, 2019, \u00b6 15.\n\n39.\n\nBoth Parties also agree that arbitral tribunals often consider the following three criteria in order to examine whether or not bifurcation would be more efficient:53 a) whether the request is substantial or the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial; b) whether the request, if granted, would lead to a material reduction in the proceedings at the next stage, or whether the objection, if successful, will result in disposing of all or an essential part of the claims raised; and c) whether bifurcation is impractical in the sense that the issues are too intertwined with the merit that it is very unlikely that there will be any savings in time or cost or can the objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits of the case.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 71; Bifurcation Application, \u00b6 22; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 46; RL-006, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8, April 14, 2014, \u00b6 109; RL-002, *Glamis Gold Ltd v. USA*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (revised), May 31, 2005, \u00b6 12; RL-007, *Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) v. India*, PCA Case No. 2016-7, Procedural Order No. 4, April 19, 2017, \u00b6 37.\n\n40.\n\nUnder the first criterion, the Tribunal must determine whether there is a credible basis for the objection. As noted in *Glamis Gold,* this criterion involves evaluating \"*whether the objection is substantial inasmuch as the preliminary consideration of a frivolous objection to jurisdiction is very unlikely to reduce the costs of, or time required for, the proceeding.*\"54 At this stage, the Tribunal is required to examine whether the objections are frivolous or vexatious. If a tribunal determines that a preliminary objection is \"serious\"\u2013 understood as the opposite of superficial\u2013or dispositive of the claims, this does not necessarily mean that the objection will be successful at a later stage of this arbitration.\n\nRL-002, *Glamis Gold Ltd v. USA*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (revised), May 31, 2005, \u00b6 12.\n\n41.\n\nUnder the second criterion, the Tribunal must evaluate whether the objection to jurisdiction, if granted, would result in a substantial reduction of the proceedings at the next phase. In order to determine whether the objection, if successful, would dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised,55 the Tribunal must assess whether bifurcation of a preliminary objection would reduce time and costs. The Parties agree that this is the standard the Tribunal should apply when deciding the effectiveness of bifurcating the proceedings. In the present case, the Tribunal must analyze whether there would be a reduction of time and costs in the arbitration if some of Respondent's preliminary objections succeed.\n\nRL-006, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 8, April 14, 2014, \u00b6 63.\n\n42.\n\nUnder the third criterion, the Tribunal must consider the practicality of bifurcation, meaning whether the objection can be examined without entering into the merits of the case. On this point, the *Glamis Gold* tribunal concluded that bifurcation is \"*impractical in that the jurisdictional issue identified is so intertwined with the merits that it is very unlikely that there will be any savings in time or cost.*\"56 Conversely, in cases where jurisdiction appears to be a distinct question to be resolved, the Tribunal could decide such questions in a different award.\n\nRL-002, *Glamis Gold Ltd v. USA*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (revised), May 31, 2005, \u00b6 12.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that these criteria should be taken into consideration when deciding bifurcation. The three factors identified are not \"stand-alone\" criteria. All three elements of the test must be cumulatively satisfied to decide a preliminary objection to jurisdiction in a separate phase.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that such criteria serve as mere guidance and should not be interpreted as restricting the Tribunal's discretion to weigh each of the requirements when arriving at its decision. In order to decide whether the bifurcation of jurisdictional objections will lead to greater efficiency in the proceeding, the Tribunal must examine the legal and factual circumstances of each particular case.\n\n45.\n\nThe Parties agree that \"procedural efficiency\", understood as the reduction in time and costs associated with the arbitration, is the principal factor that tribunals should consider when deciding whether to bifurcate.57 The Tribunal agrees that the goal of bifurcation is procedural efficiency. Yet, efficiency has to also be understood in a broader sense. The analysis of whether bifurcation would bring efficiency to the procedure should not focus exclusively on the possible additional time or costs of the jurisdictional stage.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 52.\n\n46.\n\nBoth the 1976 and the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules seek to promote efficiency in the proceedings. According to these rules, arbitration tribunals must ensure efficiency through the early resolution of preliminary questions that resolve all or substantial parts of a case. The Tribunal thus concludes that the decision to bifurcate the proceedings must balance the benefits of procedural efficiency, against the risks of delay, increased costs, and prejudging. The Tribunal is aware that any decision on bifurcation has to weigh those inherent risks with the potential benefits of reducing costs and time for the Parties. In doing so, the Tribunal will take into account the three-part test described above.\n\n**C. THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS RELATED TO EACH APPLICABLE TREATY**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal must analyze each of the preliminary objections presented by Respondent in the light of the three-prong test set out on Section III.B of this decision. For the sake of clarity and efficiency, \u2013and given that some objections are repeated with respect to different treaties\u2013 the preliminary objections raised by Respondent will be analyzed in groups.\n\n**a) Respondent's Objection regarding the \"Self-Consolidation\" of the Proceeding**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal faces a situation in which six different Claimants from different nationalities decided to present their claims under four different Treaties in a joint notice of arbitration. Respondent argues that the Treaties do not allow for \"self-consolidation\" of claims or, as Claimants submit, a multi-party arbitration,58 and in any event, even if the Tribunal were to consider that the Treaties allow for \"self-consolidation\", the requirements provided in the Treaties for consolidation are not met in the present case.59\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 44, *et seq.*\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that, in the event of bifurcation, it will hear all of Respondent's objections that comply with the requirements for bifurcation in a single proceeding. The Tribunal, however, will not decide in this procedural order the nature of the objection filed by Respondent in connection with what it characterizes as a \"self-consolidation\", which Claimants describe as a \"multiparty arbitration\". For the purposes of this bifurcation decision, the Tribunal will focus on the analysis exclusively on whether the said objection complies with the three-prong test on bifurcation.\n\n50.\n\n*Prima facie* the objection is serious and substantial because the consent given by the Parties to determine the procedure is essential to the Tribunal's jurisdiction\u2013if the objection were to be considered a jurisdictional one \u2013, or to conduct the proceedings \u2013 if the objection were to be considered a procedural one.\n\n51.\n\nIn addition, any decision regarding this objection may reduce time and costs, which would promote procedural efficiency. If upheld, all or part of the claims presented by Claimants could be disposed of, and if this objection is rejected it may substantially reduce the scope of the proceedings in the merits phase. Both scenarios would save the Parties considerable time and costs.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, the objection is not a question related to the merits of the dispute. This objection is a matter of interpretation of the applicable procedural rules, and it has no bearing on the merits of the case.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that Respondent's objection under this Section III.C(a) meets the test for bifurcation.\n\n**b) Respondent's Objection that Claimants have not Demonstrated that They are Covered \"Investors\" of Covered \"Investments\" under the Treaties at All Relevant Times**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the ground that Claimants have not proven that they are covered \"investors\" of covered \"investments\" under the Treaties, which requires proving their nationality, the investments, and the legality of the investments at all relevant times.60\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6 18.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this group of objections meets the three-prong test on bifurcation for the reasons set out below.\n\n56.\n\nFirst, the objections are *prima facie* serious as they raise a substantial issue regarding whether each Claimant has proven that he or she complies with the definitions of \"investor\" and \"investment\" contained in the applicable treaty during all the relevant dates. These objections could impact the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae*.\n\n57.\n\nSecond, if all or some of these objections were upheld, the claims raised by all or some of the Claimants would be disposed of, which would make the merits phase unnecessary or lead to a significant reduction of the scope of the dispute.\n\n58.\n\nThird, these objections can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits of the case for two main reasons. First, the question on what the relevant dates are for analyzing whether Claimants are covered \"investors\" of covered \"investments\" under each treaty is a matter of interpretation of the applicable law; the Tribunal need not address whether on those critical dates Respondent breached its obligations under the Treaties. Second, the evidence required for proving or disproving that the Claimants complied with the requirements set out in each treaty to be covered \"investors\" of covered \"investments\" at the critical dates is not intertwined with the merits of the case. While the Tribunal may have to engage with some factual evidence, it is not convinced that significant issues regarding Claimants' substantive claims would have to be determined in the jurisdictional phase.\n\n**c) Respondent's Objection under the Argentina-Mexico BIT regarding Mr. Sastre's Dual Nationality and Domicile**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nRespondent contends that Article 2(3) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT is applicable in the present case given that there is *prima facie* evidence that Mr. Sastre had his domicile in Mexico as from the date of the investment to the date when the alleged breach of the treaty occurred. According to Respondent, the critical dates to determine whether this provision is applicable are the date of the investment and the day of the alleged breach of the treaty, not the day the dispute settlement mechanism of the BIT was activated. Respondent also contends that there is *prima facie* evidence that Mr. Sastre is also a Mexican national, and therefore Claimants must prove that his Argentinian nationality was the dominant one at all relevant periods of time.61\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6\u00b6 59-69.\n\n60.\n\nThe objections related to Mr. Sastre's dominant nationality and domicile at the relevant periods of time comply with the three bifurcation criteria.\n\n61.\n\nFirst, the objections regarding Mr. Sastre's dual nationality and domicile are *prima facie* capable of impacting the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Both objections raise plausible questions that must be analyzed before addressing the merits of the case.\n\n62.\n\nSecond, if one or both objections were upheld, Mr. Sastre's claims under the Argentina-Mexico BIT would be disposed of, which would significantly reduce the scope and complexity of the dispute.\n\n63.\n\nThird, these objections are not intertwined with the merits of the case. The question of whether Mr. Sastre's dual nationality has any bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction is, first, a matter of law that has no relation with the merits of the case. Likewise, to resolve whether Article 2(3) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT is applicable in the case at hand, the Tribunal must analyze the scope of interpretation of this provision, which is not related to the merits of the case. Although both objections are fact-intensive, their factual basis is restricted to the evidence regarding Mr. Sastre's \"dominant\" nationality and \"domicile\" at \"all the relevant times\", and not to the merits of the case.\n\n**d) Respondent's Objection that Mr. Sastre's Claim Does Not Comply with the Time Limit Set Out in Article 1(2) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nRespondent argues that Article 1(2) of the Annex to the Argentina-Mexico BIT provides that any claim must be presented no later than four years after the claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach and the losses or damages suffered. Yet, Mr. Sastre submitted the NOA#1 on December 29, 2017, and the NOA#2 on June 14, 2019, more than six years after he knew about the measures taken on October 31, 2011 related to the hotels \"Hamaca Loca\" and \"Tierras del Sol\", which allegedly breached the treaty. Therefore, Respondent argues that the time limit (\"prescription period\" as characterized by Respondent) to present a claim regarding said measures expired. Claimants in turn contend that the denial of justice and judicial expropriation arising from the failure of Respondent's judicial system crystallized in 2015, and thus *prima facie* satisfies the four-year period, provided in Article 1(2) of the BIT.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the jurisdictional objection raised by Respondent complies with the bifurcation test.\n\n66.\n\nFirst, the objection raises a serious and reasonable question about the application of Article 1(2) of the Annex to the Argentina-Mexico BIT, which could impact of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n67.\n\nSecond, if the objection were upheld, all or some of Mr. Sastre's claims would be disposed of, leading to a significant reduction of the scope and complexity of the dispute.\n\n68.\n\nThird, the objection is not intertwined with the merits of the case. While the Tribunal may have to examine the measures taken by Respondent to determine, *inter alia*, whether they constitute continuous or separate acts, this question is primarily a question of international law. The factual basis necessary to conduct such analysis does not touch upon the issue of whether the alleged measures taken by Respondent breached the Argentina-Mexico BIT or any of the Treaties invoked by Claimants.\n\n**e) Respondent's Objection that Mr. Sastre, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Gal\u00e1n Did Not Comply with the Notice of Intent Requirements in the Argentina-Mexico BIT and the NAFTA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAs regards Mr. Sastre, Respondent argues that he did not comply with the requirements under Article 10(3) and (4) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT, given that the notice of intent presented by Mr. Sastre on June 15, 2017 referred to the Mexico-Switzerland BIT and not to the Argentina-Mexico BIT. Claimants contend that the second notice of intent presented by Mr. Sastre on September 6, 2017, \"*expanded upon the original claims, by adding additional claims arising from Respondent's same treaty violations under the Argentina BIT.*\"62 Also, the NOA#1 dated December 29, 2017, and the NOA#2 dated June 14, 2019, complied with the requirements of the Argentina-Mexico BIT.\n\nClaimants' Opposition, \u00b6 94.\n\n70.\n\nAs regards Mr. Alexander and Ms. Gal\u00e1n, Respondent contends that the notice of intent presented by both Claimants on January 17, 2019, does not comply with the requirements set forth on NAFTA Article 1119, which are necessary for the materialization of the consent provided in NAFTA Article 1116.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent are not frivolous.\n\n72.\n\nIf these objections were upheld, the scope of the case would be significantly reduced because the objections are susceptible of barring the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, and either Mr. Sastre's, and/or Mr. Alexander and Ms. Gal\u00e1n claims would be disposed of.\n\n73.\n\nAlso, these objections are matters of law with a narrow scope of factual grounds to be analyzed, which are not related to the merits of the case. Thus, the Tribunal considers that the *ratione voluntatis* objections comply with the criteria for granting bifurcation.\n\n**f) Respondent's Objection that Mr. Sastre's Attempt to Present Claims for HLSA/Hamaca Loca is an Abuse of Rights Not Protected under the Argentina-Mexico BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nRespondent claims that Mr. Sastre's alleged \"investment\" in HLSA was not made for the purpose of carrying out an economic activity in Mexico but merely to initiate a claim in this arbitration. According to Respondent, Mr. Sastre's attempt to present claims for HSLA/Hamaca Loca constitutes an abuse of rights and the alleged investment is therefore not protected by the BIT.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the objection raised by Respondent regarding Mr. Sastre's abuse of rights is serious and substantial, and if upheld, could reduce the scope of the dispute given that the claims regarding HLSA/Hamaca Loca could be dismissed before reaching the merits of the case. The Tribunal also notes that the factual basis to be analyzed under this objection is not related to the alleged breach of the Argentina-Mexico BIT, but ultimately to Mr. Sastre's alleged \"investment\" in Mexico. Therefore, this is an issue that can be analyzed without prejudging or entering the merits of the case. The Tribunal thus considers that the objection regarding Mr. Sastre's \"abuse of rights\" complies with the three-prong test on bifurcation and therefore will be addressed in the preliminary phase of the proceedings.\n\n76.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the interests of procedural efficiency and fairness are best served by bifurcating the preliminary objections raised by Respondent from the merits of the case.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n77.\n\nBoth Parties requested that the Tribunal award costs against the other Party for this phase of the proceeding.63 The Tribunal will decide the issue of costs together with its decision on the jurisdictional objections of Respondent.\n\nBifurcation Application, \u00b6 142(2); Claimants' Opposition, \u00b6 110(e); Respondent's Bifurcation Reply, \u00b6 26(ii); Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 72(e).\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n78.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal decides to bifurcate the proceedings and address the preliminary objections raised by Respondent in a preliminary phase. The decision on costs will be issued together with the decision on the objections submitted by Respondent.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal will provide the Parties with the corresponding instructions as to the procedure for the jurisdictional phase."}, {"Title": "Award on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2022-11-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award on Jurisdiction\n---------------------\n\n**I.

An *ejido* is community property.\n\n40.\n\n*Ejidos* are semiautonomous communities governed by Mexican law, including Agrarian Law, and they are situated on a specified area of land. They are created by decree and have legal personality, internal rules, governing bodies, and individual members. The *Ejido* Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez was created by the Mexican government on 8 October 1973.\n\n41.\n\nThe *ejido* has the right to appoint its representatives and to administer as well as determine the use, transfer and release *ejido* lands. *Ejidos* have an internal governance system. As opposed to other property regimes, *ejidos* fall exclusively under federal jurisdiction.3 The *ejido* is also responsible for assigning each type of *ejido* property to individuals that fulfill the requirements provided for in the law and applicable regulations.4\n\n**Exhibit PGPG-0016**, Agrarian Law of Mexico published in DOF on 26 February 1992, in force since 27 February 1992, as amended, in its version in force as of 16 April 2008, Articles 9, 10 and 12.\n\n**Exhibit PGPG-0016,** Agrarian Law of Mexico published in DOF on 26 February 1992, in force since 27 February 1992, as amended, in its version in force as of 16 April 2008, Article 56.\n\n42.\n\nThe governing bodies of the *ejido* are the Ejido Assembly *(La Asamblea Ejidal),* the *Ejido* Commissariat (*El Comisariado Ejidal*), and the *Ejido* Oversight Council (*El Consejo de Vigilancia).* The Assembly is the supreme, decision-making body of the *Ejido,* made up of the *Ejido* members, adopting decisions on all matters pertaining to the administration, management, and disposition of the *ejido* assets.

Claimants asserted violations of their rights under Articles 14 (due process) and 16 (right to receive an order written by a competent authority before being deprived of their property) of the Mexican Constitution.59\n\n**Exhibit C-0116**, Indirect Amparo Petition relating to the seizure of Tierras del Sol, 22 November 2011; **Exhibit C-0117**, Indirect Amparo Petition relating to the seizure of Hamaca Loca, 22 November 2011.\n\n78.\n\nLater, in May 2012, Mr. Sastre\u2019s Agrarian Law attorney, Mr. Alvaro L\u00f3pez Joers, was murdered. Mr. Sastre submits that all his documentation that was being held in his attorney\u2019s office was confiscated by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Quintana Roo.60\n\nWitness Statement of Carlos Sastre, \u00b6 53.\n\n79.\n\nAfterwards, Mr. Sastre stayed in Mexico to receive updates on the legal proceeding and to manage a new hotel business.61\n\nWitness Statement of Carlos Sastre, \u00b6 57.\n\n80.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, the Second District Court in Quintana Roo dismissed the *amparo* application. The Court determined that none of the evidence proffered by the claimants proved that their lots were in the same area where the seizure was performed on 31 October 2011. According to the Court, the evidence needed to prove that the land was in the same location was a topographical expert\u2019s report. Consequently, the Court appointed an official expert to prepare this report. However, the Court declared this evidence void, because, despite being duly notified, the claimants did not attend the topographic test. As a result, the Court did not find a violation of the claimants\u2019 rights, an indispensable requisite for an *amparo*, nor did the Court find that the claimants had a legitimate right to be protected under the Constitution or any law.62\n\n**Exhibit C-0029**, Mexican Federal Court Dismissal of Amparo relating to Constructora Eco Turistica and Hamaca Loca (Sobreseimiento, Juzgado Segundo de Distrito en Quintana Roo), 2 October 2015.\n\n81.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Mr. Sastre returned with his family to Rio Cuarto, Argentina.63\n\nWitness Statement of Carlos Sastre, \u00b6 57.\n\n**D.** **M****r****.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A.** **B****urden of** **P****roof and** **S****tandard of** **P****roof**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Position of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Respondent, when jurisdiction is based on the existence of certain facts, these facts must be proven in the jurisdictional phase.175 Therefore, it is Claimants\u2019 burden to prove at the jurisdictional stage the facts and conditions to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under each of the treaties.176 To Respondent, the burden of proof must be met on a balance of probabilities, contrary to the *prima facie* standard proposed by Claimants.177 Respondent submits that Claimants must prove that these requirements have been met at the time the Amended Notice of Arbitration was filed.178\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 15, lines 16-22 and page 16, line 1.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 25.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 8; Transcript, Day 1, page 16, lines 10-21.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 27.\n\n**b.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nClaimants accept that they bear the burden to prove their case-in-chief, including the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Respondent, in turn, must prove its own objections and defences, including issues regarding illegality, domicile, dual nationality, multiparty arbitration, among others.179\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 93, lines 15-21.\n\n138.\n\nTo Claimants, the Tribunal should apply the \"Higgins test\" by which each Claimant must set forth a *prima facie* case showing that the elements of jurisdiction are satisfied.180 Also, Claimants agree with the application of a balance of probabilities standard, however, the exception is for allegations of illegality which must be held to an elevated standard of clear and convincing evidence.181\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 29 -33.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 93, lines 9-13.\n\n139.\n\nTo Claimants, Respondent\u2019s position that Claimants were required to prove all jurisdictional elements in its Amended Notice of Arbitration is extreme, and Respondent offers no relevant support for it. In any event, Claimants\u2019 Amended Notice of Arbitration complied with all the requirements indicated by the UNCITRAL Rules.182\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal first recalls its Procedural Order No. 3, which confirms that *\"[t]hese proceedings will be governed by the 1976 version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\"183* Article 24(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules states that \"[e]*ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\"*\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, 17 September 2020.\n\n141.\n\nFurther, Procedural Order No. 1, Article 11.1 provides that:\n\n*For matters concerning the gathering or taking of evidence that are not otherwise covered by a procedural order issued by the Tribunal and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal may refer to the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010) for guidance as to the practices commonly accepted in international arbitrations, but it shall not be bound to apply them.*\n\n142.\n\nIn this regard, the IBA Arbitration Committee Commentary to Article 3 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration states that:\n\n*The IBA Rules of Evidence begin with the principle that each party shall introduce those documents available to it and on which it wants to rely as evidence. This provision reflects the principle, generally accepted in both civil law and common law countries, that parties have a burden to come forward with the evidence that supports their case.*184\n\n*Commentary on the revised text of the 2020 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration*, January 2021.\n\n143.\n\nAccordingly, the applicable rules to this proceeding support the general rule *\"actori incumbit probatio\",* or that a party to an international arbitration has the burden of proving the facts necessary to establish its claim or defence*.*\n\n144.\n\nThus, Claimants have the burden of proving the jurisdictional basis of their claims, that is to say, the circumstances establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under each of the treaties, namely, the Mexico-Argentina BIT, the Mexico-France BIT, the Mexico-Portugal BIT, and the NAFTA. Respondent, in turn, must prove the facts and circumstances underlying its jurisdictional objections.\n\n145.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal finds that there is no general disagreement between the Parties as to the applicable standard of proof. The Parties agree that for most jurisdictional matters, the applicable standard is the \"balance of probabilities.\" However, for Claimants, each party must make its *prima facie* case, and the tribunal will then apply the balance of probabilities standard to determine if jurisdiction exists. Also, for Claimants, allegations of illegality must be held to an elevated standard such as clear and convincing evidence.185\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 93, lines 7-10.\n\n146.\n\nIn the light of the applicable rules of the proceeding, the Tribunal agrees that the applicable standard of proof to the essential requirements of jurisdiction is the balance of probabilities.\n\n147.\n\nThis standard requires an evaluation by the Tribunal of all the evidence produced by Claimants and Respondent on the issues at hand to determine which party\u2019s claims are more likely to be true. Thus, Claimants must present persuasive evidence of the facts to establish jurisdiction for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the burden of proof has been discharged, and not a *prima facie* case as proposed by Claimants. Respondent, in turn, must provide persuasive evidence of the facts that make out its objections to jurisdiction.\n\n148.\n\nAs to the proposed application of a clear and convincing evidence standard for illegality allegations, this Tribunal notes that there are some investment treaty decisions which have applied higher standards of proof for certain types of serious wrongdoing, such as corruption, fraud, and conspiracy. However, tribunals may choose to apply these higher standards at their discretion, depending on the evidentiary circumstances of each case. For instance, in *Fraport v. Philippines I,* the tribunal rejected applying a higher standard of proof regarding a criminal matter, asserting that:\n\n*[w]hatever standard of proof is required under Philippine law to prove a criminal act, the jurisdictional question before this Tribunal, which is seized of an international investment dispute, is not a determination of a crime but whether an economic transaction by a German company was made 'in accordance \u2019 with Philippine law and thus qualifies as an 'investment\u2019 under the German Philippine BIT.186*\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0098,** *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. The Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, \u00b6 399, Award, 16 August 2007.\n\n149.\n\nThe Fraport (I) tribunal continued by expressing:\n\n[e]*ven assuming, however, that the 'preponderance of evidence \u2019 test which applies in civil law must yield in the instant case to a 'beyond a reasonable doubt \u2019 test because the subject of the 'in accordance \u2019 inquiry is a Philippine criminal statute, this is a case in which res ipsa loquitur. The relevant facts, all of which are found in Fraport's own documents, are incontrovertible.*187\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0098**, *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. The Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25*,* \u00b6 399, Award, 16 August 2007.\n\n150.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal does not deal with corruption, fraud, conspiracy, criminal issues, nor matters that are extremely difficult to prove. The jurisdictional question presented to this Tribunal include whether Claimants were *qualified investors* who had a *qualified investment* under the requirements of the applicable treaties. This analysis does not necessitate the application of a heightened standard of proof by this Tribunal.\n\n151.\n\nAll things considered, as the applicable rules indicate, and as both Claimants and Respondent have agreed, the burden of establishing jurisdiction lies primarily upon Claimants, and Respondent in turn, has the burden to demonstrate its objections. This burden must be met on a balance of probabilities standard of proof.\n\n**B.** **R****elevant** **D****ates**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Position of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nClaimants maintain that the Tribunal should separately determine which moments of time are relevant to Claimants\u2019 jurisdictional elements and Respondent\u2019s defences.188\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 53; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 149.\n\n153.\n\nOverall, Claimants consider that the requirements for jurisdiction must be met at the moment of the alleged non-compliance and at the moment of the filing of the Notice of Arbitration.189\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 146; Transcript, Day 1, Page 124, lines 21-22, to page 125, lines 1-3.\n\n154.\n\nRegarding Article 2 (3) of the Argentina - Mexico BIT, Claimants assert that the domicile limitation on consent applies only on the date of filing the Notice of Arbitration.190\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 157.\n\n**b.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nRespondent asserts that for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction Claimants would have to show that they were \"investors\" holding an \"investment\" at three relevant times: (a) at the time the investment was made191; (b) at the time of the alleged breach; and (c) at the moment of filing the Notice of Arbitration.192 Moreover, the time when the investment was made is related to the requirements of the acquisition of the *Ejido* properties193 and therefore to the legality or illegality of the investment. According to Respondent, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because Claimants were not able to prove that they were investors and there was an investment at the relevant times.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 19, lines 18-19; page 20, lines 4-5.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 19, lines 14-16.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 19, lines 19-22, to page 20, line 1.\n\n156.\n\nRegarding Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT, Respondent asserts that the domicile of the person must be assessed at the time when the investment was made, when the alleged treaty breach occurred, and at the time of the submission of the claim to arbitration.194\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 19, lines 15-20.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nOverall, during the second round of memorials and during the hearings,195 the Parties accepted what multiple tribunals have stated; that is to say, that generally the relevant dates for assessing issues of jurisdiction are: (i) the date when the alleged breach took place,196 and (ii) the date when the request for arbitration was lodged.197 Respondent, however, insisted that the Tribunal must also consider the date when the investment was made. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that certain issues related to jurisdiction debated in this arbitration must consider the date when the investment was made. Such is the case with respect to objections related to the alleged illegality of the investment.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 19, lines 11-16; Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 18.\n\n**Exhibit RL-0069***,* *Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v.

Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Final Award, 18 September 2018.\n\n158.\n\nWhere the relevant investment treaty is silent, arbitral tribunals have adopted different approaches with respect to the date when the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction needs to be established. Consequently, in this case, the Tribunal will address the \"relevant dates\" issue on an objection-by-objection basis, considering the provisions of the relevant treaty and the applicable legal framework.\n\n**C.** **T****he** **J****urisdictional** **O****bjections** **S****ubmitted by** **R****espondent**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nRespondent has submitted two categories of jurisdictional objections: those that apply to all Claimants (general objections) and those that apply only to a particular Claimant or group of Claimants (particular objections). Respondent also claims that all jurisdictional requirements provided for in all the treaties should apply cumulatively.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal will take a straightforward approach to the resolution of this case. If an argument has convinced the Tribunal, the Tribunal will not engage with other arguments that have been brought forward in favour of the same or a similar solution. The Tribunal will, in principle, not discuss arguments or decisions in prior investment arbitration cases that it does not find applicable. It is to be understood that arguments that the Tribunal has not discussed, have been rejected or deemed irrelevant.\n\n161.\n\nIf a general or a particular objection succeeds with respect to one of the Claimants, the Tribunal, in principle, will not analyse other jurisdictional objections that apply to the same Claimant, unless the Tribunal finds that such objection applies to more than one Claimant - as is the case of the renouncement of nationality - or that a particular objection merits additional comments from the Tribunal.\n\n162.\n\nOne of the objections that apply to all Claimants that the Parties have heavily debated in this jurisdictional phase is whether hearing all claims of all Claimants in a single arbitration constitutes an impermissible case of consolidation or a permitted case of multi-party arbitration. The Tribunal decided, without opposition from the Parties, that the Tribunal was authorized, in the bifurcated jurisdictional phase, to address all jurisdictional objections in one single proceeding.198\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, \u00b6 28.\n\n163.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considered whether it had to address this jurisdictional objection first, as a practical matter, the Tribunal determined that this issue will only become relevant if the Tribunal has jurisdiction over more than one of the Claimants. If the Tribunal decides, as it does in the present matter, that it has no jurisdiction to hear any of the claims submitted by any of the Claimants, the issue becomes moot as there will be no proceedings to consolidate or claims to hear in a multi-party arbitration.\n\n164.\n\nAnother objection that applies to all Claimants is the challenge made by Respondent to the documents submitted by all Claimants as evidence of their rights to their alleged investments. Based on the opinion of its expert in Agrarian Law, Respondent presented a detailed explanation of the reasons for considering that there was no evidence of title under Mexican law.\n\n165.\n\nClaimants and their expert, in turn, insisted that the documents submitted in their Statement of Claim and in their Reply were more than sufficient to prove their rights related to the land under Mexican law.\n\n166.\n\nEven though the experts had significant disagreements in their analysis, they agreed on one fundamental concept: the need to register title before RAN as a requirement for the transfer of title to be enforceable against third parties and admitted in court.199 Further, during cross-examination and in response to the questions posed by the Tribunal during the Hearing, Mr. Bonfiglio, Claimants\u2019 Agrarian law expert, confirmed that the registration before RAN was a requirement *ad probationem,* and without such registration the alleged titles may only be invoked between the parties to the respective agreement.200\n\nTranscript, Day 4, page 419, lines 8-22; page 442, lines 1-11.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, page 417, lines 3-4; page 419, lines 8-22; page 420, lines 1-4.\n\n167.\n\nRegardless of whether the absence of registration before the RAN may or may not be invoked against Mexico, the fact is that a certificate of registration before RAN could have served as evidence of the chain of title for each one of the Claimants. However, the Tribunal was not provided with a certificate from the RAN or evidence of registration before the RAN.\n\n168.\n\nThe reports of the Agrarian Law experts raise serious doubts as to issues such as the consent of the parties to the different contracts, and whether the assignor of rights was validly entitled to transfer such rights.\n\n169.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Tribunal will take a more practical and efficient approach by first addressing the objections not related to land rights and address the topic only as regards those Claimants with respect to whom other objections either do not apply or have no merit.\n\n**D.** **W****hether** **M****r****.

Under this interpretation, Articles 2 and 10 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT are immediate contexts of Article 2(3). Article 10 and its Annex establish the investor-State dispute settlement procedure in the Mexico-Argentina BIT. According to Respondent, that procedure can be invoked immediately upon an investor becoming aware of the presumed breach and the losses or damages suffered. It is at that time that *\"*[a] *natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party and who is domiciled in the territory of the other Contracting Party where the investment is situated,\"* first acquires the right to invoke the dispute settlement mechanism contained in Article 10. Accordingly, Respondent contends that the domicile of the Claimant, Mr. Sastre, must be assessed at the time of the investment, at the time that the alleged treaty breach occurred as well as at the time of the submission of the claim to arbitration.201\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 217.\n\n172.\n\nFurther, Respondent asserts that Article 2(1) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT, which is the proximate context to Article 2(3), confirms this interpretation. Article 2(1) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT provides that the Mexico-Argentina BIT applies to *\"measures taken or maintained* *by a Contracting Party in respect of investors of one Contracting Party in respect of their investments and the investments of such investors made in the territory of the other Contracting Party. \"* (emphasis in original). To Respondent, \"measures taken or maintained\" by a Contracting Party are the focal point of the BIT and, thereby, the focal point of the Investor-State dispute settlement procedure. Accordingly, to Respondent, the date on which those measures occurred is vital to the operation of the dispute settlement procedure. To Respondent this is also confirmed by the fact that the four-year limitation period for invoking the procedure begins with knowledge of the measures and the losses or damages suffered.202 Thus, according to Respondent's interpretation, the domicile of an investor must be assessed at the time of the alleged breach of the treaty and the submission of the claim.203\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 218.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 216-227; Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 87.\n\n173.\n\nMoreover, in the light of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, Respondent interprets the word \"domicile\" in Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT as *\"the place where the natural person lives with the intention of remaining there and that permanence in one place for a certain period of time provides a presumption of domicile. \"*204 Also, according to its context, Respondent asserts that \"domicile\" is used as a measurement to equate a natural person to a domestic national, in this arbitration, a national of Mexico. Thus, facts that indicate the \"domicile\" of a natural person include facts that indicate a natural person is a national.205\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 223.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 225.\n\n174.\n\nRespondent submits that the evidence in this arbitration demonstrates that Mr. Sastre was domiciled in Mexico at the time of the alleged investments and at the time of the alleged breaches as he obtained a foreigner FM3 visa from the Mexican immigration authorities on 7 June 2000; declared himself as domiciled in Mexico when incorporating CETSA on 31 August 2000; signed the CETSA Transfer of Rights Agreement in Tulum, on 12 October 2000; extended his FM3 visa three times between 7 June 2000 and 2 October 2009; requested to become a naturalized Mexican national on 24 April 2006; renounced his Argentinian nationality on 27 May 2009; became a naturalized Mexican citizen and Mexican national on 27 May 2009; was present in the hotel Tierras del Sol on 19 October 2011, prior to the seizure; was residing in the hotel Tierras del Sol at the time of the seizure; continued to be domiciled in Mexico after the alleged measures.206\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 226.\n\n175.\n\nNot having a domicile in Mexico is a requirement of Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration. Accordingly, Respondent alleges that Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT disqualifies Sastre from invoking the Investor-State dispute settlement procedures in the BIT.207\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 227.\n\n176.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that the Most Favoured Nation (\"MFN\") provision of the Mexico - France BIT cannot be used to import the treatment granted in that treaty and thereby circumvent the condition of Respondent's consent, *ratione voluntatis.*208\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 71, lines 15-18.\n\n**b.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent is wrong regarding the domicile requirement for various reasons. Respondent\u2019s reference to Article 2(1) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT is not relevant. Besides being in the same Article, the two provisions are unrelated and serve different purposes. Also, the reference in Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT to Article 10 suggests that Article 2(3) applies at the moment of filing the claim. Article 10 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT covers how an investor can bring a claim in case of a dispute. It discusses what investors can do at the moment of filing that claim, not before. It is thus a procedural article - not a substantive one.209\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 171.\n\n178.\n\nClaimants refer to Respondent\u2019s argument that the reference in Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT to Article 10 means that Article 2(3) applies at the moment of the alleged treaty violations. To Claimants, simply because an investor \"can\" bring a claim immediately after a violation does not mean that the domicile requirement must apply at the moment of the violation. According to Claimants, if that were the intent of Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT, then the Contracting States could have written that Article 2(3) applies to substantive provisions covering such violations, like Article 3 and Article 5 (referring to fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\"), national treatment, most favored treatment and expropriation) instead of Article 10. Alternatively, the Contracting States could have included language indicating that Article 2(3) applies to the moment when the investments are made like in the Italy-Argentina BIT. But Argentina and Mexico did neither.210 The only substantive provision referred to in Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT is Article 4, which covers currency transfers, which are not at issue here. To Claimants, it is clear that the domicile exclusion in Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT is meant to apply to currency transfers and to the moment of filing a claim, nothing else. It does not apply at the moment of the violation.211\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 173.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 174.\n\n179.\n\nFurther, Claimants allege that Mr. Sastre was domiciled in Argentina at the moment of filing his claim on 29 December 2017. Claimants also agree with Respondent\u2019s proposed definition of the word \"Domicile,\" defining it as the place where the *\"physical person lives with the intent to remain there permanently*\"212 According to Claimants, Mr. Sastre only went to Mexico to develop and establish his business ventures. He intended to return to Argentina once this was completed, particularly because of the needs of his children.213\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 177, citing Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 223.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 178.\n\n180.\n\nIn any event, Mr. Sastre invokes the MFN protection standard in Article 3(2) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT to import the same \"treatment\" afforded in Respondent\u2019s other treaties, for example the France-Mexico BIT, which does not include a domicile exclusion. Thus, even if Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT were to apply on the date of the breach, and Mr. Sastre was \"domiciled\" in Mexico, Mr. Sastre can access international arbitration without a domicile restriction by virtue of the broad language of the MFN clause in Article 3(2) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT.214 On this point, Claimants argue that tribunals unanimously say that whenever an MFN Clause covers treatment of investors and investments, the clause includes the possibility of filing an arbitration as part of that treatment.215\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 185.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 114, lines 5-9; pages 115-116.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n**a.** ***The Relevant Dates for Assessing Mr. Sastre\u2019s Domicile***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Parties differ as regards the scope and extent of Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT and what the relevant dates are for assessing Mr. Sastre\u2019s domicile.\n\n182.\n\nTo solve this question, the Tribunal must interpret Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT in light of Article 31 of the VCLT, which provides that:\n\n*a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n183.\n\nArticle 2 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT provides as follows:\n\n*Scope of Application*\n\n*1. - This Agreement applies to the measures adopted or maintained by a Contracting Party in relation to investors of a Contracting Party regarding their investments and the investments of said investors, made in the territory of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n*2. - This Agreement applies throughout the territory of the Contracting Parties as defined in Article One, paragraph (6). The provisions of this Agreement shall prevail over any incompatible rule that may exist in the domestic laws of the Contracting Parties.*\n\n*3. - Regarding the provisions set forth in Articles Four and Ten****,*** *natural persons who are nationals of a Contracting Party and who have their domicile in the territory of the other Contracting Party where the investment is located, may only take advantage of the treatment granted by this Contracting Party to its own nationals.*\n\n*4. -This Agreement shall apply to all investments made before or after the date of its entry into force, but the provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to any dispute, claim or disagreement arising prior to its entry into force.*\n\n*5. -This Agreement shall not apply to:*\n\n*(a) economic activities reserved to the State in accordance with the legislation of each Contracting Party;*\n\n*(b) measures adopted by a Contracting Party for reasons of national security or public order;*\n\n*(c) financial services, except to the extent authorized by the legislation of each Contracting Party.*\n\n*6.-Article Three shall not apply to any measure still maintained by a Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation in force at the time of entry into force of this Agreement. As from that date, the inconsistent measure eventually adopted by a Contracting Party may not be more restrictive than those existing at the time of the entry into force of this Agreement*.216\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit CLA-0003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT. The original Spanish text provides: *\"\u00c1mbito de Aplicaci\u00f3n*: *1.- Este Acuerdo se aplica a las medidas que adopte o mantenga una Parte Contratante relativas a los inversores de una Parte Contratante por cuanto a sus inversiones y a las inversiones de dichos inversores, realizadas en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante.*  \n*2.- Este Acuerdo se aplica en todo el territorio de las Partes Contratantes tal como se lo defini\u00f3 en el Art\u00edculo Primero, p\u00e1rrafo (6).

A partir de esta fecha, la medida incompatible que eventualmente adopte una Parte Contratante no podr\u00e1 ser m\u00e1s restrictiva que aquellas existentes al momento de la entrada en vigor de este Acuerdo.\"*\n\n184.\n\nAs it follows from the text and title of Article 2 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT, this provision governs the scope of application of the BIT. Article 2(3) incorporates a specific limitation for natural persons presenting claims under this BIT. This provision states that when the natural person is domiciled in the host State of the investment, the application of Articles 4 (Transfers) and 10 (Dispute settlement between an investor and the host State of the investment) is limited to the treatment that the host State accords its own nationals.\n\n185.\n\nArticle 2(3) is part of Article 2 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT, entitled \"Scope of Application\" of the Treaty. The object and purpose of Article 2 and its sub-paragraphs is to define the scope of application of the Mexico-Argentina BIT; thus, Article 2(3) must be read within this context.\n\n186.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT states that:\n\n*1.- This Agreement applies to the measures adopted or maintained by a Contracting Party regarding investors of a Contracting Party regarding their investments and the investments of said investors, made in the territory of the other Contracting Party.217*\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit CLA-0003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT. The original Spanish text provides: *\"1.-*[E]*ste Acuerdo se aplica a las medidas que adopte o mantenga una Parte Contratante relativas a los inversores de una Parte Contratante por cuanto a sus inversiones y a las inversiones de dichos inversores, realizadas en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante.\"*\n\n187.\n\nAccordingly, the treaty\u2019s application is restricted to the measures adopted by the host State in relation to the investments made by an investor of the other contracting party in the territory of the host State. therefore, the relevant dates for assessing the application of the treaty for purposes of this debate are (i) the date in which the host State allegedly adopted the measures breaching the BIT, and (ii) the date of the claim\u2019s filing.\n\n188.\n\nFurthermore, Article 10(1) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT (dispute settlement between an investor and the host State of the investment) provides that the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism of the treaty is applicable regarding *\"*[a]*ny dispute relating to the provisions of this Agreement. \"*218 Therefore, despite the fact that Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT does not refer to other substantive provisions of the treaty (Expropriation, FET, MFN, for example) Article 10 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT considers these provisions by expressly stating that the dispute settlement mechanism applies to *\"[a]ny dispute related to the provisions of the BIT. \"* A different interpretation would render Article 2(3) practically useless.\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit CLA-0003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT. The original Spanish text provides: *\"*[t]*oda controversia relativa a las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo \u2026.\"*\n\n189.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes first, that if the concerned individual is domiciled in Mexico, the Mexico-Argentina BIT does not apply in respect to money transfers (Article 4), a substantive issue, and dispute resolution (Article 10), a procedural issue. Therefore, even though such individual is still entitled to make claims for violation of the substantive obligations provided under the Mexico-Argentina BIT, the individual cannot use the dispute resolution clause of the Treaty but rather such individual has to file before the national courts of Mexico. Second, the relevant dates for assessing Mr. Sastre\u2019s domicile are (i) the date on which the host State allegedly adopted the measures breaching the BIT; and (ii) the date when the claim was filed.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine the alleged dates of the seizures, 19 October 2011 *(Tierras del Sol),* and 31 October 2011 *(Tierras del Sol* and *Hamaca Loca),* as well as 2 October 2015, the date the Second District Court in Quintana Roo dismissed Mr. Sastre\u2019s *amparo.* Also, the date of the filing the amended notice of arbitration, 14 June 2019. These relevant dates apply for this particular discussion, but the analysis is not applicable to the other issues that are being debated in this proceeding.\n\n**b.** ***Mr. Sastre\u2019s Domicile at the Relevant Times***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal will now establish Mr. Sastre\u2019s domicile at the relevant dates.\n\n192.\n\nArticle 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT does not define the term \"domicile,\" thus, its meaning must be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning in its context and in the light of its object and purpose as required by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n193.\n\nAccording to its ordinary meaning, Respondent and Claimants agree on the following definition proposed by Respondent: *\"*[t]*he place where the physical person lives with the intent to remain there permanently.\"219*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 177.\n\n194.\n\nThe meaning of domicile must also be interpreted within its immediate context. Article 2(3) specifically states:\n\n[w]*ho are domiciled in the territory of the other Contracting Party where the investment is situated[...].220*\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT.Translation by the Tribunal. The original Spanish text provides: *\"*[q]*ue tengan su domicilio en el territorio de la otra Parte Contratante donde esta\u0301 situada la inversi\u00f3n \u2026.\"*\n\n195.\n\nThe analysis of whether or not a person is domiciled in a given place requires the application of objective criteria based on the evidence submitted before the tribunal. This means that the determination of whether a person is domiciled in each jurisdiction must be made considering objective factors such as the principal and permanent place of residence, and the place where a person exercises his or her rights related to his or her business, rights, and obligations. Therefore, a purely subjective criterion, such as a person\u2019s mere statement that, despite the evidence to the contrary, he or she had the \"intent\" to leave Mexico is clearly insufficient. In the specific circumstances of Mr. Sastre, the Tribunal must look at the facts under the relevant times to properly identify his domicile. The evidence confirming Mr. Sastre\u2019s Mexican domicile is overwhelming.\n\n196.\n\nMr. Sastre obtained a foreigner FM3 visa from the Mexican immigration authorities which certified his legal stay on Mexico on 2005.221 After three extensions, the visa expired in 2009.222 However, on 27 May 2009, Mr. Sastre became a naturalized Mexican citizen and Mexican national.223 Mr. Sastre\u2019s residence in Mexico allowed him to apply for the naturalization process as a Mexican resident.224 As part of the naturalization process, Mr. Sastre renounced his Argentinian nationality.225 According to Mr. Sastre\u2019s witness statement and cross-examination affirmations, *\"*[t]*he main* [reason for] *my naturalization* [request] *was for commercial reasons,\"226* this is clear from various commercial agreements related to Mr. Sastre\u2019s investment, which confirm that his domicile was in Mexico at the time he made the investment.227\n\n**Exhibit R**-**030**, Sastre's FM3 Visa .\n\n**Exhibit R-030**, Sastre's FM3 Visa .

In light of the evidence before this Tribunal, his declaration that after the alleged breaches in 2011 and 2015 he *\"[s]tayed in Mexico mainly to receive updates on the proceedings and administer the new hotel business\",* and at the end of 2015 he *\"[d]ecided to go back with my family to R\u00edo Cuarto, Argentina\"231* is not persuasive.\n\nWitness Statement of Carlos Sastre, \u00b6 57.\n\n199.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Sastre was domiciled in Mexico at the time of the measures that allegedly breached the Mexico-Argentina BIT. The Parties do not dispute that Mr. Sastre\u2019s domicile was in Argentina at the time of the filing of the request for arbitration.\n\n200.\n\nNow, the question the Tribunal must resolve is whether Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT precludes Mr. Sastre from presenting a claim against Mexico. As was previously stated, Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT confirms that when the natural person is domiciled in the host State of the investment, the application of Article 10 (Dispute settlement between an investor and the host State of the investment) is limited to the treatment accorded by the host State to its own nationals.\n\n201.\n\nFor the purposes of the Mexico-Argentina BIT, the Tribunal has established that Mr. Sastre was domiciled in Mexico at the time of the alleged breaches. Thus, Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT precludes Mr. Sastre from initiating the Dispute Settlement mechanism contained in the Treaty.\n\n202.\n\nLastly, Claimants argue that the MFN Clause excludes the application of the domicile provision as *\"Mr. Sastre can be treated as French investors,* [...] *who are not subject to the domicile provision*.\"232\n\nTranscript Day 1, page 113, lines 19-21.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls Article 3(2) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT (National treatment and MFN treatment) which establishes:\n\n[e]*ach Contracting Party, once it has admitted into its territory investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, shall provide full legal protection to such investors and their investments and shall accord them treatment no less favorable than that accorded to investors and investments of their own investors or investors from third States.*233\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit CLA-0003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT.\n\n204.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the reference to the MFN clause of the Mexico-Argentina BIT can only be understood to refer to substantive obligations related to the treatment granted to investors and not to procedural or jurisdictional questions, much less to issues of consent of the State. The consent of a State in a given treaty cannot be replaced by the consent of that same State under a different investment treaty.\n\n205.\n\nArticle 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT presents important limits to the Dispute Settlement mechanism contained in the Treaty. In this respect, the Contracting Parties envisaged the domicile condition in Article 2(3) as a requirement to accept the agreement in question. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the consent to arbitration granted by Mexico in the Mexico-Argentina BIT is conditioned upon the investor not being domiciled in Mexico at the relevant times. Thus, Mexico conditioned its consent to arbitration only with respect to an investor whose domicile was not Mexico at the relevant times. This requirement cannot be circumvented by invoking the MFN Clause relating to a third-party agreement that does not contain this element.\n\n206.\n\nIn this regard, the tribunal in *Telenor v. Hungary* established:\n\n[I]*n the view of this Tribunal its task is to interpret the BIT and for that purpose to apply ordinary canons of interpretation, not to displace, by reference to general policy considerations concerning investor protection, the dispute resolution mechanism specifically negotiated by the parties.234*\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0044**, *Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15, \u00b6 95, Award, 13 September 2006.\n\n207.\n\nThus, as the arbitration agreement vests the tribunal with jurisdiction and it determines the scope of its jurisdiction, resorting to an MFN clause to import provisions from a third-party treaty would circumvent the express terms that grant this Tribunal jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis.* Accordingly, this Tribunal dismisses the MFN argument presented by Claimants.\n\n208.\n\nBased on the above, the consent of the Parties is an essential requisite for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Treaty, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is limited to Mexico\u2019s consent under the relevant provisions of the Treaty including Article 2(3) of the Mexico-Argentina BIT. As Mr. Sastre was domiciled in Mexico at one of the relevant times, this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* over Mr. Sastre\u2019s claims.\n\n**c.** ***Statute of Limitations and Denial of Justice***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nEven though the Tribunal has already found that it has no jurisdiction to hear Mr. Sastre's claim, it will nevertheless (a) refer in Section V.E of this Award to the case of Mr. Sastre\u2019s renunciation of his Argentinian nationality given that the effects of such renouncement are the same as those that apply to the renouncements of Mr. Silva and Ms. Abreu; and (b) briefly refer hereunder to the claim related to *Hamaca Loca* given the particularities of that claim.\n\n210.\n\nMr. Sastre acquired the claim relating to *Hamaca Loca* from Swiss investors pursuant to an assignment on 12 June 20 1 7.235 Therefore, the acquisition was made after the alleged takeover of 31 October 2011 and the *amparo* decision of 2 October 2015. Whatever treaty claims the Swiss investors may have had because of the alleged breaches related to *Hamaca Loca,* they can only rely on the Swiss-Mexico BIT, but not on the Mexico-Argentina BIT. But even if the Swiss-Mexico BIT were invoked, which it was not, it suffices to note that Article 4 of the Swiss-Mexico BIT provides for a three-year prescription period. Consequently, any claim under the Swiss-Mexico BIT would be moot. Likewise, and considering the same dates, the prescription period under the Mexican -Argentina BIT, invoked by Mr. Sastre, has expired, except for the claim related to denial of justice. However, in view of the fact that the Tribunal has already found on several grounds that it does not have jurisdiction over Mr. Sastre's claims, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to entertain the matter of denial of justice.\n\n**Exhibit C-0003**, Hamaca Loca S.A. de C.V.'s Special Shareholders Meeting Resolution and Transfer of Rights to Carlos Sastre (Cesi\u00f3n de Derechos y Resoluci\u00f3n), 12 June 2017.\n\n**E.** **W****hether the** **W****aiver or** **R****enunciation of** **T****heir** **N****ationalities of O****rigin** **A****ffects the** **T****ribunal****\u2019****s** **J****urisdiction** **O****ver the** **C****laims of** **M****r****.

In turn, Article 17 provides the content and extent of such renunciations.237\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 244, citing **Exhibit R-027**, Nationality Law, Article 17.\n\n213.\n\nRespondent asserts that the renunciations referred to in Articles 17 and 19 of the Nationality Law are only granted once the Government of Mexico has favorably approved the naturalization process initiated by the interested party, so that the request for naturalization itself does not imply a renunciation.238\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 355.\n\n214.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Mr. Sastre received a letter of Mexican naturalization on 27 May 2009, while Ms. Abreu received it on 2 October 2000, and Mr. Silva received it on 8 April 2016. This implies that they successfully initiated and concluded the naturalization process, and therefore they submitted the renunciation required by Article 19 of the Nationality Law. Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva signed a document in which they *\"[e]xpressly renounced the ARGENTINE / PORTUGUESE nationality and any other nationality\"* and *\"renounced any rights granted to foreigners by treaties or international conventions [\u2026].* 239\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 246; 356-357.\n\n215.\n\nTherefore, Respondent argues that, at the time of the alleged measures, Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva had expressly renounced \"*any rights granted to foreigners by treaties or international conventions.\"* This includes the right to invoke the Investor-State dispute settlement mechanism under the Mexico-Argentina BIT and the Mexico-Portugal BIT.240\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 44, lines 14-22 to page 45, lines 1-2; Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 358.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent argues that the logic behind the waiver is precisely to prevent naturalized Mexicans from choosing the nationality that best suits them according to any applicable law to access benefits that they would otherwise not have.241 Thus, through the naturalization process, Mr. Sastre and Respondent, and Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva and Respondent, respectively, agreed to a renunciation which is still effective and consequently this Tribunal must decline its jurisdiction over these Claimants.242\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 45, lines 3-10.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 247-248, \u00b6\u00b6 358-359.\n\n217.\n\nRespondent asserts that the Tribunal must consider the contradiction in which Claimants find themselves since, on the one hand, they allege having acquired *ejido* rights and beachfront rights, that are reserved for Mexican nationals, and, on the other, they invoke their foreign nationality to file claims against Mexico with respect to those same rights through protection mechanisms that otherwise are not available to them.243\n\nTranscript Day 1, Page 45, lines 11-19.\n\n218.\n\nRespondent further argues that even if Claimants were able to prove the legal acquisition of their investments as foreigners, Claimants\u2019 case fails because in any event they agreed with Respondent to exclude the access of the protection of the treaties invoked. Respondent explains that persons who are Mexican nationals by naturalization may acquire real property in the restricted zone only because they are Mexicans. However, the acquisition by a naturalized person invoking a foreign nationality would imply losing Mexican nationality, and losing, for the benefit of the Nation, the property for which the investor invoked the protection.244\n\nTranscript Day 1, page 45, lines 20-22 to page 46, lines 1-13.\n\n219.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 effort to adjust their nationality to the convenience of the forum before which they bring their claims is a clear abuse of rights. At a minimum, these waivers in the naturalization process confirm that Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva were exercising their Mexican nationality as their dominant and effective nationality at the relevant times.245\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 46, lines 14-21.\n\n**b.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAccording to Claimants, under the Mexico-Argentina BIT, the nationality of an investor is determined by the laws of the State of origin of the investor. Claimants cite Article 1 of the Mexico-Argentina BIT in its relevant part:\n\n*'Investor' designates any natural or legal person who, makes or has made an investment, and who a) being a natural person, is a national of one of the Contracting Parties,* ***in accordance with its legislation.246*** *(emphasis in original)*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 141-143, citing **Exhibit CLA-0003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT, Article 1.\n\n221.\n\nSimilarly, under the Mexico-Portugal BIT, the nationality of an investor is determined by the laws of the investor\u2019s State of origin. Article 1 of the Mexico-Portugal BIT reads in its relevant part:\n\n*3.\"Investor\" means:*\n\n*a) natural persons having the nationality of either Contracting Party,* ***in accordance with its laws and regulations.**247(emphasis in original)*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\n222.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent\u2019s reliance on Mexican law and Mexican naturalization documents is misplaced.248 The state of the investor has the final say in defining who is or is not a national of that state.249 Therefore, Respondent would have to analyse Argentine law on renunciation of nationality and submit convincing facts and evidence to prove that Mr. Sastre waived his nationality under Argentine law.250\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 253 (c).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 259.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 151.\n\n223.\n\nFurther, Respondent made no legal analysis evidencing that Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva waived their Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law.251 Portuguese law requires nationals seeking to waive their nationality to: (1) apply before the relevant Portuguese government agencies, and (2) pay a corresponding fee. Respondent has not shown that Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva have done either.252\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 155.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 155.\n\n224.\n\nClaimants argue that the Treaties are silent on whether investors can waive the rights conferred to them by the Treaties. Only the Contracting Parties may waive treaty rights, because they are the ones who negotiate the investment treaties.253 Tribunals have also been concerned with the serious effects that such waivers would have on investors\u2019 rights, refusing to accept them unless they meet a very high bar.254\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 144.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 145.\n\n225.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent presents no facts showing that Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva intended to waive their rights under the Mexico-Portugal BIT,255 or that Mr. Sastre intended to waive his rights under the Mexico-Argentina BIT.256 Additionally, Claimants allege that the waivers included no reference to Claimants' specific investments, nor were these Claimants even aware of their treaty rights when they signed the form, and further testified in this proceeding that they had no knowledge of the treaties at the time that they signed their waiver.257\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 156.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 152.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 121, lines 18-22; page 122, lines 1-14.\n\n226.\n\nThus, according to Claimants, the focus of the analysis is on whether the investor freely, clearly, and *specifically intended* to waive his or her rights, being aware of the possibility of a future treaty dispute and the entitlement to arbitrate against Respondent in a neutral forum.258\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 147.\n\n227.\n\nClaimants argue that the purported waiver documents are blanket boilerplate statements that have no legal effect on treaty rights.259\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 156.\n\n228.\n\nAs to the dominant and effective nationality test, Claimants stress that it applies to diplomatic protection and has no place in investment treaty law. Nothing in the Mexico-Argentina BIT nor the Mexico-Portugal BIT bar dual nationals from investment protection or restricts consent to only those investors whose dominant and effective nationality is that of the other Contracting State.260 Respondent cannot add restrictions not contemplated in the Treaties.261\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 234.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 133, 138.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Parties extensively debated whether the test of dominant and effective nationality is applicable and whether investors may renounce rights conferred to them under investment treaties.\n\n230.\n\nThe Parties debated the landmark cases on dominant and effective nationality - particularly *Nottebohm* - and various decisions from investment tribunals that have applied, or refused to apply, the aforesaid test. Moreover, the three States that are signatories of NAFTA -Mexico as Respondent and Canada and the United States of America as third parties - indicated that the test of dominant and effective nationality must be applied under NAFTA.262 In the view of the Tribunal, in a situation where all State parties to the treaty are of the same opinion regarding the interpretation and scope of one of the terms used therein, if the Tribunal were to deviate from such consensus, it would need to explain the reasons for doing so. However, the cases of Ms. Abreu and of Messrs. Sastre and Silva are not merely cases of dual nationality. Even though they hold their nationalities of origin -Argentinian and Portuguese - and acquired Mexican nationality, they waived their nationalities of origin as a condition to obtain Mexican nationality. So, the Tribunal must focus on the effects of such waiver under the BITs that Mexico has concluded with Argentina and Portugal, rather than on the issue of dominant and effective nationality.\n\nSubmission of the United States of America, \u00b6\u00b6 13- 15.\n\n231.\n\nWith respect to the waiver of treaty rights, the Parties invoked several decisions where arbitral tribunals have reached different conclusions as to whether investors can waive the rights conferred to them by investment treaties and have either expressed doubts as whether such pre-dispute waivers are possible or have established a high bar for such waivers.263\n\nThe Parties referred, *inter alia*, to **Exhibit CLA-0037**, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 February 2010. **Exhibit CLA-0078**, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004. **Exhibit CLA-0079**, *Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. v. Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2017-37, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2019. **Exhibit CLA-0080**, *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008. **Exhibit CLA-0081**, *TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A, v Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award, 19 December 2008. **Exhibit CLA-0082,** *Aguas del Tunari, S.A., v. Republic of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005.\n\n232.\n\nThe facts of this case are substantially different from the ones invoked by the Parties in support of their respective pleadings. First, this is not a case where an individual acquires multiple nationalities and remains a national of all the corresponding States without renouncing one or more nationalities or losing one nationality because of the application of national law. Second, the cases of renunciation of the protection of investment treaties invoked by the Parties generally refer to situations where the investor, by contract or as a condition to invest, renounces generally the application of treaties or investment treaties or specifically the application of a given investment treaty. In the instant case, three Claimants renounced before Respondent their nationalities of origin and the national and international rights attached to such nationalities.\n\n233.\n\nMexico is not claiming that Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu made an implicit waiver of their rights under the respective treaties. Not even that they made a general waiver to the application of treaties that should be deemed as including the protection granted under the treaties that Mexico entered with Argentina and Portugal. The case of Respondent is that to acquire their Mexican nationality Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu waived their original nationalities and that such waiver expressly included all rights conferred by international treaties that were applicable because of their original nationalities, including the bilateral investment treaties with Argentina and Portugal.\n\n234.\n\nTherefore, prior decisions of other tribunals as regards the renouncement of rights under investment treaties have little relevance, if any. The Tribunal in this case cannot analyze the waiver of treaty rights in isolation because such waiver is inextricably tied to the willingness of Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu to obtain the nationality of Respondent and to the effects of such nationality with respect to their investments.\n\n235.\n\nArticle 19 of the Mexico\u2019s Nationality Law provides that the foreigner who intends to become a naturalised Mexican must:\n\n***I-*** *Apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicating the will to acquire the Mexican nationality.*\n\n***II-*** *Formulate the renunciations and oaths referred to in article 17 of the [Nationality Law].*\n\n[...]\n\n***III-*** *Prove that he/she speaks Spanish, knows the history of the country, and is integrated into the national culture.*\n\n*IV- Prove that he/she has resided in the national territory for the term required under article 20.*264\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit R-027**, Nationality Law.

In addition, the applicant must accept to commit to, obey, and submit to the laws and authorities of Mexico and abstain from any conduct that implies submission to a foreign State.266\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal, **Exhibit R-027**, Nationality Law. The original Spanish text provides: \"*Art\u00edculo 17.-Los mexicanos por nacimiento a los que otro Estado considere como sus nacionales, podr\u00e1n solicitar a la Secretar\u00eda el certificado de nacionalidad mexicana, \u00fanicamente para los efectos del art\u00edculo anterior.

The naturalisation letter shall be granted once it is established that renunciations and oaths have been made.267\n\n**Exhibit R-027**, Nationality Law, Article 19.\n\n239.\n\nMessrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu have submitted evidence of their Argentinian and Portuguese nationalities, respectively, and they have asked the Tribunal to consider it as *prima facie* evidence of their nationality for purposes of jurisdiction and disregard the declarations and waivers that they made when they acquired Mexican nationality.\n\n240.\n\nThe evidence submitted by Claimants is *prima facie* evidence of their nationalities. However, the Tribunal must review and analyse the totality of the evidence and decide for itself whether Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu may invoke their Argentinian and Portuguese nationality in relation to Mexico in the circumstances of this case.\n\n241.\n\nAccordingly, what the Tribunal must determine is not whether Mr. Sastre is a national of Argentina and Mr. Silva and Ms. Abreu are nationals of Portugal, respectively, but whether in the light of the totality of the evidence submitted in this arbitration they can invoke their purported Argentinian and Portuguese nationalities for purposes of the investment treaties that Mexico entered with Argentina and Portugal, and specifically with respect to the claims submitted in this arbitration.\n\n242.\n\nIt is undisputed that Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu voluntarily and willingly applied for Mexican nationality. Claimants have argued, as evidence of their allegation, that they acted in good faith and were advised by counsel. Even though Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu have provided explanations to justify the application for Mexican nationality, it is not disputed that they applied for Mexican nationality of their own will and free from any external pressure.\n\n243.\n\nThe provisions of the Nationality Law leave no doubt that the Constitution and laws of Respondent do not permit dual nationality for naturalized Mexicans. Foreigners willing to become Mexican nationals must renounce their nationality of origin as a condition to become Mexicans and they must do it on the terms and with the effects provided for under the Nationality Law.\n\n244.\n\nMessrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu did not simply follow a formality or sign a *\"boilerplate\"* document as they claim in this arbitration. The evidence on the record show that those Claimants were aware that individuals having Mexican nationality had significant advantages to invest in the *ejidos* and other areas subject to special regimes.268 They could not have ignored that when they applied for Mexican nationality, they had to renounce their nationalities of origin with the consequences provided for in the Nationality Law. The decision to renounce one\u2019s nationality is not a decision that is taken lightly and at the very least they should have consulted about the effects of the change of nationality with counsel. Claiming that they are not lawyers so they are unable to understand what they were signing or that what they signed was a *\"boilerplate form\"\"* cannot serve as an excuse to ignore the renunciations and oaths included in their written declarations.\n\nSee Transcript, Day 2, page 214, lines 3-4; page 241, lines 18-21.\n\n245.\n\nFollowing the requirements of the Mexican Nationality Law, each one of them, at the time of their naturalization as Mexicans signed a document renouncing (a) their nationalities of origin; (b) all submission, obedience, and fidelity to any other foreign government, especially to that of Argentina and Portugal, respectively; (c) all foreign protection to the laws and authorities of Mexico; and (d) all rights that international treaties or conventions grant to foreigners. In addition, they accepted to be subject to Mexican law and Mexican authorities and by obtaining the Mexican nationality they undertook to abstain from performing any conduct that would imply submission to a foreign State.269\n\n**Exhibit R-027**, Nationality Law.\n\n246.\n\nAfter signing the document, they were conferred the nationality of Respondent. There was an agreement between the applicants (Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu) and Respondent (Mexico) under which the latter will provide recognition to the former of all the rights and privileges of Mexican nationals and the former agreed not to invoke their nationalities of origin in their national and international relationships with Respondent.\n\n247.\n\nClaimants are correct in that Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva would not lose their nationalities of origin unless they renounced their respective nationalities in accordance with the laws of Argentina and Portugal, respectively. But the Tribunal reiterates that the questions it must decide is whether in this arbitration Claimants can invoke such other nationalities before Mexico, with all the rights and privileges derived therefrom, notwithstanding the renouncement and oaths made in exchange for obtaining the Mexican nationality.\n\n248.\n\nThe renouncement was validly made. Nothing on the record suggests otherwise. Of course, since the waiver was made with respect to Mexico it has effects only with respect to the relationship between Respondent, on the one hand, and Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva, on the other. It does not necessarily invalidate the nationalities of origin of these three Claimants under the laws of Argentina and Portugal, but it does affect their entitlement to raise claims against Mexico under any international treaty, including the Mexico- Argentina BIT and Mexico-Portugal BIT, respectively. The effect of the wording of Article 17 of the Nationality Law and the text of the renouncement resulting therefrom is that Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva have agreed with Respondent that in, their mutual relationships, Respondent will treat them as Mexican nationals for all purposes, both at a local and at an international level, and in exchange they will have all the rights and privileges that Mexico grants to its nationals. This is not merely a waiver of treaty rights or a factual debate on dominant and effective nationality, but an agreement by an investor not to invoke his/her original nationality against a sovereign State in exchange for that sovereign State accepting the investor as its own national.\n\n249.\n\nIn sum, the effect of the acquisition of Mexican nationality by Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva with respect to the treaties is that even though they are Argentinian and Portuguese nationals, respectively, and therefore they may be considered investors under the Mexico-Argentina BIT and the Mexico-Portugal BIT, they cannot invoke these other nationalities in their relationship with Mexico. Such relationship includes the rights derived from Mexico-Argentina and the Mexico-Portugal BITs. They voluntarily and willingly accepted to be treated as Mexicans by Mexico with respect to all their activities in Mexico, including their investments, and the effects of such activities at a national and international level,. Therefore, in respect of all international rights and obligations that they may have with respect to Mexico, Respondent can treat them as Mexican nationals.\n\n250.\n\nThe decisions invoked by the Parties as regards the waiver of rights under investment treaties refer to cases where the State has claimed an implicit waiver from the investor or where investors had signed contracts providing for such waivers or where a wide language in a document was alleged to include a waiver of treaty protection. The Tribunal has already found that the case here is different. But even if the Tribunal were to apply the high threshold pleaded by Claimants as the one adopted by some arbitral tribunals, such threshold would have been complied with. Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva voluntarily and willingly and expressly accepted to be treated by Mexico as Mexican nationals for all purposes related to their relationships with Mexico, with no exceptions whatsoever, and expressly renounced to invoke before Mexico all their rights and privileges as Argentinian and Portuguese national, including protection by their States of origin and the applicable international treaties. They cannot validly claim now that they were not aware of the effects of waiving their nationalities of origin.\n\n251.\n\nInvoking their nationalities of origin despite the voluntary, clear and express waiver constitutes a violation of basic principles of international law that the Tribunal must apply to decide the dispute. The Mexico-Argentina BIT provides that the tribunal constituted to decide disputes between the investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, as defined therein, shall apply the treaty and the rules and principles of international law.270 The Mexico-Portugal BIT in turn provides that the tribunal shall apply the treaty, the applicable rules of law and principles of international law.271\n\n**Exhibit CLA-003**, Mexico-Argentina BIT- Article 10.5.- \"The tribunal shall decide the disputes submitted to it on the basis of the provisions of the present Agreement as well as international law rules and principles on this subject.\"\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0034**/**Exhibit RL-016**, Mexico-Portugal BIT Article 15.1- \"A tribunal established under this Dispute Settlement Mechanism shall decide the submitted issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of law and principles of International Law.\"\n\n252.\n\nThe Treaties do not contain provisions regarding waiver of rights by the investor, nor do they provide norms or guidance as to a situation like the one debated in this arbitration. The Parties, considering the absence of specific provisions or guidance on the issue at stake, have correctly invoked principles of international law as well as arbitral decisions applying such principles as the applicable law to decide the issues of double nationality and waiver. The application of such principles would lead to the same result: Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva cannot invoke their nationalities of origin before Mexico for purposes of their claims in this arbitration.\n\n253.\n\nGood faith is undoubtedly one of the \"general principles of law\" referred to in the Statute of the International Court of Justice and as a fundamental principle of international law. The principle of good faith is at the crux of investment arbitration. Investment treaties and associated conduct by the parties must be interpreted in good faith, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Investments must be made in good faith and both the investor, and the State must act in good faith in their dealings with each other.\n\n254.\n\nTwo principles derive from the fundamental principle of good faith: *estoppel* and *pacta sunt servanda.* Both have been invoked by the Parties as applicable principles for the resolution of this dispute.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the principle of estoppel not as a mere transplantation of the rules of estoppel under jurisdictions of the common law tradition, particularly the United States of America, but as a principle of international customary law under which a party cannot go against its own acts. The *teoria de los actos propios* in civil law jurisdictions follows the same basic concept: a party cannot make an assertion at one time and deny it at another. As aptly indicated by Bin Cheng:\n\n*It is a principle of good faith that 'a man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold\u2014to affirm at one time and deny at another... Such a principle has its basis in common sense and common justice, and whether it is called estoppel or by any other name, it is one which courts of law have in modern times most usefully adopted. In the international sphere, this principle has been applied in a variety of* 272 *cases.*272\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0092**, Bin Cheng, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals*, (1953, 2009), pp.141-42.\n\n256.\n\nUnder the principle of estoppel, a party cannot behave in a manner that creates in the other party a legitimate expectation that such behaviour confirms the mutual understanding of the parties on a given matter, and then change course to adopt a different position. Legitimate expectations have been largely discussed in investment arbitration, but generally with respect to Fair and Equitable Treatment and in reference to the expectations that the State may create for the investor. States, however, are not the only ones that can create legitimate expectations. Investors through their conduct can also create legitimate expectations *vis-a-vis* the State, which may include, as in this case, the legitimate expectation that the common behaviour of the State and the investor represents the mutual understanding of the parties.\n\n257.\n\n*Pacta sunt servanda* is one of the oldest and most basic principles that applies in international law. Agreements must be complied with. Of course, it refers to agreements that are not contrary to law or entered in a fraudulent manner. The Tribunal has already found that there is an agreement between Respondent and Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva pursuant to which the former grants these individuals Mexican nationality in exchange for the latter renouncing their right to invoke their nationalities of origin with respect to Mexico. There is no allegation, much less evidence, that such agreement is contrary to law or is affected by fraud or corruption. Therefore, the parties to such agreement are under the obligation to comply with same.\n\n258.\n\nHaving set the framework for the decisions that the Tribunal will make with respect to the waivers of Mr. Sastre, Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva, the Tribunal will apply such framework to each of these Claimants.\n\n**a.** ***Renouncement of Mr. Sastre***\n---------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nOn 27 May 2009, Mr. Sastre became a naturalized Mexican citizen273 and on that same date he signed a document with the following statement addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico:\n\n*I expressly renounce my ARGENTINE nationality and any other nationality to which I may be entitled, as well as all submission, obedience and fidelity to any other foreign government, especially to that OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. I likewise renounce all foreign protection from Mexican laws and authorities and all rights that international treaties or conventions grant to foreigners.

The original Spanish text provides: \"*Obtuve carta de naturalizaci\u00f3n n\u00famero 01577 expedida el 27 de mayo de 2004 y con conocimiento de las penas en que incurren las personas que declaran con falsedad ante una autoridad distinta a la judicial, en los t\u00e9rminos de lo dispuesto por el art\u00edculo 247, fracci\u00f3n I del C\u00f3digo Penal para el Distrito Federal en materia del fuero com\u00fan y para toda la Rep\u00fablica en materia del fuero federal, manifiesto que no har\u00e9 uso de ning\u00fan otro pasaporte distinto del mexicano, ya que incurriria en una de las causales de p\u00e9rdida de nacionalidad mexicana por naturalizaci\u00f3n, previstas en el art\u00edculo 37, Secci\u00f3n B de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos*\".\n\n261.\n\nOn 25 August 2000, Mr. Sastre and his partner Mr. Marana incorporated CETSA, a Mexican corporation. Mr. Sastre was declared the sole administrator of the company. Mr. Sastre and Mr. Marana incorporated the following clause in the by-laws of CETSA:\n\n[t]*he partners adopt the clause referred to in Article fourteen of the regulations of the Foreign Investment Law, which , in its relevant part, reads as follows: 'When the corporate bylaws do not include a foreigner exclusion clause, the parties thereto must execute an express agreement or covenant that forms an integral part of the bylaws, whereby the company's current or future foreign partners are bound before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consider themselves as nationals with respect to the following:*\n\n*I. The shares, equity interests or rights such company acquires;*\n\n*II. The goods, rights, concessions, holdings or interests owned by such companies, and*\n\n*III. The rights and obligations deriving from the contracts to which the companies themselves are a party.276*\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit C-0002**, Partnership Agreement (Contrato de Sociedad) for Constructora Eco Turistica S.A. de C.V. (CETSA), 25 August 2000, pp. 1-2.\n\n262.\n\nMr. Sastre not only renounced his Argentinian nationality and made the renunciations and oaths required by the Nationality Law but reaffirmed thereafter his understanding that he could not invoke his Argentinian nationality and that doing so would result in losing his nationality and in the application of criminal penalties. Moreover, he reaffirmed at the time of the incorporation of CETSA that he agreed to be treated as a Mexican national and that his investment will be considered an investment made by a Mexican national.\n\n263.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Sastre invoked his Argentinian nationality before the Mexican authorities in connection with his alleged investment. On the contrary, in his requests and applications for permits and licenses and generally in acts related to the investment where Mexican authorities were involved, he represented that he was a Mexican national. In sum, he complied with the undertakings made at the time of his naturalization as Mexican. He cannot now claim that the undertakings were merely \"boilerplate\" and that he must be treated as Argentinian in its relationships with Mexico derived from the BIT, without going against the principles of *estoppel* and *pacta sunt servanda.*\n\n264.\n\nBecause of the express declaration and the behaviour of Mr. Sastre, Mexico was fully justified in relying on that he would continue complying with his obligations as a Mexican national, including the obligation not to invoke his Argentinian nationality and the rights derived therefrom. Mr. Sastre cannot change course and invoke his Argentinian nationality.\n\n265.\n\nThe interpretation proposed by Claimants as regards Mr. Sastre leads to a contradiction. On the one hand, Mr. Sastre claims that he must be treated as a Mexican national for purposes of his alleged investment. This, of course, will allow him to overcome significant restrictions in Mexican law that apply to the areas where he invested. But on the other, with respect to the same investment, he asks to be treated as an Argentinian for purposes the alleged expropriation of the investment he made as a Mexican national.\n\n266.\n\nMr. Sastre cannot escape from the obligations acquired under his agreement with Mexico, much less after having taken advantage of his Mexican nationality for purposes of his investment. The obligation not to invoke his Argentinian nationality remains valid and binding and must be complied with.\n\n267.\n\nIn conclusion, at the time of the alleged breaches (19 October 2011 and 2 October 2015) and at the time of the filing of this arbitration (14 June 2019), Mr. Sastre remained a Mexican national. His renunciation of his Argentinian nationality made in order to become a Mexican national, with all the consequences related thereto, had not been withdrawn or revoked. He remained an Argentinian national under Argentine law, but his Argentinian nationality cannot be invoked against Mexico for purposes of the Mexico-Argentina BIT. Mexico can validly object to Mr. Sastre\u2019s request for him to be considered a national of Argentina for purposes of his claim and the Tribunal must accept the objection.\n\n268.\n\nTherefore, also for this reason, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to Mr. Sastre.\n\n**b.** ***Renouncement of Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe case of Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva is not substantially different. Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva voluntarily applied for and obtained Mexican nationality. In Ms. Abreu\u2019s application for Mexican nationality on 24 January 2000, after stating that she profoundly identified with Mexico and its culture, had been living in Mexico for eleven years and was Mexican in her heart and actions, Ms. Abreu requested to be officially recognized as a Mexican national. She also declared that she had been informed of the terms and conditions of the procedure and she therefore had no doubt and was in agreement with it.277 Similarly, on 8 April 2016, Mr. Silva received a Mexican Naturalization letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico recognizing that he has \"[p]*romised commitment, obedience and submission to the laws and authorities of the United Mexican States and has complied with the requirements set forth in Articles 19 and 20, Section 1, Paragraph c) of the Nationality Law in force to obtain Mexican nationality by naturalization*.\"278\n\n**Exhibit R-062**, Ms. Mar\u00eda Margarida Oliveira de Abreu's Application for Naturalization to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 24 January 2000.\n\n**Exhibit R-024**, Silva's Mexican Naturalization Letter, 8 April 2016.\n\n270.\n\nFurther, Ms. Abreu (on 2 October 2000) and subsequently Mr. Silva (on 6 May 2016), signed the declaration required by Article 17 of the Nationality Law, which provides in its relevant part as follows:\n\n*I expressly renounce my* ***PORTUGUESE*** *nationality and any other nationality to which I may be entitled as well as to any submission, obedience and fidelity to any foreign government, especially to that* ***OF THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC****. I also renounce all foreign protection* from *Mexican laws and authorities and all rights that international treaties or conventions grant to foreigners.*279\n\nTranslation by the Tribunal. **Exhibit R-041**, Letter Renouncing Abreu's Portuguese Nationality, 2 October 2000. **Exhibit R-037**, Silva's Letter Renouncing his Portuguese Nationality, 6 May 2016.\n\n271.\n\nThere is no evidence that Ms. Abreu nor Mr. Silva invoked their Portuguese nationality before the Mexican authorities in connection with their alleged investment, and, in all acts related to the investment where Mexican authorities were involved, they represented that they were Mexican nationals. Both had, as Mr. Sastre, an agreement with Mexico with the same mutual obligations, and they behaved in a manner such that Mexico would have every reliance that they would comply with the Nationality Law and their renouncement and oaths and would not invoke their Portuguese nationality.\n\n272.\n\nClaiming their Portuguese nationality now would violate the legal principle of good faith and its derivatives of *pacta sunt servanda* and estoppel for the same reasons already developed in paragraphs 253 to 257 with respect to Mr. Sastre.\n\n273.\n\nThe interpretation proposed by Claimants as regards Ms. Abreu and Mr. Silva leads to a contradiction for the same reasons explained in paragraph 217.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal will not resolve additional jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent regarding Messrs. Sastre and Silva and Ms. Abreu, nor their alleged investment considering that they are moot as the Tribunal already concluded that it does not have jurisdiction over his claims under the Mexico-Argentina BIT and the Mexico- Portugal BIT.\n\n**F.** **W****hether** **M****r****.

(Abodes Mexico), dated 15 May 2007.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 297.\n\n277.\n\nRespondent further highlights Mr. de la Peza\u2019s expert report, submitting that the Promissory Sale Agreement dated 15 May 2007285 is not sufficient to prove that Mr. Jacquet is the holder of parcel or ejido rights regarding the AMSA Lot due to documentary and legal deficiencies.286 Alternatively, Mr. Jacquet failed to fulfill the legal requirements under the Agrarian Law and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requirements regarding the restricted zone, for the lot acquisition to be considered valid.287\n\n**Exhibit C-0017**, Promissory Sale agreement (Contrato Privado de Promesa de Compraventa) between Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo and Abodes Mexico S.A. de C.V. (Abodes Mexico), dated 15 May 2007.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 300. This is because it lacks the basic legal formalities to be enforceable between the parties themselves. It lacks the official documentation to prove the exact location of the AMSA Lot, the transfer of rights on 4 August 2006 in favor of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo as well as the official documentation to prove that an agreement of sale was concluded between Mr. Rom \u00e1n Lazo and Abodes regarding the AMSA lot, among others.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 302-303. This is because the Promissory Sale Agreement lacks the legal requirements to be enforceable before the RAN and third parties, and the ceded rights of use and enjoyment of land agreed in the Promissory Sale Agreement lack the legal requirements and formalities to be enforceable before the Ejido.\n\n278.\n\nRespondent also claims that the Commodatum Agreement between Mr. Rom\u00e1n Lazo and Mr. Jacquet (South Lot) dated 10 January 2008,288 is insufficient to show Jacquet\u2019s rights in Lot 10-A as there is no evidence to show that he used the commodatum rights as the base to construct and operate the hotel and store.289 Moreover, Respondent alleges that the commodatums are insufficient to prove that Mr. Jacquet acquired *ejido* rights in Lot 10-A because the acts described therein contravene the Agrarian Law and lack the requirements and formalities needed under law to be effective against the *Ejido;290* and, as a legal instrument, the commodatum agreement is insufficient as it lacks the basic legal formalities to have legal effect before the RAN and third parties. Alternatively, Mr. Jacquet was required to comply with Mexican legislation in restricted zones.291\n\n**Exhibit C-0018**, Commodatum Agreement between Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo and Renaud Jacquet (South Lot), 10 January 2008.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 305.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 306.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 307.\n\n279.\n\nRespondent also asserts that Mr. Jacquet has not proven evidence of his rights in the hotel, the store or other \"property interest.\"292 All documents presented in this arbitration show that Mr. Rom\u00e1n and not Mr. Jacquet had interest in the lot/properties and that it was Mr. Rom\u00e1n who paid the municipality taxes. Further, the Construction Regularization License *[Behla Tulum]* dated 5 October 2012;293 the Certificate of Land Use *(Constancia de Uso de Suelo)* dated 5 October 2012;294 the Tulum Municipal Treasury Receipt for payment of property taxes *(aportaciones);295* the Municipal Treasury Receipts *(Tesorer\u00eda Municipal, Recibos Municipales)* dated 17 June 2016 and 18 June 2012;296 and the Record of Lifting Closure Seals *(Acta de Levantamiento de Sellos de Clausura)* dated 3 July 2013297 (all provided by Mr. Jacquet), show that the property interests are in the name of Mr. Rom\u00e1n. Also, as shown in the Commodatum Agreements between Mr. Rom\u00e1n and Mr. Jacquet for the South298 and North299 Parcels, dated 10 January 2008, the right to request or to present a claim for expropriation was Mr. Rom\u00e1n\u2019 s right.300\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 308-312.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0012**, Construction Regularization License (Regularizaci\u00f3n de Obra) issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo, 5 October 2012.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0013**, Certificate of Land Use (Constancia de Uso de Suelo) issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo, 5 October 2012.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0016**, Tulum Municipality's Receipt issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo for payment for contributions, 17 June 2016.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0020**, Tulum Municipality's Receipt issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo for payment for contributions, 17 June 2016, 18 June 2012.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0021**, Records of Lifting Closure Seals (Acta de Levantamiento de Sellos de Clausura) relating to Renaud Jacquet, 3 July 2013.\n\n**Exhibit C-0052**, Commodatum Agreement Between Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo and Renaud Jacquet (South Parcel), 10 January 2008.\n\n**Exhibit C-0053**, Commodatum Agreement Between Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo and Renaud Jacquet (North Parcel), 10 January 2008.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 50, lines 7-22; page 51, lines 1-13.\n\n280.\n\nNeither Abodes Mexico nor Mr. Jacquet have complied with the Mexican legislation related to the alleged property rights, and, alternatively, they do not comply with the legal framework for property acquisition by non-Mexican nationals in restricted zones, in contravention of Article 2(1) of the Mexico-France BIT.301\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 313-315.\n\n281.\n\nFinally, until March 2014, Mr. Jacquet only held 50% of the shares in Abodes Mexico as stated in the Articles of Incorporation document (*Acta Constitutiva*) of Abodes Mexico S.A. de C.V. dated 24 March 2004,302 and Abodes Mexico is not a party to this arbitration.303\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0003**, Articles of Incorporation for Abodes Mexico S.A. de C.V., 24 March 2004.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, page 50, lines 7-22; page 51, lines 1-13.\n\n**b.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Mr. Jacquet negotiated two commodatum agreements for the use and enjoyment of two contiguous beachfront lots, which were developed and known as *Behla Tulum* and *La Tente Rose*.304 Claimants submit that \"*the possession, use and enjoyment of the lots, the business interests in the hotel and tourism enterprise and in the liquor shop are 'assets' and thus 'investments' under the France-Mexico BIT.\"305* Claimants further explain that until 2007, Mr. Jacquet and his late wife used Abodes Mexico to manage the investment. In 2008, however, Mr. Jacquet decided to manage the investment in his personal capacity.306\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 71.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 71*;* Rejoinder, \u00b6 166(b) .\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 102.\n\n283.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s arguments that Mr. Jacquet has not demonstrated that he had individual rights over the *Behla Tulum* and *La Tente Rose* investment, Claimants allege that they have provided evidence of the licenses and permits issued to Mr. Jacquet by Mexican authorities,307 including operating licenses from the Urban Development Office and the State of Quintana Roo, a permit to use the Federal Maritime-Land Zone for which he paid several times each year, and authorizations from Respondent\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Claimants assert that throughout the development and operation of this investment for approximately one decade, no Ejido member, Ejido official, or agency of Respondent ever claimed that this investment was unlawfully established in the manner that Respondent now claims. The only time when this investment was penalized for non-compliance was in 2013, when the environmental authorities suspended construction activities in *Behla Tulum* for failure to obtain an environmental permit. However, after visits by inspectors and payment of a fine, the matter was resolved. Thus, Mr. Jacquet duly executed agreements to build his business in the *Behla Tulum* lots.308\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 181; Witness Statement of Mr. Jacquet, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10, 14, 15, 17 n. 16.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 89.\n\n284.\n\nClaimants explain that Mr. Jacquet originally formed Abodes Mexico S.A. de C.V. for his investment, but he received conflicting legal advice on how to structure the corresponding land acquisitions. Eventually, the agreements related to the land where the alleged investment is located were restructured as commodatum agreements, transferring rights over the lots in Jacquet\u2019s name. After executing the two commodatum agreements, Mr. Jacquet continued to operate his *Behla Tulum* and *La Tente Rose* business on the combined lots in an undisturbed manner for 8.5 years.309\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 181; Witness Statement of Mr. Jacquet, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10, 14, 15, 17 n. 16.\n\n285.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s expert and witness evidence confirm that non-nationals are not prohibited from holding possessory rights over *ejido* lands. First, restricted zone laws are irrelevant, because title remained with the *Ejido.310* Additionally, under Agrarian Law, Claimants are not prohibited from holding possession over *ejido* lands.311\n\nClaimants' closing statement, p. 17, citing Mr. Marcelino Miranda Aceves' Witness Testimony.\n\nClaimants' closing statement, p. 17.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether Mr. Jacquet is an investor of the *Behla Tulum* hotel and *La Tente Rose*, whether Mr. Jacquet has proven his rights over the portion of Lot 10, and whether the *Behla Tulum* and *La Tente Rose* investments were made in accordance with Respondent\u2019s relevant laws under the terms of the Mexico-France BIT. It is undisputed that Mr. Jacquet incorporated a company (Abodes Mexico) on 24 March 2004.312 However, as the Tribunal will analyse hereunder, the rights of use were granted to Mr. Jacquet personally and his claim is not based on his hypothetical loss of the company. Moreover, the aforesaid company is not a party to this arbitration. Therefore, the references made by Mr. Jacquet in his witness statement regarding Abodes Mexico are irrelevant for the purposes of this arbitration.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0003**. Articles of Incorporation for Abodes Mexico S.A. de C.V., 24 March 2004.\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls Article 1 of the Mexico-France BIT containing the definition of investment:\n\n*ARTICLE 1*\n\n*Definitions*\n\n*For the purpose of this Agreement:*\n\n*1. The term investment means every kind of asset, such as goods, rights and interest of whatever nature, including property rights, acquired or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes, and in particular though not exclusively:*\n\n*a) Movable and immovable property* [...] *as well as any other right in rem such as mortgages, liens, usufructs, pledges and similar rights;*\n\n*b) Shares, premium on share and other kinds of interest including minority or indirect forms, in companies constituted in the territory of one Contracting Party;*\n\n*c) Title to money or debentures, or title to any legitimate performance having an economic value;*\n\n*d) Intellectual, commercial and industrial property rights such as copyrights, patents, licenses, trademarks, industrial models and mockups, technical processes, Know-how, tradenames and goodwill;*\n\n*e) Rights derived from any concession conferred by any legal means.*\n\n288.\n\nMr. Jacquet has the burden to prove that he was an investor at the time of the investment and at the time of the taking. As indicated by the tribunal in the *Cementownia* case, \"[i]*t is undisputed that an investor seeking access to international jurisdiction pursuant to an investment treaty must prove that it was an investor at the relevant time, i.e., at the moment when the events on which its claim is based occurred.\"313* Mr. Jacquet also needs to prove that he was an investor at the time of the filing of his claim.\n\n**Exhibit RL-038**, *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2, \u00b6 112 Award, 17 September 2009.\n\n289.\n\nTo determine whether Mr. Jacquet had an investment under the terms of Article 1 of the Mexico-France BIT, the Tribunal will begin by noting the timeline of the relevant facts related to the assets and rights claimed by Mr. Jacquet over the portion of Lot 10 and its constructions as well as the scarce evidence submitted. The Tribunal notes that some of the alleged facts present significant inconsistencies or irregularities that, when examined together with the precarious evidence provided, show that Mr. Jacquet did not have any rights over the lots nor rights to the hotel.\n\n290.\n\nMr. Jacquet claims that the laws of Mexico do not restrict foreigners from having possession of the property and that he has possession of the land. However, he does not provide evidence of possession, but instead submits a *comodato* agreement, that authorizes the use and enjoyment of the lots, and he does not convincingly explain how a *comodato* agreement, where he undertakes to return the property at any time at the request of the owner, grants him possession over such property.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls non-Mexican nationals cannot acquire *ejido* rights nor have ownership rights in *ejidos* or restricted areas. Foreign individuals, however, may have the use and enjoyment of land situated in restricted areas (such as beachfront property as is the case here) provided they enter into a trust agreement (*fideicomiso*) by means of a public deed. The foreign beneficiaries must agree with the Government of Mexico to consider themselves Mexican nationals with respect to their rights as beneficiaries, and they cannot invoke the protection of their governments, under penalty of losing their rights in favor of the Nation (see Section III.B).\n\n292.\n\nAs regards the chain of transfers that ended in the *comodato* agreements, it raises unsurmountable doubts as to Mr. Jacquet\u2019s alleged rights of.\n\n293.\n\nMs. Villareal had acquired Lot 10 A, which forms part of a larger Lot 10, from Mr. Rogelio Novelo Balam (*Ejidatario*). On 1 May 2006, Ms. Villarreal transferred the possession and usufruct of a portion of Lot 10A to Abodes Mexico (represented by Mr. Jacquet) through a private contract and an Addendum.314 Therefore, as of 1 May 2006, Ms. Villareal and Abodes Mexico shared rights over a portion of Lot 10 A.\n\n**Exhibit PGPG-0071**, Private agreement of transfer of possession and usufruct rights, executed between Mrs. Villarreal, represented by Mr. Villarreal Cueva, and AMSA, represented by Mr. Jacquet, 26 April 2004; **Exhibit RJ-0008**, Addendum to Transfer of Rights Agreement between Irma Villarreal and Abodes M\u00e9xico S.A. de C.V (North Lot), 1 May 2006.\n\n294.\n\nOn 5 August 2006, the *Ejido* Commissariat issued a Certificate of Possession stating that Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo (Mr. Rom\u00e1n) was the possessor of lot 1496 \"that originally corresponded to [Mr.] Rogelio Novelo Balam.\"315 Lot 1496 is also part of Lot 10. Claimants provide a map of the site,316 even though there is no clarity as to the specific location and boundaries of the lot.\n\n**Exhibit C-0049**, Certificate of Possession, Use and Enjoyment issued by the Ejido to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo, 5 August 2006.\n\n**Exhibit C-0049**, Certificate of Possession, Use and Enjoyment issued by the Ejido to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo, 5 August 2006.\n\n295.\n\nOn 15 May 2007, Mr. Rom\u00e1n executed a contract with Abodes promising to sell to Abodes the property rights previously acquired by Mr. Rom\u00e1n in respect to the \"AMSA lot\" which is allegedly a portion of Lot 10 A.317 The Tribunal notes that Section III, second part of the contract, provides that if the sale is prevented (because the buyer is not considered Mexican) the seller undertakes to constitute an irrevocable trust (\"*Fideicomiso Irrevocable Traslativo de Dominio\")* in order to address this issue. The measures of the AMSA lot are described in the promise, but there is no certainty as to its boundaries and specific location. Therefore, as of 15 May 2007 there were three different holders of rights over portions of Lot 10: Ms. Villareal, Abodes and Mr. Rom\u00e1n. The first two over Lot 10A and Mr. Rom\u00e1n over Lot 1496.\n\n**Exhibit C-0017**, Promissory Sale agreement (Contrato Privado de Promesa de Compraventa) between Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo and Abodes Mexico S.A. de C.V. (Abodes Mexico), dated 15 May 2007.\n\n296.\n\nOn 15 August 2007, Abodes Mexico transferred to Mr. Rom\u00e1n the lot previously acquired from Ms. Villarreal (see paragraph 91).318 Therefore, as of 15 August 2007 Abodes Mexico had no rights on the lot. It had transferred to Mr. Rom\u00e1n the portion of Lot 10 A acquired from Ms. Villareal and had executed a promise with Mr. Rom\u00e1n. There is no evidence that the promise was actually performed.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0009**, Transfer of Rights Agreement (Contrato Privado de Cesion de Derechos) between Abodes M\u00e9xico S.A. de C.V and Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo (North Lot), 15 August 2007.\n\n297.\n\nOn 2 January 2008, Ms. Villarreal transferred the \"remaining part of lot 10 A\" (also referred to as the \"South Lot\") to Mr. Rom\u00e1n.319\n\n**Exhibit C-0051**, Transfer of Rights Agreement Between Irma Villareal and Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo (South Lot), 2 January 2008.\n\n298.\n\nFinally, on 10 January 2008, Mr. Rom\u00e1n executed two *comodato* agreements with Mr. Jacquet over the free use of \"fraction A of lot 10\" and \"fraction B of lot 10\".320 There is no allegation, let alone any evidence that a *fideicomiso* had been constituted, despite the fact that the Parties, as mentioned in paragraph 295 above, were fully aware of such requirement.\n\n**Exhibits C-0052 and C-0053**, Commodatum Agreements between Mr. Rom\u00e1n and Mr. Jacquet , 10 January 2008.\n\n299.\n\nBut even though the absence of a *fideicomiso* arrangement is dispositive of the matter of Mr. Jacquet's lack of use rights in the beachfront land, the Tribunal also wishes to point to the circumstances discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\n300.\n\nThe documents submitted do not allow the Tribunal to conclusively determine that the transferors had the right to make the transfers and therefore that Mr. Jacquet has the rights that he claims. Aside from the debate as to the effects of not registering the transfers before RAN, had Mr. Jacquet registered the transfers, the Tribunal would have had certainty as to the chain of title over the lots.321 But he did not.\n\n**Exhibit PGPG-0016**, Agrarian Law of Mexico published in DOF on 26 February 1992, in force since 27 February 1992, as amended, in its version in force as of 16 April 2008, Arts. 148, 150, 152.\n\n301.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal did not find any evidence supporting Mr. Jacquet\u2019s rights over the properties of *Behla Tulum* and *La Tente Rose.* In this respect, the Urban Development Office issued a Construction Regularization License in the name of Mr. Rom\u00e1n, in which he appeared as the owner of the property.322 The Municipal Treasury of Tulum issued taxes payment receipts regarding Lot 10 under the name of Mr. Rom\u00e1n as well.323 None of these documents present Mr. Jacquet as the owner or administrator or user of the properties or land. In fact, during the suspension of construction activities mentioned by Claimants, the Mexican authorities recognized that \"[a]*t the time of the diligence, the person* [Mr. Jacquet] *did not exhibit any document that accredits such personality* [of responsible for the works and activities that are carried out in said property]\".324\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0012**, Construction Regularization License (Regularizaci\u00f3n de Obra) issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo, 5 October 2012.\n\n**Exhibits RJ-0016**, Tulum Municipality's Receipt issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo for payment for contributions, 17 June 2016.; **RJ-0020,** Tulum Municipality's Receipt issued to Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Rom\u00e1n Lazo for payment for contributions, 18 June 2012.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0021,** Records of Lifting Closure Seals (Acta de Levantamiento de Sellos de Clausura) relating to Renaud Jacquet, 3 July 2013.\n\n302.\n\nClaimants allege that several licenses were issued to *La Tente Rose* and *Behla Tulum.* The Tribunal recognizes that the majority of the licenses were issued for purposes of operating *La Tente Rose,* but there is no evidence to support Mr. Jacquet\u2019s possible property interest in *Behla Tulum* or in *La Tente Rose.325* Licenses and land use certificates serve to demonstrate that the municipal authority authorized the performance of the activities to which they refer, but they do not grant property or related rights, nor do they serve as evidence of the existence of any investment as claimed by Mr. Jacquet.\n\n**Exhibit RJ-0014**, Commercial Land Use License (Licencia de Uso de Suelo Commercial) issued to Renaud Jacquet, 5 October 2012; **Exhibit RJ-0015**, Provisional Permits for sale of beer, wine and liquor in closed containers, issued to Renaud Jacquet on 20 December 2013 and 19 September 2014; **Exhibit RJ-0017**, Operating License (Licencias de Funcionamiento), and Operating License with Alcoholic Beverage License, issued to Renaud Jacquet on 31 December 2012 and 2013; **Exhibit RJ-0018**, Sanitary License issued to Renaud Jacquet, 8 May 2014; **Exhibit RJ-0019**, Certificate of Security Measures Concerning Civil Protection, dated 7 May 2014; **Exhibit RJ-0021**, Records of Lifting Closure Seals (Acta de Levantamiento de Sellos de Clausura) relating to Renaud Jacquet, 3 July 2013.\n\n303.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that the evidence provided by Claimants to prove the existence of Mr. Jacquet\u2019s rights over the lots and hotel properties is insufficient and raises serious doubts as to the chain of transfer of rights. But most important, there is no evidence that Mr. Jacquet entered into a *fideicomiso* for the use of the lots as required by Mexican law, and therefore, he lacks evidence that he made an investment in accordance with the laws of Mexico.\n\n304.\n\nFor Mr. Jacquet to have an investment under Article 1 of the Mexico-France BIT, he must prove that his investments were made in accordance with Respondent\u2019s legislation based on the legal standards established under Article 2(1) of the Mexico-France BIT:\n\n*ARTICLE 2*\n\n*Scope of the Agreement*\n\n*1. It is understood that* ***investments covered under the present Agreement****are those which have already been made or may be made subsequent to the entering into force of this Agreement,* ***in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory****or in the maritime area of which the investment is made.326(emphasis added)*\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0015**, France-Mexico BIT.\n\n305.\n\nIn this regard, the tribunal in the *Fraport* case specified that:\n\n*[w]ith respect to a bilateral investment treaty that defines 'investment', it is possible that an economic transaction that might qualify factually and financially as an investment (i.e. be comprised of capital imported by a foreign entity into the economy of another state which is party to a BIT), falls, nonetheless, outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal established under the pertinent BIT, because legally it is not an investment within the meaning of the BIT. This will occur when the transaction that might otherwise qualify as an 'investment' fails ratione temporis, as occurred in Empresa Lucchetti S.A. et al v. Republic of Peru, or fails ratione personae, as occurred in Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates. It will also occur when the transaction fails to qualify ratione materiae, as occurred in Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador.*327\n\n**Exhibit CLA-0098**, *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, \u00b6 306, Award, 16 August 2007.\n\n306.\n\nThe previous examination of the facts suggests that the transfers did not meet the requirements of the Agrarian Law governing the *ejido* regime. These lots were \"common land lots\" and therefore the agreements and contracts executed by Ms. Villarreal and Mr. Rom\u00e1n required approval from the *Ejido* Assembly.328 No evidence of such approval was provided. In addition, no *fideicomiso* was entered into. These two requirements form part of Mexico\u2019s special legal regime of mandatory provisions that govern investments by non-Mexicans in *ejidos* and restricted zones. Mr. Jacquet made his alleged investment in clear violation of mandatory provisions of Mexican law.\n\n**Exhibit PGPG-0016**, Agrarian Law of Mexico published in DOF on 26 February 1992, in force since 27 February 1992, as amended, in its version in force as of 16 April 2008, Article 23.V.\n\n307.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, this Tribunal considers that Mr. Jacquet did not make an investment in accordance with Mexican law, as required by the Mexico-France BIT, and therefore, Mr. Jacquet cannot be considered an investor for purposes of the Mexico-France BIT. This Tribunal, thus, does not have jurisdiction over Mr. Jacquet\u2019s claims.\n\n**G.** **W****hether** **M****s****.

Referring to the decision in *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* Mexico claims that arbitral tribunals have the obligation to not protect the abuse of the international system of investment protection under ICSID or investment treaties.329\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 241.\n\n309.\n\nSeveral arbitral tribunals have likewise concluded that to extend the protection provided for in international treaties to investments made in bad faith or in violation of local law would compensate the improper behaviour of investors in violation of the principle *nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem allegans:* no one may benefit from his or her own wilful misconduct.330 Therefore, it will be inappropriate for this Tribunal to accept jurisdiction over Claimants in this arbitration, because, in doing so, it will be violating the aforementioned principles.331\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 246.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253.\n\n310.\n\nThe investments and Claimants\u2019 actions as regards the alleged investments violated the national and international principle of good faith and international public interest. They were deliberately structured to illegally obtain domestic rights over the land that otherwise would only be available to Mexican nationals. Later, some Claimants obtained Mexican nationality attempting to overcome the illegality. These illegal interests are at the core of the investments in which Claimants based their claim. The Tribunal cannot allow the improper use of the international arbitral system based on false affirmation of property or of investment rights.332\n\nReply on Jurisdiction,\u00b6 257.\n\n311.\n\nMexico further claims that the Tribunal must apply the principle of dominant and effective nationality and consider Ms. Gal\u00e1n as Mexican for purposes of her alleged investment. NAFTA is silent on how to treat investors that are dual nationals. However, the law that the Tribunal must apply to decide this dispute are the provisions of the Treaty and principles of international law. According to Respondent, such principles are summarized in paragraph 8 of the United States\u2019 NAFTA Article 1128 submission in the *Feldman* arbitration and in the scholarly writing of Professor Zachary Douglas. Under this principle, unless otherwise provided for in the corresponding treaty, if an individual claimant with the nationality of one contracting state also has the nationality of the other contracting state party, the tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* only if the former nationality is the dominant of the two.333\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 76-78.\n\n312.\n\nFor the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the claim submitted by Ms. Gal\u00e1n, she must prove that at all relevant times - that is to say the time of the investment, the time of the alleged expropriation and the time of the filing - she was a Canadian national and that her dominant and effective nationality was Canadian.334\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 251; Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 487.\n\n313.\n\nMs. Gal\u00e1n was born in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico and exercises her Mexican nationality as she has at least been issued four Mexican passports covering the time period between 13 January of 1983 and 11 March of 2020.335 As a Mexican national, Respondent submits that she is excluded from seeking protection under NAFTA against Mexico unless she proves that her Canadian nationality was the dominant and effective nationality at all relevant times. She has not done so.336\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 255.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 498.\n\n314.\n\nUnlike Mr. Sastre, Mr. Silva and Ms. Abreu, Ms. Gal\u00e1n is Mexican by birth and therefore the legal effects of her nationality must be analysed in light of the Mexican legal provisions that govern juridical acts entered into by Mexican nationals within and outside Mexican territory.337\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 500.\n\n315.\n\nArticle 13 of the Nationality Law338 clearly provides that Mexicans by birth, who have acquired or possess the nationality of another State, act as Mexican nationals with respect to (a) legal acts entered into within Mexican territory and the zones where the Mexican State exercises its jurisdiction under international law; and (b) legal acts entered into outside the limits of the Mexican jurisdiction, by means of which a Mexican by birth holds legal title over real estate located within Mexican national territory or other rights whose exercise is limited to Mexican territory.339 Article 14 of the Nationality Law adds that Mexicans by birth who are dual nationals may not invoke the protection of a foreign government or else they will lose, for the benefit of the Nation, the goods or any other rights over which they have asked for protection. Therefore Ms. Gal\u00e1n, a Mexican by birth, who acquired legal rights in Mexican territory may not invoke protection under NAFTA.340\n\n**Exhibit R-077**, Nationality Law.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 501.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 503.\n\n316.\n\nIn addition, at all relevant times, Ms. Gal\u00e1n kept her residency and centre of business in Mexico, and, in all acts related to her alleged investment, including acts that took place after the alleged taking, she invoked her Mexican nationality. Therefore, it is clear that Ms. Gal\u00e1n\u2019s dominant and effective nationality is Mexican, and therefore she is not entitled to protection under NAFTA as a Canadian.\n\n**b.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nClaimants contend that the arbitral decisions invoked by Respondent where tribunals denied protection to investments made fraudulently or through falsehoods and misrepresentations are not applicable in this arbitration. There is no evidence whatsoever that Claimants misrepresented or provided false information in the establishment or operation of their investments.341\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 405-406.\n\n318.\n\nThe accusation that Ms. Gal\u00e1n \"intentionally\" structured her investments to circumvent prohibitions of Mexican law or sought Mexican nationality later only to cure alleged illegalities is unfounded. Respondent alleged that Ms. Gal\u00e1n abused the arbitral system to present false property claims, but it is not clear which specific laws Respondent refers to. If Respondent is referring to Mexican laws that restrict ownership by foreign nationals in certain areas, the allegation is misplaced. Ms. Gal\u00e1n did not own the lands, so the point is irrelevant. Even if those laws were applicable, they violate Respondent\u2019s National Treatment obligations in the treaties. Finally, Respondent has not provided evidence of any fraud whatsoever.342\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 407.\n\n319.\n\nClaimants have provided sufficient evidence to prove that they acted in good faith. On the contrary, Respondent has failed to produce evidence to support its allegation that Claimants acted in bad faith or fraudulently or that there were serious illegalities or that there was impropriety by Claimants.343\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 408-409.\n\n320.\n\nAs regards the dominant and effective nationality test, Claimants consider that is a creature of diplomatic protection jurisprudence, which has no place in investment treaty law. The term has its origins in an International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") decision, the *Nottebohm* case, and the subsequent *Merg\u00e9* case. However, the definition of \"national\" must be found in the corresponding treaty, which is *lex specialis.* NAFTA does not bar dual nationals from investment protection or restrict consent to only those investors whose dominant and effective nationality is that of the other Contracting State.344\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 128; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 234.\n\n321.\n\nRespondent cannot add restrictions not contemplated in NAFTA. Should it have been the Respondent\u2019s intent to impose such restrictions, it would have done so as it did in its free trade agreement with Panama.345\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 133.\n\n322.\n\nThe Contracting State Party submission from the Government of the United States in connection with *Feldman v. Mexico* references the *Merg\u00e9* case, but otherwise does not explain how the test could be applicable when not referenced in the given Treaty. Moreover, Mexico neglects to reveal that the tribunal in the *Feldman* case rejected the approach proposed by the United States.346\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 135, 136.\n\n323.\n\nAs to the reference to Professor\u2019s Zachary Douglas writings, Claimants note that his analysis focuses on the language of the U.S. Model BIT, which expressly includes the dominant and effective requirement as a limitation to the definition of investor.347\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 137.\n\n324.\n\nBut even if the Tribunal were to apply the dominant and effective nationality test, Ms. Gal\u00e1n is predominantly Canadian.348 She moved permanently from Mexico to British Columbia, Canada in 2004 and has lived there ever since. She then married Mr. Alexander, a Canadian resident and citizen by birth, in 2005, and she became a permanent resident of Canada on 22 February 2007. From 2004 until 2006, while living in Canada, Ms. Gal\u00e1n, together with Mr. Alexander, coordinated the construction of Hotel Parayso, negotiated with the *ejido* authorities for the certificate of possession for the lot, operated the Hotel Parayso investment remotely, mostly from Canada. They pay annual income taxes in Canada but not in Mexico.349\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 247.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 247.\n\n325.\n\nRespondent has produced no evidence to challenge Ms. Gal\u00e1n\u2019s testimony and documents, nor has Respondent presented any documents relevant to this analysis such as income tax records filed or paid by Ms. Gal\u00e1n, Mexican voting records, or evidence that she kept a habitual residence in Mexico after her investment was expropriated nor evidence of her personal attachments to Mexico.350\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 250.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal has reiterated that under Mexican law related to *ejidos* and restricted zones, the requirements for Mexicans and non-Mexicans to acquire rights in such areas are substantially different.\n\n327.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribunal recalls that the date of the investment has particular relevance in the case of Ms. Gal\u00e1n, considering that she was the only Claimant having exclusively Mexican nationality on the date when the investment was made.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ms. Gal\u00e1n invoked her Mexican nationality to acquire rights in an area restricted to individuals who are Mexican nationals, to request permits from different Mexican authorities and to file judicial claims before the Mexican courts.\n\n329.\n\nMs. Gal\u00e1n submitted a certificate in this arbitration as support for her investment to evidence that she was granted possessory rights over the given land.351 She could only have obtained the possessory rights, as reflected in the certificate, as a Mexican national. A non-Mexican national would have had to comply with the requirements mentioned in Section III.B, including the approval of the *Ejido* Assembly and the execution of a trust agreement (*fideicomiso*).\n\n**Exhibit C-0060**, Certificate of Possession, Use and Enjoyment issued by the Ejido to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n, 25 June 2006.\n\n330.\n\nIn fact, at the time when Ms. Gal\u00e1n acquired the possessory rights from Mr. Balam on 28 April 2004352 and when she transferred part of the possessory rights to RSM,353 a Delaware company, she was a Mexican national and had not yet become a Canadian national.\n\n**Exhibit C-0023**, Transfer of Rights Agreement (Contrato Privado de Cesi\u00f3n de Derechos) between Rogelio Novelo Balam and M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n, 28 April 2004.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0007**, Purchase Agreement between M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos and Rancho Santa Monica Developments Inc., 29 November 2004.\n\n331.\n\nMs. Gal\u00e1n indicated that her domicile was in Mexico when she applied for and obtained the Construction Regularization License issued by the Urban Development Office, approving the construction on Lot 10354 and the Certificate of Land Use permitting the use of the property for tourist lodging.355 In the Concession Title granted by the Mexican federal government stating that the hotel project complied with Mexican environmental law, Ms. Gal\u00e1n is referred to as a national of Mexico domiciled in Mexico.356 Different Mexican authorities issued additional licenses and permits to Ms. Gal\u00e1n, and in all of them she is said to have a domicile in Mexico.357\n\n**Exhibit MG-0008**, Construction Regularization License (Regularizacion de Obra) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 8 March 2006.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0009**, Certificate of Land Use (Constancia de Uso de Suelo) issued for M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n, 8 March 2006.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0010**, Concession Title (Titulo de Concesio\u0301n) issued by Mexico's Ministryy of the Environment and Natural Resources to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 13 February 2007.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0011**, Construction Regularization License (Regularizaci\u00f3n de Obra) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 11 September 2009; **Exhibit MG-0012**, Land Use License (Licencia de Uso de Suelo) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 11 September 2009; **Exhibit MG-0013**, Commercial Land Use License (Licencias de Uso de Suelo Comercial) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 10 September 2009; **Exhibit MG-0014**, Construction Regularization License (Regularizaci\u00f3n de Obra) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 14 October 2015; **Exhibit MG-0015**, Land Use Certificate (Constancia de Uso de Suelo) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 14 October 2015; **Exhibit MG-0016**, Tulum Municipality Operating Licenses, 29 November 2010, and 19 August 2015 issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos; **Exhibit MG-0018**, Permanent Signage License (Licencia de Anuncio Permanente) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 9 August 2010 \u2013 9 August 2011.\n\n332.\n\nMs. Gal\u00e1n was present during the alleged taking of 17 June 2016. The court officer that led the group in charge of the taking specifically asked Ms. Gal\u00e1n for her ID, and she claimed not to have one.358 On 8 July 2016 after the alleged taking, Ms. Gal\u00e1n filed an *amparo* before the Mexican courts of Cancun, Quintana Roo seeking protection against both the order to occupy the land and the enforcement thereof. Again, in the *amparo,* Ms. Gal\u00e1n affirms that she is a Mexican national domiciled in Mexico.359\n\n**Exhibit C-0041**, Written Declaration of Court Representative Mar\u00eda Elena Anaya Reyes, 17 June 2016.\n\n**Exhibit R-047**, Ms. Mo\u0301nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos' Indirect *Amparo* Petition before the Court of the Third District of the State of Quinanta Roo.\n\n333.\n\nIn sum, there is no evidence that, having acquired the Canadian nationality in 2015, Ms. Gal\u00e1n invoked such nationality during the events of 17 June 2016, in the filing of the *amparo* or thereafter.\n\n334.\n\nUnder Chapter II of the Mexican Nationality Law which applies to Mexican nationals by birth, and therefore applies to Ms. Gal\u00e1n, Ms. Gal\u00e1n is considered a Mexican national for purposes of her alleged investment. Article 13 of said law provides that it shall be understood that Mexicans by birth who acquire another nationality act as Mexican nationals, *inter alia*, with respect to (a) legal acts executed within the national territory of Mexico and within zones where the Mexican State exercises jurisdiction according to international law; and (b) legal acts executed outside the national jurisdiction of Mexico by means of which such Mexican nationals hold title to real estate located within Mexican territory or other rights the exercise of which is circumscribed to Mexican national territory.360\n\n**Exhibit R-077**, Nationality Law, Chapter II, Article 13. The original Spanish text provides: \"***Art\u00edculo 13.-*** *Se entender\u00e1 que los mexicanos por nacimiento que posean o adquieran otra nacionalidad, act\u00faan como nacionales respecto a:*  \n**I.** *Los actos jur\u00eddicos que celebren en territorio nacional y en las zonas en las que el Estado Mexicano ejerza su jurisdicci\u00f3n de acuerdo con el derecho internacional; y*  \n**II.** *Los actos jur\u00eddicos que celebren fuera de los l\u00edmites de la jurisdicci\u00f3n nacional, mediante los cuales:*  \n**a)** *Participen en cualquier proporci\u00f3n en el capital de cualquier persona moral mexicana o entidad constituida u organizada conforme al derecho mexicano, o bien ejerzan el control sobre dichas personas o entidades;*  \n**b)** *Otorguen cr\u00e9ditos a una persona o entidad referida en el inciso anterior; y*  \n**c)** *Detenten la titularidad de bienes inmuebles ubicados en territorio nacional u otros derechos cuyo ejercicio se circunscriba al territorio nacion*al.\"\n\n335.\n\nArticle 14 of the Nationality Law adds that as regards to legal acts referred to under Article 13, Mexican nationals with dual nationality may not invoke the protection of a foreign government and if they do, they will lose, in favor of Mexico, the assets, or any other right over which the protection has been invoked.361\n\n**Exhibit R-077**, Nationality Law, Chapter II, Article 14. The original Spanish text provides: **Art\u00edculo 14.-**\"*Trat\u00e1ndose de los actos jur\u00eddicos a que se refiere el art\u00edculo anterior, no se podr\u00e1 invocar la protecci\u00f3n de un gobierno extranjero. Quien lo haga, perder\u00e1 en beneficio de la Naci\u00f3n los bienes o cualquier otro derecho sobre los cuales haya invocado dicha protecci\u00f3n*.\"\n\n336.\n\nThe cited provisions, when applied to Ms. Gal\u00e1n, have two effects. First, they confirm that even if her investment had been made when she had dual nationality and in compliance with the laws applicable to foreigners, such investment would be considered under Mexican law as an investment made by a Mexican national. Second, had Ms. Gal\u00e1n invoked her Canadian nationality to seek protection from Canada, she would have lost the alleged investment to Mexico.\n\n337.\n\nFrom the above set of facts, the Tribunal concludes that Ms. Gal\u00e1n could have not made the investment she claims in this arbitration as a Canadian national. She obtained the rights of possession, use and enjoyment of the property without complying with any of the Mexican law requirements for non-Mexicans to make investments in *ejidos* and restricted zones. On the contrary, she made a purely Mexican investment in compliance with the requirements applicable to Mexican nationals. Therefore, if she is a Canadian national (as she claims in this arbitration) she could not have made her investment in Mexico in the manner in which she did. If she is a Mexican national as repeatedly claimed before Mexico, then she is not protected under NAFTA for her investments in Mexico.\n\n338.\n\nTo summarize, Ms. Gal\u00e1n made an investment in Mexico under the regime applicable to investments of Mexican nationals, and therefore she is not protected under NAFTA for purposes of such investment. The Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear her claim.\n\n**H.** **W****hether** **M****r****.

The transfer of rights to Ms. Gal\u00e1n was not carried out in accordance with the laws of Respondent since it does not comply with any of the Agrarian Law requirements for it to be valid.\n\n341.\n\nFurther, as shown in the Purchase Agreement dated 29 November 2004,366 Ms. Gal\u00e1n entered into a sale and purchase agreement with RSM, which is not a party to this claim. Accordingly, Respondent argues that there is *prima facie* evidence that the Parayso Investments are owned by RSM, a United States company that is not a claimant in this arbitration.367\n\n**Exhibit R-005**, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), \"10-K, EX-10.6, Purchase Agreement between M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n-R\u00edos and Rancho Santa M\u00f3nica Developments Inc.\", 29 November 2004.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 263.\n\n342.\n\nFinally, in regard to Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander\u2019s *\"property rights\"* in Hotel Parayso, it is specified that the land use and operation licenses issued by the Municipality of Tulum cannot be considered proof of possession or ownership of the *ejido* parcel.\n\n**b.** ***Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nClaimants assert that Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander, as representatives of RSM, rescinded their agreement to transfer the investment to RSM and agreed to share equally in the investment. Thus, upon their marital separation, they continued to own and control the investment individually.368\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 62.\n\n344.\n\nEven if RSM were the owner of the Parayso investment, Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander would still be investors who own or control the investment \"directly or *indirectly.\"* Respondent\u2019s claim that indirect ownership is \"deficient\" has no merit, as the Treaty expressly protects these investments.369\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 64.\n\n345.\n\nRespondent also insists that *\"it has not been shown that RSM's rights over Hotel Parayso were cancelled*\" because Claimants\u2019 document has not been \"officialised\". Claimants submit that Respondent forgets that simply saying that something has not been formalized to *its* satisfaction is not the same as rebutting *prima facie* evidence. Claimants underscore that Respondent again fails to adduce any evidence to counter Claimants\u2019 evidence on this point.370\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 184.\n\n346.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that the rights of Mr. Alexander over the Parayso lot have not been demonstrated because the Gal\u00e1n-Alexander separation of property agreement *\"is not a valid or sufficient document to show that Ms. Gal\u00e1n acquired rights over* [the Parayso lot].\" Yet, according to Claimants, Ms. Gal\u00e1n acquired assets in Respondent\u2019s territory including licenses, permits, contractual rights, and an *Ejido* Certificate of Possession. These assets constituted, among other things, an \"enterprise\" and \"tangible and intangible\" property for economic benefit under the NAFTA.371\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 267-270.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander are considered investors that had an investment under the terms of NAFTA. Ms. Gal\u00e1n\u2019s case was resolved by the Tribunal in Section V.G(2). Thus, the Tribunal will now assess Mr. Alexander\u2019s individual situation and the questions of whether he is an investor of a qualified investment, and whether he has standing to file a claim against Mexico under the terms of the applicable Articles of the NAFTA.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the terms of Article 1139 of the NAFTA that read as follows:\n\n**[i]*****nvestment of an investor of a Party*** *means an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party;*\n\n***[i]nvestor of a Party*** *means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.*\n\n349.\n\nSection B of the NAFTA concerning the \"Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of Another Party\" states:\n\n*Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf*\n\n*1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation* [...]*.*\n\n*Article 1117: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise*\n\n*1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation* [...]\n\n350.\n\nTo determine whether Mr. Alexander falls within the referred definitions and filed a claim as an investor, the Tribunal must place the alleged facts in proper context.\n\n351.\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Alexander formed Rancho Santa Monica Developments, Inc. appearing as its majority shareholder, sole director and administrator.372 Later, on 29 November 2004, Ms. Gal\u00e1n transferred her rights and title of the western portion of the portion of Lot number 10 to RSM.373\n\n**Exhibit R-008**, Government of Nevada, \"Rancho Santa Monica Developments Inc.\", Business Entity Search (consulted on 6 June 2020).\n\n**Exhibit MG-0007**, Purchase Agreement between M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos and Rancho Santa Monica Developments Inc., 29 November 2004.\n\n352.\n\nIn 2015, Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander concluded a separation agreement establishing, *inter alia,* that the transfer of rights agreement dated 29 November 2004 was declared null and void. Also, the agreement specified that Ms. Gal\u00e1n \"[s]*hall transfer to Graham ('Mr. Alexander') via the Ejido Pino Su\u00e1rez and or the competent authority the portion of Parayso* [...] *property\"* (where Hotel Parayso was located).374\n\n**Exhibit C-0024**, Separation Agreement between M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n and Graham Alexander (Redacted), [REDACTED] \u00b6 11.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal will focus its analysis on three issues. First, whether Mr. Alexander possesses rights over a portion of Lot 10; second, whether he owns or controls Hotel Parayso; and third, whether Mr. Alexander has standing as he filed the claim on his own behalf.\n\n354.\n\nIn relation to the first issue, there is *prima facie* evidence that RSM owns the rights over a portion of Lot 10. The RSM Sole Director Resolution dated 21 September 20 1 5,375 establishing that the transfer of rights to RSM (Purchase Agreement between Rancho Santa Monica Developments Inc. and M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n Rios dated 29 November 2004)376 was declared null and void by Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander. The original agreement was signed by RSM and Ms. Gal\u00e1n and the resolution purportedly annulling the agreement is only signed by Mr. Alexander as president and director of RSM, but it was not signed by Ms. Gal\u00e1n.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0024**, Resolution of Rancho Santa Monica Development's Sole Director, 21 September 2015.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0007**. Purchase Agreement between M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos and Rancho Santa Monica Developments Inc., 29 November 2004.\n\n355.\n\nFurther, even if the document made the transfer of rights null and void, there is no evidence showing that Ms. Gal\u00e1n executed the Separation Agreement and actually transferred 50% of the ownership of the portion of Lot 10-Hotel Parayso to Mr. Alexander; therefore, there is no evidence to confirm that Mr. Alexander has any rights over said property.\n\n356.\n\nIn regards the second issue, under the separation agreement, it was agreed that all accounts from Hotel Parayso be re-registered in the name of RSM, all income generated by Hotel Parayso be deposited into the RSM bank account and that Mr. Alexander oversee the management of the hotel.\n\n357.\n\nAs Claimants argue, *\"Ms. Gal\u00e1n acquired assets in Respondent\u2019s territory including licenses, permits, contractual rights, and an Ejido Certificate of Possession. These assets constituted, among other things, an 'enterprise \u2019 and 'tangible and intangible \u2019 property for economic benefit under the NAFTA.\"377* The Tribunal observes that shortly after the separation agreement (October 2015), several licences and certificates (including the Construction Regularization License,378 a Land Use License,379 Authorization to the operation of the hotel and the restaurant,380 and Permanent Signage License381) were issued by the Urban Development Office to Ms. Gal\u00e1n. None of these documents presented Mr. Alexander as the owner or administrator of the fraction lot in question, nor Hotel Parayso. Thus, as all income and economic interests of Hotel Parayso were agreed to be under the RSM accounts, and every single certificate and license related to Hotel Parayso was issued in the name of Ms. Gal\u00e1n, there is no evidence that Mr. Alexander owned or controlled Hotel Parayso.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 186.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0014**, Construction Regularization License (Regularizaci\u00f3n de Obra) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 14 October 2015.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0015**, Land Use Certificate (Constancia de Uso de Suelo) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 14 October 2015.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0016**, Tulum Municipality Operating Licenses, 29 November 2010, and 19 August 2015 issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos.\n\n**Exhibit MG-0018**, Permanent Signage License (Licencia de Anuncio Permanente) issued to M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, 9 August 2010 \u2013 9 August 2011.\n\n358.\n\nThirdly, Respondent argues that there is *prima facie* evidence that the Parayso Investments are owned by RSM, a United States company that is not a claimant in this arbitration.382 Claimants challenge this position by arguing that even if RSM were the owner of the Parayso Investment, Ms. Gal\u00e1n and Mr. Alexander would still be investors who own or control the investment \"*directly or indirectly*\", and the NAFTA expressly protects these investments.383\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 263.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 64.\n\n359.\n\nAs it is expressly stated in the NAFTA, an investor may file a claim against the other Contracting Party on its own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise (Articles 1116 and 1117). To this Tribunal, the question is not whether Mr. Alexander had indirect control of RSM. Rather, this Tribunal considers that the issue rests in the fact that Mr. Alexander filed a claim as \"an investor on its own behalf\u2019 and not on behalf of RSM, which, as was previously explained, appears to be *prima facie* the owner of the rights of the Parayso Investment.\n\n360.\n\nAs it is well established in international law, a company is legally distinct from its shareholders. In this case, RSM is considered an independent legal entity with rights and its own assets. Thus, Mr. Alexander has no standing to pursue claims directly over the assets of RSM, as he filed the claim on his behalf.\n\n361.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal finds that all documents and licenses invoked by Mr. Alexander were in the name of Ms. Gal\u00e1n or at a given point in time, in the name of RSM, which is not a party to this arbitration. There is no document or other evidence that mentions Mr. Alexander as holder of the rights he now claims. Therefore, there is no evidence that Mr. Alexander is an investor of a qualified investment under the terms of NAFTA. Mr. Alexander could have invoked purported investments he made himself as the subject of his claim or investments made by RSM, a company in which he was a shareholder. But he did not. Even if RSM owned the rights, he filed a claim on his own behalf and not on behalf of RSM. Thus, the Tribunal finds that it does not have jurisdiction over Mr. Alexander\u2019s claims in the present arbitration.\n\n**VI. OTHER RELIEF**\n--------------------\n\n362.\n\nClaimants have, additionally, requested that the Tribunal order such other remedy that the Tribunal \"deems appropriate\". The Tribunal finds that it cannot entertain such claims for patent lack of specificity, let alone grant any relief thereunder.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n363.\n\nClaimants, collectively, and Respondent have requested that costs and fees be paid by the other side.\n\n364.\n\nClaimants have submitted the following claim for costs:384\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1. Total fees accrued by Partners | $ 2,709,032.75 |\n| 2. Total fees accrued by non-partner lawyers | $ 7,453,377.50 |\n| 3.

Other expenses (copies, delivery, etc.) | $ 38,729.90 |\n| Total | $12,051,604.98| |\n\nClaimants' Statement of Costs, p. 1.\n\n365.\n\nRespondent has submitted the following claims for costs:385\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ICSID Advances | ICSID | USD 400,000.00 |\n| External Consultant | Tereposky and De Rose, LLP | USD 603,955.00 |\n| Expert | OH Abogados, S.C. | USD 51,176.47 |\n| Total | USD 1,055,131.47 |\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs, p. 1.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs is governed by Articles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n367.\n\nFurther to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses and ICSID\u2019s administrative fee and direct expenses amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses |\n| Prof. Eduardo Zuleta | 215,000.00 |\n| Dr. Charles Poncet | 34,937.50 |\n| Mr. Christer Soderlund | 123,875.00 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative fees | 126,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | 84,207.10 |\n| **Total** | **584,019.60** |\n\n368.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.\n\n369.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:\n\n*1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.*\n\n*2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.*\n\n370.\n\nArticle 40(1) does not impose on the Tribunal the obligation to apply the principle of \"loser pays\" as regards costs of the arbitration, but rather sets a rule from which the Tribunal may depart at its discretion if it determines that a different apportionment is reasonable *\"taking into account the circumstances of the case!\"* As regards costs of legal representation and assistance, Article 40(2) grants the Tribunal ample discretion to reasonably apportion such costs considering the particular circumstance of the case.\n\n371.\n\nIn the present case, even though the Tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims, the Tribunal had to deal with sophisticated, complex and new legal issues alleged by Claimants. Moreover, in evaluating the facts and evidence presented, the Tribunal has found no procedural misconduct, frivolous claims, or abuses of the arbitral proceedings. On the contrary, the Parties behaved professionally and efficiently.\n\n372.\n\nBased on the above the Tribunal decides that Claimants, collectively, and Respondent bear in equal share the costs of the arbitration and that they bear their own legal and assistance costs expended in connection with this arbitration.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n373.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims filed by Claimants Mr. Carlos Esteban Sastre, Mr. Renaud Jacquet, Mr. Graham Alexander, Ms. M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n R\u00edos, Mr. Eduardo Nuno Vaz Osorio dos Santos Silva and Ms. Mar\u00eda Margarida Oliveira Azevedo de Abreu.\n\n(2) All other requests for relief are rejected.\n\n(3) Claimants and Respondent shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal share and each Claimant and Respondent shall bear their respective costs for legal and other assistance expended in connection with this arbitration.\n\nPlace of Arbitration: Washington, D.C., United States\n\nDate: 21 November 2022"}]}
