Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nII. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 26 September 2011, the Secretary General of the ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in\u00a0accordance with Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Di sputes between\u00a0States and Nationals of Other States [\"ICSID Convention'\"] and notified the parties that it had\u00a0been registered.\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proceedings were initiated based on the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal\u00a0Protection of Investments betw een the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands\u00a0[\u201cVenezuela-Netherlands BIT\u201d or the \u201cNetherlands - Venezuela BIT\u2019' or the \u201cBIT\u201d] signed on\u00a022 October 1991 and entering into force on 1 November 1993. to remain in force for fifteen years.\u00a0In relation to the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT, in its Request for Arbitration the Claimant stated that\u00a0on 30 April 2008, Venezuela presented a notice of termination, six months prior to the expiration\u00a0date of the BIT. Consequently, the Claimant argued that Article 14(3) of the BIT provides that \u201c[i]n\u00a0relation to the investments made prior to the termination date of this Agreement, the foregoing\u00a0Articles of the same shall remain in effect for an additional period of fifteen years from said date.\u201d\u00a0The Claimant concluded that the proceeding should be conducted based on the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT.\n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute a\u00a0Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for\u00a0the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings [the \u201cInstitution Rules.\u201d]\n9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that more than sixty (60) days had passed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration\u00a0without the parties having reached an agreement regarding how to constitute the Tribunal, the\u00a0Claimant invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention by letter of 15 December 2011.\n10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of the same date, the Claimant appointed as arbitrator Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna,\u00a0a Chilean national of the Republic of Chile.\n11. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 19 December 2011, Professor Onego Vicuna accepted his appointment as arbitrator in\u00a0these proceedings.\n12. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ninety (90) days having elapsed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration without the\u00a0Tribunal having been constituted, by letter of 28 December 2011, the Claimant requested that the\u00a0Chairman of the Administrative Council of the ICSID appoint the arbitrators w'ho had not yet been\u00a0appointed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 4 of\u00a0the Procedural Rules Applicable to ICSID Arbitration Proceedings [the \u201cArbitration Rules.\"]\n13. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 29 December 2011, Dr. Carlos Escarra Malave, Attorney General of the Republic,\u00a0acknowledged receipt of the Claimant's letter of 28 December 201 land stated that he was in the\nOI European Group B.V, v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB I 1/25\nAward\nprocess of engaging the services of a law firm and outside counsel for this matter and that he would proceed to appoint the corresponding arbitrator.\n14. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 11 January 2012, Venezuela communicated that Messrs Thomas Wilner. Christopher\u00a0M. Ryan. Jose Pertierra and Fernando Mantilla Serrano of the law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP,\u00a0in Washington. D.C., in addition to the Office of the Attorney General, via the Attorney General of\u00a0the Republic, Dr. Carlos Escarra Malave and Ana Maria de Stefano Lo Piano, would represent the\u00a0Respondent in this case.\n15. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 12 January 2012, the Respondent appointed Mr. Alexis Mourre. a French national, as\u00a0arbitrator.\n16. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 13 January 2012, Mr. Alexis Mourre accepted his appointment as arbitrator in these\u00a0proceedings.\n17. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 2 February\u2019 2012, the Respondent reported the death of Dr. Carlos Escarra Malave and\u00a0the appointment, on the same date, of the new Attorney General of the Republic. Dr. Cilia Flores.\u00a0In said letter and in view of the circumstances, the Respondent asked for these arbitration\u00a0proceedings to be postponed for two months so that Dr. Flores could familiarize herself with the\u00a0case and participate in Venezuela\u2019s defense.\n18. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 3 February 2012, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent's request, opposing\u00a0said postponement, since a) the Respondent had been being represented by outside counsel during\u00a0the proceeding, b) the outside counsel had sufficient authority to act on behalf of their client, c) the\u00a0new Attorney General had already been appointed, and d) the proceedings were still in the initial\u00a0stages.\n19. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By letter of 10 February\u2019 2012, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Respondent\u2019s request and the\u00a0Claimant\u2019s objections of 2 and 3 February 2012, respectively. The Centre informed the parties that\u00a0the Claimant had requested the appointment of the arbitrators that had not yet been appointed in\u00a0accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules,\u00a0and that it would move forward with said request in the next few days.\n20. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After consulting with the parties, and in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, and\u00a0Rule 4 of the Arbitration Rules, on 29 March 2012, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of\u00a0the ICSID appointed Professor Juan Fernandez-Armesto, a Spanish national, as the third Arbitrator\u00a0and President of the Tribunal. On 30 March 2012, Professor Fernandez-Armesto accepted his\u00a0appointment as arbitrator and President of the Tribunal.\n21. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 30 March 2012, the Secretary-General notified the parties under Rule 6(1) of the ICSID\u00a0Arbitration Rules, that the three arbitrators had accepted their respective appointments, and that the\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Claimant believes the Tribunal does in fact have jurisdiction to hear this\u00a0dispute, based on its having proven the existence of an investment pursuant to Article 1(a) of the\u00a0BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, Claimant submits that the Tribunal\u00a0must consider damage to Claimant's business outside of Venezuela as a background matter and,\u00a0accordingly, must dismiss the second jurisdictional objection put forward by Respondent.\n1. NONEXISTENCE OF THE INVESTMENT\nA. Respondent\u2019s position\n156. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its pleadings, Respondent has argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, claiming that the\u00a0requirement for an investment to exist has not been met under both Article 1(a) of the BIT and\u00a0A rticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Respondent claims that the term \u201cinvestment\u201d\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) has an inherent and objective meaning,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) requires that a contribution be made,\n(c) Article 1 of the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT does not negate the inherent and objective meaning of the term \u201cinvestment.\u201d\n157. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent further alleges that OIEG (d) has made no contribution whatsoever for its investment\u00a0and that (e) there is already a proceeding with the very same object, which prevents the Tribunal\u00a0from hearing this case.\na. The term \u201cinvestment\u201d has an inherent and objective meaning\n158. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent has argued throughout this proceeding that the term \u201cinvestment\u201d has an inherent and\u00a0objective meaning, both under Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB'11/25\nAward\nConvention,123 which meaning entails making a contribution.124\n159. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, this principle is also applicable to treaties\u2014such as the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT\u2014that contain a non-exhaustive definition of the term \u201cinvestment\" based on a\u00a0classification of assets.125 The expression \u201cevery kind of asset\u201d contained in Article 1(a) of the\u00a0BIT cannot include all conceivable investments, particularly if the object and purpose set forth in\u00a0the Preamble of the BIT is taken into consideration.126\n160. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent strongly opposes a literal reading of Article 1(a) of the BIT, which based on its\u00a0understanding Claimant relies on. as it asserts that it violates Article 31 of the Vienna Convention\u00a0on the Law of Treaties [\u201cVCLT\u201d].127 Respondent contends that Article 31(3) of the VCLT also\u00a0favors an objective and intrinsic interpretation of the term \u201cinvestment\u201d in Article 25 of the\u00a0ICSID Convention.128\n161. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent finds Claimant\u2019s arguments that would attempt to deny the existence of an objective\u00a0and intrinsic definition of the term \u201cinvestment\u201d to be irrelevant and flawed.129 The main\u00a0arguments Respondent relies on to refute Claimant\u2019s objections are noted in the paragraphs\u00a0below.\n162. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Respondent denies that the definition of investment set forth in the BIT determines the\u00a0scope of jurisdiction referred to under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,130 and advocates for\u00a0the application of the double keyhole test,1\u20191 aimed at determining\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether the activity in question is covered by the parties\u2019 agreement and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whether it meets the requirements of the ICSID Convention.132\n163. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Respondent submits that a literal interpretation of Article 1(a) of the BIT conflicts with\u00a0Article 31 of the VCLT, as it does not take into account the Preamble of the BIT, which\u00a0Respondent recognizes as its object and purpose, and therefore cannot be considered to be a\u00a0good-faith interpretation.133 Respondent insists that interpreting Article 1(a) of the BIT by\u00a0adhering to the current meaning that ought to be attributed to the term \u201cinvestment\u201d is the same as\n123 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RI, Sections ILB.1-11; RIH, para. 9 etseq.- RV, para. 30.\n124 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RIII, paras. 11-15; RV. para. 33.\n125 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rl. para. 23; Rill, paras. 58 and 74; RV, para. 31.\n126 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RI. paras. 20-25; RIII, para, 74; RV, para. 31.\n127 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RI, para. 25; RV. paras. 31 and 39-40.\n128 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, para. 32.\n120 RIII, paras. 16-30.\n130 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, para. 36.\n131 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ibid.\n132 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RI. para. 30.\n133 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, para. 40.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Respondent submits that what is truly important is not to determine whether ownership of\u00a0the assets constitutes an investment, per se, but whether in this case Claimant's merely passive\u00a0holding of shares, without having made a contribution, amounts to an investment.1 To support\u00a0its position. Respondent relies on several awards, and specifically on Malicorp}'\\*\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inherent and objective meaning of the term \u201cinvestment\u201d requires a\ncontribution as a sine qua non\n165. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent alleges that the inherent and objective meaning of the term \u201cinvestment\" requires a\u00a0contribution as a sine qua non, which Claimant did not, in its view. make. According to\u00a0Respondent, this fundamental principle has been confirmed by several tribunals in their analysis\u00a0of the Convention and bilateral investment treaties,139 regardless of whether they used the\u00a0intuitive or deductive method to define the concept of investment.140\n166. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent claims that Claimant has not met the sine qua non requiring a contribution and\u00a0therefore an investment does not exist, which in turn implies that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to\u00a0hear this dispute. Respondent recommends that the Tribunal take its lead from the decision in the\u00a0KT Asia case, which establishes that the lack of a contribution is enough for the tribunal to reject\u00a0jurisdiction over the dispute.141\nc. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 1 of the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT does not negate the inherent and\nob jective meaning of the term \u201cinvestment\u201d\n167. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent contends that Article 1 of the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT does not negate the\u00a0inherent and objective meaning of the term \"investment,\u2019' which requires that a contribution be\u00a0made as a sine qua non}42 Following the reasoning in the KT Asia aw-ard.

Claimant made an investment pursuant to Article 1(a) of the BIT\n177. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant asserts that Respondent's objections that OIEG did not make an \u201cinvestment\" because it\u00a0has not made a \u201ccontribution\" must be rejected:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, because they are not supported by the language of the BIT, and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0second, because case law does not require a shareholder to \u201cmake\u201d a \u201ccontribution,\u201d\u00a0given that Article 1(a) of the BIT considers that the rights derived from ownership of the\u00a0shares are an \u201cinvestment.'\u2019\n178. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant contends that an orthodox application of the principles governing the interpretation of\u00a0international treaties leaves no doubt that Claimant's investments in Venezuela are covered by\u00a0Article 1(a) of the BIT.1\u20194 In particular, Claimant argues that its investments constitute:155\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0assets in the form of shares in Old V and Favianca pursuant to the chapeau in Article 1 (a)\u00a0of the BIT,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the rights derived from ownership of such shares pursuant to Article l(a)(ii) of the BIT,\u00a0and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0its stake as a majority shareholder in the movable and immovable property of OldV and\u00a0Favianca under Article 1 (a)(i) of the BIT.\n179. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OIEG therefore contends that Respondent's attempt to distort the clear language and scope of\u00a0Article 1(a) must be rejected by the Tribunal.156\n180. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant asserts that current case law157 does not require a shareholder to \u201cmake\u201d a\u00a0\u201ccontribution\" in order for its investment to be valid under Article 1(a) of the BIT.158\n154 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CII, paras. 16 and 18; CIII, paras 26-28.\n155 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cll.para. 16.\n156 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CII, para. 17; CHI, para. 23.\n157 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CII, para. 20.

The Analysis of the Tribunal\n193. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its first objection, the Bolivarian Republic denies that the Claimant is the owner of a protected\u00a0investment in Venezuela. It submits that, in order for an investment to exist, it is not sufficient\u00a0that the shares be listed in Art. 1(a) of the BIT, but rather that it is essential that the investor have\u00a0made a contribution. OIEG never made a contribution of its own, since it acquired its interests in\u00a0the Companies in a corporate restructuring\u2014the only contribution was made by other companies\u00a0of the OI group, predecessors of OIEG; and the Claimant could not benefit from it/5\n194. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant holds the opposite view: it is the owner of shares that confer control over two large\u00a0glass-producing companies in Venezuela; the contribution exists and was made by the companies\u00a0of the OI Group from which it acquired the shares; and it is not necessary' that each successive\u00a0investment holder make a new contribution. \\* OIEG adds that, even assuming arguendo that the\u00a0opposite position were accepted, it would also have met the requirement; since it has reinvested\u00a0undistributed profits generated by the Companies and has assumed financial obligations of its\u00a0predecessor amounting to more than US$100 million.\n195. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to resolve this dispute, the Tribunal will first (a) establish the proven facts, then (b) set\u00a0out the law7, (c) define the concept of investment and, finally, (d) analyze the counter-arguments\u00a0of the Respondent.\na. Proven facts\n196. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The OI group\u2019s investment in Venezuela dates back to the middle of the 20th century : OldV was\u00a0organized in 1958 and Favianca in 1968.\nOldV\n197. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the organization of OldV in 1958, Owens Illinois of Panama S.A. contributed Bs.\u00a09,400 and acquired 94%.\u2019 \u201c Since then, OldV has been controlled continuously by companies of\u00a0the OI group and has been engaged very actively in business, operating a large plant for the\u00a0manufacture of glass.198 It is undisputed that, both at the time of its organization and on\u00a0subsequent occasions, companies of the OI group made the necessary contributions of capital, of\u00a0technology and of know-how to permit the development of its manufacturing and business\u00a0activities.\n198. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OIEG, the Claimant here, was founded in 1999 in Holland and from its creation until today has\u00a0been 100% owned by the OI group.

In 1973, OldV acquired an\u00a0interest in Favianca; and in 1982 it capitalized reserves until its interest reached 70%.199 Since\u00a0that time, Favianca has always been controlled by the OI Group, has engaged in the\u00a0manufacturing of glass containers and has been the recipient of multiple contributions of capital,\u00a0technology and know-how.\n201. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2002, Owens Illinois International B.V.\u2014the Dutch company holding the interest in OldV\u2014\u00a0also acquired a 32% interest in Favianca and did so in the same corporate transaction (the\u00a0liquidation of OIV Holding C.A.).\n202 Since 2002, the shares that are the subject of this litigation, the 73.97% of OldV and the 32% of Favianca, are controlled through a Dutch company of the OI group.200\nSimplification of the Dutch Structure\n203.

It happened, however, that the control was indirect, by way of a second\u00a0company, also Dutch, a 100%-owned subsidiary named Owen-Illinois International B.V.\n205. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In late 2005, OI made the decision to simplify the chain of ownership. To this end. it decided that\u00a0the 100%-owned subsidiary would be merged into its parent company. Thus, Owen-Illinois\u00a0International B.V. was terminated; and OIEG succeeded to direct ownership of the OldV and\u00a0Favianca shares (shares that it already controlled).\nReserves 2006-2009\n206. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the 2006-2009 fiscal years, OldV and Favianca continued their business activities in\u00a0Venezuela and generated significant earnings, distributing a portion in the form of dividends,\u00a0with the rest remaining in both companies as undistributed reserves. The Claimant has confirmed,\u00a0203 and the Respondent has not questioned, that the total amount of such additional reserves\u00a0created during those four fiscal years (reduced by dividends paid) reached nearly US$100 million,\u00a0of which approximately US$73 million corresponded to OIEG.b. Applicable law\n207. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investments protected by the BIT are defined in Article 1(a), wrhich states as follows:\n\u201cFor purposes of this Agreement:\na) The term \u201cinvestments\u201d shall include all types of assets, including without limitation:\n(I) Real and personal property, as well as any other rights in rem in all types of assets;\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rights arising from shares of stock., bonds and other forms of interest in companies and\u00a0joint ventures;\n(iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ownership interests in cash, other assets and any other benefit hav ing economic value;\n(iv) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rights in intellectual property', technical processes, goodwill, and know-how:\n(v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract, and\u00a0exploit natural resources.\u201d\n203 CI, paragraph 80.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB 11/25\nAward\n208. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BIT contains a very broad notion of \u201cinvestments\u201d: it defines them by reference to \u201call ty pes\u00a0of assets,\u201c and then offers a non-exhaustive list of certain classes of assets that in all events would\u00a0constitute investments.\n209. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both parties accept that the shares that the OI group held in OldV and Favianca are contemplated\u00a0in this list:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand they are \u201creal and personal property\u201d [protected by paragraph (i)] and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other they are \u201crights arising from shares of shock ... in companies\u201d [protected by\u00a0paragraph (ii)].204\n210. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prima facie it would appear thus indisputable that the shares of OldV and Favianca ought to be\u00a0considered as investments protected by the BIT. However, the difficulties arise from Article 25 of\u00a0the Convention, which mandates the following:\n\"The Centre's jurisdiction shall extend to disputes of a legal nature that arise directly from an investment between a Contracting State . . . and the citizen of another\u00a0Contracting State and which the parties have agreed in writing to submit to the Centre.\n211. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bolivarian Republic argues that the term \u201cinvestment,\u201d as it is used in Article 25 of the\u00a0Convention, has an intrinsic and objective meaning and that this meaning requires as a condition\u00a0sine qua non that the investor have made a contribution\u2014since Article 1 of the BIT did not, nor\u00a0can it, negate this requirement. On the contrary: the Republic argues that Article 1 of the BIT\u00a0even assumes the same intrinsic and objective definition of investment that emerges from Article\u00a025 of the Convention. In the instant case, the Respondent[sic] itself did not make any\u00a0contribution; it cannot benefit from the contributions made by its predecessors; and therefore it is\u00a0not the owner of a protected investment.\nc. The Concept of Investment\n212. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent's objection raises one of the quaestiones vexatae of investment arbitration: the\u00a0concept of the protected investment. And more precisely: what occurs when States include very\u00a0broad definitions of the concept of investment in their treaties and agree to have all disputes with\u00a0investors resolved through ICSID arbitration? How does this practice find a balance with the\u00a0requirement contained in Article 25 of the Convention, which restricts the Centre's jurisdiction to\u00a0\u201cany legal dispute\u201d that arises \u201cdirectly out of an investment\u201d?\n213. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This difficulty is exacerbated because the Convention does not include a definition of the concept\u00a0of investment. This was a decision made consciously by its drafters; a very generic definition w;as\u00a0included in the first version of the text (\u201cany contribution of money or other assets of economic\u00a0value for an indefinite period, or... not less than five years\u201d), but wras abandoned due to lack of\n204 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT. day 1, 85:3-6: CII, paragraph 78.\n205 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emphasis added by the Court\nOl European Group B.V, v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nagreement. Ultimately, the decision was made to leave the Convention totally devoid of any definition as to what one should understand by investment.206\n214. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties have argued at great length about the requirements of Article 25 of the Convention\u00a0and its relationship with Article 1 (a) of the BIT concerning the existence of an objective and\u00a0inherent concept of investment, about the need for the investor to have made a contribution, about\u00a0the characteristics such contribution must have and if it is enforceable for the investment or the\u00a0investor.\nDoes an objective and inherent concept of investment exist?\n215. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question to decide is whether a unique, objective and inherent concept of investment\u00a0exists.\n216. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the Bolivarian Republic that the concept of \u201cinvestment\u201d used in Article\u00a025(1) of the Convention does have an objective and inherent meaning.\"\" The Centre\u2019s\u00a0jurisdiction has certain limits that cannot be breached, that States cannot overstep. Disputes\u00a0submitted to ICSID arbitration must be legal in nature and must \u201carisfe] directly out of an\u00a0investment.\u201d States are given the latitude to define the concept of investment, but they cannot\u00a0distort it. They cannot make an investment dispute out of something that by all accounts lacks this\u00a0nature.\n217. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case the States have delimited the investments they wash to protect in Article 1(a) of the\u00a0BIT, and they have done so broadly, agreeing that the term \u201cinvestment\" shall comprise every\u00a0kind of asset, and then offering a non-exhaustive list of examples articulated around five\u00a0categories:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moveable and immoveable property,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investments in companies and joint-ventures,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Credit rights,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Industrial or intellectual property.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Government concessions.\n218. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not all assets, based on the simple fact that they are included in the non-exhaustive list of\u00a0examples, constitute an investment. Such assets must be a true investment in order to meet the\u00a0objective and inherent characteristic of all investments.208 To provide an example that will lend\n206 C. Schreuer, et alii, \u201cThe ICSID Convention,\" 2nd edition, p. 115; see also Ambiente Ufficio, para. 448, et seq.\u00a0RV, para. 32.\n208 The conclusion that the concept of investment has inherent and objective content is now commonly accepted by\u00a0case law: KT Asia, para. 165, Global Trading, para. 43; Quihorax, para. 214.\nO1 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARBT1/25\nAward\nclarity to the question: think about a citizen of a foreign country who is entitled to collect a pension. The pensioner's credit right could be understood as something that would fall under the\u00a0third category\u2019 of the assets mentioned in Article 1(a) of the BIT.209 However, the right to receive\u00a0a pension does not constitute an investment and accordingly should not be understood as being\u00a0included under the BIT'S scope of protection, or within the scope of jurisdiction of ICSID\u00a0arbitration, as defined by Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n219. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having set forth this conclusion, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant211\u2019 in that States enjoy wide\u00a0discretion to define which investments they wish to protect through a BIT and that Article 25(1)\u00a0of the Convention should not be subject to a restrictive interpretation. If two States have included\u00a0a certain asset within a list of investments, a tribunal should only exclude it if it fails to meet the\u00a0requirements of the objective and inherent concept of investment, if there is a compelling reason\u00a0to do so.211\n220. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This interpretation is reinforced by the way the historical negotiations leading up to the adoption\u00a0of the Convention in its current form took place. Although the negotiating parties failed to reach\u00a0an agreement on a definition of the concept of investment, the solution they chose was to omit it\u00a0from Article 25(1), and compensate for this liberal concession with the introduction of Article\u00a025(4), a provision that was absent in the first versions, and that allows States to restrict the\u00a0Centre's ratione materiae jurisdiction to certain financial transactions and assets through a simple\u00a0notice.21' The Bolivarian Republic has not availed itself of this option.2'\nDelimitation of the concept\n221. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What then, does that objective and inherent concept of the term \u201cinvestment\" entail?\n222. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An unequivocal answer is elusive given that \u201cinvestment\u201d is not a legal concept, but an economic\u00a0process that may encompass very diverse legal realities\u2014ranging from the ownership of property'\u00a0or a stock portfolio to control of a company, to a utilities concession agreement. The Law\u00a0provides for and has the capacity to define obligations, credit rights, legal transactions, securities,\u00a0contracts, ownership, possession-\u2014it is even able to delimit the concept of business. Yet the Law\u00a0is of little help in defining a complex and economic process such as carrying out an investment.214\u00a0All a legal scholar can aspire to do is establish a catalogue of characteristics that would prove\n209 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The category' includes, using the English version, which is clearer, \"title to other assets.\u201d\n210 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CII, para. 30.\n211 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See Ambiente Ufficio, para. 470; Inmaris, para. 130.\n212 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ambiente Ufficio, para. 452.\n2 But even the effects of that notice are relative insofar as they refer, in essence, to information on those matters about which the contracting State does not wish to negotiate the protection of an investor.\n214 Ambiente Ufficio. para. 427.\nOl European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nto be of some assistance in the task of discerning whether or not an asset, in a specific situation, fits within the economic category.215\n223. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is essential in this task to make a preliminary classification within the generic concept of\u00a0investment based on the asset chosen, as there is a paradigmatic and clearly varied category of\u00a0assets that leaves no room for doubt, while uncertainty remains with regard to the other types of\u00a0assets.\nTypes of assets\n224. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most common category of investments are in corporate assets, i.e., situations in which the\u00a0foreign investor is the corporate owner of an enterprise located in the receiving State (enterprise\u00a0should be interpreted as any organization having capital and labor that produces goods or services\u00a0to be placed on the market); this alternative, frequently referred to as direct investment, can be\u00a0formalized either by creating a branch office, or controlling a company created in the destination\u00a0country, which is the entity that in turn engages in the corporate activity.\n225 The second category is comprised of all other assets, those which do not give the investor any ownership of an enterprise in the destination country. Situations within this group can be highly\u00a0varied in nature. In investment case law, conflicts typically arise when the purported investor has\u00a0executed contracts with the receiving State\u2014for construction,216 services,217 supply of goods\u2014or\u00a0holds negotiable instruments issued by the State itself.218\nApplication to this case\n226. The first category, corporate assets, represents the paradigm of investors that deserve protection\u00a0and are unquestionably included under both the BIT and the Convention.\n15 There are different lists of characteristics ty pical of investments, like the one in Salini, para. 52, and the one in C.\nSchreuer, (vide: \u201cThe ICSID Convention,\u201d 2nd edition, p. 158). In a nutshell, the required characteristics are contribution, duration and risk (see Quiborax, para. 219). It is importanl to clarify that the required characteristics\u00a0are merely guidelines: it is possible for an asset to be an investment even when it does not meet all the\u00a0characteristics, and vice versa.\nIt is doubtful that the characteristics have the same meaning in different types of investment; thus, for instance, the risk in a corporate investment is the possibility of obtaining benefits or incurring losses, while in an investment in\u00a0public debt the risk is that the State will not pay\u2014by all accounts two very different uncertainties. And the\u00a0requirement of a contribution, as understood in a coiporate asset, makes little sense in other assets such as public\u00a0debt or corporate obligations.\nThe Salini test was designed to discern whether or not a construction contract constitutes an asset. Its usefulness in other situations is doubtful. For difficulties in applying the Salini test to public debt see Ambiente Ufficio, para. 482.\n' \u2018 Salini: Pantechniki.\n217 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SGS: MHS.\n218 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abaelat, Ambiente Ufficio.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARBI 1/25\nAward\n227. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the second paragraph of Article 1(a) of the BIT includes among the protected assets\u00a0\u2018\u2022shares.. .and other kinds of interests in companies.\u201d\n228. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And corporate assets also include, by their very nature, investments for purposes of Article 25(1)\u00a0of the Convention. The ICSID Convention was enacted precisely to promote and protect these\u00a0types of investments. The Preamble of the Convention invokes, as the first justification for the\u00a0Treaty, the need for \u201cinternational cooperation for economic development.\u201d The creation of a\u00a0local company by a foreign investor is precisely the most direct and immediate way to favor\u00a0economic development in the receiving State. The foreign investor contributes money, goods or\u00a0industry, creates an organization in the destination country, generates employment, pays taxes,\u00a0introduces goods or services to the local market\u2014all of which are wealth-creating activities.\nConclusion\n229. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 25(1) of the Convention defines those disputes that may gain access to ICSID arbitration\u00a0and does so by requiring that such disputes \u201caris[e] directly out of an investment.\u201d The concept of\u00a0investment utilized in that provision has an objective and inherent meaning that States cannot\u00a0distort by classify ing as investments those relationships that do not meet the necessary\u00a0requirements.\n230. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scope and characteristics of the objective and inherent concept of investment are open to\u00a0debate, and whether certain uncommon assets are part of this or not: it is legitimate to ask\u00a0whether a mere sales agreement, or the acquisition of a corporate obligation, or simply owning an\u00a0apartment for w eekend use meet the objective and inherent requirements in order to be considered\u00a0an investment.\n231. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same question cannot be posed with regard to corporate assets located in the destination\u00a0country , and especially if the foreign investor manages the company. The acquisition and holding\u00a0of this type of asset represents the quintessential investment, and, by nature, complies with the\u00a0objective and inherent requirements of an investment. Consequently, there is nothing preventing\u00a0two States that are negotiating a BIT and want to define the scope of protection from including\u00a0them in the assets protected. If they do so, as have the Bolivarian Republic and the Netherlands,\u00a0they cannot be deemed in any way to be distorting the concept of investment or violating Article\u00a025(1) of the Convention.\n232. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this arbitration, OIEG. through its controlling shares in OldV and Favianca, owns corporate\u00a0assets located in Venezuela, consisting of tw o large glass manufacturing plants, and has managed\u00a0these at least since 2002.' Assets such as these, expressly included in the list contained in the\u00a0BIT. also comply, by their very nature, with the requirements of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\u00a0The purpose and aim of the BIT and the Convention are to promote economic development and\u00a0wealth creation in the destination country. Corporate investments in which the foreign investor\n219 The OI group has been managing them since long before, but as the focus is only on OIEG, it did not acquire its\u00a0shares in the Companies until 2002.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\ncontributes money or goods to create or acquire a company, manages it with its own technology and maintains its ownership for a long period of time, are those that most clearly contribute so\u00a0that such purpose and aim may be achieved.\nd. Counterargument of the Bolivarian Republic\n233. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent alleges in contrast to this conclusion that OIEG has not made any contribution\u00a0whatsoever: it allegedly acquired the shares in the Venezuelan Companies through a restructuring\u00a0completed in 2005, to which no contribution was made, and has failed to make any contribution\u00a0since that date.\n234. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not share this view.\n235. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of a contribution by the foreign investor in the form of a monetary contribution,\u00a0goods or industry, constitutes one of the characteristics that, as a general rule, assets must meet in\u00a0order to be classified as investments.220 The Tribunal is willing to accept that in a case such as\u00a0this one, in which OIEG claims to be the owner of corporate assets in Venezuela, this requirement\u00a0could be relevant: the ownership of corporate assets in the destination country requires the foreign\u00a0investor to have made some contribution, at least at the very beginning, when the company\u00a0started operating or made the acquisition.\n236. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet the Tribunal harbors no doubt that OIEG, hie et nunc, has more than complied with that\u00a0requirement.\nCash Contribution\n237. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most common way for a foreign investor to contribute to the company in the destination\u00a0country is by means of a cash contribution.\n238. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is indisputable that the Ol group, from the formation of the Companies in the last century, has\u00a0made several cash contributions. It would thus seem that the requirement is met.\n239. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bolivarian Republic, however, argues that OIEG, which has separate legal status and Dutch\u00a0citizenship, and invokes it to benefit from the BIT, may not benefit from the contributions made\u00a0by other companies in the group, which lack those characteristics, before OIEG became the\u00a0owner of the shares.221\n240. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not necessary for the Tribunal to address this argument brought by the Respondent, since\u00a0even if it accepted for the sake of argument that the contributions made by previous owners do\u00a0not qualify (a matter that the Tribunal does not address), it is a fact that OIEG has also made its\n220 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For certain assets, such as the acquisition on a secondary market of negotiable instruments, it is arguable as to\u00a0whether there is a true contribution.\n221 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RIH, para. 103.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nown cash contributions after its acquisition of the Venezuelan Companies.\n241. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, during fiscal years 2006-2009 OTEG has provided cash to the companies, when it did not\u00a0withdraw part of the profits generated, and allowed them to be kept as reserves. The total amount\u00a0retained (excluding the dividends paid to shareholders) amounts to almost USD 100 million, of\u00a0which USD 73 million correspond to OIEG. When a shareholder decides not to collect profits in\u00a0full, but to leave them\u2014in whole or in part\u2014with the company, it is waiving a right and making a\u00a0contribution of cash to the company, which is enriched to the extent of the amount that the\u00a0shareholder relinquished.\n242. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the funds provided by the foreign investor to Venezuelan Companies would have\u00a0been generated in the destination country itself. But this is irrelevant:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0first, because there is no requirement that the funds be of foreign origin:2\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and also, because the investor could have repatriated the dividends, since the BIT grants it the\u00a0right to do so, in order to immediately reinvest them in the company; all that has happened is\u00a0that both cash flows have been compensated.\n243. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent also raises one last argument: OIEG could not have made a contribution by\u00a0means of its own inaction\u2014that is, by not withdrawing the profits generated in the form of\u00a0dividends.22 \u2019\n244, The argument is not persuasive: it is not true that the investor has remained inactive. The creation\u00a0of a reserve requires an agreement of the company\u2019s governing bodies, controlled by the OIEG,\u00a0in which it decides to distribute only part of the profits, and apply the rest to reserves.\nContribution of Effort\n245. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, OIEG has been making, since becoming the owner of the investment, a contribution\u00a0in the form of effort: the management of Venezuelan Companies. This is not an insignificant\u00a0contribution, since one of the main goals that is sought with foreign investment is to improve the\u00a0management skills of domestic companies.\n246. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, OIEG has been managing OldV and Favianca since 2002. first indirectly through its\u00a0subsidiary Owens Illinois International B.V., and directly since 2005. This management activity\u00a0has been made by participating and voting in shareholders\u2019 meetings, and appointing directors\u00a0and managers of the Companies. The results have been very successful: under the management\n222 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C.

This contribution has\u00a0been reflected in its own efforts in managing the Companies and in a cash contribution, which\u00a0exceeds USD 73 million.\ne. Coda\n248. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are situations in which a foreign investor, although it is the owner of a protected\u00a0investment, does not enjoy the protection of the corresponding treaty . This happens in cases in\u00a0which the investor has not acted in good faith, has engaged in abuse of rights, has fraudulently\u00a0benefited from a corporate structure, or is only the formal owner of the investment but has made\u00a0no investment.\n249. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent does not allege that the Claimant has not acted in good faith, has engaged in\u00a0abuse of rights, or has fraudulently benefited from a corporate structure. In addition, the Tribunal\u00a0does not see evidence that these situations could have occurred.\n250. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent, however, has made a special reference to an award in which the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal would have established that a lack of contribution is sufficient to deny the existence of\u00a0investment and its own jurisdiction: KT Asia. Actually, that case can be clearly distinguished\u00a0from this case.\nKT Asia\n251. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts in KT Asia are the following:\nMr. Ablyazov w-as the ultimate owner of multiple companies through trustees and straw men, who were the ones who formally claimed to be the ow ners of the securities. These\u00a0persons acted on behalf of Mr. Ablyazov, but kept this situation secret, Mr. Ablyazov\u00a0himself was never formally a shareholder in any of the companies, and, therefore, a group\u00a0of companies never existed. The claimant, KT Asia, had acquired the shares of BTA (the\u00a0company that was the object of the alleged expropriation) from two other companies\u00a0controlled by Mr. Ablyazov for a nominal price, w'hich it never actually paid. KT Asia\u00a0never injected capital or made any contribution for the benefit of BTA, neither during the\u00a0acquisition nor afterward.\n252. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on those facts, the tribunal in KT Asia held that the claimant had not made any contribution\u00a0in connection with the alleged investment, and that it had neither the capacity nor the intention of\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\ndoing so in the future. Therefore, the tribunal ruled that there was no investment for purposes of article 25(1) of the Convention.\"4\n253. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AT Asia is part of a long list of cases in which the tribunals rejected the claimants\u2019 standing to\u00a0sue, because they had only disbursed a nominal value for the investment, which showed that they\u00a0were mere trustees, straw men, or intermediaries.'\n254. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This factual situation bears no relation to the one in this arbitration. In this case, the Claimant\u00a0belongs to a group of companies that historically has made important contributions to the\u00a0Venezuelan Companies; it has legitimately acquired shares during the liquidation of a Venezuelan\u00a0holding company belonging to the group, and since then it has managed the Companies and made\u00a0significant contributions of capital when it reinvested a significant portion of the dividends\u00a0generated.\nMobil\n255. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the nucleus of fact of this dispute is more similar to the one in Mobil, a case in which the\u00a0claimant decided to restructure in order to incorporate a Dutch company into the chain of\u00a0ownership and benefit from the BIT between the Netherlands and Venezuela. The Bolivarian\u00a0Republic raised a jurisdictional defense, arguing that the restructuring implied an abuse of rights;\u00a0the tribunal rejected it with regard to the disputes arising after the taking of control. In its\u00a0argument, the tribunal stated the following:\n\u201c190. It thus appears to the Tribunal that the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan\u00a0measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT, This choice was considered as \u201clogical, \u201d taking into account\u00a0the double taxation agreements concluded by the Netherlands and the\u00a0activities that Exxon Mobil already had in that country.\n191. Such restructuring could be \u201clegitimate corporate planning\u201d as contended by the Claimants or an \u201cabuse of right\u201d as submitted by the\u00a0Respondents. It depends upon the circumstances in which it happened. \u201d 226\n256. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the specific circumstances of that case, the tribunal held that the restructuring performed by\u00a0Mobil actually constituted \u201clegitimate corporate planning. \u2018\n224 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0KT Asia, para. 206.\n225 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phoenix, para. 119; Caratube, par. 435; Quiborax, para. 232; Saba, paras. 121 and 147.\n226 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mobil, para. 190-191.\n' See also Saluka, paras. 229 and 230.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

CONCLUSION\n268. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, the Tribunal rejects the two jurisdictional defenses raised by Venezuela, and rules\u00a0that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal itself has jurisdiction to hear all the issues raised\u00a0in this proceeding and rule on the substance of the dispute.\n240 Procedural Ruling No. 1: \u201c29.

The rejection in limine of Plaintiff s claim for harm suffered outside\u00a0Venezuela would imply a possible risk of prejudging, since the Tribunal would be deciding matters before the\u00a0parties had the opportunity to fully address them.\u201d [The Tribunal's translation]\nOI European Group B.V. v.

BREACH OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE BIT: UNLAWFUL EXPROPRIATION\n277. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The main cause of action of Claimant is the fact that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, through\u00a0the actions and omissions of its government entities, has unlawfully expropriated the Claimant's\u00a0investment in violation of Article 6 of the BIT. Respondent, in turn, denies the unlaw'fulness of the\u00a0expropriation and argues that it was conducted in compliance with international Law.\n2.1. Claimant\u2019s Position\n278. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant argues that the expropriation conducted by Respondent is unlawful as it does not comply\u00a0with the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT and, thus, it is entitled to be \u201cfully compensated\" for\u00a0its investment.241 Claimant specifically argues that: (i) the expropriation was not in the public\u00a0interest; (ii) the expropriation was arbitrary, contrary' to Venezuelan Administrative Law' and\u00a0violated the Companies' right to due process of law; (lit) the expropriation was discriminatory in\u00a0nature, and (iv) Respondent has not paid any form of compensation.\n(i) The expropriation was not in the public interest\n279. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant considers it demonstrated that the expropriation was not conducted in the defense of a\u00a0\u201cgenuine public interest\" according to the standard set in ADC.242 President Chavez selected\u00a0Claimant because of its foreign nationality.243 In addition. Claimant suggests that the true\u00a0motivation for the expropriation was a desire to cause damage to Polar, the largest private company\u00a0in Venezuela and minority shareholder and main customer of the Companies.244\n280. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Expropriation Decree and the accusations of noncompliance with environmental, labor and\u00a0jurisdiction laws were nothing but a \u201cconvenient device\u2019\u2019245 to dispossess OIEG of its\u00a0Companies246\u2014since prior to the expropriation, the authorities had never made any accusation\u00a0against the Companies.\n281. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, Claimant assures that the manifest incoherence of the diverse justifications offered by\u00a0Venezuela for the expropriation\u2014in the President\u2019s words, the alleged contraventions of\n241 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, paras. 158-172; CIV, paras. 160-264; CV, para. 110.\n242 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI. para. 158. citing ADC, para. 432.\n243 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para. 28.\n244 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, paras. 161 and 162.\n245 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Term used by the arbitral tribunal in the Siemens case, para. 273.

Namely,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation to give investors sufficient notice;252\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investors\u2019 right to be heard before the State implemented the expropriation order;253\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to be informed of precisely which assets are being expropriated;254\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to know the implementation plan for the expropriation order.255\n284. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant argues that it does not need to prove the fact that the expropriation violated Venezuelan\u00a0Law to demonstrate that Respondent violated Article 6 of the BIT.256 However, it considers that the\u00a0violation by the Republic of its own Law clearly shows that Venezuela acted arbitrarily or without\u00a0complying with due process of law.2 '7 Claimant refers to three types of violations of domestic Law\u00a0by the Republic:\n247 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, para. 160; CV, para. 29.\n248 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para. 63.\n249 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para. 65; HT, day 4,14:34-36.\n250 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para. 66: HT, day 4,15:2-4.\n251 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, paras. 63 and 64.\n252 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI. paras. 165-167.\n253 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, para. 165.\n254 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, paras. 36-44.\n255 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 238; CV, paras. 45-52.\n256\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Thus, it considers that the decision entered\u00a0in Conoco Phillips is applicable to this dispute. In that case\u2014based on the same BIT as this\u00a0dispute\u2014the Tribunal decided that Venezuela had violated the compensation requirement under\u00a0Article 6(c) of the BIT, as it did not negotiate the compensation with Claimants based on the fair\u00a0market price of the expropriated investments. 8\n294. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OIEG considers that it has been demonstrated that the expropriation procedure has made no\u00a0progress because Respondent failed to comply with the basic procedural requirements to move the\u00a0procedure forward? 9\n295. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover.

Further, Respondent holds that the occupation of the Plants was performed in accordance with\nVenezuelan Law and rejects all allegations to the contrary, based on the following arguments:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to what Claimant says. Venezuelan Law al low's for the occupation of expropriated\u00a0property without court authorization;308 in fact, Article 6(4) of the INDEPABIS Law requires\u00a0no court authorization in order to occupy expropriated assets;309 thus, INDEPABIS was\u00a0entitled to occupy the Plants since the Expropriation Decree w as published;310\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INDEPABIS w\u2019as entitled to decide whether to conduct the occupation under Article 6(4) or\u00a0do so under Article 112(1) of the INDEPABIS Law indistinctly;311 it chose to carry out the\u00a0occupation under Article 112 because there was an objective risk of dismantlement or\u00a0production stoppage;312\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The occupation did not violate Article 4 of the Expropriation Decree, since that Article does\u00a0not require occupation to be conducted pursuant to Article 56 of the Expropriation Law but\u00a0simply contemplates that possibility ;313\n304\n305\n306\n307\n308\n309\n310\n311\n312\n313\nRV, paras. 138-150.

This can be seen (applying Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties)\u00a0from the very text of the BIT. which adds the adjective \"any\u201d to the noun to emphasize its broad\u00a0scope. Consequently, it encompasses all types of administrative, legislative or judicial acts\u00a0performed by any of the branches of government of the Bolivarian Republic (or by any other\u00a0entity for whose acts the Republic is liable in accordance with International law), and prohibits\u00a0such acts from resulting in an expropriation, nationalization or equivalent measures.\n325. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BIT does not define the terms \u201cexpropriation,\u201d \u201cnationalization,\u201d or \"equivalent measure\u201d\u00a0and this gap must be filled in based on the principles of International Law.\nExpropriation\n326. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExpropriation\u201d consists of the State, in exercise of its sovereign powers, dispossessing an\u00a0investor protected by the Treaty, depriving it of the control or the ownership of a protected\u00a0investment. Dispossession means that the investor suffers the loss of the use and enjoyment (and\u00a0sometimes also the ownership) of the investment. Thus, the definition in the BIT centers on the\u00a0investor, not on the State. It does not require that the dispossession of the investor result in an\u00a0appropriation in benefit of the State. However, in most cases, the investor\u2019s loss will lead to the\u00a0reciprocal gain of a public entity, which will facilitate the classification of the action as\u00a0expropriatorv. The definition in the Treaty- also does not require that the intent to dispossess exist.\n3 4 Emphasis added.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n327. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investment and investor are defined terms in the BIT and the Tribunal has concluded that\u00a0Claimant is an investor for the purposes of the Treaty and that it is the owners of a protected\u00a0investment materialized in the Plants.335\nNationalization\n328. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNationalization\" is a term similar to expropriation, with the addition that it frequently involves\u00a0complete sectors of the economy and that the State normally assumes ownership of the\u00a0investment it has taken from the investor.336\nEquivalent measures\n329. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third term used by Article 6 of the BIT is \u201cmeasures with an equivalent effect.\" The\u00a0circumlocution covers what is usually known as regulatory or indirect expropriation. These are\u00a0legislative or administrative acts adopted by State, normally in exercise of its regulatory or\u00a0policy-making powers, but which translate into a significant interference in the use and\u00a0enjoyment of an investment, not necessarily going so far as to deprive the investor of the\u00a0ownership and control of its investment.\nExceptions\n330. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition on adopting expropriatory, nationalization or equivalent measures is not absolute.\u00a0The BIT allows them, provided three conditions are met (and the appropriate compensation is\u00a0also paid):\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are for reasons of public interest;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are not discriminatory; and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are adopted in accordance with \u201cdue process of law.\u201d\n331. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A legitimate expropriation additionally requires the payment of a \u201cfair\u201d compensation that:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must represent the market value of the expropriated investment;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time \u201cjust before the measures are taken or the imminent measures are made public\u00a0knowdedge, whichever occurs first;\u201d\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cshall include interest at a normal commercial rate up to the payment date;\u201d and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cshall be paid and made transferable without undue delay;\u201d\n5 See paragraph 158 supra.\n336 In practice, the term nationalization is usually reserved for the expropriation of natural resources or industrial\u00a0sectors in benefit of the State or a government entity: see Brownlie: \u201cPrinciples of Public International Law, 7th Ed\u00a0(2008), p. 532.\n01 European Group B.V. v.

Proven facts\n332. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant proven facts for determining whether an expropriation took place are the following\n(a more extensive explanation is found in paragraphs 85 to 153 above):\n333. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) On the evening of 25 October 2010, President Chavez made a televised speech announcing the\u00a0immediate expropriation of the Venezuelan companies owned by Owens-Illinois. This was the\u00a0first news that the Bolivarian Republic intended to expropriate the Companies.\nThe Expropriation Decree\n334. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) The next day, 26 October 2010. the Bolivarian Republic enacted the Expropriation Decree,\u00a0formalizing, on an urgent basis, the forced acquisition of:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the properties owned by OldV,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the OldV and Favianca Plants, including the movable property belonging to or found in\u00a0those plants;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the means of transportation used in the OldV process that were necessary for executing its\u00a0work and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any other tangible goods belonging to OldV that were needed to execute purpose of the\u00a0project \u201cstrengthening of the public sector industrial capacity in the manufacture of glass\u00a0containers for the Venezuelan people\u2019\u2019 [\u201cGlass Strengthening Project\u201d]337\n335. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Expropriation Decree, the expropriated goods became part of the Republic\u2019s\u00a0assets through the MINOT, pursuant to Art. 11 of the LECUPS.338\nThe preventive occupation measure ordered bv INDEPABIS\n336. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iii) The next day, 27 October 2010, INDEPAB1S (the Venezuelan Consumer Protection\nAgency), went to the Valera plant owned by Favianca to \u201ccarry out the preventive temporary occupation measure\u201d under Articles 111 and 112 of the INDEPABIS Law.339 One day later, it\u00a0appointed the management board that it entrusted with the management of the company.340\n337 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expropriation Decree, Art. 4, Exhibit C-24.\n338 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expropriation Decree, Art. 2, Exhibit C-24\n330 INDEPABIS Act of 27 October 2010.

On 29\u00a0October 2010,INDEPABIS went to this factory in order to conduct an audit.341 After determining\u00a0purported violations of the INDEPAB1S Law, INDEPABIS ordered a \u201cpreventive temporary\u00a0occupation and operation measure for a term of ninety (90) days [\u2014]\u201d and created a temporary\u00a0management board.342\n338. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The result of the acts ordered by INDEPABIS was that, effective 29 October 2010, the Bolivarian\u00a0Republic took phy sical possession of the Valera and Los Guayos Plants and exercised effective\u00a0control over them.\nThe provisional remedy ordered by of the First Administrative Court\n339. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(v) Several weeks later, on 18 November 2010, the Office of the Attorney General filed a petition\u00a0with The First Administrative Court for an unnamed provisional remedy consisting of the\u00a0occupation, possession and use of the movable and immovable properties and improvements\u00a0presumably owned by OldV and Favianca.343 The petition was based on the injunctive power of\u00a0the Administrative Law judge and the urgency of implementing the Glass Strengthening\u00a0Project.344 On 20 December 2010, without allowing Claimant a hearing, the Court:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ordered the requested provisional remedy and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorized the creation of an ad hoc management board, appointed by MINCIT, to\u00a0manage, organize and control the Companies.345\nThis provisional remedy was subsequently joined to the expropriation proceedings,346 and came to be the instrumental occupation measure in those proceedings.\n340. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(vi) Three months later, on 11 March 201 1,34 the MINCIT effectively created the Management\u00a0Board.

Respondent asserts that the Tribunal must grant greater deference to the definition\u00a0that the Republic has made of its public interest 379 and explains that the expropriation was carried\u00a0out to protect basic constitutional principles38\" and in defense of two well-known and longstanding policies of public interest: food security381 and endogenous development.38' which the\u00a0Republic has been implementing since 2001\u201d and 2007,384 respectively.\nThe Tribunal's opinion\n368. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine whether the expropriation wras actually carried out for reasons of public\u00a0interest, we must analyze how the Expropriation Decree itself justifies the decision. The decree\u00a0defines its objective as a project that it refers to with the name \u201cstrengthening of the public\u00a0sector\u2019s industrial capacity in the fabrication of glass containers for the Venezuelan people,\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0establishes the grounds for the administration's actions in its \u2018whereas clauses' as follows:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national sector dedicated to the production and marketing of glass containers is a\u00a0priority within the economic policy of endogenous development promoted by the National\u00a0government in order to create jobs and guarantee a proper level of welfare for the\u00a0population;385\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 1NDEPAB1S Law declares all the assets needed to engage in the production,\u00a0manufacture, import, storage, transportation, distribution and marketing of goods and\u00a0services to be of public utility and social interest.386\n369. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These two \u2018whereas clauses' allow Respondent to assert that the expropriation was carried out in\u00a0defense of well-known and longstanding policies of public interest: endogenous development38\u00a0and food security .\u201988\n370. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal partially shares Respondent's position.

From that perspective, the\u00a0economic policy of promoting endogenous development may be associated with the requirement of\u00a0public interest established in Art. 6 of the BIT.\nFood Security\n373. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Food security is supported in Art. 305 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\u00a0which deems it as\n\u201c...sufficient and stable availability of food throughout the nation and timely and permanent access to it by consumers. Food safety will be reached by developing and\u00a0favoring internal agricultural production, understanding this to be produce obtained from\u00a0agricultural, livestock, fishing and aquatic activities. Food production is of national interest\u00a0and fundamental for the economic and social development of the Nation For these\u00a0purposes, the State will decree the financial, commercial, technology transfer, land holding,\u00a0infrastructure, training, and other measures necessary to reach strategic levels of selfsupply.

What there is no evidence of is that the Companies abused their dominant\u00a0position\u2014which is the only offense penalized by anti-trust regulations.\n381. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, even if the Companies had a dominant position, this w-ould never justify such an\u00a0extreme measure as expropriation: experts for both Parties agree in that the expropriation could not\u00a0be carried out exclusively to remedy an alleged position of dominance on the part of the\u00a0Claimant.401\n382. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, it is very significant that Venezuelan authorities who defend free competition have not\u00a0investigated the accusation contained in Whereas Five of the Expropriation Decree and that tliere is\u00a0no resolution that supports it.\n383. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, the Tribunal deems that the Respondent has not proven that the alleged position of\u00a0dominance of the Companies in the Venezuelan glass market can be considered a factor of public\u00a0interest that justifies the expropriation.\n384. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary , the Tribunal finds that the Republic nationalized the Claimant's investment in an\u00a0attempt to favor endogenous development, w-hich allows it to consider the requirement of \u201cpublic\u00a0interest\" established in Art. 6 of the BIT to have been met.\nb. The expropriation was carried out in compliance with due legal process\n383. Art. 6(a) of the BIT requires that in order for an expropriation to be considered legitimate, it must be adopted\n\u201cin accordance with due legal process.\u201d\n386, The Claimant asserts that by carrying out the expropriation, Venezuela has not only violated the\u00a0international standard of due process, but has also violated its domestic law, which would constitute\u00a0a prima facie violation of due process.402 For its part, Venezuela asserts that a simple\n390 CV, Par. 65; HT, Day 4.14:34-36.\n400 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, Par. 63 and 64.\n401 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Report by Jesus Eduardo Cabrera Romero, expert witness for the Respondent, issued on 26 August 2013, Par. 97\u00a0| from here on. \u201cCabrera\u201d]; Hernandez, Par. 12 and 14.\n402 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para. 117\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nviolation of domestic law is not sufficient to trigger a breach of art. 6(a) of the BIT.403\n387. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike other Treaties,404 which expressly require the expropriation proceeding to be carried out in\u00a0accordance with the domestic law of the expropriating State, Art. 6(a) of the Venezuela\u2014\u00a0Netherlands BIT does not do so. The article does not refer specifically to the regulations of the\u00a0expropriating State, but to due process405 in general, a generic concept which must be interpreted\u00a0in accordance with the requirements of international Law; it is this minimum regulatoiy standard\u00a0commonly accepted in all States under the rule of law which guarantees the subject that any\u00a0decision affecting it will be adopted after having gone through a fair and equitable process.406\n388. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in the matter of expropriation the Court must limit itself to analyzing whether\u00a0Venezuela has satisfied the requirement of due process, as it is understood in international Law,\u00a0without making an evaluation of non-compliance with internal Venezuelan Law. (The allegations\u00a0of the Complainant regarding non-compliance with the LECUPS with respect to the unlawful\u00a0execution of the Decree of Expropriation and with respect to the irregular occupation of the\u00a0Plants may constitute violations of the standard of fair and equitable treatment and will be\u00a0analyzed in the next Chapter).\n389. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Complainant has identified four possible violations of due process:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lack of prior notification:40\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to be heard prior to the expropriation;408\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The inaccurate identification of the property expropriated;409 and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lack of knowledge of the expropriation measure implementation plan.4'0\u00a0Notification, right to be heard, implementation plan\n390. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Complainant asserts that prior to the expropriation of the Plants the Republic never advised\u00a0the Companies with respect to the alleged violations of environmental, labor or free competition\n403 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, para. 172\n404 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A.

For those same reasons,\u00a0international Law cannot recognize an absolute right to the investor to be heard and make\u00a0allegations prior to the State executing the expropriation measure or to know the execution plan\u00a0to be adopted.\n392. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requirements of international Law' with respect to due process in the expropriation of\u00a0property owned by foreigners falls more within a grey area: they do not require ex ante\u00a0notification, but rather the possibility of being able to resort ex post to an independent authority.\u00a0What is essential is that the decision adopted by the expropriating State can be reviewed\u00a0subsequently by' a legal Authority w'hich does not belong to the Executive Branch. And, In\u00a0Venezuelan Law, this requirement is satisfied: the LECUPS is a modem and protective law which\u00a0affords legal protection to the expropriated party, and which permits the Judge to review the\u00a0administrative expropriation action and determine the valuation owed to the expropriated party\u00a0due to its loss of equity.414\n393. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the decision of the Republic to order the expropriation of\u00a0the Plants by means of the ex-parte enactment of the Expropriation decree, which was issued\u00a0under the LECUPS, in itself is compatible with the requirement of BIT article 6(a), that the\u00a0decision has been taken\n\"\u2018in accordance with due legal process.\u201d\n394. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether the Republic met or failed to meet the due process requirements pursuant to the LECUPS\u00a0[Law' for Expropriation for Public or Social Interest] is another matter. Failure to meet said\u00a0requirements could constitute a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard guaranteed by\u00a0the BIT, a matter we shall discuss in the following Chapter.\nCertainty regarding, the object of the expropriation\n395. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant also argues that an essential component of due process, required by international\u00a0Law. is that the party whose property' is expropriated must know', with certainty, which assets the\u00a0State is forcibly acquiring.

However, paragraph a) of\u00a0the same article includes the Valera Plant among the property expropriated, which w'as not part of\u00a0the OldV's property', but rather was owned by an independent company, Favianca. (OldV merely\u00a0held a minority interest in Favianca).\n398. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover. Art. 1 in fine of the Decree includes an extensive clause that expropriates the following:\n\u201c[a]ny other tangible assets that form a part of the commercial company Owens Illinois de Venezuela. C.A. that are necessary to achieve the purpose of the work,\u00a0which is the \u00abReinforcement of the public sector's industrial capacity' for the\u00a0production of glass containers)/\\*415\n399. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant\u2019s legal expert in that the definition of the assets expropriated\u00a0in Article 1 of the Decree is ambiguous, excessively broad and leaves it entirely unclear whether\u00a0the property expropriated covers the property of OldV alone, or whether the company as a whole is\u00a0being expropriated, including its assets and liabilities.\n400. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The imprecise language of the Decree prevented the Claimant from knowing precisely which of its\u00a0assets would be expropriated, and as such, violated its right to due process. This concern is also\u00a0shared by the Respondent\u2019s expert.416\n415 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expropriation Decree Art. 1 in fine.\n416 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Cabrera stated: (HT, day 4, 81:4-16): \u2018\u2019PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL: But with the liabilities, if you\u00a0think, you believe that Owens' liabilities, OldV doesn't have to pay the liabilities, it doesn\u2019t have to pay them. The\u00a0liabil ities, I am unclear about the liabilities. If the liabilities are part of the expropriation, or they go, as Mr, Moore\u00a0said, with the goodwill, and it is actually the company including alt of its assets and liabilities that is being\u00a0expropriated. Do you see my confusion?\nA. [Sr. Cabrera]. Yes, yes, I\u2019m confused by the same thing. Because if I go by the Expropriation Decree, this is a collection of property that constitute a company, and said company is going to continue to operate with this\u00a0property, and that's why a board of directors was appointed. Now\u2019, at no time does it take into account the assets or\u00a0liabilities of the original owner of the property which still exists, which would be Owens. And in reality I cannot\u00a0answer that question.\u201d\nIn response to the President of the Tribunal's question with regard to what had been expropriated, Mr. Hernandez responded (Spanish Record, day 4. 50:27-31): \u201cWell, I admit that when I drafted my report that w as one of the most\u00a0difficult matters to understand, because it was never clear, in my opinion, what exactly was being expropriated.\u00a0Article 1 of the Expropriation Decree talks about Owens Illinois de Venezuela. But later when it lists the property to\u00a0be expropriated, it includes property owned by a company, Favianca, that isn't listed in the first Decree.\u201d\nOl European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n401. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The uncertainty regarding exactly which property was being expropriated persisted throughout the\u00a0expropriation process. The application for advance provisional remedy filed by the Attorney\u00a0General listed companies and offices417 among the tangible assets owned by OldV that do not\u00a0appear on the Expropriation Decree and in the prayer for relief requested the seizure of all the\u00a0property of the Companies and \u201ctheir subsidiaries.\u201d418 The decision of the First Administrative\u00a0Court to grant the provisional remedy consisting of said seizure, compounded the error by ordering\u00a0the seizure of property that was not listed in the Expropriation Decree.419\n402. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, despite the fact that the Expropriation Decree only lists certain property and\u00a0improvements, the Respondent actually expropriated the manufacturing and business activity in\u00a0which both companies owned by OIEG were engaging in Venezuela.

Discrimination requires more than\u00a0different treatment. In order for it to exist, similar cases must be treated differently without\u00a0justification.428\n406. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant argues that it was expropriated because it was an investment owned by U.S.\u00a0nationals, but merely states some presumptions in defense of its theory, which cannot be considered\u00a0sound proof of its argument:\n407. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, it argues that President Chavez, in his speech announcing the expropriation added the\u00a0tagline \u201ca company with U.S. capital\u201d after the name \u2018\u2022Owens-Illinois.\u201d This simple obiter dictum\u00a0does not appear to be sufficient to justify the claim that the US nationality of the OI group was a\u00a0decisive factor in the decision to expropriate. Moreover, as the Respondent correctly points out,429\u00a0the claim that Venezuela expropriated its investment specifically because it was foreign and\u00a0American, contradicts its other argument that the true purpose of the expropriation was to cause\u00a0damage to Polar Group.430\n408. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly , the references made by Minister Menendez and Vice President Jaua on 26 October 2010\u00a0can hardly be classified as discriminatory.\n409. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vice President Jaua announced the passage of the Expropriation Decree and in response to a\u00a0question from a reporter, stated that the government was acting in the defense of the public interest,\u00a0in clear contrast with w'hat other previous governments had done,431 which had allowed the \u201cneo-colonialization by transnational companies, particularly American companies\u201d\u2014a statement of a\u00a0political and historical nature that cannot be classified as an indication of discrimination.

In the\u00a0decision to expropriate, the decisive factor appears to have been the expropriated Companies were\u00a0operating in the glass manufacturing sector in which the Venezuelan Government wished to\u00a0implement said policy\u2014and not the U.S. nationality of the O1 group.\n411. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, given that OI had more than 60% of the market share of the glass container\u00a0manufacturing industry,433 its expropriation cannot be understood to constitute discrimination in\u00a0favor of domestic investors, but rather a strategic decision. The expropriation of the company\u00a0ensured that the government would control the largest share of the glass container manufacturing\u00a0sector\u2014considered by the Republic to be strategic for its endogenous development policy.43\n412. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider it to have been proven that the expropriation was carried\u00a0out for discriminatory' reasons.\nd.

This language requires the payment of just\u00a0compensation\u2014but fails to define the moment at w'hich said compensation must be paid. There is,\u00a0then, a clear contradiction between the different versions of the BIT\u2014which according to the\u00a0closing of the Treaty are \u201cequally authentic.\u201d\n417. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How do we resolve this contradiction?

These proceedings, in which\u00a0neither the companies nor the Claimant are participating,44'' began on 14 March 2011 as a result of\u00a0the request for expropriation filed by the Attorney General's Office, and is currently being\u00a0processed by the Second Administrative Court.4'1 As of the date of the award, there is no evidence\u00a0the fair value has been determined nor has the Claimant received any compensation whatsoever.\n421. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(it) Between January and July of 2011 the Companies and the Respondent held four meetings out of\u00a0court for purposes of determining the proper compensation. Given the vast differences between the\u00a0two parties\u2014the Claimant valued 100% of the Companies at just over USD 1 billion, while the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela counter-offered a range of between USD 100-120 million\u2014the\u00a0meetings broke down without any agreement.\n440 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Letter from OTdV to Minister Menendez dated 9 December 2010, Exhibit R-5.\n441 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hemandez-Exhibit 111.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n422. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has already established that the LECUPS is a modem law, compliance with which in\u00a0principle meets the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT. However, given that the process began\u00a0nearly four years ago and the fair value has still not been set, much less any compensation paid,\u00a0does this delay constitute \u201cundue delay,\u201d which would violate the express provision of Article 6(c)\u00a0in fine of the BIT?\n423. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela acknowledges that it owes compensation to OI Group and\u00a0that the value of the expropriated property exceeds, based on Venezuela\u2019s own calculations, USD\u00a0100 million\u2014a significant sum by any account. The BIT requires that the Bolivarian Republic pay\u00a0compensation \u201cwithout undue delay.\u201d In order to meet this requirement, it w'ould have been\u00a0appropriate for the procedure provided in the LECUPS to have moved forward without delay, and\u00a0that the fair value owed under said Law would have been established and paid\u2014without prejudice\u00a0to the investor\u2019s right to file a claim under the BIT, if it believed that, despite the payment made,\u00a0the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had not fully performed its obligations under international\u00a0law that it undertook in the Treaty.\n424. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent acknowledges that the legal proceedings in Venezuela have been drawn out, but it\u00a0justifies this by saying that the Claimant\u2019s failure to appear has made proper processing difficult.442\u00a0However, the experts for both parties confirmed at the hearing that the opposite is true.443 In\u00a0particular, the expert for the Respondent stated:\n\u201cCLAIMANT (Mr. Grane Labat).- Would you say that this means that the failure to appear on the part of this, of this expropriated party would not stand in the way of\u00a0this legal proceeding contemplated by the Law for the purpose of paying the\u00a0compensation?\nEXPERT (Mr. Cabrera).- It would not stand in the way.\u201d444\n425. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the Bolivarian Republic has failed to offer a plausible\u00a0explanation to justify the delay of more than four years in setting and paying the fair value due in\u00a0compliance with the LECUPS, which in turn implies that the requirement under Article 6(c) of the\u00a0BIT that the compensation be paid \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d has not been met.\n\\* \\* \\*\n426. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal holds that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not been able to\u00a0prove that the Expropriation Decree has complied with all the requirements set forth in Article 6 of\u00a0the BIT. Although this Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the expropriation was carried out in\u00a0the public interest, and is not discriminatory, Venezuela has failed to ensure due process of law , by\n442 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, paragraph 205.\n443 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT, day 4,26:10 - 27:2; Hernandez, paragraphs 26 and 159-160.\n444 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT, day 4, 65:7-11.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

The\u00a0Claimant asserts that Venezuela, through the acts and omissions of its government agencies:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has treated the Claimant\u2019s investments in an unfair and inequitable manner, and has\u00a0hindered, by means of arbitrary and discriminatory measures, the operation, maintenance,\u00a0management, use, enjoyment and disposal of the investment, in violation of art. 3(1) of\u00a0the BIT;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has failed to grant full physical security and protection to the Claimant\u2019s investments, in\u00a0violation of art. 3(2) of the BIT;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has failed to comply with the obligations assumed by it with respect to the treatment of\u00a0the investments, in violation of art. 3(4) of the BIT [\u201cUmbrella Clause\u201d];\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and has failed to guarantee that the payments related to the Claimant\u2019s investments can be\u00a0transferred in a freely convertible currency, in violation of art. 5 of the BIT. all such facts\u00a0being attributable to Venezuela.\nThe first three claims will be referred to as the \u201cAncillary Claims.\u201d\n428. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant considers that each breach of the BIT is independent and cannot be legally\u00a0incorporated into the other breaches445 and that each one grants it the right to petition for a\u00a0declaratory\u2019judgment and to obtain full compensation for the totality' of the damages (including\u00a0moral damages) caused.446 Notw ithstanding, hie et nunc, it does not claim any amount\u00a0whatsoever, with the exception of moral damages, with respect to the Ancillary Claims.\n429. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent denies that Venezuela has violated articles 3(1), 3(2), 3(4), and 5 of the BIT.447 It\u00a0adds that in the event the Tribunal decides that a wrongful expropriation has occurred, the\u00a0analysis of the Ancillary Claims wnuld be superfluous, since all the damages\n445 CV, para. 122.\u00a044 CV, para. 122.\u00a0447 R1I. para 359.\n01 European Group B.V. v.

However, it adds that in this case, once the conclusion that a\u00a0wrongful expropriation has occurred is reached, the analysis of the Ancillary Claims would be\u00a0unnecessary, since all damages claimed by the Claimant\u2014with the exception of moral\u00a0damages\u2014would arise as a result of the w rongful expropriation.\n432. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the fact that the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent in that the analysis of the Ancillary\u00a0Claims would probably be futile in practical terms, its request cannot be granted:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because the Tribunal must make a fully informed assessment of the possible\u00a0existence of moral damages.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and also, because the Claimant has expressly and repeatedly requested a declaratory\u00a0judgment.\n433. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Tribunal proceeds to analyze, albeit briefly, the Ancillary Claims.4.

Analysis of the Tribunal\n463. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its arguments and in its petition, the Claimant proposes that the same events that led to the\u00a0expropriation of its investment\u2014w'hich have already been analyzed in the previous section\u2014\u00a0constitute an additional international illegal act of unfair and inequitable treatment sanctioned by\u00a0the Treaty. However, as has been indicated, the Claimant is ciaiming no additional compensation\u00a0for these alleged violations: the compensation requested for the expropriation of its investment\u00a0also includes the damage caused by these illegal acts, with the exception of moral damages.\u00a0OIEG is suing for USD 10 million for moral damages stemming from w\u2019hat it refers to as the\u00a0Respondent\u2019s atrocious conduct52 during the six months following the expropriation.\n464. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent, for its part, denies the existence of unfair or inequitable treatment and any\u00a0arbitrary' or discriminatory' measures.\nDetermining of the scope of analysis\n465. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant includes in the alleged violation of the standard of PET not only the actions that\u00a0resulted in the takeover of the Plants, but also the actions of INPSASEL and INDEPABIS, two\u00a0State agencies, as well as those of the Judicial Branch of the Venezuelan government.\n466. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To resolve this issue, the Tribunal shall first determine what standard of protection is established\u00a0by the Treaty (A). Once the standard of protection has been clarified, the question of whether the\u00a0events constitute a violation of the standard of FET can be analyzed (B).\nA. Definition of the standard of FET in the BIT\n467. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the arbitration, the Republic has insisted that the scope of the guarantee of FET\u00a0defined in the BIT is limited to the minimum standard of treatment of Customary International\u00a0Law. In support of its thesis, it has invoked the verbatim text of item 2 of the Protocol, which uses\u00a0the adverb \u201cas w ell as\u201d to indicate that the notion of FET must be analy zed from the perspective\u00a0of both the most favored nation and the minimum standard of treatment of foreign nationals under\u00a0international law.528\n526 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rll, para. 422.\n527 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI. para. 248 (v).\n528 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RIV. para. 314.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/1 1/25\nAward\n468. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant\u2019s understanding, on the other hand, is that the standard reflected in article 3(1) of\u00a0the BIT and item 2 of the Protocol does not coincide with the minimum customary treatment, but\u00a0instead represents an autonomous and broader contractual standard. In its opinion, article 3(1) of\u00a0the BIT does not tie the standard of FET to the minimum standard of treatment of customary\u00a0international law, nor does item 2 of the Protocol introduce such a limitation.529 (In any case, the\u00a0Claimant maintains that even if the minimum customary' standard of treatment is applied, the\u00a0result would be the same: the Respondent\u2019s conduct was so blatant that it also violated the less\u00a0demanding standard530).\nFET in the BIT and its Protocol\n469. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation to accord FET to protected investments is recognized in article 3(1) of the BIT and\u00a0item 2 of its Protocol.\n470. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3(1) of the BIT establishes the following:\n\u201c1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by arbitrary or\u00a0discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or\u00a0disposal thereof by those nationals.\u201d\n471. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BIT thus contains two rules:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, it ensures FET of the protected investments.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, furthermore, it prohibits arbitrary or discriminatory measures against protected\u00a0investors.\n472. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The regulation of article 3(1) of the BIT is supplemented by item 2 of the Protocol, which sets out\u00a0the following:\n\u201cThe Contracting Parties agree that the treatment of investments shall be considered to be fair and equitable as mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 1, if it conforms to the treatment\u00a0accorded to investments of their own nationals, or to investments of nationals of any third\u00a0State, as well as to the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under\u00a0international law, whichever is more favorable to the national concerned.\u201d\n473. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the standard orders that the treatment accorded to a protected investor shall be fair and\u00a0equitable if it conforms:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cto the treatment accorded to national [Venezuelan] investments or\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to investments of nationals of any third State,\n529 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 272.\n530 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 280-284\n01 European Group B.V. v.

The Protocol contains a rule to resolve this issue:\u00a0item 3 establishes that:\n\u201cthe English text shall be taken as a reference.\u201d\n480. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the regulation of FET envisaged in the English version of item 2 of the Protocol shall\u00a0prevail. In practical terms, this regulation implies that the FET guaranteed by the BIT\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asa genera! rule, shall equate to the minimum customary standard;\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- Unless the investor is able to prove that the treatment guaranteed for the investments of nationals or third States is superior.\nUnited Kingdom - Venezuela Treaty\n481. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant has attempted to avail itself of this exception, arguing that the standard of treatment\u00a0established in the Treaty between the United Kingdom and Venezuela is indeed superior. Article\u00a02(2) of that Treaty indicates that\n\u201c[investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with international law .\u201d531\n482. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not agree with this assessment: it is not true that the Treaty with the United\u00a0Kingdom offers superior treatment to the minimum customary standard, since in reality\u2019 it only\u00a0offers protected investors FET \u201cin accordance with international law.\u201d The Treaty' therefore does\u00a0not guarantee FET in abstract, but rather only as recognized by international law. And the level of\u00a0protection that international law offers and ensures to foreign nationals is precisely what is known\u00a0as the minimum customary- standard.\n483. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the Tribunal concludes that hie et nunc the general rule should be applied, and that the\u00a0standard of FET enjoyed by the Claimant in relation to its investments in Venezuela is the\u00a0minimum customary' standard (or to use the terminology of the Protocol to the BIT, \u201cthe\u00a0minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under international law\u201d).\nMinimum customary standard\n484. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What should be imderstood by minimum standard of treatment to foreign nationals guaranteed by\u00a0Customary International Law?\n485. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue is fraught with difficulties because there is no consistent case law. Furthermore, it\u00a0becomes necessary to make distinctions, taking into account the varying nature of actions that\u00a0generate international liability on the part of the State.\n486. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first formulation of the standard of FET seems to have been the one adopted in Roberts,'72 an\u00a0arbitral decision rendered in 1926 by the General Claims Commission of the United States and\u00a0Mexico, which prosecuted the actions of Mexico's Executive Branch and defined the minimum\n\u2019 Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Exhibit CLA-3.\n32 Roberts, pp. 77-81\nOl European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/I1/25\nAward\nstandard as that which is required \"in accordance with ordinary standards of civilization. '\n487. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Roberts, an American, had been imprisoned in Mexico under what he understood to be\u00a0inhumane conditions. Mexico argued that Mexican citizens were imprisoned under identical\u00a0conditions. And the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\"Facts with respect to equality of treatment of aliens and nationals may be important in determining the merits of a complaint of mistreatment of an alien. But such equality is not\u00a0the ultimate test of the propriety\u2019 of the acts of authorities in the light of international law.\u00a0That test is, broadly speaking, whether aliens are treated in accordance with ordinary\nstandards of civilization. We do not hesitate to say that the treatment of Roberts was such as to warrant an indemnity' on the ground of cruel and inhumane imprisonment. \u201d534\n488. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The standard defined in Roberts (\u201cin accordance with ordinary standards of civilization\u2019\u2019) was\u00a0established in the 1920s, in a context of injury to a foreign citizen's individual rights and of\u00a0prosecution of actions taken by the Executive Branch\u2014not judicial actions or legislative actions.\u00a0Perhaps the most important thing about the aw ard is the principle that an action attributable to the\u00a0State can generate international legal liability, despite the fact that the measures affect both\u00a0nationals and foreign nationals equally and even if there is no bad faith or willful breach of\u00a0obligations.\n489. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The minimum customary standard has not remained frozen. It has developed significantly since\u00a0its early formulations 100 years ago. driven by the establishment of Human Rights and the\u00a0implementation of the Rule of Law. Well into the 21st century, Roberts is of dubious relevance for\u00a0the protection of foreign investors against administrative, legislative or judicial actions that\u00a0interfere with the use and enjoyment of their investment. What is relevant is not the standard as it\u00a0was defined in the 20111 century, but rather the standard as it exists and is accepted today\u2014since\u00a0both Customary International Law and the standard itself are constantly evolving; \u2018 And it is\u00a0quite possible that currently the minimum customary standard and the FET envisaged in the\u00a0treaties have converged, according the investor with substantially equivalent levels of protection.\n490. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 3(1) of the BIT should serve as a starting point in the task of unravelling the current\u00a0meaning of the standard. On the one hand, the precept outlines the general principle that the\u00a0investor will be ensured FET in accordance with the minimum international standard and,\u00a0moreover, it adds a specific prohibition: no State must adopt \u201carbitrary or discriminatory\n533 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another frequently cited case is Neer, however in reality it is only applicable to situations of denial of justice: cfr.\u00a0J.

A State violates it when it takes an action or a chain of\u00a0actions that are demonstrably unlawful or fail to recognize the basic requirements of the rule of\u00a0law.536 The duty of according FET to foreign nationals is mentioned with respect to the State as a\u00a0whole, and it binds all branches that it comprises. The obligation of FET can be violated in the\u00a0following ways:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through administrative actions, taken by administrative authorities for which the State is\u00a0responsible, directly against the investor;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or also by means of judicial actions that affect the investor, if they involve a denial of justice;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or lastly by means of general legislative actions, enacted by the State, if the new regulation\u00a0contradicts the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n492. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What should be understood by \u201carbitrary or discriminatory measures\u201d?\n493. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BIT not only mentions the guarantee of FET but also prohibits the adoption of \u201carbitrary or\u00a0discriminatory measures\u201d that affect the investment.\n494. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not easy to define what arbitrary is. The fundamental idea of arbitrariness is that legality, due\u00a0process, the right to judicial remedy, objectivity and transparency in the State\u2019s management are\u00a0replaced by privilege, preference, bias, preclusion and concealment.537 Professor Schreuer has\u00a0defined (and the EDF Tribunal has accepted538) as arbitraiy:\n\"a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or\u00a0personal preference; a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put\u00a0forward by the decision maker; a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and\u00a0proper procedure. \u201d\n536 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Glamis stated in the same regard that violation of the customary minimum treatment requires that an act\u00a0must be sufficiently egregious and shocking - a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a\u00a0complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons [...]\u201d (Glamis, para. 616).\n537 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See, among many others: Ronald Lauder, para. 221; Teemed, para. 154; Loewen, para. 131; Saluka, para. 307.\n538 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EDF, para. 307; Professor Schreuer acted as an expert in these proceedings, and his opinion was cited and\u00a0adopted by the Tribunal.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Therefore,\u00a0the occupation of expropriated property can only be ordered by the Courts (except when the\u00a0expropriated party gives its consent).553 The administration is lacking in jurisdiction to execute\u00a0the Expropriation Decree on its own initiative.\n506. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judge can authorize the occupation at two moments in time: during the expropriation process\u00a0(\"prior occupation\u201d), or once the expropriation process is completed (\u201cfinal occupation\u201d).\n507. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prior occupation is a provisional remedy issued by the Judge which the LECUPS makes\u00a0subject to some very strict requirements554:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The public works have been declared to be in need of \u201curgent execution\u201d by the\u00a0expropriating agency;555\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expropriating agency has filed the expropriation action and requests prior\u00a0occupation;556\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Appraisal Commission appraises the expropriated property;557\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expropriating agency deposits the amount established as the fair price\u00a0compensation;558 and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The owner and occupants are notified of the prior occupation.559\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The action of the INDEPABIS\n508. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Expropriation Decree was fully conscious of the property occupation system set forth in the\u00a0LECUPS, and the legal requirement that such occupation be carried out under the supervision of\u00a0the Courts.

To this end, it made use of a special Law, the INDEPABIS Law, the purpose of\u00a0which is to guarantee to citizens access to goods and services, and of a public agency responsible\u00a0for its application, the INDEPABIS.\n511. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after issuing the Expropriation Decree, on 27 October 2010, the Bolivarian Republic\u00a0instructed the INDEPABIS to make an appearance in the expropriated companies and take\u00a0possession ipso jure of the Plants, creating Temporary Management Boards (\u201cTMB\u201d) for each of\u00a0them in Favianca and in OldV for their management.560 To do this, the INDEPABIS utilized the\u00a0inspection authority granted to it by the Law and the possibility of adopting preventive measures\u00a0in the event the companies are not complying with the obligations set forth by the aforementioned\u00a0regulation. The measures adopted by the INDEPABIS wrere formalized in three brief certificates\u00a0issued based on the following art icles of the INDEPABIS Law:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Favianca, on the basis of arts. 111.1 and 111.12;561 these regulations define as an\u00a0unlawful act that \u201cproduction chain members\u201d restrict the supply of goods or that a risk\u00a0exists of \u201cdestruction, disappearance or alteration of goods or documents\u201d;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Old V based on art. 111.2, 111.11 and 1 1 1.12562 of the INDEPABIS Law;563 art. 111.2\u00a0defines the unlawful act of failing to exhibit books or documents; art. 1211.11 that of\n500 INDEPABIS certificate dated 28 October 2010, Attachment C-45)\n561 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INDEPABIS Law, Art. 111:\n\u201c1.

The reason cited by this agency to adopt a\u00a0measure so drastic and invasive of the fundamental rights of the party affected by the\u00a0expropriation was that the Companies were allegedly committing certain unlawful acts prohibited\u00a0by the INDEPABIS Law: according to the Records of the proceedings,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Companies were allegedly restricting the supply of goods;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was an alleged risk of destruction, disappearance or alteration of goods or documents;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OldV was allegedly refusing to exhibit books or documents or concealing information.\n514. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent has failed to provide any evidence in support of these allegations. Even INDEPABIS\u00a0lacked any evidence whatsoever: before the temporary occupation could be ordered a prior\u00a0penalty procedure had to be initiated, and this was never carried out by INDEPABIS.\u00a0Respondent\u2019s expert himself stated he was unaware of the existence of the penalty procedure.564\u00a0Since there is no case file that shows, even if just circumstantially, that the unlawful acts were\u00a0real, there is no legal basis to justify the ordering of the occupation. Also very significant is the\u00a0fact that, despite the elapsed time, after adopting such a draconian provisional order, INDEPABIS\u00a0never came to penalize the Companies for the unlawful acts that were under investigation.\n515. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s allegation that INDEPABIS decided to cany out the occupation pursuant to Article\u00a0112 based on the existence of an objective risk of dismantling or stoppage of production565 lacks\u00a0any factual basis. There are no signs whatsoever that at any time Claimant considered the\u00a0possibility of resisting the expropriation by stopping production in its factories.\n516. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reality, the purpose behind the Bolivarian Republic\u2019s decision to use INDEPABIS temporarily\u00a0occupy the Plants was to avoid the cumbersome procedure established in the LECUPS which\u00a0requires litigating the case in administrative courts and securing a court order. It is important to\u00a0remember that pursuant to Article 56 of the LECUPS, expropriated assets may only be\n564 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT, day 4, 71:24-28.\n565 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, par. 165.\nIll\nOI European Group B.V. v.

These highly protective requirements were circumvented by means of the interim\u00a0order entered by INDEPAB1S.\n517. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is recognized by Respondent\u2019s expert himself:\n\u201cTo apply the prior occupation procedure... it was necessary to wait until the petition for expropriation w'as made by means of a proper lawsuit... have the expert appraisal\u00a0performed and deposit the amount concerned.

Respondent resorted to the temporary\u00a0occupation measure established in the INDEPABIS Law to take over the Plants for the purpose of\u00a0depriving Claimant of its rights under the LECUPS rather than as a temporary measure resulting\u00a0from the existence of alleged violations of the INDEPABIS Law by the Companies.\n519. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an example of the arbitrary decisions, Schreuer includes \u201c[text in English].\u201d568 In the opinion\u00a0of this Tribunal, the decision by INDEPABIS to carry out the occupation of the Plants falls neatly\u00a0within this category and constitutes a violation of the FET guarantee set forth in the BIT.\nE. The decision of the Administrative Court\n520. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant alleges that the advance provisional remedy issued by the First Administrative\u00a0Court on 20 December 2010, in which it authorized the occupation, possession and use of the\u00a0property owned by the Companies implied an abuse of power and a violation of its right to due\u00a0process and good faith, due to:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not having been notified of the proceeding or the decision in accordance with the law;569\u00a0and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0having been issued inaudita parte in violation of Venezuelan law570\n521. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent denies that the inaudita parte order authorizing the occupation of the Plants was\u00a0issued in violation of Venezuelan legislation,571 since Venezuelan case law permits the issue of\n566 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela's expert considers that the reference to Article 112 contained on the Records of the proceedings must\u00a0have been a mistake and that the occupation was actually carried out pursuant to Article 6 of the INDEPABIS Law.\u00a0The conclusion is the same regardless of which article is the right one.\n567 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT, day 4, 82:11-18.\n568 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See par. 494 supra.\n569 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, para. 207; CIV, para 324, 327.\n570 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 328.\n571 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RIV, para. 386.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Therefore, the Tribunal,\u00a0in the first place, will analyze the regulations and requirements for the denial of justice (a), will\u00a0then establish the proven facts (b), and subsequently verify whether the requisite elements are\u00a0present to declare that Venezuela committed a denial of justice (c).\na. Regulations and requirements for denial of justice\n523. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Denial of justice constitutes a violation of the FET guaranteed in the BIT. Tribunals and doctrine\u00a0have unanimously held that the FET guarantee contained in investment protection treaties include\u00a0as an element the denial of justice.5 4\n524. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That the facts which occurred have the requisite requirements to be able to be considered an\u00a0international unlawful act of denial of justice is a different question. For this to occur it is\u00a0common practice for the party alleging the unlawful act to prove two requirements:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) The legal system of the host State must have applied to the foreign investor treatment\u00a0clearly and obviously contrary to the legal system or due process;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) The foreign national in turn must have exhausted all existing domestic legal remedies\u00a0to combat the legal decision in question, or must prove that the filing of such appeals\u00a0wmuld be clearly futile.5'5\n525. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) The national courts must administer justice in accordance w ith generally accepted standards at\u00a0the international level. They deviate from those standards if they refuse to admit or process\u00a0without undue delay a claim by a foreign national, or if they issue a judgment following a\u00a0proceeding which is severely flawfed or the contents of which is manifestly inadmissible and\u00a0unlawful.

Proven facts\n528. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following constitute proven facts:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the fact that since the end of October, 2010, the Bolivarian Republic had already\u00a0taken possession of the Plants through the administrative measures adopted by the\u00a01NDEPABIS, on 18 November 2010 the PGR decided to validate the occupation legally,\u00a0and filed a petition for an advance provisional remedy of occupation of the Plants with\u00a0the First Administrative Court. It should be noted that this measure was not a prior\u00a0occupation petition under the terms of article 56 of the LECUPS, but was requested as an\u00a0unnamed provisional remedy.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 20 December 2010, the First Administrative Court responded to this petition and\u00a0adopted inaudita parte the unnamed provisional remedy and organized an ad hoc\u00a0management board to manage the Companies.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the provisional remedy execution proceeding, the representatives of OldV\u00a0appeared in the proceeding, simply to put on the record that the company \u201cis not a party\u00a0to any legal or administrative proceeding initiated by the Republic ... with respect to the\u00a0aforementioned expropriation of assets ...,\u201d57l! Therefore, OIdV freely made the decision\u00a0not to appeal the unnamed provisional remedy and not to participate in the subsequent\u00a0execution process.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 14 March 2011, the PGR initiated the legal proceeding under the LECUPS, filing a\u00a0petition for expropriation before the First and Second Administrative Courts.\u00a0Subsequently, the provisional remedy was combined with the expropriation\u00a0proceeding.579 Currently, the Second Administrative Court is hearing the expropriation\nPantechniki. para. 96.\n8 Court orders dated March 16 and 25, 2011.

The Claimant has decided not to participate in that proceeding.\nc. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n529. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the decision dated 20 December 2010, the First Administrative Court issued an ex-parte\u00a0unnamed provisional remedy order, under which:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the assets of OldV, Favianca and two other companies which were not mentioned in the\u00a0Expropriation Decree were to be occupied; and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an ad hoc management board was to be formed.\n530. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effect of that decision is substantially identical to that of the previous occupation provided\u00a0for in Article 56 of the LECUPS, even if it was not issued pursuant to that provision and was\u00a0called an unnamed provisional remedy order. The Court justified that decision under different\u00a0legal provisions,581 based on the urge to carry out the Glass Strengthening Project, and stated that\u00a0it was a reversible order.582 The unnamed provisional remedy order differs from the previous\u00a0occupation under the LECUPS in that it was agreed without appraising the assets and without a\u00a0bond or guarantee for the fair price\u2014in other words, the judgment was issued disregarding the\u00a0guarantees set forth in Article 56 of the LECUPS.\n531. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Second Administrative Court subsequently consolidated this unnamed provisional remedy\u00a0order into the expropriation proceedings and, as was explained by Claimant\u2019s expert, the\u00a0provisional remedy order became an instrumental occupation order within the expropriation\u00a0proceedings.583\n532. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The manner in which the order was issued and its content in disregard of the LECUPS raise\u00a0serious questions as to its legality. Nevertheless, this Tribunal will now analyze the requirements\u00a0for the existence of denial of justice in the reverse order: it will first examine whether domestic\u00a0remedies were exhausted; and only if it is concluded that said requirement is met will it evaluate\u00a0whether the Venezuelan Judiciary acted with clear and manifest unlawfulness.\nExhaustion of domestic remedies\n533. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Tribunal has already reached the conclusion that it is a commonly accepted requirement for\u00a0the existence of denial of justice that the wronged party has exhausted or demonstrated the futility\u00a0of pursuing domestic remedies.\n580 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hernandez, para. 46.\n581 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRBV, Articles 299, 305 and 308; Organic Law of the Administrative Litigation Jurisdiction, Article 4; Code of\u00a0Civil Procedure, Article 588; Decree with rank, value and force of Law Reforming the Decree with Force of Organic\u00a0Law of the Office of the Attorney General (PGR), Articles 91 and 92.\n582 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judgment of the First Administrative Court of the Metropolitan Caracas Area dated 20 December 2010, Exhibit\u00a0C-63, p.26.\n583 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hernandez, par. 145.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n534. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case at hand, it is a proven fact that Claimant has not appealed the provisional remedy\u00a0order and it has voluntarily decided not to participate in the expropriation proceedings\u2014to the\u00a0point where Claimant only appeared before the Court to state that it would not participate. It is\u00a0also a fact that Claimant has produced no evidence whatsoever to demonstrate the futility of\u00a0defending itself before Venezuelan Courts.\n535. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requirement to exhaust domestic remedies ( or produce proof that the investor is being denied\u00a0access to domestic justice or that domestic justice has incurred unreasonable delays or that any\u00a0further motions would most likely be futile) is a requirement for an international tribunal to\u00a0decide that a court decision has denied justice. International Law cannot become a convenient\u00a0system to appeal any domestic court decision the investor disagrees with. Before it can be\u00a0established under International Law that a State\u2019s legal system has committed a wrong, it is\u00a0essential to provide it with a chance to correct its own mistake.

The\u00a0Tribunal has already concluded that a State only breaches the FET guarantee when it takes action\u00a0that is manifestly contrary to the legal system or disregards the basic tenets of the rule of law.610\u00a0The Minister\u2019s statements do not amount to a violation of this standard: warning of the\u00a0consequences of a crime or an unlawful act cannot be interpreted as a threat or coercion.\n547. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in paragraphs 579 et seq.. the Tribunal will examine the presence of the GNB at the\u00a0Plants (and will conclude that it was not serious enough to constitute an international offense\u00a0attributable to the Republic).\n548. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary , the warnings made by Minister Menendez that any deliberate action taken to stop\u00a0the Plants from operating would be punished did not constitute threats that would give rise to an\u00a0international offense.

During the transition period Claimant had to endure situations that could be characterized\u00a0as unpleasant, and that are inherent to any forced takeover procedure. Nevertheless, Claimant has\u00a0failed to prove how these situations amount to offenses that would incur liability under the BIT.\u00a0Specifically, Claimant has not proven that INPSASEL\u2019s \u201cre-investigation\u201d gave rise to an FET\u00a0violation\u2014especially considering that the entity ended up finding violations of legal provisions.\n558. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In terms of visits by third parties to the Plants and the transfer of intellectual property to Chinese\u00a0companies, it has also not been proven that this constitutes a FET violation, and the Tribunal\u00a0refers to the conclusions reached in paragraph 897 infra with respect to damages.\n559. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, with the exception of the conduct on the part of INDEPABIS, which was arbitrary\u00a0and amounted to an abuse of authority in violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT, it has not been\u00a0proven that the Republic\u2019s other conduct during the transition period constituted a violation of the\u00a0FET standard under the Treaty.\n\\*\\*\\*\n560. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary: the Tribunal agrees with the claims Claimant has presented, and finds that the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic subjected Claimant\u2019s investments to unfair or inequitable treatment and to\u00a0arbitrary measures in violation of Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT because the\u00a0expropriation violated due process and the takeover of the Plants by INDEPABIS was arbitrary.\n5.

Claimant defends\u00a0the extension of the FPS standard to legal protection based on the following arguments:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Definition of investment in Art. 1(a) of the BIT includes intangible assets, which only\u00a0enjoy full protection and security through legal:636\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no overlap betw een the FET and FPS standards, because the latter involves the\u00a0positive obligations of care and due diligence.637\n563. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant maintains that Venezuela did not comply with its duty to guarantee the physical\u00a0protection of Claimant's investments or with its duty to ensure their legal protection.638\n564. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Claimant considers that the deployment of the GNB at the Plants caused an atmosphere in\u00a0which the employees of the Plants were threatened and intimidated639 and had no other alternative\u00a0than to obey the orders of Respondent or face legal action for \u201csabotage.\u201d640 That constitutes,\u00a0according to Claimant, a breach of the duty to protect the phy sical safety of its investments.\n565. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second.

Respondent denies having violated Art. 3(2) of the BIT by failing to comply with the FPS\u00a0standard.64'\n568. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Republic argues that the FPS standard is traditionally linked to physical protection and\u00a0imposes on the State a duty' of care and diligence, and not an objective responsibility.6\u2019\u00a0Venezuela does not deny that some courts have extended the protection of the FPS clause.\u00a0However, it maintains that this view is not the predominant one. since a broad interpretation of\u00a0the FPS clause would overlap with the FET standard.646 It further argues that the cases cited by\u00a0Claimant are not applicable, because in all of them there was a modification of the regulatory-framework or frustration of legitimate expectations\u2014which did not happen in this case\u2014and the\u00a0Tribunal's decision was closely linked to the violation of the FET standard.64\n569. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Respondent denies that it has caused any physical coercion of employees of the\u00a0Companies to continue operating the Plants.648 In fact, it claims that the majority decided to\u00a0continue working for Venvidrio.649 Venezuela maintains that the intervention at the Plants was\u00a0peaceful and believes that Claimant has exaggerated the presence of the GNB, which for most of\u00a0the time was present in very small groups (two or three guards),650 positioned at security booths\u00a0of the Plants, without interfering with the entry and exit, and only entered the Plants to go to the\u00a0cafeteria.651 According to Respondent, the mission of the GNB was to maintain peace at the\u00a0facilities.652\n570. Third. Respondent rejects Claimant's argument that by expropriating OIEG investments,\nVenezuela violated the Investment Law and LECUPS and, therefore, violated the provisions of their own legislation. Respondent holds that Venezuelan law allows and extensively regulates\u00a0compulsory acquisition and concludes that Venezuela ordered the compulsory acquisition of the\u00a0Companies in accordance with LECUPS, and that in no way did it deprive Claimant's\u00a0investments of legal protection.

The Analysis of the Tribunal\n571. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The obligation to accord FPP [Full Physical Protection] to protected investments is recognized\u00a0under Article 3(2) of the BIT, which immediately follows Article 3(1) regulating the FET\u00a0guarantee. It reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Each contracting party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by\u00a0arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance,\u00a0use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those national.\n2. More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that\u00a0accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to the investments of\u00a0national of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the national\u00a0concerned.\u201d\n572. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties disagree as to the scope and interpretation to be given to the FPP standard. The debate\u00a0Centers on determining the breadth of the protection. Claimant alleges that the standard includes\u00a0not just the physical security of the investment, but legal certainty as well.653 Claimant argues that\u00a0the definition of investment in Art. 1(a) of the BIT includes intangible assets, which can only\u00a0enjoy full security and protection through legal protection.654 It also insists that there would be no\u00a0overlap between the FET and FPP standards because this entails the positive obligations of\u00a0vigilance and due diligence.655\n573. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent denies that the protection extends to legal certainty: the FPP standard is, it claims,\u00a0traditionally linked to physical protection and would impose on the State a duty of vigilance and\u00a0diligence, but not of strict liability,656 Venezuela does not deny that some tribunals have favored\u00a0an extensive interpretation, but maintains that this is not the predominant view65 and that the\u00a0cases cited by Claimant are not applicable.658\n574. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with Respondent.\n575. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been widely argued whether the primary scope of protection of the FPP standard, which\u00a0only covers physical security, can also be extended to legal certainty. If such extension were\u00a0accepted,659 any arbitrary modifications to the legal and regulatory framework could also give rise\u00a0to violations of the FPP standard.\n653 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It relies on commentators such as Dolzer & Schreuer and on the CME and Siemens cases, among others.\n654 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 360.\n655 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ibid. para. 362.\n656 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RIV, para. 349.\n657 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RII, para. 411.\n658 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RIV, para. 350.\n659 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And this has been done in Azurix, para. 408 and Vivendi II, para. 7.4.15, among others.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n576. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case before us, the matter is resolved by the language of Article 3(2) itself.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the precept is similar to a specific application of the FET standard, given that it is\u00a0immediately inserted after the FET guarantee (contained in Article 3(1)) and leads with\u00a0the phrase \u201cmore particularly.\u201d As such, a literal reading of the BIT indicates that there is\u00a0a general classification\u2014FET under Article 3(1)\u2014and a more specific type\u2014FPP under\u00a0Article 3(2). Whereas the general classification covers acts that violate legal certainty, the\u00a0specific type Centers on physical security.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The language itself in Article 3(2) of the BIT confirms this interpretation: it expressly\u00a0uses the adjective \"physical\u201d to describe the security it guarantees. A literal\u00a0interpretation, favored by Article 31(1) of the CVDT, unavoidably leads to the conclusion\u00a0that Article 3(2) of the Treaty is limited to guaranteeing full physical security and\u00a0protection.\n577. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary. Article 3(2) of the BIT deals with a specific type within the general classification of\nFET that applies when the security of an investment is impaired by physical violence or civil strife.660 The responsibility of the State will arise if it fails to adopt the protection measures that\u00a0w ould be required out of prudence to protect the foreign property covered under the Treaty'.\nApplication of the Standard to the Facts\n578. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant alleges that the presence of the GNB beginning on the morning of 26 October 2010\u2014\u00a0prior to the issuance of the Expropriation Decree\u2014and its continued presence at the Plants over\u00a0several weeks entailed a violation of the FPP standard.661 The Republic, in contrast, insists that\u00a0the intervention of the GNB was carried out without any harassment or threats662 and was only\u00a0aimed at keeping the peace in the Plants in light of protests by the workers.663\n579. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with Respondent\u2019s view and dismisses OIEG\u2019s claim in this respect.\n580. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FPP guarantee entails an obligation by the State to deploy its police force or take other\u00a0coercive measures to prevent others from disrupting the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the\u00a0investment. The mere presence of the GNB during the takeover of the Companies is a component\u00a0of the precautionary measures a government authority legitimately can and should take to ensure\u00a0that control is assumed in an orderly manner, precisely for the purpose of guaranteeing FPP of the\u00a0investment. It is contradictory to allege that the actions of the State\u2019s security forces, which\u00a0ensure physical security, constitute a violation of the FPP standard.\n660 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, Saluka, para. 483, with reference to other decisions.\n661 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI. para. 226; CIV, paras. 365 and 374-381.\n66: RI, para. 413.\n663 Rll.para. 119.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

BREACH OF ART. 3(4) OF THE BIT: UMBRELLA CLAUSE\nA. Claimant\u2019s Position\n582. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant argues that Venezuela violated the provisions of art. 3(4) of the BIT [the \u201cUmbrella\u00a0Clause\"], which requires that Respondent comply with \u201cany obligations\u201d that could have been\u00a0assumed regarding the treatment of investments belonging to Dutch nationals.\n583. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant maintains that international courts, in interpreting umbrella clauses that are similar to\u00a0that of this BIT, have highlighted the broad scope of phrases such as \u201cany obligations.\u201d664\n584. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Complainant believes that Respondent assumed certain obligations with respect to Claimant\u2019s\u00a0investments under Articles 6, 8, 11, 12, and 15 of the Investment Law, which provide\u00a0respectively665:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right of investments to receive fair and equitable treatment;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition of discriminatory treatment of investments and investors due to the country\u00a0of origin of capital;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition of illegal expropriation under international law;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right of international investors and investments to transfer all payments related to\u00a0investments;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela\u2019s commitment to develop favorable conditions for investment and investors.\n585. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant rejects the restrictive interpretation given by Respondent of the terms of art. 3(4) of the\u00a0BIT and, in particular, the argument that the Umbrella Clause does not require recipient States to\u00a0respect obligations assumed in investments in general\u2014as set forth in the Investment Law\u2014but\u00a0only for specific investments.666 Claimant relies on decisions such as SGS667 and Enron^ to\n664 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, paras. 233 and 234, citing Eureko and Enron.\n665 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, para. 235.\n666 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 375.\n667 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 377.\n668 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 378.\nOI European Group B.V, v.

Claimant believes that it is proven that Venezuela did not comply with the obligations\u00a0arising from the Investment Law, and therefore breached art. 3(4) of the BIT.' 7\"\nB. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent's Position\n587. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent rejects the claim, arguing that the Investment Law, on which Claimant bases its\u00a0claim, does not refer to specific investments, rather it involves a general rule that establishes a\u00a0generic regulatory framework for investments in Venezuela. It further argues that the Investment\u00a0Law does not refer to a specific sector but confirms commitments similar to those already\u00a0provided for in the BIT and international Law. whereby the cases on which Claimant relies are\u00a0not applicable. Therefore. Respondent argues that it is inconceivable that the alleged violation of\u00a0the Investment Law gives rise to a breach of the Umbrella Clause of the BIT1\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Analysis of the Tribunal\n588. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Art. 3(4) of the BIT includes a Clause of Incorporation of other obligations:\n\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other Contracting\u00a0Party.\"\n589. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Clause of Incorporation is broadly worded. As\u00a0previous tribunals have reflected,672 the term \u201cany obligation\" includes obligations entered into bylaw. Consequently, Venezuela has accepted the commitment to fulfil all of the legal obligations\u00a0established in the Venezuelan legal system.\n590. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Venezuelan legal system includes the Investment Law.6'' The purpose of this law is to\u00a0provide a stable, predictable legal framework for national and foreign investments:\n\u201cArticle 1. The purpose of this Decree-Law is to provide investors and investments, both national and foreign, with a stable and predictable legal framework in which\u00a0same can be carried out in an atmosphere of security, through the regulation of State\u00a0intervention with regard to those investments and investors, w ith a view to\n660 CIV. para. 379.\n670 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CL para. 236.\n671 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RII, para. 432.\n672 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SGS v.

International investments shall have the right to fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the regulations and criteria of international law' and\u00a0shall not be subject to arbitrary or discriminatory measures that hinder the\u00a0maintenance, management, use, enjoyment, expansion, sale, or liquidation thereof.\nArticle 8. The treatment of international investments or investors shall not discriminate based on the country where their capital originates. (...)\nArticle 11. (...) Investments shall only be expropriated (...) for reasons of public utility or social interest, following the procedure that has been legally established for\u00a0such purposes, in a non-discriminatory way and with prompt, just, and adequate\u00a0compensation.\nThe compensation shall be equivalent to the fair price of the expropriated investment immediately before the time at which the expropriation is announced by the legal\u00a0mechanisms or made public, whichever occurs first. The compensation, w'hich will\u00a0include the payment of interest until the effective payment date, calculated on the\u00a0basis of customary business standards, shall be paid without delay.\nSole Paragraph: The compensations that are applicable as a result of the expropriations of international investments shall be paid in convertible currency and\u00a0shall be freely' transferable out of the country.\nArticle 12. International investments and. as the case may be, international investors, shall have the right, upon prior compliance with domestic regulations and the\u00a0payment of the applicable taxes, to the transfer of all payments associated with the\u00a0investments, such as the initial capital ...; the profits, ... and the payments that result\u00a0from the settlement of disputes. (...)\u201d\n592. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Venezuelan Investment Law thus offers all investors a protection against expropriation and\u00a0unfair and unequal treatment analogous to the protection afforded by the BIT to the protected\u00a0Dutch investors. In turn, article 3(4) of the BIT elevates the failure to comply with \u201cany\u00a0obligation that [Venezuela] may have entered into with regard to the treatment of [protected]\u00a0investments\u201d to the categoiy of a breach of the Treaty . Therefore, non-compliance with the\u00a0Venezuelan Investment Law effectively becomes non-compliance with the BIT as well.\n593. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The practical consequences of this conclusion are few: the Tribunal has already established the\u00a0conclusion that Venezuela's actions entailed a failure to comply with the obligations on\u00a0expropriation and fair and equitable treatment contained in the BIT, with the consequence that the\u00a0Claimant has the right to receive compensation in accordance with the provisions thereof.\nOl European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB, 11/25\nAward\n594. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant has not argued that the protection offered by the Venezuelan Investment Law is\u00a0greater or more extensive than that granted by the BIT. Therefore, the Claimant\u2019s substantive\u00a0rights, as a consequence of the international offenses committed by the Bolivarian Republic of\u00a0Venezuela, shall be those that proceed from the BIT, and the invocation of the Investment Law\u00a0shall not provide grounds for greater protection.\n595. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal considers the claim made by the Claimant, requesting that the Tribunal\u00a0declare that Venezuela violated the Clause of Incorporation of article 3(4) of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT, to have merit, even though the consequences thereof do not differ from the ones\u00a0that were previously identified by the Tribunal.7. Breach of Art. 5 of the BIT: Transfer of Payments\nA. Claimant\u2019s position\n596. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant states that the Bolivarian Republic also breached Art. 5 of the BIT, which guarantees\u00a0that \u201cpayments related to an investment may be transferred ... in a freely convertible currency,\u00a0without restriction or undue delay.\u201d674\n597. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OIEG accuses the Bolivarian Republic of having breached this guarantee in two ways:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because the request to transfer funds between OldV/Favianca and OIEG experienced\u00a0unwarranted delays; the requests were submitted in May, November, and June 2009 and were\u00a0denied on 8 September 2011\u2014almost three and a half years later\u2014by CADI VI, the body of the\u00a0Republic in charge of exchange control; furthermore, the decision was made just one week after\u00a0the presentation of this arbitration, and never ended up being communicated to the Venezuelan\u00a0Companies.675\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, because CADI VI denied the transfer of the dividends declared by OldV on 21 May\u00a02008 and 15 June 2009 and by Favianca on 24 November 2008 to their parent company;676\u00a0CADIVI\u2019s decision was based on an inaccurate inference: that the dividends had allegedly\u00a0already been paid to OIEG; in reality, the dividends appeared in the balance of the Venezuelan\u00a0Companies as \u201caccounts payable\u201d because they had been forwarded to the group in the form of\u00a0a loan.677\n598. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As compensation for the alleged breach of Art. 5 of the BIT, the Claimant claims a compensation of\u00a0over USD 54 million.\n674 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, para. 237.\n675 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 153.\n676 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, para. 241-243.\n677 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CIV, para. 153.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Prov en facts\n605. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proven facts are the following:\n606. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) In early 2003, the Venezuelan government issued an Exchange Agreement685 establishing an\u00a0exchange control system. In addition, shortly thereafter, it created CAVI DI. a government agency\u00a0in charge of approving transactions in foreign currency. The Bolivarian Republic\u2019s grounds for\u00a0establishing such measures were686:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in the supply of foreign currency coming from the oil industry and the\u00a0extraordinary demand for currency had negatively affected the level of international reserves\u00a0and the exchange rate, which could endanger the normal development of the country\u2019s\u00a0economic activity;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in domestic industry exports, significantly affecting the Nation\u2019s accounts;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The need to adopt measures aimed at achieving the stability' of the currency, ensuring the\u00a0continuity of the country\u2019s international payments and counteracting undesirable capital\u00a0flight.\n607. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside this exchange control system created by the government, there was always the possibility\u00a0of obtaining USD in Venezuela through the parallel foreign currency market. This market\u00a0consisted of buying Venezuelan government bonds or corporate bonds with VEB and then selling\u00a0them in USD. The exchange rate in this parallel market was determined by the play of free supply\u00a0and demand and was always less favorable than the official exchange rate.\n608. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) On 21 May 2008 and 15 June 2009, OldV declared various dividends.

OIEG\u00a0was entitled to a total of VEB 160,272,487 (which, at the official exchange rate at that time\u20142.15\u00a0VEB/USD\u2014would equal USD 74.545,342).\n611. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iii) On 27 June 2008 and 6 August 2009. OldV applied to CAD1VI for repatriation of the\u00a0dividends declared in favor of Claimant. On 23 October 2009. Favianca also submitted an\u00a0identical request for its dividends. The requests totaled the VEB 160,272,487 owed by the\u00a0Companies.\n612. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iv) Between December 2009 and April 2010, the Companies used VEB 402,573.736 to buy and\u00a0subsequently sell bonds in the parallel market, which resulted in a balance of USD 59.544.000 at\u00a0an average exchange rate of 6.76 VEB per USD.\u201d The Companies transferred the USDs that\u00a0were obtained to OI.688\n613. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be kept in mind that the dividends were always denominated in VEB and that the amount\u00a0to be repatriated only totaled VEB 160.272.487. However, the companies spent VEB 402.573.736\u00a0on buying USD to send them to their parent company.\n614. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iv) In the meantime, the three requests submitted to CADIVI remained undecided. It was not\u00a0until 8 September 2011 that CADTVI decided to reject them and so notified the Companies,\u00a0sending the document to their original addresses, which coincided with the address of the\u00a0expropriated Plants. Claimant has stressed that CADIVI\u2019s decision w\u2019as issued one week after\u00a0Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration. However, as Respondent has pointed out, the fact that\u00a0the dates match is a mere coincidence. The ICSID only registered the Arbitration Request on 26\u00a0September 2011, i.e. three weeks after CADIVI\u2019s decision, and prior to that date, the Republic\u00a0could not have known its exact terms.\nb. The correct interpretation of Art. 5 of the BIT\n615. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of Art. 5 BIT establishes:\n\"The Contracting Parties shall guarantee that the payments related to any investment may be transferred. Such transfers shall be made in a freely convertible currency,\u00a0with no restriction or undue delay. Such transfers shall include, but not be limited to:\na) Profits, interest, dividends and other current income;\n55\n687 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek 1, par. 156.\n688 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT, day 5,35:17-36:17\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB 11/25\nAward\n616. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties are debating the proper interpretation of this provision.\n617. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant believes that Art. 5 requires the Bolivarian Republic to implement a system of free\u00a0transferability for the profits generated by protected investments. The creation of an exchange\u00a0control system with the subsequent need for CADIVI authorization would represent a de jure\u00a0violation of the accorded guarantee.689\n618. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand. Respondent asserts that legitimate and justified restrictions to free\u00a0convertibility are fully compatible with the BIT, because it does not grant the foreign investor an\u00a0absolute right to repatriate its profits. Rather, it only guarantees free convertibility \u201cwithout\u00a0restriction or undue delay.\u201d The Venezuelan exchange control regulations, and particularly the\u00a0requirements for CADIVI authorization,690 would thus be fully compatible with the Treaty. In\u00a0addition, the Treat} does not guarantee that conversion has to be done at the official exchange\u00a0rate.691\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n619. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties debate whether the exchange control system instituted in Venezuela starting in 2003\u00a0complies with the guarantees on free transfer and convertibility of profits offered by the BIT to\u00a0protected investors. On this matter, the Tribunal leans toward the position defended by the\u00a0Bolivarian Republic.\n620. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2003. Venezuela decided to institute a dual control sy stem that, when the events under analysis\u00a0occurred,692 would allow any foreign investor in Venezuela that needed foreign currency to resort\u00a0to either an official market or a parallel market to obtain it.\n621. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The official market offered a more favorable exchange rate set by the State, while in the parallel\u00a0market, which worked through the purchase and subsequent sale of public debt or bonds, the\u00a0exchange rate was freely established by the market, and in practice was worse for the investor\u00a0than the official market (because the investor needed a greater quantity of VEB to buy the same\u00a0amount of DSD). Access to the official system required a request to CADTVI. the agency that the\u00a0Republic had put in charge of managing the exchange control sy stem and that enjoy ed broad\u00a0discretion in granting or denying the authorization, depending on the availability' of foreign\u00a0currencies and for reasons of economic policy .\n622. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, we see that in the specific case of repatriation of dividends under Art. 121 of Currency\u00a0Exchange Order No. 56 dated 18 August, 2004:\n689 CI. paragraph 50.\n090 RII, paragraph 424.\n691 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RII, paragraph 426, with reference to the BITs between France and Venezuela and between the United Kingdom\u00a0and Venezuela.\n692 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The currency exchange system in Venezuela has undergone different modifications that will not be analyzed by\u00a0this Tribunal. The Tribunal limits itself to analyzing the currency exchange system at the time that the events in\u00a0question occurred.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n\"Article 11. The authorizations to purchase foreign currencies {autorizaciones de adquisicion de divisas - AAD) referring to international investments ... shall be\u00a0subject to the availability of foreign currencies established by the Central Bank of\u00a0Venezuela and the guidelines issued by the National Executive Branch.\"\n623. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does Art. 5 of the BIT offer investors an absolute guarantee that they would be able to repatriate\u00a0their profits at all times, and applying the official market exchange rate? The answer has to be\u00a0\u2018no.\u2019\n624. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) This can be seen, first, from the very wording of the article, because it only guarantees the\u00a0conversion and transfer of funds \u201cwith no restriction or undue delay.\u201d On the on other hand, it\u00a0allows the State to create restrictions or delays for justified cause. The introduction of exchange\u00a0control systems is part of the economic and financial sovereignty' of the States, and does not\u00a0constitute an \u201cundue restriction\" for purposes of the BIT. Having created an exchange control\u00a0system, the State may legitimately opt for a single structure or prefer, as Venezuela has done, a\u00a0dual system with an official market and another parallel market. The choice of one or the other\u00a0alternative is a policy decision, outside the scope of an arbitral tribunal\u2019s review.\n625. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) Second, it should be stressed that the BIT only protects the transfer of profits denominated in\u00a0a \u201cfreely convertible currency.\u201d Note that the Treaty does not establish any guarantee whatsoever\u00a0on the applicable exchange rate. In this, it differs significantly from other BITs that do regulate\u00a0this issue. Thus, the Venezuela - France BIT refers to the normal rate of exchange officially in\u00a0force on the date of the transfer;\u201d693 or the United Kingdom - Venezuela BIT to the \u201crate of\u00a0exchange applicable on the date of transfer pursuant to the exchange regulations in force.\u201d694\n626. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since there is no reference whatsoever to a guaranteed exchange rate in the BIT between\u00a0Venezuela and the Netherlands, then provided the exchange control system instituted by the\u00a0Republic allows free transferability, even if it is at the parallel market exchange rate and not at the\u00a0official market exchange rate, the accorded guarantee cannot be taken to have been violated. This\u00a0is precisely what happened: Venezuela instituted a dual system in which the foreign investor\u00a0could freely opt between repatriating its profits through CADIVI or opt for the parallel market. In\u00a0the first case, it enjoyed a privileged exchange rate, but the authorization was subject to the\u00a0availability of foreign currencies and to general policy decisions. In the second case, the exchange\u00a0rate was the market rate, but the conversion was immediate and did not require an administrative\u00a0authorization.\n627. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal thus reaches that conclusion that the exchange control system instituted\u00a0by Venezuela at the time that the events in question occurred was compatible with the guarantees\u00a0accorded by Art. 5 of the BIT to guaranteed investors, despite the fact that the exchange rate\n693 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Art. 6 in fine.

Application of the law to the facts\n628. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pro memoria: Between June 2008 and October 2009. OldV and Favianca applied to CAD1VI for\u00a0authorization to repatriate dividends in the amount of over VEB 160 million. In view of the lack\u00a0of administrative authorization, the Companies used VEB 402 million to buy foreign currencies\u00a0in the parallel market and repatriated them for the benefit of the OI group. In September 2011,\u00a0CAD1VI rejected the three dividend repatriation requests, arguing that they had already been\u00a0paid.\n629. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant believes that Venezuela committed a double violation of Art. 5: CAD1VI was guilty of\u00a0excessive delay and ultimately rejected the request with no justification.\n630. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bolivarian Republic denies having violated Art. 5 of the BIT. It emphasizes that Claimant\u00a0admits that it transferred the dividends through the parallel market and therefore CADIVI\u2019s\u00a0decision to deny the repatriation of dividends that had already been repatriated was justified.695 It\u00a0was the Companies w'ho improperly handled the procedure with CADIVI, asking to expatriate\u00a0funds that had already been transferred to their parent company.696\n631. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal holds that Respondents\u2019 defense is pertinent.\n632. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having declared the dividend in favor of OIEG, the Companies had the option of resorting to the\u00a0official market or the parallel market to convert the VEB to USD. Initially, they attempted to\u00a0access the official market because they exchange rate was better, although there were\u00a0uncertainties concerning the administrative authorization. A few months after submitting the third\u00a0request to CADIVI, and without waiting for the government agency to act, the Companies freely\u00a0decided to abandon the official market route, opting for the alternative and buying the foreign\u00a0currency in the parallel market, and in this process, they not only spent the amount of the\u00a0dividends owed (VEB 160.272.487), but a significantly higher figure (VEB 402,573,736).\n633. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By opting for the parallel market, the companies tacitly w'aived the option of obtaining the foreign\u00a0currency through CADIVI. Once the dividends are converted into USD through the parallel\u00a0market and the funds repatriated to the parent company through this procedure, it is inappropriate\u00a0for Claimant to complain that the exchange rate was unfavorable and that CADIVI\u2019s decision was\u00a0overdue and denied the request. The Companies themselves w'ere the ones who opted for the\u00a0parallel market.\n' RV, paragraph 280. 696 RV, paragraph 281.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB 11/25\nAward\n634. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant has attempted to justify its behavior by arguing that buying the USD in the parallel\u00a0market was not due to the repatriation of dividends, but in reality w\\*as a loan granted by the\u00a0Companies to another subsidiary of the group (01 Manufacturing Netherlands B.V.).69\u201d However,\u00a0the existence of the loan is not proven, and in any event the annual financial statements of OldV\u00a0and Favianca show that the dividends had already been paid.698\n635. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, CADIVI's decisions to reject the fund transfer requests because the dividends had\u00a0already been transferred through the parallel market were justified699 (although they were, in fact,\u00a0issued somewhat late, this is not serious enough to constitute an illicit act under international\u00a0law). Once an investor has opted to repatriate the funds through the parallel market, it loses its\u00a0right to claim the conversion into foreign currency through the official market controlled by\u00a0CADIVI.\n636. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Tribunal dismisses the claims set forth by Claimant, asking the Tribunal to declare\u00a0that the Bolivarian Republic violated Article 5 of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.\n697 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HT, day 5,35:21-27\n698 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhibit NAV-55, p. 39; Exhibit NA V-30, p. 52: HT. day 5,35:4-8.\n699 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhibits R-15, R-16 and R-17.\nOl European Group B.V. v.

The Claimant has\u00a0used the expertise of Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA, from the consulting firm Navigant Consulting. Mr.\u00a0Kaczmarek has submitted two reports [ 'Kaczmarek I\u201d and \u201cIF]. For its part, the Respondent has\u00a0hired Jean-Luc Guitera, a partner at KPMG Forensic in France, who has also submitted two reports\u00a0[\u201cGuitera I\u201d and \u201cII\u201d]. Both experts appeared at the Hearing, gave a summary of their positions,\u00a0and were questioned by the other party and by the Tribunal.\n639. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon finishing their statements, and with the consent of both parties, the Tribunal asked both\u00a0experts to jointly prepare a matrix with calculations of the value of the Companies, applying\u00a0various parameters in the assessment of the DCF [the \u201cJoint Matrix\u201d].700 Both experts did so.\u00a0submitting the joint work dated 9 October 2013. The Tribunal thanks them for their effort.\nThe Claimant\u2019s position\n640. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant states that, in accoidance with the principles established by International Law,\u00a0Venezuela is required to make restitution for all the damages that its unlawful conduct has caused\u00a0the Claimant. This full restitution standard would require not only the pay ment of the market value\u00a0of the Companies, but also the recovery' of all the other damages caused.701\n641. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimant, specifically, claims a total of USD 929,544,714, divided into six types of damages:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0USD 729,821,323 for the expropriation of the Venezuelan Companies\n~ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0USD 16,833,383 for the expropriation of the surplus cash in the bank accounts of OldV and\nFavianca\nUSD 54,292,257 for the loss of revenue caused by Respondent's unlawful interference with the repatriation of the Claimant's dividends paid by OldV and Favianca\n70(1 HT, Day 6,44:1-6. 701 CV, para. 133\nOl European Group B.V. v.

COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATION\n647. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Art. 6(c) of the BIT contains a quite detailed regulation of the compensation owed for the\u00a0expropriation of a protected investment:\n\u201c...(c) The measures shall be taken after fair compensation. Such compensation shall represent the market value of the affected investments just before the measures are taken or before the\u00a0imminent measures are made public knowledge, whichever occurs first; it shall include interest\u00a0at a normal commercial rate up to the payment date; and in order to be enforced for the\u00a0claimants, it shall be paid and made transferable without undue delay to the country designated\u00a0by the interested claimants in the currency of the country' of which the claimants are nationals\u00a0or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\u201d\n648. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The precept sets three fundamental characteristics that any compensation for expropriation must\u00a0have:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the amount, the compensation must represent the \u201cmarket value of the affected\u00a0investments\u201d\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the relevant date, the compensation has to be calculated as of the date \u201cjust\u00a0before the measures are taken\" or if they have been made public knowledge in advance, as of\u00a0the date on which the public gained knowledge of them\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- With regard to the currency in which the compensation must be expressed, the precept grants the expropriated investor an option: it may request it \u201cin the currency of the country of which\u00a0the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\"\nMarket value\n649. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both parties agree that the \u201cmarket value\" is the appropriate assessment standard for calculating the\u00a0compensation.

Mr. Guitera, adopted a somewhat different methodology. In his opinion, the\u00a0market value should he calculated by applying the DCF methodology\\* only, while the other\nm ethodologies should be used as a simple \"sanity check,\u201d in the w\\*ords of the expert, in order to corroborate the result achieved.\nComparison of the two methodologies\n657. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal tends to agree with the Respondent\u2019s expert.\n658. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most widely accepted formula for calculating the market value of a functioning company is\u00a0unquestionably the DCF methodology\u2014provided that the enterprise can show that it will generate\u00a0a reasonably foreseeable free cash flow\\* in the coming years. This methodology essentially means\u00a0the following (using the World Bank\u2019s definition):718\n\u201d \u2018[Discounted cash flow value \u2019 means the cash receipts realistically expected from the enterprise in each future year of its economic life as reasonably\u00a0projected minus that year's expected cash expenditure, after discounting this net\u00a0cash flow for each year by a factor which reflects the time value of money,\u00a0expected inflation, and the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic\u00a0circumstances. Such discount rate may' be measured by examining the rate of\u00a0return available in the same market on alternative investments of comparable\u00a0risk on the basis of their present value. \u201d\n659. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal believes that use of a DCF-based model is particularly appropriate in the case of\u00a0OldV and Favianca. As Mr. Kaczmarek has said:\n\u201c/\u00ab general, what 1 would say is that this is a very straightforward non-complex DCF analysis.\u201d119\n660. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, there are a number of elements that facilitate the use of the DCF methodology in this\u00a0case:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, both Companies have devoted themselves for nearly half a century to a stable industrial\u00a0business in which they use their own technology, which was developed on a worldwide scale\u00a0and w'hich gives them an advantage over local competitors.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, they rank first among glass manufacturers in Venezuela, far ahead of their closest\u00a0competitor.\n'' Guitera I, para. 5.\n18 World Bank (eds.): \u201cLegal Framework for the Treatment of Foreign Investment.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, they have a captive customer in the Polar Group, the largest agri-food business group\u00a0in Venezuela and also a minority partner in the Companies.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, they have a sophisticated business plan [the \"Business Plan\u201d],720 which was prepared\u00a0prior to expropriation and which the Companies had been developing year by year. This plan\u00a0contained highly detailed projections of their future development over the 2010-2013\u00a0quadrennium and of their capacity to generate free cash flows.721\n661. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is an additional argument that reaffirms the foregoing. As stated by Mr. Guitera, the\nVenezuelan business market has special, unique characteristics, making it advisable to use a \u2018\u2018stand-alone\u201d valuation, such as the DCF methodology, and unadvisable to use methods based on\u00a0comparisons to other countries.\n\"... due to the fact that it is very difficult to come to a value by comparison between a company in Venezuela, which is a very specific environment, with\u00a0other environments, I do not think the multiple approach should be relied [on] as\u00a0a primary approach to compute the price, but only as a check [...] which is why I\u00a0have applied the DCF and then the check, and not made a kind of weighted\u00a0valuation between the two. \u201d72\n662. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, while recognizing the prevalence of the DCF methodology, prudence dictates that it\u00a0should not be applied mechanically since this could easily lead to a distorted outcome. Any DCF\u00a0model is simply the result of plugging some estimated future parameters, as determined by the\u00a0expert, into a mathematical formula. If the estimates of these parameters turn out to be inaccurate,\u00a0the results will not reflect the true market value of the expropriated asset. Small changes in the\u00a0parameters can cause very significant differences in the outcomes.\n663. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of these risks, all experts agree that the results of a DCF-based model must be checked\u00a0using other valuation methods. Mr. Guitera proposes that they be compared with the value of\u00a0similar publicly traded companies, or with the actual price at which similar companies have been\u00a0sold.\nThe TribunaFs preference\n664. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the proposal of Mr. Guitera, as it reflects the most common practice in\u00a0this type of valuation.\n665. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek, meanwhile, also proposes that these methodologies be used, not as a \"sanity\u00a0check,\u201d but as independent values that the expert should weigh alongside the value calculated\u00a0using the DCF. The procedure proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek, though less common in practice,\n720\n721\n722\nExhibit NAV-20. Ibid.\nRV, par. 308.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\ncannot be described as wrong: If a methodology yields a divergent result, the weighting will moderate its impact. The draw back of this alternative is that the determination of the w eighting\u00a0percentages is highly subjective: There is no objective reason for using a 40/40/20 weighting\u00a0scheme, as opposed to a 60/20/20 scheme or even a 34/33/33 scheme. Mr. Kaczmarek himself has\u00a0been unable to provide an objective rationale for why his weighting scheme should be given\u00a0preference over other alternatives.\n666. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary , the Tribunal sides with the methodology proposed by Mr. Guitera and will use it to\u00a0determine the market value of the expropriated Companies. To this end it will develop its own\u00a0DCF model, determine the resulting valuation, and then check this valuation by comparing it to\u00a0the value obtained through the comparable-companies and comparable-transactions\u00a0methodologies.\n667. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, even though the Tribunal has sided on a theoretical level with the methodology\u00a0proposed by Mr. Guitera, as opposed to the one proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek, the use of one or\u00a0the other does not have a significant practical impact. Applying Mr. Guitera's methodology to\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s numbers would have the effect of increasing (not reducing!) the market value.\u00a0In fact, the DCF valuation of US$1.004 billion calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek is slightly below the\u00a0valuation resulting from the weighted average (US$1,000 billion for 100% of OldV and\u00a0Favianca).\nApplication of the methodology\n668. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek has designed a DCF methodology based on the Business Plan of the expropriated\u00a0Companies, which project the cash flows that the expropriated Companies would have reasonably\u00a0generated in the 2010-2020 period and which, when discounted at the discount rate deemed\u00a0reasonable by the expert, would lead to a valuation of US$1,004 billion (for 100% of both\u00a0Companies). The Respondent's expert, Mr. Guitera. accepts in general terms the model proposed\u00a0by Mr. Kaczmarek. including the 2010-2020 time framework, but he proposes that certain\u00a0adjustments be made in the cash flow estimates and discount rate, which would reduce the value\u00a0to US$195 million (again, referring to 100% of both Companies).723\n669. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although in absolute terms the results obtained by the two experts are vastly different, these\u00a0differences can actually be reduced to five parameters on which the experts maintain opposing\u00a0positions:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cost of goods sold;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Increase in sales price;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Development of exports;\n723 Joint Matrix, p. 2.\n01 European Group B.V. v.

Then, the Tribunal must determine the discount rate\u00a0to be applied (C.), which will allow for the calculation\u2014with the help of the Joint Matrix\u00a0prepared by both experts\u2014of the Companies\u2019 market value (D.). The Tribunal must then decide\u00a0whether this market value should be increased on the grounds that excess cash was expropriated\u00a0(E.) or decreased on the grounds that a discount should apply due to the Companies\u2019 specific\u00a0characteristics (F.). The resulting value will be checked by using other methodologies (G.), which\u00a0will lead to a final summary (H.).\nB. The four points of disagreement\na. The cost of goods sold\n671. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first parameter of the DCF model on which the experts disagree is the production cost of\u00a0goods sold, i.e. the total variable costs incurred by the Companies (raw materials, labor, energy.\u00a0transport724) to make the products that are later sold [\u201cCost of goods sold\u201d].\nPosition of the experts\n672. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his first report. Claimant\u2019s expert calculates the Cost of goods sold using the following\u00a0methodology ~\u20195:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the Cost of goods sold is variable, he considers it appropriate to determine it as a\u00a0percentage of total sales;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For years 2010-2013, the expert takes the percentages of the Cost of good s sold shown for\u00a0each year in the Business Plan of the Companies; \"\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For 2014-2020, Cost of goods sold is established as 63.7% of sales\u2014the average of the\u00a0percentages projected in the Business Plan for each year from 2010-2013,\n673. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera disagrees with these calculations in his first report.728 In his opinion, the percentages\u00a0proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek are too low. as they rely on the fact that traditionally in Venezuela\n24 There has been some confusion over whether Production Costs should or should not include depreciation; see Kaczmarek II, n. 52: the Tribunal w ill take the figures without depreciation.\nKaczmarek I. para. 84.\n726 Exhibit NAV-20.\n7 Excluding amortization - see Kaczmarek II, para. 78.\n28 Guitera I, para. 125.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nenergy costs have been heavily subsidized, a situation that in the long-term would not be sustainable. Therefore. Respondent\u2019s expert prepares a different projection:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the first five-year period, the Cost of goods sold will increase progressively until\u00a0reaching 70% 29 of sales in 2015;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As from 2016, the Costs will stabilize at 70%.\n674. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Republic\u2019s expert noted that the Companies generate a profit margin that is higher by\u00a0approximately 5% over that obtained by other companies of the Ol group in South America; in\u00a0his opinion, this increased profitability is due to subsidized energy prices in Venezuela and\u00a0cannot be maintained in the long-term.730\n675. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his second report. Mr. Kaczmarek defends his calculation and rejects Mr. Guitera\u2019s. In his\u00a0opinion, the Venezuelan Companies have consistently achieved operating results superior to those\u00a0of other subsidiaries of the OI group in South America. Having a decade of financial information\u00a0prior to 2010 that repeatedly shows such advantage, there is no reason to exclude it from future\u00a0projections.\n676. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera in turn reiterated in his second report the same conclusions reached in the first.732 In\u00a0his view, it is unrealistic to think that energy costs will remain static until 2020. and therefore he\u00a0believes that his model, which implicitly includes an increase in energy costs of 2.9% of sales in\u00a02010 to 7.9% in 2020, is more realistic. Even with this increase, energy costs for the Companies\u00a0would continue to be lower than the ty pical percentage applied in the glass industry, which would\u00a0be 15-25%.733\n677. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the hearing, both experts had the opportunity' to explain their positions. 734\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n678. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both experts are in agreement on the basic philosophy of how the Operating Costs are to be\u00a0calculated in the model. Because they are a variable expense, it is appropriate to determine them\u00a0as a percentage of sales. Where the two experts disagree is on the precise formula for calculating\u00a0that percentage:\n729 Including amortization 75% - see Kaczmarek II, para. 79.\n30 Guitera I, para. 129.\n1 Kaczmarek II, para. 80.\n\u25a0 Guitera I. para. 135.\nGuitera II, para. 159.\n734 Kaczmarek: HT, day 4 (English), 162:8 etseq.; Guitera; HT, day 5 (English), 101:6.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek uses the forecasts for the first quadrennium contained in the Business\u00a0Plan approved by the company, and for the remaining sexennium uses the average of the\u00a0percentages of the initial quadrennium, which is 63.7%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera. on the other hand, increases the percentage of costs proportionally until it\u00a0reaches 70% in 2015, and maintains this percentage unchanged until 2020.\n679. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the difference between the two experts is apparently minor, its impact on the market\u00a0value is very\u2019 significant: other things being equal, the value of the Companies falls by\u00a0approximately 30% from USD 1.004 billion to USD 701 million,735 depending on which forecast\u00a0is used.\n680. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After weighing the arguments of both experts, the arbitral Tribunal on this point favors the\u00a0Claimant\u2019s position. The following arguments justify this decision:\n681. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the arguments of the Claimant's expert are strengthened by the fact that his figures are\u00a0based on the Business Plan prepared by the Companies in 2010, before they were expropriated.736\u00a0In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this business plan has a high level of reliability:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was prepared by the Companies\u2019 Venezuelan managers, who, in their forecasts, used\u00a0historical, audited, and apparently very reliable financial data and their in-depth\u00a0knowledge of the Venezuelan market;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was prepared on a date which had no relationship with the current dispute, when there\u00a0was no indication that the Companies might be expropriated;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Its purpose was to prepare a model for the Companies' development and to create a\u00a0yardstick forjudging the quality of management: therefore, they had no incentive to make\u00a0overly optimistic projections, because if they were wrong it would reflect badly on their\u00a0judgment.\n682. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The figures proposed by Mr. Guitera, how\u2019ever, are of his own making, and there is no factual\u00a0basis to support them (the figure of 70%, which is central to his entire calculation is a simple\u00a0estimate, and no arguments have been put forward to justify it; nor is there any support for the\u00a0increase in energy costs from 2.9% of sales in 2010 to 7.9% in 2020).\n683. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the figures proposed by the Claimant's expert do not assume that the Cost of goods sold,\u00a0especially energy- costs, will remain static throughout the decade. These costs will increase in\n35 Joint Matrix, p. 2. 736 Exhibit NAV-20.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nproportion to sales, which increase as a result of inflation.737\n684. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Mr. Guitera starts from the premise that during the triennium 2007-2009 the Venezuelan\u00a0Companies obtained profits that consistently outperformed those made by other OI subsidiaries in\u00a0South America by 4-5% annually.738 In his opinion, this additional return is exclusively due to\u00a0low energy costs in Venezuela and it should disappear as the subsidies are reduced.\n685. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Mr. Guitera has not analyzed whether the higher profitability might be partly or wholly\u00a0due to other causes.\n686. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a fact that the Venezuelan Companies had two factories with the most advanced\u00a0technology,739 which had a dominant position in the market,740 and that the Venezuelan consumer\u00a0has a clear preference for glass.741 These factors might explain\u2014at least partly\u2014the superior\u00a0performance of OldV and Favianca compared to the other companies in the OI Group. Mr.\u00a0Guitera has not analyzed this alternative so as to rule it out, and this makes his figures less\u00a0capable of convincing.\n687. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, on the date of the expropriation (26 October 2010, which is the relevant date for making\u00a0the assumptions underlying the model) there was no indication at all that Venezuela intended to\u00a0change its energy policy.\n688. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bolivarian Republic is one of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, and for\u00a0decades it has been implementing a policy of low prices for domestic and industrial internal\u00a0consumption\u2014so much so that the low price of fuel is the main (or one of the main) competitive\u00a0advantages of Venezuelan manufacturing companies. The Respondent\u2019s expert has failed to\u00a0provide proof that in 2010 there was a perceived significant risk of increase in the industrial\u00a0prices of petroleum products.\n689. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, the records contain an internal OI report of October 2008, which analyses the\u00a0energy situation in Venezuela, and reaches the conclusion that\n\u201cWe do not foresee any energy price increase in Venezuela\u201d\u21222\n690. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifth, even assuming that the Bolivarian Republic were to decide to change its energy policy and\u00a0significantly increase fuel prices, the Venezuelan Companies would always have had the\u00a0opportunity to pass that increase in costs on to the final purchaser by raising prices\u2014especially\n737 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TA, day 4 (English), 164:3-9.\n738 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, para. 123.\n739 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See para. 88 supra.\n740 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C I, para. 38; C IV, para. 23-24.\n741 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Euromonitor Glass Returns to Growth: The Outlook in Food and Beverages, Exhibit NAV-02, p. 57.\n742 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhibit NAV-l 5, p. 32.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

This option is not merely theoretical, since the same internal OI report of 2008 that\u00a0concludes that the risk of price increases is low- also explicitly states that, if an increase were to\u00a0occur, it could be offset by passing the increased costs on to the customers: \\*\n\"The cost increment in energy is transferred to our customers thru price increases. \u201d\n691. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the Tribunal considers that the Cost of goods sold forecast by Mr.\u00a0Kaczmarek seem more reasonable than those forecast by Mr. Guitera. and therefore it opts for the\u00a0former.b. Increase in sales prices\n692. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second point of disagreement between the experts relates to the increase in sales prices of\u00a0glass.\nPosition of the experts\n693. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek bases his first report on the Business Plan prepared in 2010 by the Companies,\u00a0which projected an average annual increase in prices in the four years from 2010 to 2013 of\u00a030.6%, which is the result of adding an expected annual inflation rate of 28% plus a real annual\u00a0increase in prices of 2.6%.744 The expert considers these projections to be good, but for years\u00a02014-2020 he assumes that prices will not undergo additional real increases and that they would\u00a0only adjust for inflation (long-term projection of 14% annually).45\n694. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera analyses these expectations in his first report, agreeing with some of the projections\u00a0of Claimant\u2019s expert, but disagreeing w ith others. He agrees that from 2014 until 2020 the prices\u00a0of glass sold by the Companies will increase at the same rate as inflation. But he is not willing to\u00a0accept the expectation that in the four years from 2011-2013, prices will grow at a rate of 2.6%\u00a0above inflation.746\n695. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his second report, expert Mr. Kaczmarek stresses that historical results confirm his position, in\u00a0the five-year period from 2005 to 2009, the Companies were able to raise prices above inflation\n743 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhibit NA V-15. p. 32\n744 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I, para. 79.\n745 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I, para. 78.\n746 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, para. 109.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

These facts would justify an expected increase of 2.6% per y ear for the first four-year period. \\*\n696. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s arguments did not convince Mr. Guitera. in his second report, he accepts that\u00a0historically prices had risen above inflation, but he adds that historical comparisons are not a\u00a0sound basis to justify similar future increases.748 Specifically, he identifies two reasons why he\u00a0considers that the projected increases above inflation are unrealistic:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because the projected price increases for the four-year period of 2010 - 2013 contained\u00a0in the Business Plan show large variations, ranging from -1.8% in 2010 to +9.9% in 2012; the\u00a0expert particularly disagrees with the latter figure, as he does not find any justification to\u00a0support such a large increase;749\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the expert draws attention to the fact that significant price increases obtained in the\u00a0five-year period from 2005 - 2009 coincided with a growth phase of the Venezuelan per\u00a0capita GDP. However, after 2009 this indicator would begin to decline, suffering a decline of\u00a0- 2.8% that year. Mr. Guitera believes that in such a macroeconomic situation, it would be\u00a0impossible to raise prices.\n697. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the hearing, both experts explained their positions in this regard,\nThe Tribunal's Decision\n698. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two experts disagree on the sale prices of the glass manufactured by the Companies. They\u00a0agree that in the period 2014-2020 prices will increase in parallel with inflation (which is forecast\u00a0at 14% per year\u2014a point on which they also agree). They do not agree, however, on the price\u00a0increases in the first quadrennium (2010-2013). Mr. Kaczmarek takes the figures from the\u00a0Business Plan prepared by the management, which includes a real increase of 2.6% above\u00a0inflation, while Mr. Guitera argues that it should not be included.\n699. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal favors the position defended by Mr. Kaczmarek. for the following reasons:\n700. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First. Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s position is based on the figures contained in the Business Plan, for which,\u00a0in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, there is a presumption of reasonableness.\n701. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, on this point the Business Plan is pessimistic rather than optimistic. In the preceding\u00a0quinquennium (2004-2009) the Companies had managed to increase sale prices by 5.2% per year\n' Kaczmarek II, para. 116.\nGuitera II. para. 191.\n749 Guitera II, para, 193.\n511 Kaczmarek: HT, day 4 (English), p. 161 etseq.; Guitera: HT, day 5, p. 193 etseq.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nabove inflation. This justifies a forecast for the following quadrennium of 2.6%. which is exactly half the historical percentage increase.\nThe Respondent's Counter-arguments\n702. The Respondent has counter-argued that historical price increases have been possible as a result of\u00a0the economic boom in Venezuela during the years 2005-2008. but that this situation would have\u00a0changed in 2009, making a real price increase policy impossible in the future. As evidence of this\u00a0statement, Mr. Guitera uses the GDP per capita index in USD to purchase power parity which had\u00a0declined in 2009 and 2010, as seen in the follow ing chart:\nVenezuela GDP per capita (USD. Purchase Power Parity) and Associated Growth Rate\nGDa per capita PFP \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Growth rate\n703. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal cannot agree with this argument.\n704. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most common index for measuring a nation\u2019s growth rate is the increase in GDP growth\u00a0(positive or negative)\u2014an index which also appears in the graph prepared by Mr. Guitera.751\u00a0According to this indicator, the Venezuelan economy grew continuously during the sixennium\u00a0from 2005-2010 (in percentages, ranging from 5% to 15%), with no noticeable slow-down at the\u00a0end of the sixennium: in 2009 and 2010. growth rates were even higher than in 2005 and 2006.\u00a0From the graph prepared by the expert, indications are that during 2009 and 2010, GDP growth\u00a0was greater than 10%.\n705. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is evident, according to data from Mr. Guitera that the GDP per capita in USD in relation to the\u00a0purchase power parity entered into negative growth in 2009 and 2010. How can real GDP growth be\u00a0justified while GDP per capita in USD in relation to the pwchase power parity decreases? The expert\u00a0does not provide any justification and the Tribunal merely notes that one index is calculated based\n751 On the appropriate scale\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB 11/25\nAward\non VEB and the other on USD. and the differences could be due to the continuous devaluation of the VEB against the USD.\n706. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, regardless of the macro-economic realities which affect or fail to impact the\u00a0Venezuelan economy, such facts alone are unable to undermine the reasoning for the forecasts\u00a0outlined in the Business Plan, As the Venezuelan economy grows more or less at the macro level, it\u00a0does not necessarily determine the price which Companies receive from the sale of their range of\u00a0products at the micro level.\n707. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true with regard to fluctuations in price increases for each year of the quadrennium.\u00a0another of the counter-arguments advanced by the Respondent\u2019s expert. These fluctuations appear\u00a0to follow the forecasts of the guidelines regarding the introduction of new products into the market,\u00a0and do not detract from, but on the contrary, confirm the accuracy with which the forecasts were\u00a0made.\nc. The inclusion of imports\n708. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third point of disagreement between the experts concerns Companies' expectation of being\u00a0able to resume their exports.\nExperts\u2019 Position\n709. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its DCF model. Mr. Kaczmarek includes the exportation of glass, an activity which the\u00a0Companies had carried out up to 2006, which\u2014according to his assertions- there were plans to\u00a0restart in 2011. The projected exports represent 1.22% of the domestic sales for 2011, 2.44% for\u00a02012 and 3.66% for the years between 2013 and 2020/'\n710. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expert, Mr. Guitera estimates that it is illogical to envisage exports. In his opinion, exports in\u00a0the past have been erratic, and were based on promptly taking advantage of opportunities and not\u00a0on a rational growth strategy. Besides, there were hardly any exports from 2005.\n711. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his second report. Mr. Kaczmarek recognizes that from 2005, the export volume fell significantly. In\u00a0justifying this, he explains that in view of the high demand for glass bottles in Venezuela\u2019s domestic\u00a0market, in 2005, the Companies ceased exporting. Although in 2008 and 2009, they made attempts to\u00a0resume, administrative restrictions prevented them from doing so. The expert further states that the\u00a0average figure for exports in the quinquennium 2001 to 2005 w as 3.7% of total sales, and he reaffirms\u00a0that the forecasts were reasonable.754\n752 Kaczmarek 1, para. 76.\n' Guitera I. para. 101.\n754 Kaczmarek II, para. 123.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No, ARB/11/25\nAward\n712. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s line of argument did not satisfy the expert, Mr. Guitera. In his second report, the\u00a0latter places emphasis on the fact that the Business Plan does not include any export forecast, that\u00a0the cost structure worked out by Mr. Kaczmarek does not include any forecast whatsoever of\u00a0additional costs required for exports, and that from a distance of more than 250 miles, the\u00a0transportation of glass bottles reduces the competitiveness of the product755\n713. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his Summary of Conclusions, the Claimant insists that in the years 2007 and 2008, the Companies\u00a0would have resumed exporting, and that they failed to do so only because administrative restrictions\u00a0made it impossible. Proof of this resides in the fact that Venvidrio, the public Company which is not\u00a0subject to administrative restrictions would have resumed exports to Brazil in particular.7t\u2019 The\u00a0Respondent, on the other hand, reaffirms in his conclusions that there is absolutely no basis for\u00a0including possible exports in the DCF model.5\nThe IribunaTs Decision\n714. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, the Tribunal adopts position endorsed by the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, and agrees that it\u00a0is reasonable to include an exports projection in the DCF model. He reasons as follows:\n715. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, the Tribunal finds that both experts concur that until 2006, the Companies regularly\u00a0engaged in exporting, and that in that year they were suspended and not reinstated. However, it\u00a0finds the claim by the Claimant and its expert is credible in stating that the reason there were no\u00a0exports in 2008 and 2009 was not for a lack of interest on the part of the Companies but instead for\u00a0bureaucratic and currency control issues.\n716. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the Tribunal finds it likely that a hypothetical buyer would consider the fact that the\u00a0Companies previously had successful export activities, and it would assume that they could be\u00a0reinstated (especially given positive relations with the Administration that would in turn overcome\u00a0holdups) and it would include in the offer price a small premium to account for this potential\u00a0additional business. The difference between including and excluding the exports in the market\u00a0value is approximately USD 17 million, ceteris paribus. 58\n717. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good evidence that the Plants had export capacity and that a hypothetical buyer could have\u00a0recognized it is the fact that, after the expropriation and already under the control of Venvidrio,\u00a0they immediately began exporting in significant quantities.759\n55 Guitera II, para. 203.\n756 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para. 204.\n757 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RV, para. 344.\n58 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joint Matrix, pg. 2\n59 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, para 206: here, it states the problem with the value of the facts occurring after the appropriation. As Mr.\u00a0Guitera correctly states, what the Court has to calculate is the market value of the Companies as of the date of\u00a0expropriation that a hypothetical buyer would have paid for them, considering the information available at that time.\u00a0What is telling are the expectations as of the dale of expropriation. Later exports are only an indicator; the\u00a0determining factor is the expectations of a hypothetical buyer as of the date of valuation.\nOl European Group B.V. v, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n718. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is still a counter-argument to be analyzed. Though the Business Plan does not provide for\u00a0any export activity, the Tribunal understands that this exclusion is not an express w aiver of the\u00a0ability to export. Instead, it means that the Ol group directors had lost any hope that the\u00a0Administration would lift the administrative holdups preventing them.\nd. Capital expenditures (\u201ccapex\"} required to operate the business\n719. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fourth and final disagreement between the experts regarding the parameters of the DCF model\u00a0relates to the need for investment\u2014capex in financial jargon.\nExperts' position\n720. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) In his initial report, the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek starts from the investments anticipated in the\u00a0Business Plan prepared in 2010 by the Companies, to determine the capex necessary in the\u00a0quadrennium 2010-2013 (which amounts to 4%, 3%. 5% and 7% of sales anticipated, respectively ).\u00a0For the period 2014-2020, the expert estimates that investments will reach 6.4% of sales. He\u00a0arrives at this percentage by calculating the average for the decade 2004-2013.760\n721. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) On the other hand, the expert, Mr. Guitera estimates that these forecasts are extremely low.761\u00a0He understands that the Companies have been under-investing in the Plants, which would have\u00a0resulted in deterioration of their equipment. As evidence of this situation of under-investment, as\u00a0well as general deterioration of the Plants, the expert refers to\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information that would have facilitated the management of Venvidrio, and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a report on Envidrio [sic] for 2011, according to which the ovens were showing an elevated\u00a0level of wear.\n722. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to correct this situation of under-investment, the expert proposes that the investment\u00a0average for the 2000-2009 decade be used for the 2010-2020 period.\n723. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He also points out that Mr. Kaczmarek has selected the 2004-2013 decade to calculate the average\u00a0investment required, without taking into consideration the fact that in the years 2000-2003, the\u00a0investment percentage had been very high. In summary, in the quadrennium 2000-2003. the capex\u00a0percentage reached 20%, 16%, 16% and 10% of sales. This would support his opinion that the\n760 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I, para. 92.\n761 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, para. 147.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\naverage selected by Mr. Kaczmarek\u2014the 2004-2013 decade\u2014is not a good reference for establishing the investment levels required for the 2014-2020 period.\n724. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, taking into consideration the fact that the investment percentage in sales was 15.5%\u00a0in the quadrennium 2000 to 2003, and that it fell to 10% during the 2000-2010 period, the expert,\u00a0Mr. Guitera is exaggerating by using this last figure.762\n725. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iii) In his second report, the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek reaffirms the correctness of his calculation.\u00a0Upholding the statements of the directors of the OI, Messrs Machaen and Gomez, he denies that the OI\u00a0under-invested in their Venezuelan Plants, and in his appendix N, he provides the complete figures in\u00a0USD invested from 2000 to 2010 which range between a minimum of USD 10.6 million in 2004 and a\u00a0maximum of USD 23.5 million in 2006. Besides, he points out that in the years 2002 and 2006. there\u00a0was expansion in the production capacity installed (from 1,356 tons/day in 2002 to 1,433 tons/day in\u00a02006)\u2014which exceeds the capacity required by the DCF model, which goes only to 1,250 tons/day.763\n726. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iv) In his second report, Mr. Guitera explains that his calculation is based on investments in VEB\u00a0made in the period 2000-2010, which includes a sub-period of important investments related to\u00a0sales (2000-2003) and another of less significant investments (2004-2010). Throughout the period,\u00a0the average amount of investment w as 10% of sales, a percentage which the expert proposes to use\u00a0for the entire period 2010-2020. He emphasizes that for this calculation it is of no importance\u00a0whether the Plants are in poor condition as regards maintenance (as Venvidrio states), or not (as\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek claims).764\n727. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards amounts actually invested between 2000 and 2010, Mr. Guitera casts doubt on the USD\u00a0figures presented in appendix N to Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s report. In his opinion, these figures reflect the\u00a0investment amounts authorized by the parent company, whereas the relevant figures are in the\u00a0audited accounts of the Companies which are quoted in VEB. The expert compares both amounts\u00a0and finds discrepancies between them and those that have not been verified.765\n728. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera also analyses table 7 In the second report of the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, in which details of\u00a0repair wwk on the ovens, carried out in the period 2000-2010 is set out together with those anticipated\u00a0for the years 2011-2015. He points out that according to this table, in the quadrennium 2010-2013\u2014\u00a0the period to which the Business Plan refers\u2014it is anticipated that the ovens will be refurbished three\u00a0times. In his opinion, these projections require significant investment inputs, without which it would\n762 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, para. 154.\n763 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, para. 110.\n764 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera II, para. 164.\n765 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera II, para. 178.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

In his opinion, in order to calculate the average correctly, he should have\u00a0excluded a year, and he proposes the exclusion of the year 2010 (since it was in October of this\u00a0year that the Companies were expropriated). With this correction, the ten-year average would\u00a0exceed 10% (calculated on an 11-year basis) to 10.8 %\u2014which in turn, would require a reduction\u00a0of the market value of the Companies by approximately USD 50 million.769 Mr. Guitera promised\nto present new calculations in which the error would be corrected and this was done by the Parent\n770\ncompany.\n732. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(vii) In their Summary of Conclusions, the Claimant points out that Mr. Guitera has not taken into\u00a0consideration the Business Plan prepared by the Companies for the quadrennium 2010-2013, and\u00a0has changed this by a massive increase in the capital expenditure, amounting to USD 85 million,\u00a0without explaining what the investment had entailed.77'\n733. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(viii) The Respondent, for his part, indicates that his expert has used the data of a complete\u00a0industrial cycle, so as to be able to correctly forecast future data. As regards the life cycle of the\u00a0ovens, the witness, Mr. Machen would have referred to 10 years, while the other witness, Mr. Pazos,\u00a0would have extended this to 14 years.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n734. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This dispute revolves around the appropriate capex level that should be included in the DCF\u00a0model.\n735. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek proposes using two calculations: in the first quadrennium. he selects figures\u00a0contained in the Companies' Business Plan (some low percentages of 4%, 3.5%, 4.5% and 6.6%\u00a0on sales) and for the rest of the period (2014-2020) he takes the mean for the period of 20042013, which is 6.4%.\n736. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera, on the other hand (and after a clear error in his calculation was corrected) uses the\u00a0mean investment for the decade from 2000-2009 (10.8%) and applies it evenly over the period of\u00a02010-2020.\n737. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to resolve this dispute, the Tribunal will proceed as follows: (i) first, it will gather\u00a0available data regarding investments in the Companies; (ii) second, it will analyze the credibility\u00a0of the data used by the Companies in their Business Plan; next, it will do the same with the data\u00a0proposed by (iii) Mr. Kaczmarek and (iv) Mr. Guitera.\n(i) Available Data\n738. Historically, the Companies reached the following investment levels (in % on sales)772\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n[2010]\n20%\n16%\n16%\n10%\n6%\n9%\n9%\n9%\n6%\n7%\n[2%]\n739. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The year 2010 should be excluded from this historical series because that is when the\u00a0expropriation occurred, and therefore the data is not comparable.\n740. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, the other data shows that in the first three years of the decade, the investment level was\u00a0significant (16%-20%), and dropped in the following seven, fluctuating between a 6% low' and a\u00a010% high.\n741. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Business Plan that the Companies projected for the quadrennium 2010-2013 [showed]\u00a0significantly lower percentages:\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n4%\n3.5%\n4.5%\n6.6%\n72 Kaczmarek I, appendix D.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB,' 11/25\nAward\n(ii) Credibility of the Business Plan data\n742. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal continually expressed its respect for the data contained in the Business Plan\u00a0generated by the directors of the Companies, and it has generally accepted its projections as\u00a0satisfactory. It is questionable whether this acceptance should also be extended to the projected\u00a0investments.\n743. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doubt arises because the projected investments for the quadrennium 2010-2014 are. by far,\u00a0the lowest since the year 2000. which is when the historical series begins:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the decade 2000-2009, which predates the expropriation, the projected investment\u00a0never dropped lower than 6%; it remained at that level for two years, but was higher in\u00a0the remaining eight, reaching 16% in two years and even 20% in one;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0however, the Business Plan for the quadrennium 2010-2014 projects that in one year, the\u00a06% (the historical low) will repeat and in the remaining three, the percentage will be\u00a0approximately 4%, figures that are lower than the minimum in the historical series by one\u00a0third.\n744. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What could such low investment projections be attributed to?\n745. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, has not provided a specific answer to this question. He has limited\u00a0himself to accepting the figures because they appear in the Business Plan and reflect what the 01\u00a0group expected to invest in the Companies during the quadrennium.\n746. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera, on the other hand, maintains a different interpretation. In his opinion, the Companies\u00a0were already suffering an under-investment situation, which the Business Plan would only\u00a0exacerbate. The under-investment would be a decision considered by O1 group, which sought to\u00a0limit its losses and reduce the country risk in Venezuela.773\n747. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the Business Plan shows that in the next quadrennium OI was actually planning low\u00a0investment levels in its Venezuelan affiliates.\n748. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That, how\u2019ever, is not the problem to be addressed.\n749. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue is whether a hypothetical investor that reviewed the Companies\u2019 Business Plan would\u00a0have shared this attitude, agreed to include in its valuation that the investment levels in the first\u00a0quadrennium after purchase would be the decade\u2019s lowest by far. The doubt is bolstered by the\u00a0fact that O1EG has not justified the low investment levels projected for that quadrennium.\nTA, day 5 (English), pg. 105; TA, day 5 (Spanish) pg. 64\nOJ European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n750. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera theorizes that 01 group would not want to increase the country risk for Venezuela.\u00a0The Tribunal does not have any elements to validate or reject this theory . However, it finds that a\u00a0hypothetical buyer w'ould have the Plants undergo an exhaustive review, with results similar to\u00a0those reached by Venvidrio in the report it prepared for the Venezuelan government. Generally,\u00a0the latter found the Plants to be in good condition, although it found that certain ovens required\u00a0additional investments 4\n751. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This conclusion coincides with the Companies' plans themselves, which expected to have four\u00a0ovens undergo major repairs in the quinquennium 2011-2015. \\* This is shown in table 7 of\u00a0Kaczmarek\u2019s second report:\nTable 7 - Furnace Rebuild Schedule for Los Guayos and Valera, 2000 - 2015'\nYEAR\nLos Guavus Furnace Number\nValera Furnace Number\n102-A\n102-B\n102-C\n102-D\n102 -E\n1024\n145-A\n145-B\n345-C\nHistorical Furnace Rebuilds\n2000\nMinor\nMinor\n2001\n2002\nMaintenance\nMajor\nMaintenance\nMaintenance\nMaintenance\n2003\n2004\n2005\n20(W\n2007\nMinor\n2008\n2009\nMinoT\nMaintenance\nMaintenance\n2010\nMinor\nMaintenance\nPlanned Furnace Rebuild?\n2on\nMinor\nMajor\n2032\nMinor\n2073\nMajor\nMajor\nMinor\n2014\nMinor\n2015\nMajor\nMajor Rebuild and Capacity Expansion i 1 Major Rebuild I , \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, Minor Rebuild I...........

As Mr, Guitera notes,776 in the quadrennium 2010-2014 (covered by the Business Plan) three\u00a0major repairs were projected, while in the sexennium 2004-2009. only three had been completed.\u00a0Major oven repairs require large investments. It seems contradictory that in the quadrennium\u00a02010-2014:\nOn one hand, the investment rate in major oven repairs was projected to double,\n4 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preliminary Report by Envidrio, pgs. 36 and 37, Exhibit R-14.\n5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, table 7.\n776 Guitera II, para 108.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Boliv arian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and at the same time, reductions were projected in investment percentages (which would\u00a0go from a mean of 7.66% in the historical sexennium to 4.65% in the projected\u00a0quadrennium).\n753. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal concludes that the investment levels projected in the Business Plan for\u00a0the quadrennium 2010-2013 reflected the plans of 01, and that it was likely that a hypothetical\u00a0buyer would have rejected these investment levels, and substituted them for others which were\u00a0higher and closer to the mean of the historical average.\n(iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Credibility of the data proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek\n754. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the first quadrennium, Mr. Kaczmarek proposes using the investment levels included in the\u00a0Business Plan. For the years 2014-2020, he proposes taking the mean of the percentages for the\u00a010 years immediately preceding (2004-2013), which comes out to 6.4%.\n755. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mean proposed by the expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, (6.4%) is clearly too low:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because he excludes the calculation for the four years of the historical series, when\u00a0the investment was higher (2000-2003: 20%; 16%, 16%; 10%). and replaces them with\u00a0the projection of the Business Plan for the quadrennium 2010-2013 which, for\u00a0unsubstantiated reasons, projects minimum investment levels (4%; 3.5%; 4.5%; 6.6%);\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, because the 6.4% that he selects is the lowest piece of date in the historical\u00a0series, equaled only in the years 2004 and 2008; which the eight remaining entries in the\u00a0historical series are all above 6% (and some significantly higher).\n756. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the projection by Mr. Kaczmarek for the sexennium 2014\n2020 (6.4%) is too optimistic, given that, historically, the Companies\u2019 investment levels had been significantly higher.\n(iv) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Credibility of the data proposed by Mr. Guitera\n757. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposal by Mr. Guitera involves two decisions:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it means not considering the projections contained in the Business Plan;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, [it means] establishing a single percentage for the period of 2010-2020, which in\u00a0the opinion of the expert must be equal to the mean reached in the prior decade (20002009). which is 10.8%.\n758. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both proposals by Mr. Guitera seem reasonable.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB I 1/25\nAward\n759. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has already explained why it finds that the projections in the Business Plan for the\u00a0quadrenniuni 2010-2013 must not be considered. It would therefore seem reasonable to assume\u00a0that a hypothetical buyer would have included in his valuation model for the Companies some\u00a0higher investment percentages starting with the acquisition period itself.\n760. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which ones?\n761. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera proposes adopting the mean investment percentage resulting from the historical\u00a0series of the last decade prior to expropriation (2000-2009) and applying it equally over the\u00a0period of 2010-2020. This is conflicting data taken from annual audited accounts that cover a\u00a0long series coinciding approximately with the life cycle of glass manufacturing machinery'. The\u00a0proposal by the expert. Mr. Guitera. seems reasonable and the Tribunal adopts it.\nC. Discount rate\n762. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once the Tribunal has settled the four points of disagreement regarding the DCF model in\u00a0discussion with the experts, it remains to establish the rate at which future fluctuations in the funds\u00a0generated by the Companies will be discounted, so as to bring them up-to-date financially with\u00a0regard to the expropriation. On this question, the experts are in agreement that the appropriate\u00a0discount rate is the WACC (the weighted average cost of capital), but they again disagree on the\u00a0exact quantification: Mr. Kaczmarek proposes 20.39% while Mr. Guitera proposes 25.78% (bear in\u00a0mind that the greater the discount rate, the less will be the market value of the company).\n763. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before analyzing this discrepancy, the Tribunal would like to establish that the calculation of the\u00a0discount rate is only useful in specific cases, and that the conclusions reached in a particular\u00a0proceeding cannot be generalized and may not be mechanically extrapolated as regards another\u00a0situation\u2014even though one is dealing with a company in a similar sector, and one in the same country'.\u00a0The calculation is a specific task, which depends on the individual characteristics of each case,\u00a0especially given the way in which the Company is being financed, how each DCF model is\u00a0constructed and alternatives selected by the experts. There is no single formula for calculating the\u00a0discount rate. Moreover, in each case, the decision of a tribunal is predetermined by the arguments and\u00a0counter-arguments made and the proof brought forw ard by the experts and the parties.\na. Model developed by Kaczmarek\n764. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his first report, Mr. Kaczmarek concludes that the appropriate discount rate, that is to say, the\nCompanies\u2019 WACC, should be 20.39%. In arriving at this total, the expert takes the following\n\u2014.777\nsteps:\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nCost of equity\n765. (i) He first calculates the cost of equity, applying the CAPM formula:\nFigure 18 - CAPM Formula\nCAPM = Rf + ft \\* EMRP + CRPWhere:Rf = Risk Free Rate of Return ft = BetaEMRP = Equity Market Risk Premium CRP = Country Risk Premium\n766. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this formula, each of the items has the following values:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rf: is the total US bond yield (2.06%), plus the expected rate of inflation in Venezuela\u00a0(16.45%). totaling 18.85%;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0f): represents the volatility of a particular company with regard to the overall market; since\u00a0tills has not been quoted by the Companies, the expert calculates it based on a number of\u00a0companies with similar characteristics; after balancing the result, the expert arrives at a\u00a0figure of 0.613;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EMRP: is the investment premium for equity; the expert estimates this at\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05%.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CRP: this refers to the country risk premium, which Mr. Kaczmarek establishes to\u00a0be 2%.\n767. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using these values, the expert calculates the cost of equity to be 23.91 %.778\nDebt cost\n768. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) The next step is to determine the debt cost, after tax. For that, he uses the average rate of\u00a0interest on loans in VEB to companies in Venezuela over the three-vear period prior to\u00a0expropriation, which is 20.65%. Having deduced that there is a negative impact (at a rate of 34%),\u00a0the debt cost after taxes remains at 13.63%.\n' Kaczmarek I, para. 117.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nWACC\n769. (iii) Once the costs of equity and the debt have been determined, the expert will then be in a\u00a0position to calculate the WACC (which equals the discounted rate). To do so. take the capital\u00a0structure of competitor companies in the packaging sector, as informed by Bloomberg. The average\u00a0capital structure of these comparable companies was 66% equity and 34% debt. Accepting these\u00a0weighted averages, the Companies\u2019 WACC is established at 20.39%. pursuant to the following\u00a0chart:\nTable 16 - Average Weighted Capital Cost of the Business Company OldV1\"\nWACC Component\nAmount\nCapital Cost\n23.91%\n% of Capital\n66%\nCost of Debt after Taxes\n13.63%\n% of Debt\n34%\nCost of Weighted Average Capital\n20.39%\nPoints of Disagreement by Mr. Guitera\n770. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera generally accepts the system for calculating the discounted rate proposed by Mr.\nKaczmarek, but he disagrees on the way in which Mr. Kaczmarek has calculated five items:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, he disagrees with the CRP calculation; this is the country risk in which Mr.\u00a0Kaczmarek proposes a 2% premium and Mr. Guitera proposes a 6% premium (b).\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, he disagrees on the amount set for the beta in which Mr. Kaczmarek is alleging\u00a00.613, whereas Mr. Guitera prefers 0.687 and he disagrees on the debt to equity ratio to be\u00a0used in the calculation (c).\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, he disagrees with the cost of the before taxes debt, which Mr. Kaczmarek believes\u00a0should be 20.65% and Mr. Guitera believes should be 22.42% (d); and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth. Mr. Guitera wishes to add a specific risk premium due to the Companies' features of\u00a02% that Mr. Kaczmarek rejects (e).\n771. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In applying these four items to the WACC formula as Mr. Guitera proposes the result is a\u00a0discounted rate of 25.78%.\nb. Country\u2019 Risk\n772. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek proposes applying a country risk rate of 2% to the Bolivarian Republic of\nVenezuela, whereas Mr. Guitera proposes a rate of 6%.\nOl European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nFinding of the Tribunal\n773. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rate of 6% proposed by Mr. Guitera is derived from the country risk table developed by Prof.\u00a0Damodaran. who is without a doubt an important authority on assessing companies' worth and who\u00a0publishes tables on country' risk for all countries in the world. The proposal by the Defendant's\u00a0expert is consistent with what the usual practices are for assessing companies: one uses the tables\u00a0with calculations of risk premiums by countries and one applies the number proposed by the table.\u00a0These tables generally make the calculation by comparing the public debt spreads of different\u00a0countries as w'ell as other ancillary7 factors. Of all of the existing tables, Prof. Damodaran's tables\u00a0are the most universal.\n774. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the Tribunal establishes, as its first finding, that the calculation made by Mr. Guitera is\u00a0consistent with the normal practice in the financial world of assessing companies.\nMr. Kaczmarek's proposal\n775. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rate proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek for Venezuela's country risk is the comparatively low figure\u00a0of 2%, which on Prof. Damodaran's tables corresponds to the country risk of a country like Italy .\n776. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How can one justify his proposing to apply to Venezuela a country risk corresponding to Italy,\u00a0which is a country that at first blush would seem to be more stable and predictable?\n777. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The explanation that the expert offers is as follows: the government of the Bolivarian Republic of\u00a0Venezuela has been implementing a policy of expropriations and it has repeatedly expropriated\u00a0privately owned companies. This government policy causes a general depreciation in the value of\u00a0Venezuelan companies and this general effect should be excluded from the model. He therefore\u00a0proposes that the legal, regulatory' and policy risks that are controlled by the State be excluded from\u00a0the calculation of the discounted rate. \u201c As a result, Mr. Kaczmarek, even if he agrees that\u00a0according to Prof. Damodaran\u2019s tables the country risk for Venezuela is 6%, believes that for the\u00a0purposes of calculating the value of expropriated companies this should be lowered to a simple 2%.\n778. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not share the expert's position for the following reasons:\n779. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First of all, because the figure of 2% is simply an estimate made by Mr. Kaczmarek and there is no\u00a0indication of the methodology used for the calculation, nor has the basis for it been demonstrated in\u00a0outside sources.\n780. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, a risk premium of 2% is one that corresponds to a countiy like Italy, not to a country like\u00a0Venezuela. An investor who is considering making the same investment in a developed country or,\u00a0alternatively, in a developing country, will frequently choose the developed country, unless he is\u00a0offered an opportunity' to obtain higher profits in the developing country. This disadvantage that\n779 CV, par. 211.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB,'11/25\nAward\ndeveloping countries have is what is captured through the country risk premium. It makes no sense for Italy and Venezuela to share the same premium level.\n781. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third. Mr. Kaczmarek seeks to justify the 2% premium and dismisses the 6% premium by referring\u00a0to the \"negative messages in the business environment about potential expropriations\u201d780 that\u00a0Venezuela would have generated.\n782. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it is true that the numerous expropriations that have occurred in Venezuela may be perceived\u00a0by investors as \"negative messages,\u201d it has not been demonstrated that those negative messages\u00a0have managed to cause a four percentage point increase in Venezuela's country risk premium. Prof.\u00a0Damodaran\u2019s calculation is based on the Venezuelan public debt non-compliance spread, which is\u00a0approximately 4% multiplied by the relative volatility of the stock markets vis-a-vis the debt\u00a0markets, which is a factor of 1.5./' This calculation bears no relation whatsoever with the\u00a0microeconomic policies implemented by the Republic.\n783. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal finds that in the CAPM formula, the \u201cCRP\u201d addend, which is\u00a0Venezuela's country risk, should be equal to 6, as proposed by Mr. Guitera, and not equal to 2, as\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek alleges.\nc. Calculating the beta coefficient and the debt-to-equity ratio\n784. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two experts disagree on technical aspects of the calculation of the 3 coefficient and the debt-to-equity ratio: Mr. Kaczmarek proposes a p coefficient of 0.613 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 34/66\u00a0(52%), while Mr. Guitera prefers a p of 0.687 and a ratio of 29/71 (41 %).782\nCalculation of the P coefficient\n785. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The disagreement over the calculation of the p has a bearing on a technical point: whether the\u00a0average of the listed companies used to calculate the p should be weighted or simple.

Assuming that the weightings are reasonable, a weighted average will be more accurate than a simple average. At no time has Mr. Guitera said that the weightings given\u00a0by Mr. Kaczmarek are inappropriate\u2014his line of argument is that weighting is rare in practice.78'\u00a0Debt-to-equitv ratio\n788. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two experts also disagree on how to calculate the debt-to-equity ratio needed to regear the p\u00a0and determine the WACC.\n789. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek made the calculation by using a sample of 16 companies in the packaging sector,\u00a0which is a broader sample than that used to calculate the p. 786 The Respondent\u2019s expert does not\u00a0agree. In his opinion, the sample should have been the same.787\n790. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal, while recognizing that both approaches are reasonable, opts for Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s\u00a0solution, not so much because its methodology is more convincing, but because the results obtained\u00a0seem more accurate.\n791. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek adheres to the following methodology: he identifies a sample of seven listed\u00a0companies that are comparable to the Companies and uses the weighted average of the p\u00a0coefficients to determine the ungeared p of the expropriated companies. He then regears the P\u00a0coefficients, using the debt-to-equity ratio not of those seven companies, but of a sample of 16\u00a0companies. This same ratio is then used in the calculation of the WACC. The expert justifies the\u00a0use of the two samples by arguing that the first represents the greatest possible similarity to the\u00a0expropriated Companies, while the second represents the packaging industry in general.788\n792. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera disagrees: in his opinion, the same sample should have been used for the calculation of\u00a0the P, for its regearing, and for the calculation of the WACC. He considers that Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s\u00a0methodology creates unacceptable inconsistencies and distorts the calculations, and it is something\u00a0which he has never seen applied.789\n793. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From a strictly methodological point of view, the Tribunal tends to share Mr. Guitera\u2019s position. It\u00a0seems preferable that the same sample be used for the calculation of the p, for its regearing, and for\u00a0the calculation of the WACC, which are three interrelated calculations. This does not mean that the\u00a0methodology adopted by Mr. Kaczmarek is erroneous because calculation of the WACC is not an\u00a0exact science, and the rules of the art allow the use of different methodologies.\n785 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which does not appear to be proven; the use of the weighted average enjoys academic support: Grimblat &\u00a0Titman, \u201cFinancial Markets and Corporate Strategy,\u201d 2nd edition, 2002, p. 386; Exhibit NAV-125.\n786 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, para. 151.\n787 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera II, para. 184.\n788 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, para. 153.\n789 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera II, para. 246.\nOl European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n794. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reality, however, the practical application made by Mr. Guitera leads to results that are not\u00a0reasonable: he takes the same sample of seven values developed by Mr. Kaczmarek (which the\u00a0latter had chosen, not because they represent the industry, but because they are similar to the\u00a0Companies) and uses it to make the triple calculation. The result is a debt-to-equity ratio of 29/71\u00a0(41%). which indicates that in the global packaging industry more than 70% of funding is obtained\u00a0from equity' capital and less than 30% comes from outside sources; in other words, the level of\u00a0gearing is very low.\n795. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek has provided convincing ev idence to show that such a low level of gearing is not\u00a0reasonable and that the figure which he proposes (34/66 or 52%) is more accurate. For this we refer\u00a0to Ibbotson\u2019s Cost of Capital Report, a reputable source, which gives a ratio of 61% for the glass\u00a0industry in 2O1O.790 He has also provides the opinion of an analyst in 2010, which gives one a ratio\u00a0of 55.9% for the packaging industry.791\n796. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why is it that Mr. Guitera. while applying a better methodology, reaches inappropriate results? The\u00a0reason is probably that by mimetically copying the sample of seven companies created by Mr.\u00a0Kaczmarek he is using an inadequate sample. It would have been appropriate to create his own\u00a0sample and apply it consistently in the triple calculation.\n797. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the Tribunal considers that the data calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek are more accurate\u00a0and reasonable, and opts to use a 3 of 0.613 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 34/66 (52%).\nd. Cost of Debt\n798. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another point on which the experts disagree is the cost of debt.\n799. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek takes as a reference the average cost of financing for companies, expressed in\u00a0Venezuelan currency, in the three years prior to the date of expropriation and arrives at a figure of\u00a020.65% (which is reduced to 13.63% after tax).792\n800. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera does not agree with that calculation. Although he accepts that it is nonnal to use\u00a0historical data to determine the cost of debt when valuing companies, he considers that this\u00a0methodology is not appropriate in this case. \" His reason for considering this is that if market\u00a0interest rates are taken in the quadrennium 2007-2010 and inflation in Venezuela during these years\u00a0is deducted, the real rates are negative (varying between - 2% and - 11%). In his opinion, negative\u00a0real rates cannot be maintained over the long term, and therefore he considers that the rate of\n79 Exhibit NAV-147 - this is data for the year 2010: the average of the past years is significantly less.\n791 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jeffereys & Company, Exhibit NAV-11; not 52% as erroneously stated in Kaczmarek II, para. 154.\n792 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I, para, 118,\n793 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera II, para. 198.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. A RB/11/25\nAward\n20.65%, calculated bv Mr. Kaczmarek. is not realistic. He proposes that it be replaced with a rate calculated with a different formula, which give a result of 22 41 %.\n801. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal rejects Mr. Guitera's proposal.\n802. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because the interest rate that he proposes\u201422.41%\u2014does not solve the problem that he hopes\u00a0to solve: Even if this percentage had been applied, the real rates of interest in the years 2008. 2009\u00a0and 2010 would still have been negative (because actual inflation was greater than 22.41%).\n803. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And secondly because Mr. Guitera is comparing apples to oranges. His objection is based on\u00a0comparing the 20.65% cost of debt proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek with historical inflation in the\u00a0quadrennium prior to the expropriation. But that is not the relevant calculation. The proper\u00a0comparison is with the inflation forecast in the DCF model. And this amounts to 14%. When this is\u00a0compared to a cost of debt of 20.65% it is found that the model incorporates a positive real interest\u00a0rate of more than 6%. The problem raised by the expert is not really a problem.794\ne. Specific risk premium\n804. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr, Guitera also adds a 2% specific risk premium to the cost of equity . He justifies its inclusion by\u00a0arguing that the Companies are highly dependent on the Polar Group, a single customer which\u00a0accounts for more than 70% of sales. This risk would not be reflected by the p or by the country\u00a0risk premium. 95\n805. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek disagrees with that approach. He argues, on the one hand, that the Companies were\u00a0the largest producer of glass in Venezuela, and. on the other, that the Polar Group was its major\u00a0customer and at the same time owned a significant (but minority') stake in the Companies. Because\u00a0of that, OI and Polar were mutually dependent on each other: the Companies could not impose\u00a0prices on Polar, because it was their largest customer, and conversely Polar needed them so that it\u00a0could obtain containers in the required quantities, because there were no other manufacturers that\u00a0could meet the demand.\n806. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, a hypothetical buyer would view the relationship with Polar\u2014the main customer and\u00a0minority shareholder\u2014as a factor that mitigated, rather than aggravated, the risk. For this reason,\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek is opposed to the inclusion of an additional specific risk premium to cover a\u00a0hy pothetical risk which in his opinion does not exist, and which is, on the contrary, a positive\u00a0factor.796\n794 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TA, day 5 (English), p. 119: TA, day 5 (Spanish), p. 70: CV, para. 227.\n795 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera 1, para. 191\n796 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, para. 144; Kaczmarek: TA, day 4 (English), p. 176; TA, day 4 (Spanish), 106:32-107:9.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n807. The Tribunal considers that on this point Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s approach is convincing for the following\u00a0reasons:\n808. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because of the highly subjective nature of the 2% adjustment proposed by the expert Mr.\u00a0Guitera, who recognizes that there is no scientific basis for the calculation:\n\u201c/ have decided to include in the cost of capital a Specific Company Risk Premium, which I believe, based on my experience as a Transaction Service Partner, should amount to 2%\u201d797\n809. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, because it does not seem likely that a hypothetical buyer would consider the dual\u00a0relationship with Polar\u2014the most important customer and a minority shareholder\u2014as a risk factor.\u00a0Rather, it seems more likely that a buyer would accept the relationship with the main Venezuelan\u00a0food group\u2014a relationship that had already been in existence for many years and which was always\u00a0friendly, as a positive factor that would reduce risk and strengthen the stability of the Companies.\n810. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the relationship between Polar and the Companies has been and still is one of mutual\u00a0dependence. The Companies need Polar as a buyer, and Polar has no real option that would allow it to\u00a0purchase containers from other manufacturers in the Bolivarian Republic. Strong evidence of this is\u00a0seen in what has happened since the expropriation: although Polar too was expropriated, it continues\u00a0to purchase most of its containers from the Factories.\nD. Market Value\n811. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having clarified and settled all discrepancies between the two experts, the Tribunal is now in a\u00a0position to calculate the correct discount rate (WACC). In order to do this it is necessary to calculate\u00a0the cost of equity and the cost of debt so that they can then be weighted.\nResources owned\n812. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cost of equity is obtained by using the CAPM formula:\n797 Guitera II, para. 195.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB, 11/25\nAward\nFigure 18 - CAPM Formula\nCAPM = Rf + S EMRP + CRP\nWhere:\nRf = Risk Free Rate of Return Beta\nEMRP = Equity Market Risk Premium CRP = Country' Risk Premium\n813. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The values accepted by the Tribunal are the following:\nRf (Risk Free Rate of Return): 18.85%\nB: 0.613\nEMRP (Equity Market Risk Premium): 6%\nCRP (Country Risk Premium): 6%\n814. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inserting the values in the formula gives a cost of equity of 27.92%.\nDiscount Rate\n815. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cost of the debt and the debt/equity ratio are calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek at 13.63% and 34/66.\n816. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following discount rate results from these figures:\nWACC = [27.92 x 0.66] + [13.63 x 0.34]\nWACC = 23.06% = 23%\n817. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal thus concludes that the correct discount rate is 23%.\nMarket value of the Companies\n818. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once it was calculated that 23% is the appropriate rate for discounting the DCF method for the\u00a0Companies, the Tribunal can move on to detennining their market value. For this, the Joint Matrix\u00a0prepared by both experts, denominated in USD\u2014as this is the currency in which Claimant is\u00a0requesting compensation\u2014should be used:\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n819. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has opted for the following solutions:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): Mr. Kaczmarek798\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capex (investments): Mr. Guitera799\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sales (increase in sales prices): Mr. Kaczmarek800\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exports: Mr, Kaczmarek801\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discount rate: 23%\n820. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adding these values to the Joint Matrix yields USD 487,275,939 as a value for the Companies,\u00a0which the Tribunal accepts.\nE. Excess Cash\n821. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is an established fact that the Bolivarian Republic expropriated not only the Plants, but also all the\u00a0funds held in cash and in the banks [\u2018\u2019Cash\"],802 which amounted to VEB 151 million. This amount\u00a0was very significant and was due to the difficulties encountered by the Companies in repatriating\u00a0their profits.803\n798 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See para. 691 supra.\n799 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See para. 761 supra.\n800 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See para. 699 supra.\n801 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See para. 714 supra.\n802 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See para. 342 supra.\n\\* Kaczmarek I, para, 149.\nOJ European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nExperts' position\n822. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both experts accept that the value of the Companies calculated using the DCF methodology does\u00a0not result in the Cash surplus which the companies may be holding unlaw fully, far in excess of the\u00a0amount required to guarantee their normal operations. It is. therefore, necessary to increase the\u00a0value of the Companies by an amount that reflects this surplus. Both experts are also in agreement\u00a0on the most suitable methodology to be used in calculating it by\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defining a sample of similar companies;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determining their Cash to Total Assets Ratio;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying this percentage to the assets of the Companies;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using this methodology to calculate the required cash level;\nthe amount over that minimum represents the Cash surplus that must be paid by the Claimant to the Respondent.\n823. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having agreed on the methodology\u2019, the experts are however in disagreement on the company\u00a0sample that must be used for comparison purposes.\n824. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek proposes utilizing the same sample of seven similar companies, which he had\u00a0already used to calculate (I.804 Using this sample, he concludes that the average Cash to Assets Ratio\u00a0is 5.1%; applying this percentage to the Companies, he concludes that the required amount of cash\u00a0increases to VEB 52 million, which when converted into USD at the exchange rate of 4.3, results in\u00a0an amount of USD 23,064,801.\n825. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera is taking a different approach. He is of the opinion that of the seven companies in the\u00a0sample, only one is comparable, namely Rigolleau S.A. Therefore, he only uses the Cash to Assets\u00a0Ratio of this company as a point of reference, which is 10.5%, and which results in a Cash surplus\u00a0of VEB 45 million, which is equivalent to USD 10,562.275.815\nThe Tribunal s Decision\n826. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal finds that Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s calculation is appropriate.\n827. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera only chooses one company for comparison and that company is, among the seven in the\u00a0sample, the one with the largest Cash holdings. By choosing this company as a comparison, Mr.\u00a0Guitera is distorting the result. Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s method, based on the average amount of Cash held\n804 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek 1, para. 149.\n805 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera 1, para. 267.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nby the same sample that was already used to calculate the 6 ensures a result that more faithfully reflects the levels of Cash in entities that are comparable to the Companies.\n828. In summary, the Tribunal decides that the excess in Cash that has been taken away must be added to\u00a0the value of the Companies established by the DCF method (USD 487,275,939), totaling USD\u00a023,064,801, thereby resulting in a total value for 100% of the Companies of USD 510,340,740.\nF. Company Specific Discount\n829. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is one last point to be analyzed in order to establish the correct market value of the\u00a0Companies: the proposal from the expert, Mr. Guitera that a discount be applied to the Companies\u00a0for their specific characteristics.\na. Position of the Experts and the Parties\n830. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his first report, Mr. Guitera introduces the notion that the value of the Companies generated by the\u00a0DCF Model should be the cause for a reduction based on a lack of liquidity (\u201clack of marketability\" in\u00a0English terminology used by the expert).806 In his opinion, the need to apply such a discount, which he\u00a0establishes at 20% is based on two reasons:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Restrictions on the sale imposed by the OldV and Favianca bylaws, and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of a series of statutory laws in favor of Polar, which limits the capacity of the\u00a0potential buyer to manage the Companies.\n831. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expert recognizes that in this case the discount is not linked to the total valuation of the\u00a0Companies, but only to the value of their shares held by OIEG.807\n832. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the percentage of 20% which he is advocating, the expert explains that pursuant to\u00a0the Private Equity Valuation Guidelines, a discount in the range of between 10% and 30% is\u00a0appropriate, from which he has selected the middle value.8\\*\u20198\n833. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek on his part advises against the application of the discount. He supports this based on\u00a0the following major arguments:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, he underscores that M&A is intensively involved in the packaging sector; he has\u00a0managed to identify 113 transactions during the quinquennium preceding the\u00a0expropriation;800 it would be unreasonable to apply a discount for reasons of lack of\u00a0liquidity in this sector;\n80\u00b0 Guitera I, para. 250.\n807 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, para. 253.\n808 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, para. 258.\n809 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I, para. 163 and Appendix F2.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, a discount for lack of liquidity would be particularly inappropriate in the case of\u00a0Companies which are a part of a group quoted on the Stock Exchange, whose annual\u00a0accounts are subject to review and scrutiny and by themselves are significant entities,\u00a0which generate significant amounts of cash flow\u2122\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, he alleges that a discount for a lack of liquidity is not compatible with the market\u00a0value standard, which is the one that ought to be used in estimating the cost of the\u00a0Companies; the standard presupposes that there is a purchaser ready to purchase and to pay\u00a0the market value of the company.811\n834. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the hearing, both experts had the opportunity to present their arguments.812\n835. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their Closing Statements both parties expounded on their arguments. For the Respondent, the\u00a0OldV and Favianca bylaws restrict the possibilities for the sale of OIEG and its management\u00a0capacity, and these terms make it difficult to find a purchaser and would also decrease the price.813\u00a0The Claimant, on the other hand, alleges that Polar\u2019s only right would be to block the purchase by\u00a0competitive companies in the beverages sector.814\nb. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision\n836. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant on this point in that in order to determine the market value\u00a0of the Companies, which is required under article 6(c) of the Agreement on Encouragement and\u00a0Reciprocal Protection of Investments betw een the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of\u00a0Venezuela, it would not be appropriate to apply a discount for lack of marketability to the value\u00a0calculated using the methodology accepted by both experts and based on the DCF.\n837. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expert, Mr. Guitera, asserts that on certain occasions, it may be appropriate to apply a discount\u00a0for lack of marketability that reduces the price that must be paid when purchasing equity interest in\u00a0a company. In this case, the expert has identified two causes that, in his opinion, justify such a\u00a0discount:815\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first consists of the sales restrictions contained in the bylaws of Favianca and OldV, and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second consists of the joint management rights granted to Polar under such bylaws.\n810 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, paras. 165 and 168.\n811 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek 11, para. 170.\n812 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek: HT, day 5 (English), pg. 40; HT, day 5 (Spanish), pg. 26.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n838. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the expert's opinion, the restrictions contained in the bylaws would result in a willingness by\u00a0all potential buyers\u2019 to only purchase OIEG\u2019s 73% interest in the Companies if a 20% discount\u00a0on the standard market price were applied.\n839. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to determine whether the proposal made by the Respondent\u2019s expert is reasonable, the\u00a0bylaws of OldV816 and Favianca81 must be carefully reviewed. These two documents, while\u00a0differing in the manner in which their articles are numbered, govern ihe causes in question in a\u00a0practically identical manner.\nRestrictions on Unrestricted Transfer Contained in the Bylaws\n840. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bylaws contain two restrictions on the unrestricted transfer of shares:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first consists of a prohibition on transfers: O1EG agrees that it will not transfer\u00a0Company shares to \u201cany person directly or indirectly involved in any of Polar\u2019s main\u00a0lines of business\u2019\" (including beer, wine, mineral water, non-alcoholic beverages, and oil)\u00a0without Polar's permission.8'8\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second grants Polar the right of first refusal in the event OIEG decides to relinquish\u00a0control over the Companies. This right must be exercised at the same price (\u201cFirst Price\u2019\u2019)\u00a0offered by the potential buyer.819\n841. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the opinion of the Tribunal, neither of these two restrictions should significantly affect the\u00a0price a third party would be willing to pay for the OIEG block of shares:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first should not because, as Mr. Kaczmarek has demonstrated, of the 35 purchase\u00a0transactions involving glass companies that took place during the quinquennium prior to\u00a0the expropriation, not one involved a purchase by a drink manufacturer. Drink\u00a0manufacturers are not natural buyers of glass companies.820\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second should not because Polar\u2019s right of first refusal is set at the same price as the\u00a0price offered by third parties (not at book value or a value set by an auditor); therefore, all\u00a0third parties attempting to purchase the OIEG block of shares must at least offer the\u00a0market price for such block. Otherwise, Polar (a very strong company) would exercise its\u00a0right, purchase OIEG\u2019s equity interest at below-market price, and then either keep it or\u00a0resell it at market price and keep the difference. For this reason, Polar's right of first\n816 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhibit C-l.\n817 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exhibit C-2.\n818 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This restriction is present in article 11 of OldV\u2019s and article 13 of Favianca\u2019s bylaws. Mr. Guitera makes errors\u00a0when referring to the articles.\n810 This restriction is present in articles 9 and 10 of OldV\u2019s and articles 11 and 12 of Favianca\u2019s bylaws. Mr. Guitera makes errors w'hen referring to the articles.\n820 Closing Brief, paragraph 245; Exhibit F2 of Kaczmarek I.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nrefusal would not lead to a price reduction and might, in fact, result in an increase. All third parties truly interested in purchasing would end up offering a premium on the\u00a0market price to decrease Polar\u2019s incentive to exercise the right.\nSupermajority Voting Rights\n842. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 29 of OldV\u2019s and article 32 of Favianca\u2019s bylaws grant Polar certain supermajority\u00a0voting rights.821 Both articles state that as long as Polar holds at least 18.49% interest,\u00a0resolutions adopted regarding \u201cFundamental Matters\u201d (which include the matters that already\u00a0require a supermajority vote in accordance with article 280 of the Commercial Code as well as\u00a0certain financing or related-party transactions) require the consent of both shareholders\u00a0(regardless of whether a resolution is adopted by the members of the shareholders\u2019 meeting or\u00a0the board of directors).\n843. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the opinion of the Tribunal that a minority shareholder\u2019s being granted these rights under\u00a0the bylaws should not significantly affect the price that a third party would be willing to pay for\u00a0the OIEG block of shares:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, because practically all close corporations with a majority shareholder have\u00a0provisions protecting the rights of minority shareholders. All potential purchasers of a\u00a0majority interest in a company with minority shareholders would be fully aware that they\u00a0could not arbitrarily exercise control.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, because the protection provided by the bylaws to the minority shareholder\u00a0simply represent rights already granted by law. The main category of Fundamental\u00a0Matters consists of the matters specified in article 280 of the Commercial Code,822 which\u00a0is a provision that establishes a supermajority protection for the rights of minority\u00a0shareholders.\n- Third, because paragraph (c) of articles 29 and 32 of the bylaws includes an escape clause that allows the majority' shareholder to adopt capital increases at a fair price\n821 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The references provided by Mr. Guitera are again incorrect.\n822 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 280 of the Commercial Code reads as follows: \u201cWhen not otherwise provided for in the bylaws, the\u00a0number of shareholders representing three-fourths of the capital stock and the favorable vote of those representing at\u00a0least one-half of such capital stock must be present at the meeting when addressing the following matters:\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early dissolution of the company\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Extending its duration\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merger with another company\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sale of its corporate assets\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reimbursement of a capital contribution, or a capital increase\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A capital reduction\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A change in corporate purpose\n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A restatement of the bylaws in connection with the matters set forth in the preceding items.\nIn any other event specifically provided for by law.\u201d\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nwhen they are necessary to keep the Companies competitive.\n844. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary , the Tribunal concludes that the existence in the bylaw's of the Companies of the\u00a0provisions identified by Mr. Guitera should not cause a significant decrease in the price a third\u00a0party would be willing to pay for the OIEG block of shares it holds in the Companies.\nAn additional reason\n845. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is an additional reason for which in any event the discount\u00a0defended by Mr. Guitera makes no sense in this case.\n846. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The discount only makes sense in situations in which a buyer purchases a controlling interest in\u00a0(but not 100% of) a company when there is a minority shareholder with supermajority voting rights.\u00a0In such cases, the reduction is justified, because the buyer will not be able to freely manage the\u00a0company and will need to take into account the minority shareholder's opinion\u2014if not for all\u00a0decisions, then at least for certain important ones.\n847. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a buyer purchases 100% of the capital, then there is no logical foundation whatsoever for the\u00a0discount. In such a case, the minority shareholder w ill never be able to have the right of first refusal\u00a0or supermajority voting rights. A buyer that purchases 100% of the capital will in any event have to\u00a0pay 100% of the market price, with no discount whatsoever, regardless of the bylaws (which in any\u00a0case he will be able to modify on the day after the purchase).\n848. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying these principles to this case, the discount could only have been proposed had Venezuela\u00a0only acquired a package of shares that represented 73% of the Companies\u2019 capital. Only in such a\u00a0case could it be debated whether the hy pothetical buyer should pay 73% of the market value for the\u00a0package, or whether it would be appropriate to further discount this price due to the existence of the\u00a0right to first refusal or of certain supermajority voting rights in Polar's favor.\n849. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other words: the application of a discount like the one proposed by Mr. Guitera inevitably\u00a0presupposes that the transaction will satisfy two requirements:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That the buyer purchases a controlling equity interest in a company,\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that after the purchase, the buyer has to get along in the company with a minority\u00a0shareholder who has supermajority' voting rights.\n850. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither of these two requirements is satisfied in this case. The Bolivarian Republic has not\u00a0purchased 73% of the Companies' capital, but rather the Plants and the manufacturing facilities\u00a0owned by the Companies and through which they generated their businesses. After the purchase.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nthe State does not have to get along with Polar as a minority shareholder, because it did not purchase shares, and above all. because it also expropriated the part thal corresponded to Polar.\n851. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, and for the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal decides that Mr. Guitera\u2019s proposal\u00a0of applying a discount to the market price of the Companies should not be admitted.\nG. Sanity7 Checks\n852. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Companies\" market value on the date of\u00a0expropriation, calculated using the DCF model developed by the experts, totaled USD 487,275,939.\u00a0The excess Cash appropriated by the Bolivarian Republic, which totals USD 23.064.801, must be\u00a0added to this amount, resulting in a total value of 100% of the Companies of USD 510,340,740.\n853. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except for the calculation of the excess Cash, this valuation was arrived at through the application\u00a0of a DCF methodology\u2014a methodology that must be validated. Making calculations using the DCF\u00a0methodology is not a mechanical exercise, and the use of apparently reasonable parameters can lead\u00a0to completely irrational results. That is why it is important for the Tribunal to perform this\u00a0validation and to reach the conviction that the results are reasonable. To do so, the Tribunal will\u00a0perform three verifications:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it will check its own results against the experts\u2019 results (a);\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then it will calculate the value of the Companies using the EBITDA multiples\u00a0methodology (b), and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, it will check the value of the Companies in relation to the value of the OI group (c)\na. The experts\u2019 results\n854. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first attempt at validation, the market value must be compared with the values reached by the\u00a0parties' experts.\n855. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The results of the two experts\u2019 valuations could not be any more different: Mr. Kaczmarek values\u00a0100% of the Companies at USD 1.004 billion, Mr. Guitera at USD 195 million.823 The Tribunal has\u00a0decided that the correct figure is USD 487 million (not including Cash). The difference between\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s value and the Tribunal\u2019s seems to be highly exaggerated, but in fact it is due to\u00a0only two factors:\n- the capex forecasts; and\n823 Joint Matrix, page 2.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB 11/25\nAward\n- the application of a discount rate of 23% (and not 20.39%).\n856. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same can be said of Mr. Guitera's valuation: four factors (the selling price of the products,\u00a0price increases, exports, and the rate of 23% instead of 25.78%) would bring his value back into\u00a0line with the one established by the Tribunal.\nb. Comparable companies\n857. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A commonly accepted formula for checking the valuation of a company calculated based on DCF is\u00a0to repeat the calculation using the EBITDA multiples method. Essentially, the procedure is as\u00a0follows:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, a sample is defined of comparable companies for which the EBITDA and market\u00a0value are known, and the average multiple that results from dividing the market value by\u00a0the EBITDA is calculated:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When this multiple is known, it is multiplied by the EBITDA of the company that is to be\u00a0valued, yielding the value;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That value is compared with the value obtained through the DCF methodology.\n858. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both experts applied this methodology in order to tty' to confirm their results\u2014and both came to the\u00a0conclusion that they had done so (despite the differences in their valuations). Therefore, it is\u00a0imperative for the Tribunal to critically review' their calculations.\nDetermination of the multiple\n859. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first step in any valuation using EBITDA multiples is to define the sample of comparable\u00a0companies. The only expert who did so was Mr. Kaczmarek, who created a sample of seven listed\u00a0companies that are similar to the Companies (this sample is the same one used in calculating the\u00a0unlevered D).824 It includes 01 itself, with a multiple of 6.5, and the weighted average of the eight\u00a0values yields a multiple of 8.825\n860. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Guitera does not agree with that conclusion. Nev ertheless, he accepts as a starting point that the\u00a0two companies in the sample that are truly comparable, Rigolleau (Argentine) and CIV (Brazilian),\u00a0have multiples of 8. However, he considers that the multiple should be reduced to 6.5, since on the\u00a0one hand the Argentine and Brazilian economies hav e better prospects for growth than Venezuela\n824 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I. paragraph 119.\n825 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek I, paragraph 134.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\ndoes, and on the other, because 6.5 is the 01 multiple.826 Finally, he ad\\ ocates reducing the multiple to 4 in order to reflect the concentration of risk in Polar?\n861 The Tribunal does not share this last assessment made by Mr. Guitera. as it has already expressed its opinion that the relationship with Polar does not take away from the value of the Companies.828\u00a0Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that for a company with OldV\u2019s and Favianca\u2019s characteristics, a\u00a0range of EBITD A multiples of betw een 6.5 and 8 seems reasonable, which is a conclusion that is\u00a0consistent with the positions held by the two experts.\nThe EBITDA of the Companies\n862. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next step consists in establishing the EBITDA of the Companies.\n863. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The experts agree that the Companies generated the following EBITDA;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VEB 244 million in 2008\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VEB 259 million in 2009\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VEB 364 million in 2010\n864. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Companies\u2019 accounting is performed in VEB, and the EBITDA is calculated in that same\u00a0currency. However, the experts have discussed whether the EBITDA should be converted to USD\u00a0and whether the exchange rate of 2.15 (which was in effect in 2008 and 2009) or of 4.30 (which\u00a0was in effect in 2010) should be used. They have also discussed whether the relevant figures\u00a0should be the ones from 2009 or the ones from 2010.\n865. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal's position is the following:\n866. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The calculation should be performed in October 2010, which is when the Companies were\u00a0expropriated. What is the EBITDA calculation that a hypothetical buyer could have had then? At\u00a0that time, the most recent audited and approved annual accounts would have been the 2009 ones;\u00a0for 2010, there would only have been a budget and the data closed at the end of the third quarter.\n867. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In general, buyers would tend to use the EBITDA derived from the most recent audited and\u00a0approved accounts, since they are the most reliable\u2014that is to say, the 2009 accounts. But in\u00a0Venezuela, with its high-inflation economy, this would not be a suitable solution: in October\u00a02010, the 2009 EBITDA figure would already have become outdated, due to inflation.\n868. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The experts maintained varied positions on how to solve this problem. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion,\u00a0the most appropriate solution, which hypothetical buyers would have adopted, would be to use\n8 26 HT, day 6 (English), page 53: HT, day 6 (Spanish), pages 29 and 30: RV, paragraph 391. 82 Guitera II, paragraphs 293 and 294: RV, paragraph 394.\n828 See paragraph S44 supra.\n01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSBD Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nthe last figure that was officially approved by the company, the 2009 EBITDA, and adjust it for the inflation that took place in the first nine months of 2010. The rate of inflation for the year\u00a02010 as a whole reached 28.30%,829 which is approximately equivalent to 21% for the first nine\u00a0months. Applying this adjustment, the 2009 EBITDA would go from VEB 259 million to VEB\u00a0313 million. In the Tribunal's opinion, this figure represents a reasonable estimate of the\u00a0Companies\u2019 EBITDA in October 2010, as it is based on the last audited and approved EBITDA\u00a0but includes adjustments thereto in order to take interim inflation into account.\n869. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking this EBITDA and applying the minimum and maximum multiples from the range adopted\u00a0by the Tribunal gives the following results:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.5x313 = 2,035\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a08x313=2,504\n870. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is to say, the total value of the Companies that is derived from applying the EBITDA\u00a0multiples methodology varies from VEB 2,035,000,000 to VEB 2,504,000,000 (depending on the\u00a0multiple in the range that is chosen).\n871. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does this result compare with the value calculated using the DCF methodology? This value\u00a0is calculated in USD and reaches USD 487,275,939 (not including cash). But in their joint matrix,\u00a0the two experts also calculated the value in VEB, using the exchange rate in force on the date of\u00a0expropriation.8\u20190 The value in VEB is 2,095,286,539, that is to say, in rounded figures, VEB\u00a02,095,000,000.\n872. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal confirms that the market value of the Companies, calculated using the DCF\u00a0methodology, VEB 2,095,000,000, is in line with the calculations made using the EBITDA\u00a0multiples methodology:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using the multiple of the OI group as a whole (6.5), the result is very similar: VEB 2,095\u00a0versus VEB 2,025.\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And applying the multiple 8, which results from the weighted average of comparable\u00a0companies, the result is VEB 2,504\u2014compared to which the result of VEB 2,095\u00a0obtained with the DCF methodology is 19.5% lower.\n873. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal therefore confirms that there is a high level of concordance between the results\u00a0obtained using the DCF methodology and the EBITDA multiples methodology:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using the EBITDA multiple most favorable to the Claimant, the results are identical;\n829 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guitera I, paragraph 199.\n830 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joint Matrix, page 1.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- Using the EBITDA multiple most favorable to the investor, the difference is 19.5% (that is to say, the price set based on DCF is less than the one derived from the multiples\u00a0methodology).\n874. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The multiples methodology thus confirms that the DCF calculation is correct overall, but tends to\u00a0be conservative and detrimental to the investor.\n875. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, this conservative bias is partially offset by another decision made by the Tribunal, in\u00a0which it accepts the claim of excess cash on hand and in banks, and grants the investor an\u00a0additional compensation of USD 23,064,801, which is equivalent to VEB 99 million. The total\u00a0compensation for 100% of the Companies thus changes from VEB 2,095 (not including cash) to\u00a0VEB 2,194,000,000 (including cash)831\u2014a figure that offsets the conservative bias of the DCF\u00a0model and brings the total compensation for 100% of the Companies to a (reasonable, but not\u00a0excessive) multiple of just over 7 times EBITDA.832\nc. Comparison with the OI group\n876. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A third verification remains to be performed: since the OI group is a company that is listed on the\u00a0stock exchange, its market value as of 30 September is known and totals USD 8.595 billion.\u00a0Furthermore, the company is obligated by United States stock market regulations to publish a\u00a0Form 8-K on a quarterly basis. In this form, the company breaks down how much the Venezuelan\u00a0Companies contribute to the group as a whole:83 ' their share represents approximately 3% of\u00a0sales, 4% of assets, and 5.7% of the EBITDA834 of the OI group.835 Therefore, it is possible to\u00a0assign the Venezuelan companies an intrinsic value, calculated as a percentage of the value of the\u00a0entire group as a whole.\n877. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expert Guitera takes the average of sales, gross profit, and EBIT\u2014an average that equals 4.1%\u2014\u00a0as a criterion for comparison, and applies it to the group\u2019s stock market value of USD 8.595\u00a0billion. This calculation yields a value for the Venezuelan Companies of USD 352 million.\n878. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Tribunal accepts the principle proposed by the expert, it considers the most\u00a0appropriate parameters for comparing the value of the Venezuelan Companies within the OI\u00a0group as a whole to be the EBITDA and the assets:\n83' Equivalent to USD 510,340,740.\n832 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which is the result of dividing the total price including cash on hand and in banks (2,194) by the adjusted\u00a0EBITDA (313), giving a result of 7.01.\n833 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guiterra H, paragraph 323.\n834 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The experts discuss whether this is EBITDA or simply EBIT; for the purposes of the Tribunal\u2019s argument, it is\u00a0irrelevant whether the percentage represents one concept or the other.\n835 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Guiterra n, paragraph 323; RV, paragraph 412.\nOI European Group B.V. v, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- According to the Form 8-K, the Venezuelan subsidiaries' portion of the EBITDA is 5.7%; applying this to the stock market value of the group as a w hole gives a result of USD 490\u00a0million.\n- The Venezuelan subsidiaries\u2019 share of the group's assets is 4%, yielding a value of USD 344 million.\n879. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal estimates the value of the Venezuelan Companies' share in the Ol group to total\u00a0USD 372 million (73% of USD 510 million, including Cash)\u2014a figure that is within the range of\u00a0values derived from the OI group's accounting itself (USD 344 million if the assets are used as\u00a0the distribution criterion. USD 490 million if the EBITDA is used). The comparison confirms that\u00a0the calculation performed by the Tribunal is reasonable.\nH. Final summary\n880. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, this Tribunal concludes that the market value of the Companies (calculated by the\u00a0Tribunal applying the DCF method developed by both experts) is reasonable and is confirmed by\u00a0using alternative methods, such as that of EBITDA multiples or that of the Companies\u2019 equity' in\u00a0the OI group as a whole. The value of the companies amounts to USD 487,275,939. The excess\u00a0Cash of w'hich the companies have been deprived (which amounts to USD 23.064.801) must be\u00a0added to this sum. Thus, the total value of 100% of the Companies is USD 510,340,740.\n881. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Claimant is the owner of a 72.983%836 equity interest, it is entitled to compensation in the\u00a0amount of USD 372,461,982 for the expropriation of the Companies, including excess Cash.\n4. Additional Damages\n882. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to compensation for the value of its participation in the expropriated Companies,\u00a0Respondent is claiming additional damages for two reasons8 :\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it is claiming the sum of USD 50,566.759 because Respondent made exports to Brazil,\u00a0causing damage to Claimant's business activity in said countiy;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, it is asking for USD 68,030.092 for the disclosure outside of Venezuela and after\u00a0the expropriation of proprietary information belonging to the OI group.\n883. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claims for additional damages pose two problems;\n- On the one hand, whether Claimant has a right to claim them and\n836 Kaczmarek I, par. 57.\u00a08 ' Kaczmarek I. Par. 57.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB 11/25\nAward\n- On the ot her, whether the damages c laimed meet all of the requirements of proof and causality in order to be awarded.\n884. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the legal aspect. Claimant argues that when Respondent made an expropriation that\u00a0does not meet the requirements stipulated in Art. 6 of the BIT. and having incurred other violations\u00a0of the Treaty. Claimant is entitled to demand not just the market value of the expropriated goods,\u00a0but also compensation for additional damages suffered. In more legal terms, Claimant considers\u00a0that it has the right to receive \u201cfull compensation\u201d for all of the damages caused by the illegal\u00a0actions of the Bolivarian Republic in the broadest terms in which customary' international Jaw\u00a0interprets this concept.8 8\n885. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent, on the other hand, states its disagreement, and in its opinion Claimant only has a right\u00a0to the compensation provided for in Art. 6 of the BIT, that is, the market value of the expropriated\u00a0goods, whether or not the expropriation was legal or illegal, in compliance or not with the\u00a0requirements stated in said norm.839\n886. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall invert the order of analysis: it will first study whether the damages claimed by\u00a0Claimant have been proven and meet all of the remaining requirements to be recognized; and if it\u00a0reaches the conclusion that either one of the two categories complies with these requirements, it\u00a0will analyses whether or not the BIT or Customary International Law allow's damages to be\u00a0awarded.\nA. Damages based on exports to Brazil\n887. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his first report. Mr. Kaczmarek analyzed this reason for the claim and reached the conclusion\u00a0that the damages suffered by Claimant total USD 124 million. This amount represents the \u201cpotential\u00a0damages\u201d that OIEG would suffer in the Brazilian market with the hypothetical association between\u00a0Envidrio, the Uruguay an manufacturer of containers, and Venvidrio, the Venezuelan state company\u00a0which has taken over the Plants, an association that would presumably lead to the construction of a\u00a0joint plant in Brazil,840\n888. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, as the expert himself recognizes in his second report, the construction of a new\u00a0factory' in Brazil has been postponed, and for this reason. Mr. Kaczmarek has modified the bases for\u00a0his calculation of damages. He takes as his starting point that Venvidrio had started to export to\u00a0Brazil glass containers manufactured in the expropriated Plants. These exports would represent a\u00a0new supplier in the Brazilian glass market, in w hich OIEG is leader, and could potentially erode its\n838 CIV. Par. 392.\n830 RH, Par. 442.\n840 Kaczmarek I, Par. 173.\nOJ European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nposition as such. Without the exports. Claimant would have obtained higher profits than those actually produced and that would be the base of the damages.841\n889. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to calculate it, the expert has proceeded as follows: starting w ith the customs information,\u00a0he has confirmed that Venvidrio exported 29.165 tons of glass to Brazil from December 2012 to\u00a0May 2013. These exports equal 58.330 annualized tons that in turn equal 3.9% of the Brazilian\u00a0market.\n890. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, the expert calculates the value of 4% of the Brazilian glass market using as a measure the last\u00a0purchases and sales made by glass container manufacturing companies in that country. Taking the\u00a0average of the price of those transactions, he estimates that the value of 4% of the Brazilian glass\u00a0container market is DSD 92 million. Given that Claimant has a 55% share of the Brazilian market,\u00a0the expert multiplies that percentage842 by USD 92 million, and obtains USD 50,566,759\u2014the\u00a0amount that Claimant is asking for as compensation.\n891. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the exports that Venvidrio is making to Brazil may be\u00a0eroding the profits that OIEG. the country\u2019s main glass manufacturer, makes, therefore causing it\u00a0certain additional damage\u2014damage that would not exist if the Bolivarian Republic had not\u00a0expropriated the Companies. However, the Tribunal has already taken this information into account\u00a0in the DCF model in that it has accepted the inclusion of export expectations. This inclusion has\u00a0had the effect of increasing the market value of the expropriated Companies {ceteris paribus) by\u00a0USD 16 million.843\n892. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant now hopes to obtain additional compensation for this same reason. Its claim cannot\u00a0prosper because neither the existence nor the quantification of the damages supports a criti cal\u00a0analysis:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it has not been proven that Venvidrio has obtained 4% of the Brazilian market\u00a0for glass containers; the expert simply extrapolates the import data for six months in order to\u00a0reach this conclusion, but this manner of proceeding does not convince the Tribunal. The\u00a0exports may have been temporary and not maintained over time;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second place, the expert hopes to give a value to the 4% share of the Brazilian market\u00a0that Respondent would have obtained through his purely commercial import activity by\u00a0applying to it the theoretical price that a glass container manufacturing company located in\u00a0Brazil would have reached had it had a 4% share of the market\u2014an unjustified equalization of\u00a0values;\n841 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, Par. 211.\n842 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking into consideration that OIEG in turn has a 99.5% share of the Brazilian business.\n843 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From USD 471.001,780 to USD 487,275,939 - see Joint Matrix, P. 4.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if we accepted that Venvidrio obtained a permanent 4% share of the Brazilian market,\u00a0and that the value of that share was USD 92 million (quod non), and also accepting (although it\u00a0has not been proven) that OIEG had a 55% share of that market, which is totally impossible to\u00a0understand\u2014and Mr. Kaczmarek also does not explain844\u2014that is why Claimant would have\u00a0suffered damages equal to 55% of USD 92 million.845\n893. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal considers that the effect of the exports that Venvidrio has begun is\u00a0already duly included in the DCF model and that Claimant has not been able to demonstrate the\u00a0existence of any additional damage for this reason. The burden of proof being on OIEG, the\u00a0Tribunal rejects the claim.\nB. Damages resulting from Disclosure\n894. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant is also seeking additional compensation for irregular disclosure of its proprietary\u00a0information in the amount of USD 68 million.\n895. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As per Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s explanation, Venvidrio made the design of certain ovens, protected by\u00a0Claimant\u2019s proprietary information, to a Chinese manufacturer named Luoyang Dayang Refractory\u00a0Co, Ltd [\u201cDY\u201d]. This disclosure allegedly caused OIEG damages, which it hopes to recover in this\u00a0arbitration.846\n896. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Kaczmarek recognizes that the damage is difficult to measure, because the effects of the\u00a0disclosure are not yet known and these effects will become more important in the future. The\u00a0estimation of the damage made by the expert assumes that Venvidrio will use the plans to\u00a0manufacture a new oven and that it will be used for exporting to Brazil. With these assumptions, the\u00a0expert first calculates that a new oven will represent 5.2% of the Brazilian market.847 Applying the\u00a0same methodology used in the previous calculation, the expert reaches the conclusion that 5.2% of\u00a0the Brazilian market for glass containers has a value of USD 124 million, and applying the 55%\u00a0share of the market that OIEG has in that market, the resulting damage is USD 68,030,992.8iS\n897. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The claim cannot prosper:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Tribunal indicated in its Decision on Provisional Remedies,849 it is a fact that the\u00a0proprietary information does not belong to Claimant; therefore, Claimant has no standing to\u00a0claim those damages;\n844 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, Par. 214 does not contain any explanation or justification.\n845 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjusted taking into account that his share is 99.5%.\n846 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, Par. 215.\n847 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kaczmarek II, Par. 217.\n848 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjusting for OIEG\u2019s 99.5% share in the OI group\u2019s business in Brazil.\n84 Decision on Provisional Remedies, Par. 52: \u201c[...] But this Proprietary Information was not in the ownership of the Claimant, but rather of a different company, 01, which had signed separate agreements - the PI Agreements -for the transfer of the Proprietary Information to the Venezuelan companies. Claimant has never had any\u00a0entitlement to the Proprietary Information and has in no way participated in its transfer to Venezuela.[...f\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is total speculation that a new oven will be built and that its production will be exported to\u00a0Brazil;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if it w ere to be exported, the calculation of the damages is not convincing for the reasons\u00a0given in the previous section.\nC. Legal Basis\n898. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having proven that the claim for additional damages must be rejected for lack of evidentiary\u00a0calculation. Claimant\u2019s claim merits no further consideration.\n5. Moral Damages\nA. The Parties\u2019 Positions\nClaimant's Position\n899. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant declares that International Law' recognizes that States must compensate for moral\u00a0damages, as established in the Articles of the International Law Commission, international\u00a0jurisprudence,850 and doctrine.851 It particularly considers relevant the decision in the Desert Line\u00a0case, w'here the tribunal granted moral damages for the harassment and intimidation suffered by the\u00a0respondent\u2019s executives at the hands of the State's Armed Forces.852\n900. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore. Claimant claims the sum of USD 10 million in moral damages.\nRespondent\u2019s Position\n901. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela defends the inadmissibility of the claim for moral damages because the BIT\u2019S \u201cfair\u00a0compensation\u201d standard and Venezuelan legislation only authorize OIEG to receive compensation\u00a0equal to the market value of its investment.85\n902. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent considers that it has been proved that the Companies\u2019 staff did not suffer any\u00a0physical or moral coercion854 and maintains that Claimant is \u201clight years away\u201d from the strict\u00a0thresholds that international tribunals require to aw ard moral damages.855 Arbitral tribunals would\n850 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CL Par. 360. citing Craw ford and cases Lusitania, Desert Line and others; CV, Par. 298.\n851 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, Par. 298, citing Ripinsky and Williams.\n852 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cl.

The Analysis of the Tribunal\n904. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OIEG claims USD 10 million in compensation for moral damages caused by what it calls\u00a0\u201cegregious behavior\u2019858 by Respondent during the six months following the expropriation. The\u00a0Bolivarian Republic, on the other hand, denies OIEG\u2019s claim with factual and legal arguments.859\n905. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To solve this matter, the Tribunal will first determine the required standard for the award of\u00a0damages (a). Then, it will proceed to analyze if such compensation for damages is appropriate,\u00a0given the proven facts (b).\na. Definition of the moral damages standard\n906. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BIT does not make any reference to the possibility that the investor may claim and obtain\u00a0compensation for moral damages. Article 6 only provides that it has a right to receive \u201cjust\u00a0compensation\u201d for the expropriated assets. Nonetheless, such \u201cjust compensation\u2019\u2019 may, under\u00a0certain circumstances, include compensation for physical or moral suffering caused by the\u00a0Government to the investor. The award entered in Desert Line admitted the possibility\u2019 that an\u00a0arbitral tribunal may grant an investor additional compensation for moral damages, but that was\u00a0subject to the existence of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d The conclusions, shared by the Tribunal,\u00a0are the following:860\n\"Even if investment treaties primarily aim at protecting property and economic values, they do not exclude, as such, that a party may, in exceptional\u00a0circumstances, ask for compensation for moral damages. \u201d\n907. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Desert Line, the circumstances were truly exceptional. The claimant had suffered physical ill-treatment and its facilities w\u2019ere besieged by the troops of the Government being sued. The\u00a0tribunal, indeed, granted compensation for moral damages.\n908. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question, then, is not whether a Tribunal may or may not grant compensation for moral\u00a0damages, because it has been accepted that it has the powrer to do so as long as exceptional\n856 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RU.

The real question is: when do these exceptional situations, which merit the grant of compensation for moral damages, take place?\n909. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Lemire, the tribunal, after an exhaustive analysis of case law, summarized the status\u00a0quaestionis in the following manner:\n\u201cSumming up the conclusions which can be drawn from the above case law is that, as a general rule, moral damages are not available to a party injured by the\u00a0wrongful acts of a State, but that moral damages can be awarded in exceptional\u00a0cases, provided that\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the State\u2019s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention, or other analogous\u00a0situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which\u00a0civilized nations are expected to act;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering\u00a0such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and\u00a0social position; and\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0both cause and effect are grave or substantial.\"\\*61\n910. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees entirely with the conclusion in Lemire. As a general rule, a party injured by\u00a0the wrongful acts of a State cannot be awarded additional compensation for moral damages,\u00a0unless it can prove the following:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the State's actions implied physical threat, illegal detention, or other ill-treatments in\u00a0contravention of the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and that such situation has caused serious damage to its physical health, grave mental\u00a0suffering or a substantial loss of reputation.\nb. Application of the standard to the facts\n911. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant argues that the following facts\u2014which were already reported by Claimant as violations\u00a0of the standards of Fair and Equitable Treatment [FET] and of Full Physical Safety and Protection\u00a0[PSP]\u2014amount to \u201cegregious\u201d behavior by Respondent, which should constitute grounds for\u00a0granting compensation for moral damages:862\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent allegedly created an omnipresent atmosphere of fear and intimidation in the\u00a0Plants;863\n861 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lemire, (Award), par. 333.\n862 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CI, par. 364.\n863 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, par. 300 a).\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Actually, the facts did not exactly occur in the manner and causing the effects described by\nClaimant. The Tribunal, after carefully assessing the evidence, has arrived to the following conclusions:\nThe warnings by Minister Menendez that any deliberate action with the intention of paralyzing the Plants would be punished did not amount to a threat or cause an\u00a0international wrong;869\nIt was not proved that workers were forced to continue working in the Plants;870\nThe actions by the GNB at the Plants were not grave enough so as to amount to a violation of the guarantee of Full Physical Safety and Protection set forth in the BIT.871\nClaimant has been unable to prove that it has suffered damages for the alleged disclosure of the intellectual property used in the Plants.872\nIt has not been proved that the Temporary Administrative Boards showed threatening and aggressive attitudes towards OldV and Favianca.873\n864\n865\n866\n867\n868\n869\n870\n871\n872\n873\nCV. par. 300 b).\nCV, par. 300 c).\nCV, par. 300 d).\nCI, par. 364.\nIbid.\nSee par. 548 supra.\nIbid.\nSee par. 579 et seq. supra.

Claimant has not succeeded at proving that the behavior of the Republic during the\u00a0transition period has given rise to a violation of the standards of Full Physical Safety and\u00a0Protection and of Fair and Equitable Treatment (except for the occupation of the Plants by\u00a0INDEPABIS, which was arbitrary' and constituted a violation of the standard of Fair and\u00a0Equitable Treatment, as will be analyzed in the following paragraph). The Full Physical Safety\u00a0and Protection and Fair and Equitable Treatment standards have fewer requirements than those\u00a0necessary in order to grant moral damages compensation. Since the behavior reported by\u00a0Claimant could not be qualified as international wrongs, it follows that it may not constitute\u00a0grounds for awarding compensation for moral damages.\n914. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now we shall address the actions by INDEPABIS. The Tribunal has already concluded that\u00a0INDEPABIS acted arbitrarily and there was a misuse of power, contrary to the Fair and Equitable\u00a0Treatment standard required in Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n915. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is this behavior worthy of an additional compensation for moral damages?\n916. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal concludes that the answer to the question above is negative. Claimant failed to\u00a0prove that the irregular behavior by INDEPABIS amounted to physical threats, illegal detention\u00a0or ill-treatment. In addition, it has not been alleged or proved that INDEPABIS behavior caused\u00a0harm to the health or stress or anxiety, or any other kind of psy chological suffering such as\u00a0humiliation, shame, degradation, or loss of reputation, standing or social position to Claimant or\u00a0its legal representatives. Therefore, it does not meet the necessary requirements for awarding\u00a0additional compensation for moral damages.\n\\*\\*\\*\n917. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal denies the Claimant's request to order the Bolivarian Republic of\u00a0Venezuela to pay compensation for moral damages, because it has not been proven that\u00a0Respondent's behavior was sufficiently grave and unlawTul for this Tribunal to grant such an\u00a0exceptional measure as additional compensation for moral damages.\n8 4 See par. 557 supra. 875 See par. 557 supra.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Until that date, Claimant benefitted from the product of\u00a0its investment and since that date, it must receive the interest accrued on compensation.\n933. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal finds no justification to postpone interest accrual until the date of the request for\u00a0arbitration, much less until the date of the award.\nAccrual end date\n934. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This shall be the date of effective payment of full compensation by the Bolivarian Republic of\u00a0Venezuela.\nInterest rate\n935. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Netherlands-Venezuela BIT provides that compensation for expropriation \u201cshall include\u00a0interest at a normal commercial rate.\u201d894 Nevertheless, it does not specify the interest rate; as a\u00a0result, this Tribunal must determine the interest rate at its discretion.\n936. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela proposes to apply the median interest rate on the short-term debt incurred by OI for the\u00a0period that ended on 30 September 2010 or the six-month U.S. Treasury Bills rate.\n937. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent.\n938. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rate of interest on the compensation for expropriation, owed since 2010, must be that of a\u00a0long-term debt. In addition, the United States\u2019 credit risk is among the lowest in the market;\u00a0applying its interest rate to a debt owed by the Bolivarian Republic would lead to unreasonable\u00a0financial results.\n804 Article 6 of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n939. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expert for Claimant has evaluated the possibility of applying one of the three following\u00a0alternatives to compute the proper interest rate:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the yield of USD-denominated Venezuelan sovereign bonds;895\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LIBOR plus 4%;896\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or the U.S. prime rate plus 2%.897\n940. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, in its final petition. Claimant did not leave the choice among the three alternatives to the\u00a0Tribunal but specified that it requested that the Tribunal apply a LIBOR-based interest rate plus a\u00a04% margin.898\n941. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Tribunal hereby grants Claimant's request.\n942. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LIBOR is the interest rate used in the London interbank market and it is set by the British Bankers\u2019\u00a0Association on a daily basis for interbank deposits at various terms and in various currencies. It is\u00a0universally accepted as a benchmark to set interest rates for loans, deposits and other financial\u00a0instruments. In financial practice, bank loans to customers accrue interest at LIBOR plus a margin.\n943. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the instant case, the Tribunal is inclined to apply the LIBOR rate for one-year deposits plus the\u00a0surcharge that would be applied to a company similar to Claimant for a loan in the market.\n944. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant proposes that the margin be 4% and this Tribunal confirms that a recent arbitral award\u00a0accepted such figure.899 A LIBOR rate for one-year deposits plus 4% is a \u201cnormal commercial\u00a0rate\u201d that guarantees full compensation to Claimant.\n945. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The initial LIBOR rate will be the rate published on the accrual start date for one-year deposits; it\u00a0will be applied for the following year and be recalculated annually.\nCalculation method\n946. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimant has requested \u201ccompound interest.\u201d What Claimant means by this equivocal term is that\u00a0each year, unpaid accrued interest should be accumulated to the principal (or even every six\u00a0months after the issuance of the award, if this were more favorable to Claimant), generating in turn\u00a0interest over the following periods.

This question has been\u00a0analyzed in several investment-related awards and, although the traditional view has been rather\u00a0reticent to accept it, the most recent trend is to accept yearly or half-yearly capitalization.900\n949. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Tribunal shares the view stated in the most recent decisions because in a LIBOR-based\u00a0interest calculation, capitalization is financially essential in order to wholly compensate the\u00a0investor.\n950. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the purpose of interest is to compensate for the external financial cost that Claimant would\u00a0hypothetically incur to cover the loss caused by the delay in the payment of damages. If Claimant\u00a0had obtained a one-year LIBOR loan on normal market conditions, it wnuld have had to pay\u00a0interest annually from the accrual start date; failure to do so would have caused interest to\u00a0accumulate to the principal amount, thus accruing further interest from that moment on. Thus, in\u00a0order to maintain Claimant fully indemnified, the aw ard needs to allow for annual capitalization of\u00a0interest.\n951. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, Claimant requests that interest prior to the award be capitalized yearly and interest\u00a0after the award be capitalized half-yearly or yearly (whichever amount is greater). This Tribunal\u00a0finds no reason why any such distinction should be made: there is no reason that justifies making a\u00a0difference between the periods before and after the award. In addition, half-yearly capitalization\u00a0would require the six-month deposit and the one-year deposit LIBOR rates to be applied\u00a0depending on the capitalization period, which would introduce unnecessary complexity to the\u00a0calculation.\n952. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Tribunal hereby decides that interest shall be capitalized yearly in arrears, on the\u00a0same date that the LIBOR rate for one-year deposits is recalculated.\n\\*\\*\\*\n900 Siemens, par. 339; Enron, par. 452: LG&E, par. 115; Sempra, par. 486; Lemire (Award), par. 359.\nQ] European Group B.V. v.

These are known as the costs of the proceedings\u00a0[the \u201cCosts of the Proceedings\u2019\u2019];\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expenses incurred to pay for the parties\u2019 defense [the \u201cDefense Expenses\u201d].\nCosts of the proceedings\n969. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Tribunal finds that Claimant has prevailed, not entirely, but to a great extent, in these\u00a0proceedings: the Tribunal confirmed its jurisdiction over all the claims, it determined three of the\u00a0five breaches of the BIT alleged by Claimant and it awarded 40% of the requested damages.\n970. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, this Tribunal finds that Respondent must bear the Costs of the Proceedings. In\u00a0other words. Respondent shall reimburse Claimant for a total of USD 500,000.\na. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defense Expenses\n971. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Defense Expenses requested by Claimant are of a w idely varied nature as they are concerned\u00a0with attorneys, experts and witnesses, among other elements. In the view of this Tribunal,\u00a0Respondent cannot be made to bear all the expenses incurred by Claimant, without limitations.\u00a0Respondent shall only bear the Defense Expenses actually incurred by Claimant that are\u00a0indispensable to adequately defend its interests [\u201cReasonable Defense Expenses\u2019\u2019]. Taking into\u00a0account the complexity' of the case, the amounts in dispute and the work performed by the\u00a0attorneys and the experts, this Tribunal has determined that the amount of the Reasonable\u00a0Defense Expenses is USD 6,000,000 for attorneys and USD 1,500,000 for experts.\n3 See paras. 212 eZ seq. supra.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\nVenezuela\u2019s Contribution to the Reasonable Defense Expenses\n972. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Tribunal must determine the portion of the Reasonable Defense Expenses to be borne by\u00a0Respondent based on the time on which they are to become payable by Claimant.\n973. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arbitration process has been divided into three large stages: jurisdiction, liability and\u00a0damages. In order to determine the apportionment of the costs, the Tribunal will assume that\u00a0Claimant\u2019s Reasonable Defense Expenses have been divided as follows during these stages:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0one third of the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses at each of said stages;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and the total amount of the experts\u2019 fees and expenses during the damages stage.\n974. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the jurisdiction stage, all the jurisdictional objections made by Venezuela were\u00a0dismissed. Therefore, Claimant prevailed entirely and is to be reimbursed for the total\u00a0amount of its Reasonable Defense Expenses at this stage: USD 2,000,000\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the liability stage, this Tribunal granted three of the five claims made by\u00a0Claimant: expropriation, unfair and unequal treatment, and breach of the Umbrella\u00a0Clause; the Tribunal holds that Venezuela must pay 75% of the Reasonable Defense\u00a0Expenses incurred at the liability stage: USD 1,500,000.\n\u2014 During the damages stage, Claimant claimed USD 929,544,714.914 This Tribunal has determined that the amount of damages owed to Claimant as a consequence of the\u00a0expropriation is USD 372,461,982.915 This Tribunal holds that Venezuela must pay 50%\u00a0of Claimant\u2019s Reasonable Defense Expenses incurred at the Damages stage: that is to say,\u00a0USD 1,000,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses and USD 750,000 for experts\u2019 fees and\u00a0expenses.\n975. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The total amount owed to Claimant by Venezuela for Reasonable Defense Expenses is USD\n5,250,000.\n976. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, Venezuela shall pay USD 5,750,000 for the costs involved in this arbitration. In\u00a0addition, Claimant has requested that interest be accrued on said amount. This request is hereby\u00a0granted by this Tribunal, to which end the accrual start date shall be the day on which this award\u00a0is issued; and the accrual end date, the interest rate and the method of calculation shall be those\u00a0established in Section 6 of this Chapter.916\n914 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CV, par. 323.\n915 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See par. 881 supra.\n916 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See par. 927 et seq. supra.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n(6) if the Tribunal does not order Defendant to pay all of Plaintiffs arbitration expenses,\u00a0order Defendant to pay all of Plaintiff s expenses in connection with the preliminary\u00a0objections and the bifurcation request, which include but are not limited to all of the expenses\u00a0and fees of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and the Tribunal,\u00a0and all the legal expenses and costs incurred by Plaintiff (which include but are not limited to\u00a0attorney fees and expenses), with interest calculated in accordance with paragraph (4) above;\u00a0and\n(7) order any other additional compensation that the Tribunal considers appropriate.\u201d\n978. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to its first claim, the Tribunal has rejected the defenses of lack of jurisdiction raised\u00a0by Defendant and holds that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal itself has jurisdiction to\u00a0hear all the issues raised in this proceeding and rule on the substance of the dispute.\n979. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to its second claim, the Tribunal has ruled that the Republic of Venezuela has\u00a0breached articles 6, 3(1), and 3(4) of the Venezuela-Netherlands Reciprocal Investment\u00a0Protection Agreement. However, it has dismissed Plaintiffs request to declare that Venezuela has\u00a0breached articles 3(2) and 5 of the Reciprocal Investment Protection Agreement.\n980. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has resolved Plaintiffs requests for damages as follows:\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiff requested USD 729.821,323 for the expropriation of its economic interests in the\u00a0Companies; the Tribunal holds that the value of OIEG\u2019s interest in the Companies\u00a0amounts to USD 355,628,599;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiff requested USD 16,833,383 for the expropriation of surplus cash in the bank\u00a0accounts of OldV and Favianca, and the Tribunal fully grants the request;\n- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Tribunal entirely rejects Plaintiff s remaining claims for damages.\n981. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, of the USD 929,544,714 requested by Plaintiff for damages, the Tribunal has awarded\nUSD 372.461,982 as compensation for the expropriation of Plaintiff s interest in the Companies and its share in the surplus cash in the bank accounts of OldV and Favianca.\n982. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to Plaintiff's request for interest, the Tribunal holds that Defendant must pay interest\u00a0on USD 372,461,982 at an interest rate of LIBOR +4% for one-y ear deposits in US dollars; the\u00a0interest must be compounded annually, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date when\u00a0the payment in US dollars is received by Plaintiff in funds immediately available in a bank\u00a0account outside Venezuela, designated by Plaintiff.\nOI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25\nAward\n983. With regard to Plaintiffs cost request, the Tribunal holds that the Republic must pay USD\u00a0500,000 and USD 5.250.000 for Procedural Costs and Defense Expenses, respectively, plus\u00a0interest from the date of this award until the date when the payment in US dollars is received by\u00a0Plaintiff, at an interest rate of LIBOR +4%; the interest must be compounded annually. That\u00a0amount includes the payment of all costs incurred by Plaintiff in its defense in connection with\u00a0the preliminary objections and the bifurcation request.\nOI European Group B.V. v.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously rules as follows:\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It holds that the Tribunal has powers and the Centre has jurisdiction to rule on this dispute.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It holds that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela illegally expropriated the investment ow ned by\u00a0OI European Group B.V. located in Venezuela, in violation of article 6 of the Reciprocal\u00a0Investment Protection Agreement (BIT.)\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It holds that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has failed to guarantee the fair and equitable\u00a0treatment recognized in article 3(1) of the BIT to the investment owned by OI European Group\u00a0B.V. located in Venezuela.\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It holds that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has failed to comply with the obligations under\u00a0article 3(4) of the BIT with regard to the investment owned by OI European Group B.V, located\u00a0in Venezuela.\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It orders the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to pay OI European Group B.V. USD 372.461,982\u00a0in compensation for the expropriation of its investment.\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It orders the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to pay OI European Group B.V. interest on USD\u00a0372,461,982, accrued between 26 October 2010 and the date of actual payment, calculated at a\u00a0LIBOR interest rate for one-vear deposits in US dollars, plus a margin of 4%. with annual\u00a0compounding of accrued interest.\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It orders the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to pay OI European Group B.V.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, Venezuela filed with the Secretary General of ICSID an application for the annulment of the Award in the present case (the \"Application for Annulment\"). Venezuela\u2019s Application for Annulment included a request under ICSID Convention Article 52(5) for a stay of enforcement of the Award, pending a decision by the Committee to be constituted on the Application for Annulment.\n\n4.\n\nThe Application for Annulment is based on the grounds that: (a) the Tribunal was not properly constituted (ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(a)); (b) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(b)); (c) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(d)); and (d) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n5.\n\nOn July 17, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for Annulment and at the same time notified the parties that enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n6.\n\nOn October 13, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(3). Its members are: Dr. Alvaro Castellanos Howell (Guatemalan) President, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Republic of Guatemala; Prof. Piero Bernardini (Italian), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Italian Republic, and Mr. David Pawlak (American and Irish), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Slovak Republic; all members were appointed by the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council. On that same date, OI European Group B.V. (the \"Respondent on Annulment\" or \"OI\") and the Applicant (together, the \"Parties\") were duly informed of the commencement of the annulment proceeding.\n\n7.\n\nOn October 14, 2015, OI sent a letter noting that the Applicant bears the burden of specifying the circumstances that require the continuation of the stay of enforcement and that it had failed to provide any type of justification for its request in its Application for Annulment. On this basis, Respondent on Annulment argued that the stay of enforcement should be discontinued or allowed to terminate automatically within 30 days of the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n8.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, pursuant to the schedule determined by the *ad hoc* Committee, as subsequently amended by the Parties, the Applicant filed a first submission in support of its request to maintain the stay of enforcement (the Applicant\u2019s \"First Submission\"); on November 12, 2015, the Respondent on Annulment filed observations on Applicant\u2019s first submission (the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s \"Observations\"); on November 25, 2015, the Applicant filed a second submission on the stay of enforcement of the Award (the Applicant\u2019s \"Reply\"); and on 8 December 2015, the Respondent on Annulment filed its rejoinder (the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s \"Rejoinder\").\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated October 27, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee notified the Parties that, as contemplated by Arbitration Rule 54(2), the *ad hoc* Committee decided to maintain the provisional stay on the enforcement of the Award until it has had an opportunity to review the Parties\u2019 submissions and to issue a further decision on the matter.\n\n10.\n\nOn December 9, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee held its first session. Given that the Parties had not agreed to hold the first session on any of the dates proposed by the *ad hoc* Committee within the 60-day period envisaged in ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, and had not agreed to extend such 60-day period, as permitted by ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, the *ad hoc* Committee held its first session without the Parties by teleconference.\n\n11.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n12.\n\nOn December 20, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee notified the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee deemed that two rounds of written submissions provided ample opportunity for the Parties to present their observations on the issue of the stay of enforcement, and declined the Applicant\u2019s request for an additional round of oral submissions.\n\n13.\n\nOn March 2, 2016, the *ad hoc* Committee informed the Parties by e-mail that, in accordance with Section 16.5 of Procedural Order No.l, it had decided not to consider the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s letter of February 26, 2016, and requested the Parties to abstain from presenting further unsolicited submissions, consistent with the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s direction in its letter of October 27, 2015.\n\n**II. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Parties\u2019 positions on the stay of enforcement of the Award.1\n\nThis summary does not intend to be a detailed and exhaustive description of all of the Parties\u2019 arguments. Its objective is merely to establish the general context for this decision.\n\n**A. The Applicant\u2019s position**\n-------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant requests the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award until the *ad hoc* Committee renders a decision on the Application for Annulment.\n\n16.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Applicant states that under the ICSID Convention the obligations and responsibilities of *ad hoc* committees do not include ensuring compliance with the decision they issue.2 The Applicant argues that this has been acknowledged in a number of cases, citing *El Paso* v. *Argentina and MINE* v. *Guinea3* For the Applicant, it is on this basis that the specific rules on the stay of enforcement of awards should be interpreted.4\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 27.

See also Applicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 26-36.\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicant sustains that in the present case there is no reason or circumstance authorizing the *ad hoc* Committee to terminate the stay of enforcement. In particular, the Applicant asserts that: (i) there is no risk of non-compliance by Venezuela of the Award in the event it is not annulled, and, in addition, such failure to honor the Award should not be presumed; (ii) there is a risk that Venezuela will not be able to duly recover its funds if the stay is terminated; (iii) the Application for Annulment is not dilatory; (iv) terminating the stay of enforcement of the Award would cause significant and irreparable damage to Venezuela; and (v) OI would not be prejudiced if the stay of enforcement of the Award continues pending a decision on the annulment.\n\n20.\n\nFurthermore, the Applicant (vi) rejects OI\u2019s request that the *ad hoc* Committee require Venezuela to provide a security as a condition to the maintenance of the stay. According to the Applicant, the *ad hoc* Committee should reject this request, not only because the ICSID Convention does not grant this power to *ad hoc* committees, but also because, even if they had the power, the present case does not fulfill the requirements necessary to grant such a measure.\n\n21.\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the Applicant\u2019s arguments justifying each one of these assertions.\n\n***i. There is no risk of non-compliance by Venezuela with the Award in the event it is not annulled, and, in addition, such failure to honor the Award should not be presumed***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Applicant cites *S.S. Wimbledon9* to argue that international tribunals cannot base their decisions on presumptions that States will not comply with their international obligations.10\n\nSS *\u2018Wimbledon United Kingdom and ors* v *Germanv.* Judgment (1923) PCIJ Series A no 1, ICGJ 235 (PCIJ 1923), 17th August 1923.\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission \u00b6 37. Applicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\n23.\n\nThe Applicant stresses that Venezuela has fully and constantly complied with its international obligations, despite economic difficulties,11 and points out that Venezuela has recently paid an amount in excess of USD 5.2 billion in connection with PDVSA (Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.) bonds.12 The Applicant also asserts that Venezuela has never failed to comply with any obligation under the ICSID Convention and has repeatedly affirmed that it will continue complying with it.13\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 38. Applicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 27.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\n24.\n\nThe Applicant rejects the list of \"factors\" that OI identifies to justify the alleged risk of non-compliance of the Award. Among other things, the Applicant argues that the statements made in 2012 by late President, Mr. Hugo Chavez\u2014and quoted by OI to prove that Venezuela will not comply with the Award\u2014are cited out of context, since such statements were clearly made in connection with the denunciation of the ICSID Convention that was taking place at that time. Also, the Applicant notes that under international law unilateral statements of officials cannot generate international obligations for States unless made with clear intention to bind the State. The statements made by Mr. Chavez were of a political nature, not legal statements, and subsequent events show that Venezuela has never failed to comply with the ICSID Convention.14\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 29.\n\n25.\n\nThe Applicant also rejects OI\u2019s argument that Venezuela has avoided compliance with every single arbitral award recently rendered against it under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. For the Applicant, contrary to what is argued by OI, the fact that Venezuela has initiated annulment proceedings and interpretation or revision proceedings in relation to such awards, as well as the fact that certain investors have initiated local proceedings for the enforcement of awards against Venezuela, do not imply that Venezuela is refusing to comply with such awards. The Applicant notes that exactly the opposite is true: resorting to post-award proceedings in accordance with the ICSID Convention is a confirmation of Venezuela\u2019s willingness to follow the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the Applicant contends that the existence of enforcement proceedings outside Venezuela cannot be attributed to the latter and, in any event, is irrelevant for the purpose of deciding on the stay of enforcement of the Award in the present case.15\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 30-36.\n\n26.\n\nThe Applicant further argues that the denunciation of the ICSID Convention is also irrelevant for the present purposes and cannot be interpreted as an indication of non-compliance. On the contrary, for the Applicant, the fact that Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention in 2012 and nevertheless continues to follow all existing proceedings under the Convention is strong evidence to certify Venezuela\u2019s strict compliance with its international obligations.16\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 38.\n\n27.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicant rejects OI\u2019s argument regarding Venezuela\u2019s failure to make advance payments in certain proceedings. For the Applicant, the relevant issue is that in the present case Venezuela has never failed to comply with any of its payment obligations. In the other cases cited by OI, Venezuela has stated the reasons for which it discontinued advance payments and such reasons have nothing to do with this case. In any event, according to the Applicant, compliance with advance payment requests is an issue related to the distribution of costs included in the calculations of amounts payable by the parties upon termination of the proceeding and not related to the termination of the stay.17\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Applicant also responds to OI's argument that the local courts in Venezuela have confirmed that its domestic laws do not comply with the ICSID Convention provisions regarding the finality of awards. The Applicant contends that, on the contrary, the position of Venezuelan courts clearly shows that Venezuela is committed to complying with awards in the terms of ICSID Convention Articles 53(1) and 54(3).18 Furthermore, according to the Applicant, \"to date there is no award under the ICSID Convention whose enforcement was attempted in Venezuela and that could not be enforced therein.\"19\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 42-52.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 47.\n\n***ii. There is a risk that Venezuela will not be able to duly recover its funds if the stay is terminated***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Applicant states that *ad hoc* committees have held that a significant factor in favor of maintaining the stay of enforcement is the difficulty for the respondent State to recover the amount paid under an award if it is later annulled.20 In support of this contention, the Applicant cites the decisions of the *CMS* v. *Argentina, Enron* v. *Argentina* and *El Paso* v. *Argentina ad hoc* committees.21\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic.* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (1 September 2006) [hereinafter *CMS* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay]; *Enron Corp. & Ponderosa Assets, L.P.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/01/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (7 October 2008) [hereinafter, *Enron* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay] and *El Paso* v. *Argentina,*\n\n30.\n\nIn this sense, the Applicant claims that Venezuela would be forced to incur significant legal costs in order to recover the payments.22 Furthermore, the Applicant argues that there is a possibility that a third party might seize any amount paid under the Award, thus making it impossible for Venezuela to recover such amount should the Award be annulled.23\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 21.\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\n31.\n\nIn response to OI's statements regarding the creditworthiness of its group of companies, Applicant points out that OI has not provided any evidence proving such creditworthiness and that, in any event, the financial position relevant in this case is OI\u2019s, not that of the entire group of companies. Additionally, Applicant notes that OI could simply cease to form part of the business group to which it currently belongs.24\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 55.\n\n***iii. The Application for Annulment is not dilatory***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Applicant rejects OI's argument that the Application for Annulment is dilatory and stresses that the *ad hoc* Committee should not analyze the merits at this stage of the proceeding.25 The Applicant recognizes that the dilatory nature of an application for annulment is a relevant factor for the *ad hoc* Committee to decide on the stay of enforcement. However, the Applicant argues that the analysis of the dilatory nature of such application must not imply an analysis on the merits.26 For the Applicant, the standard applicable is \"extremely high\" since the dilatory nature of the application must be \"manifest,\" that is, the application itself \"must contain irrefutable evidence of its manifest abuse, that it was filed for the sole purpose of postponing enforcement and that it is not based on the grounds set forth in the Convention.\"27\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 44-49.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 57-61. Applicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 44.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 62-66.\n\n33.\n\nThe Applicant contends that this extremely high standard has not been met in this case since OI has not invoked any elements allowing the *ad hoc* Committee to determine whether the Application for Annulment is of a dilatory nature without conducting an in-depth analysis of its merits.\n\n34.\n\nFurthermore, the Applicant claims that its Application for Annulment is lawful and substantiated, containing rigorous support for each one of the multiple grounds for annulment, each of them discussed in full adherence to the ICSID Convention.28\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 70 *-77.*\n\n35.\n\nFinally, the Applicant also responds to OI\u2019s argument regarding Venezuela\u2019s so called \"dilatory tactics\" in other arbitral proceedings, arguing that all the examples cited by OI constitute the lawful and legitimate exercise of the rights established in the ICSID Convention and its Arbitration Rules, which therefore cannot constitute a \"pattern\" of dilatory behavior. Moreover, the Applicant states that simply pointing out the unsuccessful outcome of some of those examples is utterly insufficient to constitute such a pattern.29\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 78-83.\n\n***iv. Terminating the stay of enforcement of the Award would cause significant and irreparable damage to Venezuela***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Applicant states that the termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award would cause irreparable harm to Venezuela since it would be required to divert a significant amount of the public funds for the payment of the Award. For the Applicant, this means that a series of basic services provided by the State to its population (such as health, education, and housing) would be left with less funding.30\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n37.\n\nThe Applicant also points out that the termination of the stay would force Venezuela to incur significant legal costs to defend itself against OI\u2019s attempt to enforce the Award while the annulment proceeding is still pending.31\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the irreparable harm risk is clear because \"there are several grounds for nullity duly justified in the Application\" and the Award \"is highly likely\" to be annulled.\"32 Additionally, a State - as opposed to a private company - will not be able to cure the damage suffered by charging interest and, therefore, the risks affecting Venezuela are not comparable to the risks alleged by OI.33\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 87.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 89.\n\n39.\n\nFinally, the Applicant contends that OI\u2019s argument regarding the amount of compensation due under the Award, as compared to Venezuela\u2019s gross domestic product, contradicts OI\u2019s argument regarding the risk of non-compliance with the Award. For the Applicant, OI\u2019s invocation of this argument amounts to recognizing that Venezuela is creditworthy enough to comply with the Award.34\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 91.\n\n***v. OI would not be prejudiced if the stay of enforcement of the Award continues pending a decision on the annulment***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the maintenance of the stay would not cause any actual, certain or real damage to OI since the time elapsed between the rendering of the Award and the actual payment of any awarded amount\u2014if the Award is not annulled\u2014would be covered by interest due to OI in accordance with the challenged Award.35 In support of this argument, the Applicant cites the decisions by the *ad hoc* committees in *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile* and in *Azurix* v. *Argentina.36*\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.

The ad hoc Committee should reject OI\u2019s request to condition the continuation of the stay on the posting of a security***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Applicant argues that, in contrast to the New York Convention, the ICSID Convention does not include a provision expressly authorizing *ad hoc* committees to condition the stay of the enforcement of an award on the posting of security by the party that submitted the application for annulment.37 In support of this argument, the Applicant cites the *ad hoc* committee\u2019s decision in *Azurix* v. *Argentina.38* Additionally, the Applicant also rejects that such power can be implicitly derived from the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and rejects that there is a \"*jurisprudence constante\"* on the matter, as alleged by OI.39\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 102-104.\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina.* Decision on Stay.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 106-109.\n\n42.\n\nCiting *Libananco* v. *Turkey*,40 the Applicant contends that the *ad hoc* Committee does not have the power to recommend the posting of a guarantee as a provisional measure either, since such power is only vested in arbitral tribunals, but not *ad hoc* committees. In this regard, the Applicant highlights the fact that ICSID Convention Article 47 is not included in the list of provisions that, according to ICSID Convention Article 52(4), are applicable *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings.41\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey.* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant's Request for Provisional Measures (7 May 2012) [hereinafter, *Libananco* v. *Turkey.* Decision on Stay].\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 110-123.\n\n43.\n\nEven if the *ad hoc* Committee were to consider that it has jurisdiction to condition the stay on the posting of a security, the Applicant claims that OI has not met the burden of alleging and proving the minimum requirements that must be satisfied for a provisional measure to be granted in this case. On the contrary, the Applicant states that it has been shown that there is no need or urgency to recommend that a security be posted and that the adoption of such measure would not help to prevent any irreparable harm to OI. In fact, the Applicant contends that Venezuela would be the one suffering irreparable harm since it would have to incur in significant costs in order to provide such security.42\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 124-140.\n\n44.\n\nFurthermore, for the Applicant, the posting of a bond would unfairly place OI in a better position than that it enjoyed prior to the Application for Annulment, thus worsening the situation for Venezuela.43 In this regard, the Applicant cites the decisions issued by the *ad hoc* committees in *Patrick Mitchell* v. *the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MINE* v. *Guinea* and *V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile44*\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 141-146.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 141-143. *Patrick Mitchell* v. *Democratic Republic of Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (November 30, 2004), [hereinafter, *Patrick Mitchell* v. *Democratic Republic of Congo**,* Decision on Stay]; *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile,* Decision on Stay; *MINE* v. *Guinea,* Decision on Stay.\n\n**B. The Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that the ordinary meaning of ICSID Convention Article 52(5) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) confirms that specific circumstances must exist that require the stay of enforcement. In the absence of such circumstances, the *ad hoc* Committee should not stay the enforcement of the Award pending its decision on annulment. Citing several previous *ad hoc* committees, such as *SGS* v. *Paraguay, Sempra* v. *Argentina,* and *V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile*,45 among others, OI contends that a continued stay of enforcement is the exception rather than the rule -which in OI\u2019s view is consistent with the extraordinary nature of the annulment remedy.46\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA.* v. *The Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Paraguay\u2019s Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (22 March 2013) [hereinafter *SGS* v. *Paraguay,* Decision on Stay]; *Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine\u2019s Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (5 March 2009) [hereinafter *Sempra* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay]; *V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile,* Decision on Stay.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 16-25.\n\n46.\n\nFor the Respondent on Annulment, it is the party requesting the continuation of a provisional stay who bears the burden of demonstrating that there are specific circumstances that require its continuation.47 In support of its position, the Respondent on Annulment cites Professor Schreuer\u2019s commentary as well as the decisions of the *ad hoc* committees in *SGS* v. *Paraguay, Kardassoupoulos* v. *Georgia, V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile, Vivendi* v. *Argentina (Vivendi II)* among others.48 The Respondent on Annulment also points out that its position on the burden of proof is consistent with the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision regarding the timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions on this issue.49\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 27-37.

Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment rejects the Applicant\u2019s argument that there is a trend in the decisions of prior *ad hoc* committees to maintain the stay of enforcement of awards, to the point where it would become \"almost automatic.\" According to OI, the Applicant wrongfully bases its argument solely on the outcome of the decisions on provisional stays of enforcement in other cases, without scrutinizing the circumstances that led to those outcomes and without taking into consideration that in many instances the continuation of the stay was conditioned on the applicant furnishing a security or a guarantee of compliance with the award.50\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 23.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment contends that the Applicant has established none of the five factors that previous *ad hoc* committees have taken into account when deciding whether to continue the stay. In particular, OI argues that the Applicant has failed to prove: (i) the absence of circumstances indicating that there is a risk of non-compliance with the Award; (ii) the absence of circumstances indicating that its attempt to annul the Award and its request to maintain the stay merely seek to delay the enforcement of the Award; (iii) the lack of prospects for recoupment of the relevant payment if the Award is subsequently annulled; (iv) that lifting the stay of enforcement would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for it; and (v) the lack of prejudice to the Respondent on Annulment that would result from the Applicant\u2019s delayed compliance with the Award. Even assuming *arguendo* that circumstances justifying a continuation of the provisional stay did exist, the Respondent on Annulment contends that (vi) such continuation should be conditioned on the provision of a bond or security by the Applicant.\n\n49.\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s arguments in support of each of these assertions.\n\n***i. There is a substantial risk of non-compliance with the Award by the Applicant***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nContrary to what is argued by the Applicant, the Respondent on Annulment contends that the risk of non-compliance by the Applicant with the Award is a crucial factor in deciding on the Applicant\u2019s request.51 According to OI, this is supported by prevalent annulment decisions, such as *Sempra* v. *Argentina* and *CMS* v. *Argentina.52*\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59-66.\n\n*Sempra* v. *Argentina.* Decision on Stay; *CMS* v. *Argentina.* Decision on Stay.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that there is a very real prospect of the Applicant not complying voluntarily with the Award and points to a list of factors that illustrate this risk. Among others factors, the Respondent on Annulment refers to certain statements made in 2012 by the former President of Venezuela, Mr. Hugo Chavez, that would allegedly indicate that the Applicant does not intend to comply with the ICSID Convention.53\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50.\n\n52.\n\nContrary to what is argued by the Applicant, OI contends that these statements are legally binding and cannot be dismissed as merely political in nature, as confirmed by the *Nuclear Tests* case, as well as *CMS* v. *Argentina.*54 Further, in response to the Applicant\u2019s argument that such statements were made in connection with the denunciation of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent on Annulment notes that some of the declarations by Mr. Chavez were made after such denunciation.55\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 79-86. *CMS* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 77.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment also points out that Venezuela has initiated annulment proceedings and interpretation or revision proceedings against all of the awards rendered against it in recent years under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. For the Respondent on Annulment, this factor, coupled with the fact that the claimants in at least three of such arbitral proceedings have had to initiate enforcement proceedings in various jurisdictions, implies that the Applicant does not intend to honor the Award.56\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 87-90.\n\n54.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent on Annulment refers to the 2012 letter from the Applicant signed by the current President Maduro denouncing the ICSID Convention. Respondent on Annulment contends that such letter contained an open and vocal attack on the ICSID system which further indicates a substantial risk of non-compliance with the Award.57\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 54. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\n55.\n\nCiting *SGS* v. *Paraguay,58,* the Respondent on Annulment contends that another factor that would illustrate the risk of non-compliance is the Applicant\u2019s systematic refusal to make advance payments in a whole category of arbitration cases \"on the basis of its own self-serving interpretation of the ICSID Convention and in clear violation of the principle *pacta sunt servanda\"59*\n\n*SGS* v. *Paraguay,* Decision on Stay.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 55-59. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 93-97.\n\n56.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent on Annulment asserts that the Applicant\u2019s courts have repeatedly concluded that decisions of international courts and tribunals, such as ICSID awards, can be subjected to judicial review and that they cannot be enforced in Venezuela if the Applicant\u2019s courts consider that such awards are contrary to the Venezuelan Constitution.60 For the Respondent on Annulment, these domestic court rulings, in violation of the provisions regarding the finality, recognition and enforcement of ICSID awards contained in ICSID Convention Articles 53 and 54, indicate a risk of non-compliance with the Award, as confirmed by a number of annulment committees, such as the *ad hoc* committees in *Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia* and *Occidental* v. *Ecuador.61*\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 63-80.

Azurix* v. *Argentina.* Decision on Stay.\n\n***ii. The Application for Annulment and the accompanying stay of enforcement request are dilatory***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nCiting *V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile, Patrick Mitchell* v. *Congo* and *Libananco* v. *Turkey,* the Respondent on Annulment asserts that the dilatory nature of the Application for Annulment is highly relevant to the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision on whether to continue the stay of enforcement.65\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. *V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile.* Decision on Stay; *Patrick Mitchell* v. *Congo,* Decision on Stay; and *Libananco* v. *Turkey.* Decision on Stay.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment rejects the \"excessively high threshold\"66 argued by the Applicant and contends that dilatory applications are those \"that are \u2018manifestly abusive,\u2019 \u2018made for an improper purpose\u2019 or based on a pretext while in fact primarily intended to delay the proceedings.\"67 For the Respondent on Annulment, this is not an exhaustive test. Rather, the *ad hoc* Committee must look at the totality of evidence before it and consider all relevant circumstances when making its decision.68\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 139.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 138.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, 8 December 2015, \u00b6 138.\n\n60.\n\nTo prove the dilatory nature of the Application for Annulment, the Respondent on Annulment first contends that the Applicant has deliberately embarked on a dilatory strategy in other ICSID or ICSID Additional Facility proceedings. In this regard, the Respondent on Annulment asserts that the Applicant has not voluntarily complied with at least five of the awards recently rendered against it but, instead, has initiated postaward proceedings seeking to stay the enforcement and thus further delay the payment of compensation.69 Furthermore, the Respondent on Annulment notes that in the last six years the Applicant has requested the disqualification of an arbitrator in either ICSID or ICSID Additional Facility proceedings on no less than nineteen (19) occasions.70\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 92-96. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 142-143.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 98. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that this \"pattern of behavior\" is relevant for the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision on the stay of enforcement.71 Also, according to the Respondent on Annulment, Venezuela\u2019s conduct is motivated by the fact that, due to its poor credit rating, it is \"much cheaper for the Applicant to avoid having to pay for the investments that it expropriates for as long as possible rather than attempting to secure credit from lending institutions or friendly States.\"72\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 141.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 85.\n\n62.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent on Annulment contends that even a cursory review of the Applicant\u2019s Request for Annulment and the request to lift the stay of enforcement makes it clear that none of the grounds invoked by the Applicant can be taken seriously.73\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 86-91. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 147-156.\n\n***iii. The recoupment of any payment by the Applicant in satisfaction of the Award (if the Award is subsequently annulled) is guaranteed***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that there is absolutely no risk that the Applicant would be unable to recoup any payment it makes to OI **,** in the unlikely event that the Applicant succeeds in its Application for Annulment. The Respondent on Annulment maintains that it has conducted itself throughout the proceedings as a model litigant who has abided by all procedural obligations. The Respondent on Annulment stresses that, more importantly, it is a member of a corporate group with market capitalization of several billions of US dollars.74\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 102.\n\n64.\n\nIn response to the Applicant\u2019s arguments on this issue, the Respondent on Annulment maintains that it has adduced factual evidence that demonstrate the vast solvency and liquidity of the corporate group of which it is a member. Additionally, the Respondent on Annulment contends that the Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the possibility of the group\u2019s funds being affected by acts of a third party and regarding the group\u2019s continued creditworthiness in the future are mere speculations.75\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 44.\n\n65.\n\nFurther, the Respondent on Annulment notes that the *ad hoc* Committee could address any recoupment concerns by conditioning the continuation of the stay on the Applicant\u2019s paying the sum into an escrow account and empowering the escrow agent to release the funds to OI if, and only if, the *ad hoc* Committee rejects the Application for Annulment.76\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 103. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 43.\n\n***iv. The termination of the stay would not cause irreparable prejudice or have \"catastrophic consequences\" for the Applicant***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment rejects the Applicant\u2019s argument that the termination of the stay would cause irreparable harm because it would force Venezuela to direct public funds towards the payment of the Award instead of towards other public matters. For the Respondent on Annulment, this argument is not supported by any case law and is contrary to the obligation of a State that has committed an internationally wrongful act to make reparation.77\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 105. Respondent on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 47-52.\n\n67.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent on Annulment contends that, even if the Applicant\u2019s argument is interpreted as a claim that the satisfaction of the Award would lead to \"catastrophic consequences,\" such a claim would also not be supported by the case law. In that regard, the Respondent on Annulment points out that in *CDC* v. *Seychelles* the *ad hoc* committee held that the perpetration of catastrophic consequences upon the award debtor by the lifting of the stay of enforcement of the award was a relevant consideration, but noted that specific evidence and data must be supplied to substantiate such claim.78\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107. *CDC Group PLC* v. *Republic of the Seychelles.* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Whether or Not to Continue Stay and Order (14 July 2004) [hereinafter, *CDC* v. *Seychelles,* Decision on Stay].\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment contends that the Applicant\u2019s argument must also be rejected for practical reasons. For OI, it is a truism that a State debtor in an ICSID arbitration will pay compensation out of public funds that could be used for another purpose - that alone, given it is true of every case, cannot provide a basis on which a stay of enforcement is continued.79\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 108.\n\n69.\n\nFurther, the Respondent on Annulment notes that the Applicant has had the benefit of the expropriated plants for more than five years, and has taken for itself the hundreds of millions of dollars of profits they have generated during that time. Additionally, the Respondent on Annulment points out that the Applicant has repeatedly promised to pay the compensation that was due, and therefore cannot now maintain that it would suffer prejudice by paying.80\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 111.\n\n70.\n\nFinally, given that the sum that the Tribunal ordered to be paid is only 0.09% of the Applicant\u2019s official gross domestic product for 2014, the Respondent on Annulment argues that no catastrophic consequences will flow from its paying the requisite sum of compensation immediately.81 In reply to the Applicant\u2019s contention that this argument is contradictory with OI\u2019s approach in this case, the Respondent on Annulment points out that it has never maintained that the Applicant is soon to become insolvent. Rather, the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s position is that the Applicant will not comply voluntarily with the Award, has limited assets abroad and has a growing list of creditors pursuing those assets.82\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 108-113.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 53.\n\n***v. The Respondent on Annulment would suffer significant prejudice if the stay of enforcement were allowed to continue***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that further delaying the payment of the Award is in and of itself a prejudice sufficient to warrant the discontinuance of the stay. However, the Respondent on Annulment contends that this prejudice increases manifold due to the consequences that the delay has in this case.83 In this regard, the Respondent on Annulment notes that a continuation of the stay would force OI \"backwards in the queue of creditors that are seeking to enforce international awards against the Applicant\u2019s assets.\"84 Further, the Respondent on Annulment contends that \"the pool of assets against which the multiple awards might be enforced is limited and dwindling and therefore every day of delay directly reduces the likelihood of OI being able to enforce the Award.85\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 116.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 117.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 117. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 116-127\n\n72.\n\nAccording to the Respondent on Annulment, this prejudice cannot be offset by postaward interest and, in any event, OI\u2019s entitlement to post-award interest should not be a relevant consideration in the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s analysis on the stay of enforcement, as confirmed by the *ad hoc* committees in *Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia* and *Sempra* v. *Argentina86*\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 118-122. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 126. *Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia,* Decision on Stay and *Sempra* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay.\n\n***vi. If the provisional stay is not terminated, its continuation should be conditioned on the provision of a bond or security by the Applicant***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that if the *ad hoc* Committee decides to maintain the stay of enforcement in this case, it should do so only upon the provision by the Applicant of a financial security from which the Respondent on Annulment can obtain full satisfaction of the Award if the Application for Annulment is rejected. That security should consist of a deposit in an escrow account covering the full amount of the Award, and the corresponding interest until the date of the deposit. Alternatively, the Respondent on Annulment contends that the Applicant should furnish an unconditional and irrevocable first demand bank guarantee issued by a solvent and reputable international bank (with no principal establishment in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and acceptable to the Respondent on Annulment) for the total amount of the Award plus the corresponding interest accrued up to the date the guarantee is issued.87\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 131. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 174.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment contends that the power to condition the stay of enforcement on the provision of a bond or security is implicitly contained in ICSID Convention Article 52(5) as confirmed by ample case law.88 In support of this, the Respondent on Annulment cites *Enron* v. *Argentina, Libananco* v. *Turkey, Sempra* v. *Argentina, Repsol* v. *Ecuador, Kardassoupolos* v. *Georgia, Lemire* v. *Ukraine* and *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* among others.89\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 126-130 and 132-133. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 161-163.\n\n*Enron* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay; *Libananco* v. *Turkey,* Decision on Stay; *Sempra* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay; *Repsol YPF Ecuador, SA.* v. *Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Procedural Order No. 1 (22 December 2005); *Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia,* Decision on Stay; *Joseph Charles Lemire* v. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Annulment (16 July 2013); *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/9, Decision on Stay of Enforcement (24 November 2014).\n\n75.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent on Annulment maintains that there are no \"special circumstances\" in this case that would militate against the posting of a security by the Applicant, and that the main elements that have led previous annulment committees to require the posting of a security are all present in this case.90\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 134.\n\n76.\n\nCiting Professor Schreuer\u2019s commentary and the *ad hoc* committees in *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt* and *CDC* v. *Seychelles,91* the Respondent on Annulment argues that conditioning the stay of enforcement on the provision of a security would be an appropriate way of balancing the rights of the Parties in this case.92\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183. *CDC* v. *Seychelles,* Decision on Stay.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 139-146.\n\n77.\n\nIn response to the Applicant\u2019s provisional measures arguments, the Respondent on Annulment contends that such arguments are \"inconsequential and irrelevant to the present dispute\" given that at no stage in the present exchange of pleadings has OI requested provisional measures.93\n\nRespondent on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 164 and 166-173.\n\n78.\n\nContrary to the Applicant\u2019s claims, the Respondent on Annulment contends that conditioning the provisional stay on the provision of a security or bond would not place the Respondent on Annulment in a better position than the one in which it currently finds itself. In this regard, the Respondent on Annulment argues that a condition of security would merely balance the benefit the Applicant would enjoy if granted a stay of enforcement. Further, OI maintains that the posting of security is a suitable safeguard in the present case, where there are strong indications that the Applicant will not voluntarily comply with the Award. Finally, the Respondent on Annulment also notes that, in the circumstances, the posting of security would counter-balance the detriment caused to it by the delay created by a stay.94\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 165 and 176-208.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Parties have had a full opportunity to be heard and the *ad hoc* Committee is adequately prepared to render this Decision.\n\n80.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Convention Article 53, arbitral awards are final and binding. According to such Article, an award \"shall be binding on the parties;\" it \"shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except for those provided for in th[e] Convention;\" and the parties \"shall abide and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that the enforcement shall have been stayed.\"\n\n81.\n\nNotwithstanding the finality and binding nature of an award rendered under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, a party to an arbitration under said Convention has the right to request annulment of the award, but only under the specific grounds provided for in ICSID Convention Article 52. A request for annulment is a fundamental right which is an integral part of the ICSID system.\n\n82.\n\nThe grounds contemplated in ICSID Convention Article 52 characterize a request for annulment as an exceptional remedy; therefore, it does not constitute an appeal or a means to request the review of the merits of the case. ICSID Convention Article 53(1) is categorical: \"The award shall be binding on the parties **and shall not be subject to any appeal** or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention...\" (highlighted text by the *ad hoc* Committee).\n\n83.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute the principles of finality and the binding nature of an award and the exceptional nature of the annulment mechanism. These principles derive from ICSID Convention Articles 52 and 53, and, as such, must be considered in the interpretation and application of the provisions related to the issue of the stay of enforcement.95\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31.\n\n84.\n\nThe rules regarding the stay of enforcement of an award are contained, in particular, in ICSID Convention Article 52 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54, and are reproduced in pertinent part as follows.\n\n85.\n\nICSID Convention Article 52(5) provides:\n\nThe Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\n\n86.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 54 provides:\n\nStay of Enforcement of the Award\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a *ad hoc* Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\n\n87.\n\nUnder ICSID Convention Article 52(5), an *ad hoc* committee\u2019s decision to continue a stay depends on whether \"it considers that the circumstances so require.\" The ICSID Convention provides no further specification or guidance regarding the circumstances or criteria that are relevant to the *ad hoc* committee\u2019s determination, or the relative weight to be given to such circumstances. Rather, as further addressed immediately below, the determination regarding the stay is left to the discretion of the *ad hoc* committee.\n\n88.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Libananco* v. *Turkey* determined that:\n\nThe exercise of the discretion of the Committee depends on the circumstances surrounding the Stay Request and, therefore, the granting of a stay of enforcement or its continuation should in no way be regarded as automatic. The Committee is aware that some *ad hoc* annulment committees have considered that, \u2018absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic\u2019. However, this does not follow from the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules, and the Committee considers that its decision should be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances.96\n\n*Libananco* v. *Turkey,* Decision on Stay, \u00b6 43.\n\n89.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in the instant case agrees with the reasoning cited in the preceding paragraph. The aforementioned provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules lead this *ad hoc* Committee to a fundamental conclusion, set forth at the outset, that the continuation of the stay of enforcement in the ICSID system is far from automatic. ICSID Convention Article 52(5) provides that the stay shall continue if an *ad hoc* committee considers that \"the circumstances so require.\" Said article does not use other less categorical verbs, such as \"recommend,\" \"deserve,\" \"justify\" or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb \"require.\"97 And the expression \"if it considers\" leaves wide discretion to an *ad hoc* committee to evaluate, case by case, if those circumstances are present or not, in order to continue a stay of enforcement, notwithstanding the binding and final nature of the awards.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 15.\n\n90.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia* indicated:\n\nConsonant with the extraordinary nature of the annulment remedy, the stay of enforcement is an exception to the ICSID enforcement regime. Stay of enforcement during the annulment proceeding is by no way automatic, quite to the contrary, a stay is contingent upon the existence of relevant circumstances which must be proven by the [party requesting the stay].98\n\n*Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia,* Decision on Stay, \u00b6 26.\n\n91.\n\nThe above reasoning is in conformity with decisions of other *ad hoc* committees. For example, the *ad hoc* committee in *Sempra* v. *Argentina* held that:\n\nAgainst that background, the view of the present Committee as to the prerequisites for granting a stay can be summarized as follows. An ICSID award is immediately payable by the award debtor, irrespective of whether annulment is sought or not. A stay of enforcement should not in any event be automatic, and there should not even be a presumption in favour of granting a stay of enforcement. This follows, in the Committee's opinion, from the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of Article 52(4)(sic) of the ICSID Convention, which authorizes the Committee to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision if it considers that the circumstances so require'. Although the ICSID Convention does not give any indication as to what circumstances would warrant a stay, it is nonetheless clear from this language that there must be some circumstances present that speak in favour of granting a stay. As a consequence, it cannot be assumed that there should be a presumption in favour of a stay or that the primary burden is placed on the award creditor to show that continuation of the stay should not be granted.99\n\n*Sempra* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay, \u00b6 27.\n\n92.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee now addresses the issue of burden of proof. The Applicant claims that, unless the Respondent on Annulment proves that there are exceptional circumstances that require lifting the provisional stay, such stay should be maintained.100 The Respondent on Annulment argues that the Applicant is wrong.101 The Applicant argues that the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s letter of 14 October 2015 is a request under Arbitration Rules 54(2) second sentence, to which Arbitration Rule 54(4) makes reference, so that it is the Respondent on Annulment that has to prove the circumstances requiring termination of the stay since it first challenged the provisional stay.102\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Applicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 5-9.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 8.\n\nSee \u00b6 17 of this Decision.\n\n93.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee does not accept the position asserted by the Applicant. That is why, on 15 October 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee requested Venezuela to present its written arguments in favor of the continuation of the stay of enforcement no later than 26 October 2015. After such first submission of 26 October 2015, the Respondent on Annulment filed its Observations on the Applicant\u2019s Request for Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement, of 12 November 2015; then, the Applicant\u2019s Reply of 25 November 2015 was presented to the *ad hoc* Committee, and finally, the Respondent on Annulment submitted its Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement, of 8 December 2015.\n\n94.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee proceeded to organize such rounds of submissions because, in its opinion, in order to decide on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, the *ad hoc* Committee has to be fully satisfied that the circumstances of the particular case so require. The *ad hoc* Committee, therefore, based on the preceding statements and the relevant provisions of ICSID regime governing stays of enforcement, finds that it is for the party seeking the continuation of the stay to show that such circumstances exist, and thus, that the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued. The Applicant bears the burden of proof that there are circumstances in the instant case that, in the discretion of this *ad hoc* Committee, require the continuation of the stay of enforcement.\n\n95.\n\nAs described in paragraph 19 above, the Applicant asserts in particular that: (i) there is no risk of non-compliance by Venezuela with the Award in the event it is not annulled, and, in addition, such failure to honor the Award should not be presumed; (ii) there is a risk that Venezuela will not be able to duly recover its funds if the stay is terminated; (iii) the Application for Annulment is not dilatory; (iv) terminating the stay of enforcement of the Award would cause significant and irreparable damage to Venezuela; and (v) OI would not be prejudiced if the stay of enforcement of the Award continues pending a decision on the annulment. Each Party has addressed these circumstances in its respective submissions to the *ad hoc* Committee.103\n\nSee, for example. Section II (B), (C), (D), (F) and Section III of the Applicant\u2019s First Submission; and \u00b6 40 of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations.\n\n96.\n\nAccordingly, in the subsections that follow the *ad hoc* Committee undertakes a concise review, one by one, of the circumstances argued by Applicant in this case, in order to determine whether the Applicant has met its burden of proof, such that the continuation of the stay of enforcement is required. As a matter of clarification, the *ad hoc* Committee recognizes that the Applicant addressed those circumstances as grounds that, in its view, provide no basis for the *ad hoc* Committee to terminate the stay of enforcement. But this *ad hoc* Committee has already stated that the burden of proof resides with the Applicant to demonstrate that there are circumstances that require, at the discretion of this *ad hoc* Committee, the continuation of the stay of enforcement, and not the contrary.\n\n***i. Risk of non-compliance***\n-------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Applicant suggested in its First Submission that the *ad hoc* Committee should not take into account the existence of a risk of non-compliance with the Award when deciding whether to lift the stay of enforcement.104 Furthermore, the Applicant asserts that the *ad hoc* Committee should not doubt that Venezuela will comply with the Award given its policy of strict compliance with all of its international obligations.105\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 37.\n\nApplicant\u2019s First Submission, \u00b6 38.\n\n98.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the Respondent on Annulment that the risk of non-compliance by the Applicant with the Award is a relevant circumstance in deciding on the Applicant\u2019s request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement. In this regard, the Respondent on Annulment relies on prior decisions regarding the issue of stay of enforcement, such as in *Sempra* v. *Argentina* and *CMS* v. *Argentina.106*\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment states in both its initial Observations and its Rejoinder that as regards the existence of a substantial risk of the Applicant\u2019s non-compliance with the Award, there are at least eight factors that illustrate such risk. It devotes many pages in both its Observations and Rejoinder to address these factors.107\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 58-115; Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 43-82.\n\n100.\n\nSuch eight factors are:\n\ni) The Applicant did not reply to the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s letter requesting it to comply with the Award;\n\nii) The Applicant\u2019s own high ranking officials have expressly stated that the Applicant will not comply with ICSID decisions or with the ICSID Convention;\n\niii) The Applicant has avoided compliance with every recent arbitral award rendered against it under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules;\n\niv) The Applicant has openly and vociferously attacked the ICSID system;\n\nv) The Applicant has failed to comply with its ICSID-related payment obligations in numerous cases;\n\nvi) The Applicant has raised arguments in the enforcement proceedings initiated by the Respondent on Annulment in the United States that further confirm the Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to comply with the Award;\n\nvii) The Applicant\u2019s domestic legal system is contrary to ICSID Convention Articles 53 and 54;\n\nviii) The Applicant is taking measures to shield its assets from enforcement proceedings in foreign jurisdictions.\n\n101.\n\nThe Applicant stated in its Reply that \"none of the speculations or fallacies invoked by OI to cast doubts on the Republic\u2019s willingness to comply with the Award are admissible. There is no risk for 01 that the Republic will fail to comply with the Award in the unlikely event that the Award is not annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee.\"108\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 54.\n\n102.\n\nNotwithstanding such conclusion on the part of the Applicant, this *ad hoc* Committee does not agree that the factors argued by the Respondent on Annulment shall simply be taken as fallacies and speculations. It is not for the *ad hoc* Committee, as correctly argued by the Applicant, to assume or presume that the Award in the instant case will not be fulfilled. But that is not to say that the *ad hoc* Committee shall not direct its attention to the factors that could raise reasonable concerns in connection with compliance with the ICSID Convention, and as stated before, in particular, its Articles 53 and 54.\n\n103.\n\nAfter careful analysis of the arguments presented by the Applicant, particularly those emphasized in its Reply, the *ad hoc* Committee takes the view that the evidence with respect to some of these factors pose a question of risk of non-compliance with the Award. The *ad hoc* Committee is concerned specifically about factors ii), iv) and vii) in connection with the fulfillment of ICSID Convention Articles 53 and 54. As regards the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s factor ii)109*(\"the Applicant\u2019s own high ranking officials have expressly stated that the Applicant\u2019s will not comply with ICSID decisions or with the ICSID Convention\"),* the *ad hoc* Committee notes that other annulment committees have taken statements of State officials into account when assessing the likelihood of future compliance with awards by the State. In *CMS* v. *Argentina,* the *ad hoc* committee considered statements made by former Ministers of Justice and Finance of Argentina to the effect that adverse ICSID awards would be subject to the review by the Argentine Supreme Court in contravention of ICSID Convention Article 54.110\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 51-52 above\n\n*CMS* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n104.\n\nMoreover, the *ad hoc* Committee is persuaded, as argued by the Respondent on Annulment in its Rejoinder, that, contrary to what the Applicant states, it is well established under public international law that statements of high-ranking governmental officials, especially, a Head of State, are legally binding. The *ad hoc* Committee finds the judgments of the International Court of Justice cited by the Respondent on Annulment to be particularly pertinent.111\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 81, and footnotes 84, 85, 86.\n\n105.\n\nIn connection with factor iv) *(\"the Applicant has openly attacked the ICSID system\"),* the *ad hoc* Committee has noted that, as mentioned by the Respondent on Annulment, the Applicant\u2019s letter denouncing the ICSID Convention states that \"the provisions of the [ICSID] Convention have become unconstitutional under Venezuelan law.\" More than that, the *ad hoc* Committee considers of particular relevance, in the present context, the reference made in said letter to the fact, also mentioned by Respondent on Annulment, that ICSID is a \"biased\" institution favouring companies and private entities to the detriment of the sovereign States.112 Such letter is Exhibit RA-08.113\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 91.\n\nThe third paragraph of the letter states: *\"\"La piedra angular de este profundo proceso de devoluci\u00f3n de soberan\u00eda al pueblo de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela, fue la aprobaci\u00f3n mediante refer\u00e9ndum popular de la Constituci\u00f3n de 1999, la cual en su Art\u00edculo 151 reza que en los contratos de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico, si no fuera improcedente de acuerdo con la naturaleza de los mismos, se considerar\u00e1 incorporada, aun cuando no estuviere expresa, una cl\u00e1usula seg\u00fan la cual las dudas* y *controversias que puedan suscitarse sobre dichos contratos y que no llegaren a ser resueltas amigablemente por las partes contratantes, ser\u00e1n decididas por los tribunales competentes de la Rep\u00fablica, de conformidad con sus leyes, sin que por ning\u00fan motivo ni causa puedan dar origen a reclamaciones extranjeras, con lo cual las disposiciones del mencionado Convenio [del C1AD1]* *cayeron en el dominio de la inconstitucionalidad.* \" (Emphasis added by this *ad hoc* Committee).\n\n106.\n\nEven if only one of a number of arguments explaining the decision to denounce the ICSID Convention, the gravity of this accusation raises concerns in regard to the prospects of compliance by the Applicant with ICSID Convention Articles 53 and 54 should the Award not be annulled, considering that under ICSID Convention Article 72, the State\u2019s obligations (as well as its rights) are not affected by its denunciation.\n\n107.\n\nFinally, regarding the factor presented by the Respondent on Annulment under item vii) *(\"the Applicant\u2019s domestic legal system is contrary to Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention\")* above, the *ad hoc* Committee cannot find any evidence in the record supporting the fulfillment of an ICSID award in Venezuela, as argued by the Applicant. To the contrary, some of the aspects underlying this factor vii) are supported by the evidence. The Applicant itself made reference to a decision of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of 2008 that appears in the file under OI-17B, which is a decision that confirms that the conditions for arbitration provided by a treaty have to be \"not contrary to the Constitution.\" That same decision states at its page 24 that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Venezuela may \"confirm and enlarge upon the considerations made in Decision No. 1942/03,\" which also appears in the record under Exhibit OI-14.114\n\n*\"\"Although it is a decision issued in a single-instance proceeding, not subject to appeal and binding on the parties, which must fully comply with it (Article 53 [of the ICSID Convention]), the enforcement in the Contracting State is carried out in accordance with the norms of that State. Therefore, this Chamber considers that a decision that violates the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would be unenforceable in the country. This could give rise to an international claim against the State, but the decision would be unenforceable in the country, in this case, Venezuela.\"* Cited in Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6103.\n\n108.\n\nAccordingly, in connection with the three factors addressed above, the Respondent on Annulment has shown valid grounds for concerns for this *ad hoc* Committee about the validity and binding nature of ICSID awards in Venezuela, under ICSID Convention Articles 53 and 54, and the Applicant, in turn, has not met its burden of proof of demonstrating an absence of risk of non-compliance such that the continuation of the stay is warranted.\n\n***ii. Risk of non-recovery***\n------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAfter due consideration of the arguments presented by the Applicant, and the counterarguments presented by the Respondent on Annulment, in their respective two rounds of submissions, the *ad hoc* Committee is not persuaded that the asserted difficulty or impossibility for Venezuela to recover any amounts eventually paid out to the Award creditor if the Award is annulled is a circumstance requiring the continuation of the stay.\n\n110.\n\nIt is true, as argued by the Applicant, that *ad hoc* committees under the ICSID Convention have held that a significant factor in favor of maintaining the stay of enforcement is the difficulty for the respondent State to recover the amount paid under the award if it is later annulled. In support of this, the Applicant cites the decisions of the *ad hoc* committees of *CMS* v. *Argentina, Enron* v. *Argentina* and *El Paso* v. *Argentina.115*\n\nSee \u00b6 29 of this Decision.\n\n111.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that there is a possibility that a third party to this case might seize any amount paid under the Award, thus making it impossible for Venezuela to recover such amount if the Award is annulled.116\n\nSee \u00b6 30 of this Decision.\n\n112.\n\nIn conducting the assessment the risk of non-recovery by the Applicant, some *ad hoc* committees have considered the profile of the claimant in order to evaluate such risk. For example, the *ad hoc* committee in *Patrick Mitchell* v. *Democratic Republic of Congo* signaled that since the claimant was a natural person, whose assets and activities were difficult to localize, the circumstances posed difficulties for recoupment.117\n\n*Patrick Mitchell* v. *Democratic Republic of Congo,* Decision on Stay, \u00b6 24.\n\n113.\n\nIn the instant case, it has been demonstrated in the record that OI is a large international company with the considerable solvency and liquidity of the corporate group of which it is a member.118 The argument that the Respondent on Annulment may cease being a member of such group has not been evidenced, but is only speculative. There is nothing in the record that suggests to this *ad hoc* Committee that the Respondent on Annulment would refuse reimbursement of any payment in the event the Award is annulled, nor is there persuasive evidence that a third party\u2019s possible attachment of its assets may affect the company to such extent as to impede payment to Venezuela if the *ad hoc* Committee were to annul the Award.\n\nSee Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 103, referring to \"Form 10-K Owens Illinois, Inc. Annual Report,\" United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 10 February 2015.\n\n114.\n\nAgain, the *ad hoc* Committee does not find convincing evidence of actual circumstances related to the issue of non-recovery that, in itself, requires a continuation of the stay of enforcement.\n\n***iii. Whether the Application for Annulment is well founded or dilatory***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nRegarding the issue of whether the Application for Annulment is well founded or dilatory, the *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the statements made by other annulment committees that the merits of an annulment application are not relevant for purposes of the decision on whether or not to grant the stay, or the continuation of the stay. An appropriate inquiry is, however, whether the application is manifestly dilatory.119 Likewise, the mere fact that the application is not dilatory is not sufficient to grant the extension of the stay.120\n\n*Elsamex* v. *Honduras.* Decision on Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 96, 97.\n\n*SGS* v. *Paraguay,* Decision on Stay, \u00b6 94.\n\n116.\n\nHaving reviewed the Application for Annulment by Venezuela, the *ad hoc* Committee does not find that the arguments or allegations of the Applicant in support its Application for Annulment could be considered manifestly unfounded or merely efforts to delay the enforcement of the Award. However, this finding does not dictate that the stay automatically should be maintained. This is so for at least two reasons. First, this *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the Applicant that at this stage of the annulment proceedings it is not for the *ad hoc* Committee to decide on whether the Application for Annulment is well founded or not, apart from its screening for manifest abusiveness. Second, a serious good faith application is the least that can be expected from an applicant, and nothing in the ICSID Convention expresses, or allows an understanding, that compliance with or fulfillment of that minimum duty requires the extension of the stay.\n\n***iv. Irreparable harm***\n--------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment maintains that the Applicant has failed to prove that terminating the provisional stay would cause it irreparable prejudice or \"catastrophic consequences.\"\n\n118.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s main argument is that, if the stay is terminated, then Venezuela will need to divert a significant amount of its public funds for payment of the Award. If so, those public funds, so much needed in Venezuela for essential services, such as health, education and public security, would not be available, and therefore, such public services will not be adequately supported, affecting the needs of the population.121 The *ad hoc* Committee notes that should the Award be confirmed, payment of the Award amount, whether voluntary or as a result of its enforcement, would in any case come from public funds.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 89.\n\n119.\n\nWhile that much is obvious, the Applicant also has not established in the evidence that the termination of the stay would necessarily result in the deductions from the specific budgetary items involving the \"people\u2019s needs\" that the Applicant cites as the basis for its claimed irreparable harm, as opposed to deductions, if any, from other budgetary items.122\n\nCf. \u00b6 67 of this Decision.\n\n120.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s reasoning that the Applicant\u2019s argument, given is breadth and systemic implications, is unconvincing. \"If the Applicant were right in this proposition, Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 54 (1) would be dead letter provisions. That would contravene the public international law principle of *effete [sic] utile (ut res magis valeat quam pereat),* also called the principle of effectiveness.\"123\n\nRespondent on Annulments Rejoinder, \u00b6 50.\n\n121.\n\nFurthermore, the *ad hoc* Committee has taken note of evidence in the record, as highlighted by the Respondent on Annulment, of the Applicant\u2019s stated intention to pay compensation, and the Applicant\u2019s having offered in July 2011 a payment of USD 100 million.124 Furthermore, the Applicant does not appear to contest the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s position that for several years since October 2010 the plants in question have generated substantial revenues.125 These elements of the record further militate against the Applicant\u2019s contention that the lifting of the stay will result in irreparable harm.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 111, citing *OI European Group B.V.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25, Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, 29 March 2013, paras 14, 89 and 283 (Exhibit 01-42); and Second Witness Statement of Mr Enrique Machaen, 1 July 2013, Summary of Meeting held on 11 July 2011 (Exhibit OI-36).\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, \u00b6 109.\n\n122.\n\nIn the absence of any special circumstances duly evidenced in the record of the proceeding, this *ad hoc* Committee is not persuaded that the Applicant\u2019s argument of irreparable prejudice in the event of termination of the stay constitutes adequate circumstances under ICSID Convention Article 52(5). Furthermore, the *ad hoc* Committee concurs with the Respondent on Annulment that the Applicant did not provide evidence of irreparable harm, even less, of catastrophic consequences.\n\nv. ***Prejudice if the stay of enforcement of the Award continues pending a decision on the annulment***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the maintenance of the stay would not cause any actual, certain or real damage to the Respondent on Annulment, since the time elapsed between the rendering of the Award and the actual payment of any awarded amount -if the Award is not annulled- would be covered by interest due to OI in accordance with the Award. In support of this argument, the Applicant cites the decisions by the *ad hoc* committees in *V\u00edctor Pey Casado* v. *Chile* and in *Azurix* v. *Argentina.126*\n\nSee \u00b6 37 of this Decision.\n\n124.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee is persuaded by the argument made by the Respondent on Annulment, both in its Observations and the Rejoinder, that delay in the payment of the Award amounts, covered by interest, does not constitute the only potential prejudice in the event the provisional stay is maintained:\n\n[I]ntemational tribunals have issued numerous awards in recent years that have ordered the Applicant to pay (often vast) sums of compensation to claimants for its multiple violations of international law. Several of those awards are currently the subject of enforcement proceedings. Further, the Applicant is the State with the largest number of ICSID arbitrations pending against it -some or all of which may create yet further award debts and further enforcement claims on the Applicant\u2019s domestic and foreign asset holdings. In this context, maintaining the Provisional Stay would force the Respondent on Annulment backwards in a long queue of creditors... Thus, every day of delay that the Committee sanctions by way of a continuation of the Provisional Stay directly reduces the likelihood of the Respondent on Annulment being able to enforce the Award...127\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 118 (b).\n\n125.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s argument based on the payment of interest does not address, in the view of this *ad hoc* Committee, the fact that there is a growing list of cases where the Applicant has been ordered to pay significant sums of compensation.128 This growing list of cases appears to be undisputed by the Applicant, putting the Respondent on Annulment in a long line of creditors undertaking efforts to collect award amounts against the Applicant.\n\nSee Section II.C.(i) of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Observations, and Section III.A.(ii) of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n126.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee notes that also in this case, as in all other alleged circumstances previously examined, the Applicant has been unable to convincingly show that circumstances exist which, according to Article 52(2) of the Convention, require a continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n127.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s analysis may therefore end here with the decision that the provisional stay is to be lifted given the absence of circumstances requiring its continuation. As stated in paragraph 19 of this Decision, the Applicant asserted that: (i) there is no risk of non-compliance by Venezuela of the Award in the event it is not annulled, and, in addition, such failure to honor the Award should not be presumed; (ii) there is a risk that Venezuela will not be able to duly recover its funds if the stay is terminated; (iii) the Application for Annulment is not dilatory; (iv) terminating the stay of enforcement of the Award would cause significant and irreparable damage to Venezuela; and (v) OI would not be prejudiced if the stay of enforcement of the Award continues pending a decision on the annulment. As regards each of these contentions, the *ad hoc* Committee expressed, one by one, why it was not convinced that there are circumstances that merit, under ICSID Convention Article 52(5), the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n128.\n\nTaking into account that the Applicant has not discharged its burden of proving that there is any circumstance that requires the continuation of the provisional stay, this *ad**hoc* Committee is convinced that it must terminate such provisional stay, and so it decides.\n\n***vi. Continuation of the stay conditioned on the posting of a security***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nDue to the decision this *ad hoc* Committee is taking in the present case, there is no need to consider the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s request to condition the continuation of the stay on the posting of a security.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n130.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the *ad hoc* Committee:\n\n1. Rejects the request from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award rendered on March 10, 2015, in ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25, *OI European Group, B.V.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.*\n\n2. Declares that the provisional stay is terminated, and therefore, orders the lifting of such provisional stay effective as of the date hereof.\n\n3.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment (the **\"Application\")** of the award rendered on March 10, 2015 (the **\"Award\")** in the arbitration proceeding between OI European Group B.V. and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25 (the **\"Underlying Arbitration\").**\n\n2.\n\nThe Award decided a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** on the basis of the Agreement on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which entered into force on November 1, 1993 (the **\"BIT\"** or **\"Treaty\"),** and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14,1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\"** or the **\"Convention\").**\n\n3.\n\nThe Application was filed by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the **\"Applicant\"** or **\"Venezuela\").** The respondent on annulment is OI European Group B.V. **(\"OIEG\"** or the **\"Respondent on Annulment\").** The Applicant and the Respondent on Annulment are collectively referred to as the **\"Parties.\"** The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n4.\n\nOIEG initiated the Underlying Arbitration claiming that the Applicant had violated several substantive provisions of the BIT and was liable for its internationally wrongful conduct in relation to OIEG\u2019s investment in two of the largest glass production plants in Venezuela (the **\"Plants\"** or the **\"Investment\").** This Investment was held by OIEG through its equity interest in two Venezuelan companies, F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. (the **\"Companies\").**\n\n5.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal unanimously held that it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute and that the Applicant had violated a number of substantive standards contained in the BIT, namely, (i) that the Applicant had illegally expropriated the Investment in violation of Article 6 of the BIT; and (ii) that the Applicant had violated the fair and equitable treatment standard within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the BIT as well as (iii) its duty to observe obligations entered into with regard to OIEG\u2019s Investment under Article 3(4) of the BIT. As a result of these breaches, the Tribunal ordered the Applicant to pay OIEG US$372,461,982 in compensation, as well as compound interest on the principal sum using a LIBOR interest rate for one-year deposits in US dollars, plus a margin of 4 percent. The Tribunal also ordered the Applicant to pay OIEG US$5,750,000 in costs and expenses, with the same compound interest rate.1\n\nAward, \u00b6 984.\n\n6.\n\nThe Applicant seeks the annulment of the Award on four of the five grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (iii) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iv) the Award fails to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, the Applicant filed the Application with the Secretary-General of ICSID. The Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"****),** within 120 days after the date of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nThe Application included a request under ICSID Convention Article 52(5) for a stay of enforcement of the Award, pending a decision by the *ad hoc* Committee (the **\"Committee\").**\n\n9.\n\nOn July 17, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application and at the same time notified the Parties that enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of October 13,2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Committee had been constituted, in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(3), and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Committee was composed of Dr. Alvaro Castellanos Howell (Guatemalan), President, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Republic of Guatemala; Prof. Piero Bernardini (Italian), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Italian Republic, and Mr. David Pawlak (American and Irish), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Slovak Republic; all members were appointed by the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council. Ms. Sara Marzal Yetano, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n11.\n\nOn October 14, 2015, OIEG sent a letter noting that the Applicant bears the burden of specifying the circumstances that require the continuation of the stay of enforcement and that it had failed to provide any type of justification for its request in its Application. On this basis, the Respondent on Annulment argued that the stay of enforcement should be discontinued or allowed to terminate automatically within 30 days of the constitution of the Committee.\n\n12.\n\nOn the same day, October 14, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties requesting an initial advance on costs of US$200,000 from the Applicant, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, pursuant to the schedule determined by the Committee, as subsequently amended by the Parties, the Applicant filed a first submission in support of its request to maintain the stay of enforcement; on November 12, 2015, the Respondent on Annulment filed observations on the Applicant\u2019s first submission; on November 25, 2015, the Applicant filed a second submission on the stay of enforcement of the Award; and on December 8, 2015, the Respondent on Annulment filed its rejoinder.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated October 27,2015, the Committee notified the Parties that, as contemplated by Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Committee decided to maintain the provisional stay on the enforcement of the Award until it had an opportunity to review the Parties\u2019 submissions and to issue a further decision on the matter.\n\n15.\n\nOn December 9, 2015, the Committee held its first session. Given that the Parties had not agreed to hold the first session on any of the dates proposed by the Committee within the 60-day period envisaged in Arbitration Rule 13, and had not agreed to extend such period, the Committee held its first session without the Parties by teleconference as permitted by Arbitration Rule 13.\n\n16.\n\nFollowing the first session, on December 15, 2015, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters, as previously submitted in writing, and the decision of the Committee on disputed issues.\n\n17.\n\nOn December 20, 2015, the Committee notified the Parties that it deemed that the two rounds of written submissions had provided ample opportunity for the Parties to present their observations on the issue of the stay of enforcement, and declined the Applicant\u2019s November 25, 2015 request for a round of oral submissions.\n\n18.\n\nOn March 2, 2016, the Committee informed the Parties by e-mail that, in accordance with Section 16.5 of Procedural Order No. 1, it had decided not to consider the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s letter of February 26, 2016, and requested the Parties to abstain from presenting further unsolicited submissions, consistent with the Committee\u2019s direction in its letter of October 27,2015.\n\n19.\n\nOn April 1, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat received a wire transfer in the amount of US$121,000 from the Applicant as partial payment of the funds requested in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations to cover the costs associated with the annulment proceedings. After an additional amount of US$73,767.29 was received, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties on April 7, 2016, confirming that it had received a total of US$194,767.29 in connection with these proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nOn April 4, 2016, the Committee issued a decision rejecting the Applicant\u2019s request to continue the stay of enforcement (the **\"First Stay Decision\").** The Committee declared the provisional stay terminated.\n\n21.\n\nPursuant to the pleadings schedule established in Procedural Order No. 1: (i) on April 7, 2016, Venezuela filed its Memorial on Annulment **(\"Memorial on Annulment\");** (ii) on August 5, 2016, OIEG filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment **(\"Counter-Memorial on Annulment\");** and (iii) on September 24, 2016, Venezuela filed its Reply on Annulment **(\"Reply on Annulment\").**\n\n22.\n\nOn July 11, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested that the Applicant make a second advance payment of US$200,000 to cover administrative costs and expenditures for the next three to six months. As explained in the ICSID Secretariat\u2019s letter, this advance payment was to be paid no later than August 10, 2016. On July 25, 2016, the Applicant sent a letter in response, requesting that the ICSID Secretariat review and confirm its projected costs. The ICSID Secretariat reviewed and confirmed its projections with respect to these proceedings. In a letter dated July 30, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat reiterated its request for US$200,000.\n\n23.\n\nOn September 7, 2016, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties informing them that no funds had been received. The ICSID Secretariat invited either Party to make the requested payment as soon as possible and no later than September 22,2016. No payment was made, however, by the stipulated date.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of September 28, 2016, the Secretary-General moved that the Committee stay the proceeding for non-payment of the required advances in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n25.\n\nOn October 3, 2016, the Committee informed the Parties that it had decided to extend the deadline for payment until October 14, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the Committee\u2019s decision, the annulment proceeding would be stayed automatically if payment were not received by this extended deadline. No payment was made by this extended deadline.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of October 17, 2016, in accordance with its letter of October 3, 2016, the Committee stayed the proceedings for non-payment of the required advances, effective as of October 14,2016.\n\n27.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, the Committee confirmed receipt of full payment of the required advances and, after a stay of nearly six months, the Committee resumed the proceedings.\n\n28.\n\nOn May 25, 2017, the Respondent on Annulment filed its Rejoinder on Annulment **(\"Rejoinder on Annulment\").**\n\n29.\n\nOn September 12,2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 in which it ruled on certain pending procedural matters related to the organization of the hearing on annulment.\n\n30.\n\nA hearing on annulment was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on September 26 and 27,2017 (the **\"Hearing on Annulment\").** In addition to the Committee and its Secretary, present at the Hearing on Annulment were:\n\n*For the Applicant:*\n\nMr. Diego B.

The ICSID Secretariat invited either Party to make the requested payment as soon as possible and no later than December 18, 2017. On December 13, 2017, the Applicant informed the ICSID Secretariat that the payment was \"in process\" and that it anticipated that the payment would be made in \"the coming days.\"\n\n34.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, the Parties filed their respective submissions on costs.\n\n35.\n\nOn December 13, 2017, the Applicant proposed the disqualification of Dr. Castellanos (the **\"Proposal for Disqualification\").**\n\n36.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, the Secretary of the Committee confirmed that, in accordance with Arbitration Rules 53 and 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n37.\n\nOn December 18, 2017, Prof. Bernardini and Mr. Pawlak (the **\"Two Members\")** set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Dr. Castellanos\u2019 explanations. In accordance with such timetable, the Respondent on Annulment filed a submission on December 26, 2017 and Dr. Castellanos furnished his explanations on January 2, 2018.\n\n38.\n\nOn January 9, 2018, both Parties submitted additional observations on the Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n39.\n\nBy email of January 11, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat asked the Applicant to provide an update regarding the pending payment. By email of the same day, the Applicant informed the ICSID Secretariat that the payment was \"en route\" and that completion of the payment would occur in \"the coming days.\" On February 8, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties that it had not yet received the Applicant\u2019s payment. On March 8, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat confirmed receipt of the funds from the Respondent on Annulment.\n\n40.\n\nOn March 9, 2018 the Two Members issued their decision rejecting the Proposal for Disqualification and the proceeding resumed pursuant to Arbitration Rules 53 and 9(6).\n\n41.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat requested that the Applicant make a fourth advance payment of US$180,000 no later than July 6, 2018 to cover administrative costs and expenditures until the end of the proceedings.\n\n42.\n\nOn July 10, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat sent a letter to the Parties informing them that no funds had been received. The ICSID Secretariat invited either Party to make the requested payment as soon as possible and no later than July 25, 2018. On July 16, 2018, OIEG sent a letter informing the ICSID Secretariat that it planned to make the payment of US$180,000. On July 25, 2018, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties that US$179,970 had been received from the Respondent on Annulment.\n\n43.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, the Applicant submitted a Second Request for Stay of Enforcement of the Award (the **\"Second Stay Request\"),** in response to which the Respondent on Annulment submitted its Observations on July 31, 2018.\n\n44.\n\nOn September 7, 2018, further to the Committee\u2019s invitation, each Party submitted its statement of costs associated with the Second Stay Request.\n\n45.\n\nOn September 24, 2018, the Committee issued a decision rejecting the Applicant\u2019s Second Stay Request (the **\"Second Stay Decision\").**\n\n46.\n\nThe annulment proceeding was declared closed on September 25, 2018.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nAs noted above, the Applicant seeks the annulment of the Award on four of the five grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal was not properly constituted; (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; (iii) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iv) the Award fails to state the reasons on which it is based.2\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30.\n\n48.\n\nBelow is a summary of the Parties\u2019 arguments and the Committee\u2019s analysis on each of the grounds of annulment invoked by the Applicant, preceded by a short discussion on the nature and scope of the annulment mechanism.\n\n**A. Nature and Scope of the Annulment Mechanism**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Applicant\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Applicant disagrees with OIEG\u2019s \"excessively restrictive interpretation of the provisions contained in the ICSID Convention on the annulment of awards.\"3 According to Venezuela, if ICSID\u2019s annulment mechanism had \"the features described by OIEG, then the function of the Committee would be virtually non-existent and this proceeding would be devoid of any sense.\"4\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 11.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 9.\n\n50.\n\nIn response to OIEG\u2019s argument that the Application is \"nothing but an appeal disguised as annulment,\"5 Venezuela contends that its arguments in support of the Application \"do not refer to reasonable disagreements in terms of the interpretation of the facts and the law, but are limited to certain defects contained in the Award which are so serious that they fit the specific list included in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention as grounds for annulment of the Award.\"6\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 14.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 16.\n\n51.\n\nOpposing OIEG\u2019s \"mistaken\" invocation of a \"duty to interpret the grounds for annulment [...] in a restrictive manner,\"7 the Applicant maintains that, when examining the grounds for annulment set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee should not adopt \"an extensive or narrow interpretation.\"8 In support of this position, the Applicant relies on the decisions in *Mitchell* v. *Congo,9 Wena Hotels v. Egypt,10* and *Consortium R.F.C.C. v. Morocco.11* The Applicant also cites the annulment decision in *Soufraki* v. *UAE,*12 according to which:\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention must be read in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation forming part of general international law, which principles insist on neither restrictive nor extensive interpretation, but rather on interpretation in accordance with the object and purpose of the treaty.13\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 30.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 30.\n\n*Mr. Patrick Mitchell v.

Indonesia,* the Applicant also argues that this measure of prudence \"does not mean that an annulment committee has the discretion not to annul an award where it has defects listed by the ICSID Convention as grounds for annulment and those defects have been determining factors in the final outcome of the dispute between the parties.\"17\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 33.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 34; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

The procedure for the annulment of an award rendered under the ICSID Convention is self-contained, and autonomous from domestic law. The annulment remedy is governed, in particular, by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and Arbitration Rules 50, 52, 53, 54 and 55.\n\n59.\n\nIn accordance with *Soufraki v. UAE,* as invoked by the Applicant in paragraph 51 above, among other annulment decisions, this Committee agrees that Article 52 of the ICSID Convention should be interpreted neither restrictively nor extensively, but rather in accordance with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. As contended by the Respondent on Annulment,29 one such important purpose - indeed, \"a fundamental goal for the ICSID system\" - is \"assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards.\"30\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51-56, as summarized *supra* \u00b6 54.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016 (\"2016 ICSID Paper\"), \u00b6 71 (OILA-117).\n\n60.\n\nAdditionally, according to the Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID **(\"2016 ICSID Paper\"),**\n\n[t]he function of an *ad hoc* Committee is either to reject the application for annulment or to annul the award or a part thereof on the basis of the grounds enumerated in Article 52. Its function is not to rule on the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute if it decides to annul, which would be the task of a new Tribunal should either party resubmit the dispute following annulment of the award.31\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 35 (OILA-117) (internal references omitted).\n\n61.\n\nThus, even if an *ad hoc* annulment committee reaches a decision to annul, partially or totally, an ICSID award, that committee does not have the mandate to revisit the merits of the case in which the annulled award was rendered. The above passage of the 2016 ICSID Paper is directly relevant in the case at hand, given that the Parties have presented, for example, expert testimonies during the Hearing on Annulment.\n\n62.\n\nIt is true that nothing in the ICSID Convention, nor in the Rules, expressly prohibits an *ad hoc* committee from stating its opinion on any issues addressed by an ICSID tribunal in its award. However, this Committee agrees with the proposition stated in various decisions that an *ad hoc* committee should not pronounce upon aspects of the award that are not essential to its decision.32\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 64 and footnote 118 (and the authorities cited therein) (OILA-117).\n\n63.\n\nAs a corollary of the above, this Committee endorses several of the principles established by prior *ad hoc* committees, as expressed in the 2016 ICSID Paper:\n\n(1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled;\n\n(2) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an *ad hoc* Committee is limited;\n\n(3) *ad hoc* Committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an *ad hoc* Committee cannot substitute the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the merits for its own;\n\n(4) *ad hoc* Committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards;\n\n(5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly; and\n\n(6) an *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s authority to annul is circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an *ad hoc* Committee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, *i.e.,* either partial or full.33\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 74 (OILA-117).\n\n64.\n\nIt is within the framework for the Committee\u2019s analysis described in paragraphs 58 *et seq.* above that the Committee will examine OIEG\u2019s argument that this Application is \"at best, an appeal disguised as an application for annulment,\"34 and the Applicant\u2019s position that its arguments in support of the Application \"do not refer to reasonable disagreements in terms of the interpretation of the facts and the law, but are limited to certain defects contained in the Award which are so serious that they fit the specific list included in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention as grounds for annulment of the Award.\"35\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 47.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 14,16. For the avoidance of doubt, despite the Applicant\u2019s broad reference to Article 52(1), the Applicant did not raise the ground contemplated in Article 52(1)(c) (regarding corruption).\n\n65.\n\nThus, in the sections of this Decision that follow, with an understanding that the Parties are in agreement that annulment is not an appeal, but an exceptional remedy, the Committee will address the alleged defects in the Award from this cardinal point of view.\n\n**B. The Tribunal Was Not Properly Constituted**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n66.\n\nIn seeking annulment under Article 52(1)(a) relating to the improper constitution of the Tribunal, Venezuela complains that prior to the Award\u2019s issuance Mr. Mourre lost the requisite qualities of impartiality and independence under the Convention given that he had entered into negotiations regarding a consultancy with Dechert LLP **(\"Dechert\"),** a law firm which, the Applicant maintains, was adverse to it in several international and domestic disputes.36 Further, the Applicant complains that the timing of (i) the revelation of Mr. Mourre\u2019s professional contacts with Dechert and (ii) the closing of the proceedings in the Underlying Arbitration \"precluded the Republic from exercising its right to [...] eventually propose [his] disqualification pursuant to the ICSID Convention.\"37\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 62.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 55. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\n67.\n\nAccordingly, on the basis of Articles 52(1), 14, 40(2) and 57 of the ICSID Convention, the Applicant argues that \"if a member of a tribunal may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, the tribunal is not properly constituted and, therefore, a potential award rendered by it will not be valid.\"38 The Applicant relies on the annulment decisions in *Vivendi v. Argentina II39* and *EDF v. Argentina40* which held that an arbitrator\u2019s lack of the qualities set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention constitutes a ground for annulment pursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.41\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 35. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 41.\n\n*Vivendi v.

Argentina,* \u00b6 127 (VLA-03).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37.\n\n68.\n\nThe Applicant points out that the ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment is continuous in nature. In this regard, when considering whether a tribunal has been properly constituted, the requirements in Article 14 of the ICSID Convention \"must not only be satisfied at the time when the tribunal is actually constituted but must also continue to be met at all times,\"42 that is, until the date of the award. Therefore, there may be cases in which a tribunal is properly constituted \"but-due to a change in circumstances-it subsequently ceased to be properly constituted,\" giving rise to a ground for annulment.43\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 38. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 73.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 64.\n\n69.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that the ability to reach a decision in an independent and impartial manner must not be assessed in an abstract or general way, but must be judged in a concrete and specific manner, on a case by case basis.44\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 39.\n\n70.\n\nRelying again on *Vivendi v. Argentina II* and *EDF v. Argentina,* the Applicant further contends that a party is entitled to seek disqualification during the annulment proceeding if the circumstances prevented it from doing so during the pendency of the arbitration proceeding.45 In such case, the Applicant argues, the annulment committee must conduct a *de novo* review of the disqualification proposal.46 The Applicant asserts that this is the only avenue for its challenge to be heard, and further that the purported conflict and denial of the right to be heard regarding same are also grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d).47\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 44.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 53; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 35; *see infra* Section III.D.\n\n71.\n\nRegarding the standard applicable to disqualification requests, the Applicant relies on the disqualification decision issued by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in *Blue Bank v. Venezuela,* which is based on the \"objective perspective of an impartial and sufficiently informed third party:\"48\n\nThe applicable legal standard is an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party. As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.49\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 75.\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v.

Argentina* annulment committee, which held that:\n\n[T]he standard applied under Article 14(1) is whether a reasonable third party, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.50\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 64; *EDF* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 111 (VLA-03). *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 77-79.\n\n73.\n\nOn this basis, the Applicant highlights that proof of actual dependence or bias is not required, \"it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.\"51 This principle of the \"avoidance of appearance of impropriety\" is generally applied in both domestic and international law, and reflected in the International Bar Association\u2019s Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (the **\"IBA Guidelines\"):**\n\nDoubts are justifiable if a reasonable third person, having knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, would reach the conclusion that there is a likelihood that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors other than the merits of the case as presented by the parties in reaching his or her decision.52\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 64; *EDF* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 109 (VLA-03).\n\nIBA Guidelines, General Standard 2(c) (VLA-61).\n\n74.\n\nIn support of its Application, the Applicant cites several cases in which a party sought the disqualification of an arbitrator:\n\n\u2022 In *Blue Bank v. Venezuela,53* arbitrator Jos\u00e9 Maria Alonso was disqualified given that he was a member of a law firm in Madrid, whose New York and Caracas offices were handling an international arbitration against Venezuela addressing similar issues.54\n\n\u2022 In *Burlington v. Ecuador,55* the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council found that a sentence in one of the explanations provided by arbitrator Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a concerning the alleged conflict would lead a third party making a reasonable evaluation to manifestly perceive an appearance of lack of impartiality.56\n\n\u2022 In *Perenco v. Ecuador,57* the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration considered that Judge Brower\u2019s words in a journalistic interview created an unfavorable opinion against Ecuador, thus giving a reasonable third party justifiable doubts about his impartiality.58\n\n\u2022 In *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan,59* the other members of the tribunal found that a reasonable third party would find it very likely that, in view of arbitrator Bruno Boesch\u2019s work in a prior case that involved similar parties and facts, his objectivity and open-mindedness regarding the facts and issues to be decided upon would be tainted.60\n\n\u2022 In *Vito Gallo v. Canada,61* it was established that the conflict of interest created by a professional relationship between an arbitrator and a firm with an interest in the outcome of the dispute could not be side-stepped by the mere fact that this work was not substantial or current.62\n\n\u2022 In *Alpha Projekt* v. *Ukraine,63* it was established that failure to disclose the relationship between an arbitrator and a third party with an interest in the dispute could constitute evidence of bias, if the relationship was recent and professional.64\n\n*Blue Bank* v. *Venezuela,* \u00b6\u00b6 66-69 (VLA-05).\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 82.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v.

Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nOIEG argues that the threshold for annulling an award on the basis of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention is exceptionally high, as illustrated by the fact that this provision has only been invoked in three cases and none of them resulted in annulment.68\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment further contends that (i) annulment is not the proper means to seek the disqualification of an arbitrator;69 (ii) even under the Applicant\u2019s interpretation of Article 52(1)(a), it must establish a manifest lack of impartiality or independence as required under Articles 14 and 57; which (iii) should lead to annulment only if it would have altered the outcome of the award.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 86; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 21.\n\n*(i) Annulment is not the proper means to seek the disqualification of an arbitrator*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nFor OIEG, Article 52(1)(a) should be interpreted in accordance with the customary international law rule enshrined in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the **\"VCLT\").70** Thus, \"the Committee\u2019s starting point should be to discern the ordinary meaning of the terms \u2018that the Tribunal was not properly constituted\u2019\" and such interpretation must lead to the conclusion that Article 52(1)(a) only covers breaches of the rules governing the process of constitution of tribunals, *i.e.,* Section 2 of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention, Articles 37 to 40, entitled the \"Constitution of the Tribunal.\"71\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 24.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 27.\n\n79.\n\nOIEG further argues that, even if the Committee were to resort to the \"supplementary means of interpretation\" referred to in Article 32 of the VCLT, the end result would be the same, since the drafting history of the ICSID Convention confirms the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s interpretation of Article 52(1)(a).72 In this regard, OIEG explains that\n\n\"[d]uring the drafting of the ICSID Convention a proposal similar to what the Applicant is now advancing was rejected.\"73\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31, 32.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 93, citing the *History of the ICSID Convention,* Volume II, p. 872 *(\"History\")* (VLA-47).\n\n80.\n\nOIEG finds additional support in the decision of the committee in *Azurix v. Argentina.* There, the committee explained that the role of an annulment committee in relation to arbitrator challenges brought under Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention is limited to examining under Article 52(1)(d) whether or not there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the way in which the challenge was addressed; and that a challenge to an arbitrator brought for the first time on annulment is inadmissible under Article 52(1)(a).74 For OIEG, the legal authorities on which the Applicant relies - *EDF v. Argentina* and *Vivendi v. Argentina II -* are unpersuasive on this particular issue and the Committee should adhere to the more judicious and reasoned view expressed by *Azurix v. Argentina.75*\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 87,91, citing *Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 (Griffith, Ajibola, Hwang), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 1,2009 *(\"Azurix* v. *Argentina\"),* \u00b6\u00b6 280, 281 (OILA-89); Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 33.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 89, 92; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 52.\n\n81.\n\nOIEG objects to the Applicant\u2019s assertion that the only possibility to challenge arbitrators in relation to facts discovered after the closure of the Underlying Arbitration is to request the annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(a) or (d).76 First, if a party discovers any such facts between the closure of a proceeding and the issuance of the award, it can request that the proceeding be reopened pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38.77 Second, if the grounds for disqualification only become known after the award is rendered, the relevant party can request the revision of the award under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.78\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 35.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 36.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 90, 91; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 37.\n\n82.\n\nOIEG cites Mr. Broches, who stated that \"if the grounds for disqualification only became known after the award was rendered, this would be a new fact which would enable a revision of the award.\"79 Similarly, OIEG notes, the *Azurix v. Argentina* committee stated that:\n\nIn the event that the party only became aware of the grounds for disqualification of the arbitrator after the award was rendered, this newly discovered fact may provide a basis for revision of the award under Article 51 [...] but [...] such a newly discovered fact would not provide a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(a).80\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 91, citing *History,* p. 872 (VLA-47).\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 281 (OILA-89). OIEG also relies on *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* which stated that \"the revision and annulment remedies are compartmentalized. The discovery of a new fact does not come under one of the grounds for annulment listed at Article 52(1), so that there can be no overlapping between a ground for annulment and a ground for revision.\" *See* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 39, citing *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs* v. *Georgia,* ICSID Case Nos.

Venezuela:87*\n\nThe standard to be applied [...] is whether a reasonable third person, with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude, on an objective basis, that the challenged arbitrator is manifestly lacking in the ability to act impartially (Article 14 read with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention).88\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 99. *See also* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 60.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 97.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Company and others* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30 (Zuleta, Bucher), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L.

Rather, \"it must establish facts indicating that [Mr. Mourre] would have a manifest bias in relation to the outcome of the present case.\"89 The Respondent on Annulment cites the following passage from the *ConocoPhillips Decision on Disqualification II:*\n\nThe allegation that serves as the basis for the challenge, assuming it can be established, must be capable of being related to the present case, that is, that the particular facts must give rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality in this case.90\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 101.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Decision on Disqualification II,* \u00b6 12(c) (OILA-102).\n\n88.\n\nWith respect to the requirement of \"manifest,\" OIEG maintains that, as confirmed by \"ICSID jurisprudence\" and commentary, \"manifest\" means \"evident\" or \"obvious\" and related to the \"ease with which the alleged lack of the qualities can be perceived.\"91 According to OIEG, this high standard has been applied in *Blue Bank v.

Venezuela,93* the facts are \"starkly different from those in the *OIEG* Arbitration.\"94 In contrast with the situation of Mr. Mourre:\n\n(a) Arbitrator Alonso was a partner in Baker McKenzie Madrid; (b) Baker McKenzie New York and Baker McKenzie Caracas represented the claimant in a parallel and similar ICSID proceeding against Venezuela (i.e., in *Longreef* v. *Venezuela)',* (c) Arbitrator Alonso likely would have had to decide issues in *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* relevant to *Longreef v. Venezuela',* (d) Arbitrator Alonso was a member of Baker McKenzie\u2019s International Arbitration Steering Committee; and (e) Arbitrator Alonso stated that the result in *Longreef v. Venezuela* could have an effect on his remuneration [...].95\n\n\u2022 In *Burlington v. Ecuador,96* the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council based his decision on the fact that, in the context of a disqualification proceeding, arbitrator Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a \"made \u2018allegations about the ethics of counsel for the Republic of Ecuador\u2019 that \u2018[did] not serve any purpose in addressing the proposal for disqualification or explaining circumstances relevant to the allegations that the arbitrator manifestly lacks independence or impartiality.\u2019\"97 In this case, the Applicant has never argued that Mr. Mourre made those sorts of allegations.98\n\n\u2022 In *Perenco* v. *Ecuador,99* the conclusion of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration was based on a statement made by Judge Brower that expressed unfavorable views on Ecuador and prejudged a fundamental issue of the case. Again, the Applicant has never argued that Mr. Mourre made similar comments. Additionally, in that case the parties had agreed that the challenge would be resolved applying the IBA Guidelines, which set a different standard than the one applicable to this case.100\n\n\u2022 In *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,101* Mr. Bruno Boesch was disqualified for having acted as arbitrator in prior proceedings that involved similar parties and facts. The Applicant has failed to explain how this decision could support its arguments regarding the effects of Mr. Mourre\u2019s conversations and future relationship with Dechert.102\n\n\u2022 In *Vito Gallo* v. *Canada,103* the standard applicable was different since it was a case governed by the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Additionally, there is no factual correlation between the facts in that case and the facts in the present one.104\n\n\u2022 In *Alpha Projekt* v. *Ukraine*,105 and contrary to the Applicant\u2019s misrepresentation of the decisions and the facts of that case, the deciding arbitrators made clear that nondisclosure cannot make an arbitrator partial or lacking independence, but only the facts or circumstances that were not disclosed. Further, they cited with approval Prof. Schreuer\u2019s statement that even professional contacts between an arbitrator and legal counsel representing one of the parties are not, as a rule, an obstacle to the exercise of independent judgement.106\n\n*Blue Bank* v. *Venezuela,* \u00b6\u00b6 66-69 (VLA-05).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 93.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 93 (internal references omitted).\n\n*Burlington* v. *Ecuador,* \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80 (VLA-06).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 95.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 95.\n\n*Perenco* v. *Ecuador,* \u00b6\u00b6 48-58 (VLA-62).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 96.\n\n*Caratube Decision on Disqualification,* \u00b6\u00b6 89-91 (VLA-63).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 97.\n\n*Vito Gallo* v. *Canada,* \u00b6 32 (VLA-64).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.\n\n*Alpha Projekt* v. *Ukraine,* \u00b6 63 (VLA-65).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 104. *See also id.,* \u00b6 105.\n\n90.\n\nLastly, OIEG maintains that \"[m]ere professional contacts cannot by themselves constitute grounds for disqualification.\"107 In this regard, OIEG points out that in *SGS v. Pakistan,* when deciding on the challenge of Mr. Thomas (an arbitrator) due to his contacts with Mr. Paulsson (Counsel for Pakistan) in another arbitration, the deciding arbitrators made clear that an applicant must show \"dependency\" or \"reciprocal partisanship.\"108 Similarly, OIEG notes that Prof. Schreuer states that \"[p]rofessional contacts between an arbitrator and legal counsel representing one of the parties are not, as a rule, an obstacle to the exercise of independent judgment.\"109\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 109; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 22.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Gen\u00e9rale de Surveillance, S.A. v.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nAs recorded above, the Parties have debated at length whether an arbitrator\u2019s loss of his or her ability to act in an impartial and independent manner, as required under Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention, may properly constitute a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a).\n\n95.\n\nAs a starting point, the Committee undertakes to discern the intent of the Contracting States when agreeing to the specific wording of Article 52(1)(a) stating that \"the tribunal was not properly constituted.\" To that end, the Committee recalls Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.115 As is known, Article 31(1) provides that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" In accordance with Article 32, interpretation of a treaty also includes recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, \"including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31 [...].\"\n\nAlthough the ICSID Convention predates the VCLT, these provisions of the VCLT are generally regarded as declaratory of customary international law.\n\n96.\n\nApplying the foregoing, the Committee begins with a focus on the text of Article 52(1)(a), which, as noted above, provides that a \"party may request annulment of the award\" on the ground \"that the Tribunal was not properly constituted.\" In its ordinary meaning, the term \"constitute\" means \"establish,\" \"form,\" \"frame,\" \"give legal form to,\"116 thus pointing to the initial formation of a given body. This interpretation is supported by the use of the verb \"was\" immediately preceding the term \"constituted,\" pointing to a situation existing at the point in the past when the tribunal was established.\n\n*See* The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, 7th ed., p. 217.\n\n97.\n\nThe Committee further interprets the term \"properly constituted\" in the context of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Namely, Chapter IV, Section 2, of the Convention, entitled \"Constitution of the Tribunal\" and comprising Articles 37-40, lists the conditions to be met for a \"properly constituted\" tribunal, which must be satisfied at the time of the tribunal\u2019s initial formation. Such conditions include, for example, the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, applicable timeframes, nationality requirements, and, under Article 40(2), the condition that arbitrators \"shall possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14,\" including the ability to \"exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n98.\n\nThe foregoing interpretation also is supported by reference to the Arbitration Rules. Specifically, Chapter I (Rules 1 through 12), entitled \"Establishment of the Tribunal,\" in its very first provision refers to ICSID Convention Chapter IV, Section 2 (\"Constitution of the Tribunal\"),117 indicating a connection between the terms \"establishment\" and \"constitution.\"\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 1(1) (\"Upon notification of the registration of the request for arbitration, the parties shall, with all possible dispatch, proceed to constitute a Tribunal, with due regard to Section 2 of Chapter IV of the Convention.\").\n\n99.\n\nAccordingly, if the conditions under Articles 37-40 of the ICSID Convention for the proper constitution of the tribunal are not satisfied at the time of such constitution, then as a general matter either party may request the annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(a) on the ground that \"the tribunal was not properly constituted.\"118 However, in the case of the lack or loss of qualities listed in Article 14(1), the disqualification provisions of Articles 57 and 58 apply (together with Arbitration Rule 9), which regulate the disqualification of an arbitrator in case of a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1).119 Contrary to the Applicant\u2019s contention,120 Article 52(1)(a) is not the proper means to address the disqualification of an arbitrator.\n\nAron Broches suggested that, given the complex provisions governing the constitution of the tribunal and the fact that improper constitution of the tribunal may lead to annulment of the award, the tribunal should obtain the parties\u2019 agreement that the tribunal was properly constituted at the first session with the parties. *See* A. Broches, Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States of 1965, Explanatory Notes and Survey of its Application in AJ van den Berg (ed.), *Yearbook Commercial Arbitration,* Vol. XVIII (1993), 627, 662-663. ICSID practice indicates that it is not uncommon for tribunals to ask the parties during the first session to confirm that the tribunal was duly constituted, in order to avoid untimely, subsequent challenges. Bishop-Marchili, cit. footnote. 21, \u00b6 5.17. *See also* 2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 78 (OILA-117).\n\nThe ICSID Convention: A Commentary, p. 936, \u00b6 124 (OILA-79).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37, 55.\n\n100.\n\nAs OIEG has maintained,121 the intent of the drafters of the ICSID Convention was to distinguish annulment under Article 52(1)(a) from disqualification under Article 57. The latter provision provides:\n\nA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 87. For support, OIEG cites R. Doak Bishop & Silvia M. Marchili, *Annulment Under the ICSID Convention* (Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 50-51 (OILA-77). Upon a close examination of that source, it is true that its authors posit such a possible intent on the part of the drafters, but they ultimately are equivocal as to the interplay between Article 52(1)(a) and disqualification. *Id.,* p. 53. Regardless, herein, the Committee finds ample support for such a distinction in the text and context of Articles 52(1)(a) and 57 of the Convention, as confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires.*\n\n101.\n\nThe last sentence of Article 57 appears to confirm OIEG\u2019s interpretation in that it provides that a party \"may\" in addition *(i.e.,* to disqualification for manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1)) propose disqualification as a remedy also in a case in which the arbitrator \"was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"122 Notably, Section 2 includes Article 40(2), which requires that \"[a]rbitrators appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators shall possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" Thus, even in the case of an arbitrator\u2019s lack of qualities required for the proper constitution of the Tribunal, the remedy expressly identified in the ICSID Convention is not annulment under Article 52(1)(a) but disqualification under Article 57. If this is so at the time of constitution of the tribunal, there is no evident basis to draw the opposite conclusion where a condition of dependence or partiality arises due to a change of circumstances at a later point in the proceeding. Thus, the distinction in the ICSID system between annulment and disqualification means that Article 57 regulating disqualification is to the exclusion of Article 52(1)(a) regulating annulment.\n\nNotably, in presenting a quotation of Article 57, including its last sentence, the Applicant describes that the provision \"regulates the possible grounds for disqualification.\" *See* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 71.\n\n102.\n\nAs supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT, the drafting history of the ICSID Convention confirms the Committee\u2019s conclusions.123 During the drafting, a proposal similar to the interpretation now advanced by the Applicant was rejected when the States did not agree to add a provision \"which would allow annulment of the award where disqualification could have been possible had it been made before the award was rendered.\"124 In the context of that discussion, Mr. Broches observed, \"if the grounds for disqualification only became known after the award was rendered, this would be a new fact which would enable a revision of the award.\"125\n\nAt the Hearing on Annulment, both Parties relied on selected excerpts of the drafting history of the ICSID Convention to support their respective cases. *See generally* Tr. Day 2, pp. 528-548.\n\n*History,* p. 872 (VLA-47).\n\n*Id.*\n\n103.\n\nSimilarly, the 2016 ICSID Paper observes that:\n\nthe drafting history of the ICSID Convention indicates that the ground of improper constitution of the Tribunal was intended to cover situations such as a departure from the parties\u2019 agreement on the method of *constituting* the Tribunal or an arbitrator\u2019s failure to meet the nationality or other requirements for *becoming* a member of the Tribunal.126\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 77 (emphasis added).\n\n104.\n\nIn addition to the above VCLT analysis, the Committee considers in chronological order the three cases that the Parties have presented in addressing this issue. The first is *Azurix v. Argentina,* in which the committee considered whether a challenge addressed in the underlying proceeding pursuant to ICSID Convention Articles 57 and 58, could be reviewed on annulment under Article 52(1)(a).127 In answering the question in the negative, the *Azurix* committee reasoned that:\n\nArticle 52 does not state that \"any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\" will constitute a ground of annulment. Rather, the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(a) is that the tribunal was \"not properly constituted\". The procedure for constituting the tribunal, including the procedure for challenging arbitrators on grounds of a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1), is established by other provisions of the ICSID Convention. If [such] procedures have been properly complied with, the Committee considers that the tribunal will be properly constituted for the purposes of Article 52(1)(a).128\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina,* Section G (OILA-89).\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 279 (OILA-89).\n\n105.\n\nThe *Azurix* committee thus found that the review of a decision on disqualification would amount to an improper \"de *novo* opportunity to challenge members of the tribunal after the tribunal has already given its award.\"129 As recorded by OIEG, the *Azurix* committee -consistent with Mr. Broches\u2019 observations set forth above - further stated,\n\n[i]n the event that the party only became aware of the grounds for disqualification of the arbitrator after the award was rendered, this newly discovered fact may provide a basis for revision of the award under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention but, in the Committee\u2019s view, such a newly discovered fact would not provide a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(a). If no proposal for disqualification is made by a party under Article 57, there will be no decision under Article 58, and in such a case there can [...] be no basis for contending that the tribunal was not properly constituted by reason of any failure to comply with Article 57 or Article 58.130\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 280, 282 (OILA-89).\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 281 (OILA-89).\n\n106.\n\nThe second case is *Vivendi v. Argentina II,* in which the committee considered Argentina\u2019s argument that the tribunal was not properly constituted under Article 52(1)(a), because of an arbitrator\u2019s purported conflict of interest during the proceedings, which was discovered only after the issuance of the Award in question.131 According to the *Vivendi II* committee, this was a question that could be reviewed on annulment.132\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina II,* \u00b6\u00b6 201, 202, 232 (VLA-01).\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina II,* \u00b6 232 (VLA-01). The *Vivendi II* committee, like the *EDF* committee, considered the arbitrator challenge under both Articles 52(1)(a) and 52(1)(d). The Committee addresses the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) below in Section III.D.\n\n107.\n\nSimilarly, in *EDF* v. *Argentina* (the third case addressed by the Parties), at issue was Argentina\u2019s challenge to an arbitrator based on a purported conflict that was discovered between the time the proceedings had closed and the time of the Award.133 According to the *EDF* committee, a challenge based on Article 14(1) was \"a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(a).\"134 The *EDF* committee observed the holdings *of Azurix* and *Vivendi II as* follows:\n\nThe Committee has taken careful note of the views of the *Azurix* Committee [...] that [...] the issue should be raised in proceedings for revision under Article 51 and not for annulment but it respectfully disagrees and prefers the approach of the *Vivendi II* Committee [...].135\n\n*EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 1, 165-168 (OILA-86).\n\n*EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6 127 (OILA-86).\n\n*EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6 130 (OILA-86).\n\n108.\n\nFor the above-stated reasons concerning the ordinary meaning of Article 52(1)(a), and its context within the ICSID Convention and Rules, as confirmed by the Convention negotiating history, this Committee is respectfully unable to share the holding and conclusion of the committees in *Vivendi II* and *EDF,* and instead prefers those of the *Azurix* committee. This interpretation maintains the distinction between the rules and standards concerning tribunal formation, arbitrator challenges and annulment, thus facilitating the operation of the Convention and Rules, as the drafters intended.136\n\n*See also Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* \u00b6 13 (OILA-98).\n\n109.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that the Applicant\u2019s claims of partiality and dependence are inadmissible as grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Factual Background***\n---------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Applicant invokes this ground for annulment based on the following factual background.\n\n111.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, in *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. v. the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21) ***(\"Favianca v. Venezuela\"),*** Mr. Mourre, then a member of the tribunal in that case, informed the parties that in May 2015 he would enter into a consultancy agreement with Dechert with the title of Special Counsel. The letter to the parties in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* stated as follows:\n\nAs from May 2015, I will leave Castaldi Mourre & Partners to establish my own individual arbitrator practice. I will also as from then have a consultancy agreement with the law firm of Dechert LLP with the title of Special Counsel. At Dechert, I will only work on specific matters on which Dechert will ask me to participate, and I will have no access whatsoever to databases for matters other than those on which I will work directly. I will have a fixed compensation from Dechert and will not share in its profits or costs. My arbitrator\u2019s work will therefore be completely separate from Dechert. As a consequence, I do not consider me a Dechert lawyer for conflict purposes and I do not see Dechert\u2019s activities, except for the Dechert cases I work on, to be such as to cast any doubt on my independence and impartiality.\n\nI am however informing the parties, for the sake of transparency, that Dechert has within the past year been adverse to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and/or Petroleos de Venezuela in six litigation matters that are entirely unrelated to the present arbitration. I have no additional information on these cases and, for the avoidance of doubt, I of course confirm that I will not participate in any manner in any work of Dechert with respect to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela or any other entity related to the Republic of Venezuela.137\n\nCommunication from Mr. Mourre to the parties in *Favianca v. Venezuela,* March 4, 2015 (Exhibit V-10).\n\n112.\n\nMr. Mourre did not send such a letter to the Parties in the Underlying Arbitration.\n\n113.\n\nOn that same date, March 4,2015, the Tribunal notified the Parties that the proceeding was declared closed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 38(1).138\n\nAward, \u00b6 77.\n\n114.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, Venezuela replied to Mr. Mourre\u2019s communication in *Favianca v. Venezuela* alleging that the information received raised doubts about his ability to act as an independent and impartial arbitrator in the cases in which Venezuela was a party and seeking additional information.139 In particular, Venezuela requested:\n\n\u2022 The date of commencement of the negotiations or talks between Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP that led to the decision to join the law firm under the terms disclosed on 4 March 2015.\n\n\u2022 The date on which those negotiations or talks concluded through the agreement disclosed on 4 March 2015.\n\n\u2022 The identity of the persons who conducted those negotiations or talks between Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP and the place or places where they were held.\n\n\u2022 A list of the cases in which Dechert LLP acts as attorney or counsel in\u2014domestic or international\u2014arbitration or court proceedings against Latin American States or their instrumentalities, including details on the stage of the proceedings, industry, subject matter, claimant and\u2014in the case of arbitration proceedings\u2014institution conducting the proceedings and names of the members of the tribunal.\n\n\u2022 A list of the duties to be performed by Mr. Mourre as from May 2015 in his capacity as \u2018Special Counsel\u2019 for Dechert LLP.\n\n\u2022 A list of the team of in-house attorneys and external advisors with which Mr. Mourre will work as legal consultant within Dechert LLP, including the organizational chart on the basis of which he will receive his work requests and/or instructions.\n\n\u2022 In the event that it has already been discussed in the negotiations with Dechert LLP or thereafter, a list of the cases in which Mr. Mourre will participate, including the industries and subject matters involved.140\n\nLetter from Venezuela to the tribunal in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela,* March 9, 2015 (Exhibit V-11).\n\nLetter from Venezuela to the tribunal in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela,* March 9,2015 (Exhibit V-11).

In this communication, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela requests additional information regarding my communication to the parties dated March 4, 2015, stating however that my future professional relationship with Dechert LLP \"is such as to generate conflicts of interest that are not compatible with the requirements that an arbitrator must meet under the ICSID Convention\" *(arbitrator\u2019s translation).* In this regard, I can only confirm that my professional relationship with this law firm - which will only start on May 1st [sic] - is not such as to generate any conflict since, (i) my arbitrator\u2019s work (including in this case) will be totally separated from Dechert, (ii) I will not be a partner in Dechert and I will have no access whatsoever to their databases, (iii) my relationship with Dechert will be limited to specific matters on which Dechert will ask me to participate, and (iv) I will not have any involvement (and information on) in the cases on which Dechert may act against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela or related entities. Therefore, I am unable to provide any information relating to cases in which Dechert may be acting against the Republic or related governmental entities, since I don\u2019t have that information and I don\u2019t have access to it. I can only add that the conversations that led to the establishment of this professional relationship were informally conducted with Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero, with whom I have a longstanding friendship, and were concluded shortly before I made my declaration. Based on this, I can only confirm my total independence and impartiality. I however understand and respect the position of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In view of the importance attached to all arbitrators having the full confidence of the parties, if the Republic still believes that my statement is not compatible with my duties of independence and impartiality, I will have no choice but to resign as arbitrator in this case.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAlexis Mourre141\n\nEmail from the ICSID Secretariat to the parties in *Favianca v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/5, ICSID Website, available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/cases/casedetail.aspx?CaseNo= ARB/11/5 (Exhibit IO-50).\n\n*F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de* *Venezuela, C.A.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21 (Kim), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, June 16,2015, \u00b6 38 (OILA-28).\n\n120.\n\nBoth Parties appear to acknowledge that the consultancy arrangement between Mr. Mourre and Dechert never materialized.147\n\n*See, e.g.,* Tr. Day 1, Mr. Nistal (Counsel for OIEG), 112:3-4 (\"It is also undisputed that Mr. Mourre never got to work with Dechert.\"); Tr.

Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the contractual or professional relationship established between Mr. Mourre and Dechert - in addition to his personal friendship with one of its main partners - \"severely and irretrievably affected his impartiality and independent judgment.\"148 This is so because the decisions and opinions expressed by Mr. Mourre in cases in which Venezuela is a party \"would have been of great importance for the other cases\" in which Dechert acts against Venezuela or its government-owned company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. **(\"PDVSA\").149** As an example, the Applicant refers to *Convial v. Peru150* in which Dechert acted for the claimants and offered an interpretation of the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard under international law \"which is radically different from the position adopted by\" Venezuela in this proceeding.151\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 65. *See also id.,* \u00b6 62.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 65.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 65, citing *Convial Callao S.A. and CCI - Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Concesiones de Infraestructura S.A. v.

Argentina II* and *EDF v. Argentina,* since the party seeking the annulment did not have access to the relevant information before the proceeding was closed and thus it is \"the annulment committee that must resolve the issue for the first time.\"153\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 55.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 55.\n\n123.\n\nHowever, the Applicant points out that the situation in this case differs from *Vivendi v. Argentina II,* because in such case this ground for annulment was rejected on the basis of the explanations given by the challenged arbitrator, Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, who objected to the challenge.154 Instead, in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* and *Longreef v. Venezuela,* Mr. Mourre - unlike what happened with Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler - \"did not challenge the proposal for disqualification but expressly stated that the Republic\u2019s position as to the incompatibility between his situation and the duties of independence and impartiality left him with *no choice* but to resign.\"155\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58. Similarly, the Applicant points out that in *EDF v. Argentina* \"Mr. Rem\u00f3n never accepted Argentina\u2019s argument nor decided to resign voluntarily as a member of that tribunal.\" *See* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 118.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 57 (emphasis in original). *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 118.\n\n124.\n\nThe Applicant concludes that, in the instant case, given the similar circumstances as in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* and *Longreef* v. *Venezuela,*\n\nthere is no alternative but to assume that, if Mr. Mourre had also disclosed in this proceeding that he had been hired by the law firm Dechert LLP (as he should have done), then he would have resigned from his position as arbitrator by virtue of his conflicts of interest and, therefore, the Award that is now sought to be annulled would not have been rendered.156\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 59. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 103.\n\n125.\n\nThe Applicant states that at the time the Award was signed and the proceeding declared closed, Mr. Mourre \"knew that he was affected by a conflict of interest [of] which he believed\" the parties had to be informed in *Favianca v. Venezuela.157* Further, for the Applicant, (i) on the one hand, the fact that the Award was rendered when the conflict of interest was already present \"precludes any possibility of validating [Mr. Mourre\u2019s] acts,\"158 and (ii) on the other hand, the fact that the Award was unanimous does not preclude annulment on the basis of this ground.159 The Applicant argues that it \"cannot be truly known, nor assumed to be true [...] that Mr. Mourre had no effect on the shaping of the Tribunal\u2019s opinion in any of the points decided upon.\"160\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 60.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 67.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 68.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 104, 105.\n\n126.\n\nThe Applicant adds that the improper constitution of the Tribunal is \"aggravated and confirmed\" by the following circumstances. Even though the Award was dispatched on March 10, 2015, the Award \"was issued\" on March 4, 2015, the same date of the closure of the proceeding.161 What is more, the other two arbitrators, Mr. Mourre and Mr. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, signed before the closure of the proceeding, on February 20, 2015 and February 26, 2015, respectively, and \"[t]his irregularity in itself constitutes a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure which warrants the annulment of the award.\"162\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 61\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 61. The Committee addresses this separate ground - serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure - below in Section III.D.\n\n127.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the conflict of interest \"does not arise upon initiation of Mr. Mourre\u2019s actual work as Special Counsel for Dechert LLP, but with the incompatible professional negotiations that ended up giving rise to that contract\" and that necessarily predated the closure of the proceedings and the issuance of the Award.163\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58. *See also id.,* \u00b6 94.\n\n128.\n\nFor the Applicant, the facts that have been proven are \"sufficient to establish the lack of an appearance of impartiality of Mr. Mourre\" and, in any event, the lack of any additional evidence that could be deemed necessary cannot be attributed to Venezuela, but to Mr. Mourre\u2019s \"refusal\" to provide it.164 Furthermore, the Applicant asserts that Mr. Mourre\u2019s refusal to provide the information requested \"does not reduce but rather ratifies the need to proceed with the annulment.\"165\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 64.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 62. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 63-66.\n\n***c. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nAs mentioned above, OIEG argues that the Applicant\u2019s arguments on this ground for annulment fail as a matter of law and as a matter of fact. The Applicant\u2019s request fails as a matter of law because the annulment ground under Article 52(1)(a) is not the proper procedural avenue to challenge the lack of impartiality or independence of Mr. Mourre. OIEG states that, on this basis alone, the Committee should reject this ground for annulment.\n\n130.\n\nOIEG further argues that the Applicant\u2019s Application on the basis of this ground fails as a matter of fact because, even under the Applicant\u2019s own \"misinterpretation\" of the applicable legal standard, the Applicant has failed to discharge its burden of proving (i) the existence of facts indicating that Mr. Mourre manifestly lacked impartiality or independence in the Underlying Arbitration; and (ii) that Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged loss of those qualities could have had a material effect on the Award.\n\n*(i) Article 52(1)(a) is not the proper procedural avenue to challenge the lack of impartiality or independence of Mr. Mourre*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThis argument from the Respondent on Annulment has already been summarized above. Notably, OIEG adds that the Applicant had \"at least two alternative procedural avenues available to it to raise its concerns regarding the impartiality or independence of Arbitrator Mourre, requesting: (a) that the Tribunal reopen the proceeding; or (b) revision of the Award.\"166 Additionally, for OIEG:\n\nBoth procedural avenues presented significant advantages over the course of action the Applicant decided to follow. Not only would pursuit of each avenue have been consistent with the ICSID Convention, but also it would have allowed the issue to be decided by the appropriate adjudicators. If the Applicant had requested either the reopening of the proceeding or the revision of the Award and then submitted a disqualification proposal, that proposal would have been decided by Arbitrators Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto and Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, as mandated by the provisions of the ICSID Convention that govern the disqualification of arbitrators. Unlike this Committee, those arbitrators would have had access to the entire record of [the] *OIEG* Arbitration and, by definition, would have been in a better position to assess the potential effect of Arbitrator Mourre\u2019s contacts with Dechert on his ability to exercise independent or impartial judgment in that arbitration.167\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 45. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 40-44.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 45.\n\n132.\n\nFurther, OIEG points out that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(4), if the Applicant had sought either to reopen the proceeding or to request the revision of the Award, and then submitted a disqualification proposal, Mr. Mourre would have been able to furnish explanations.168 By choosing to raise its concerns only in the annulment proceeding, however, \"the Applicant necessarily deprived him of that right and now seeks to have the Committee engage in a level of speculation regarding Arbitrator Mourre\u2019s actions that is not only artificial, but also simply contrary to the legal standard applicable to the disqualification of arbitrators under the ICSID Convention.\"169\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 46.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 47.\n\n133.\n\nFinally, OIEG asserts that, if the Applicant had opted for requesting the reopening of the proceeding \"immediately after Arbitrator Mourre\u2019s 4 March 2015 disclosure, with a view to moving for his disqualification, any disqualification proposal would have complied with the temporal requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1)\"170*(i.e.,* to submit the disqualification proposal \"promptly\" after the discovery of the relevant facts). Instead, the Applicant chose to raise its concerns for the first time in this annulment proceeding, that is, more than four months after Mr. Mourre\u2019s disclosure. Such period of time, as confirmed by \"ICSID jurisprudence,\" cannot possibly meet the \"promptly\" requirement.171\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 48.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 48. *See also id.,* \u00b6 49.\n\n*(ii) Even under its own misinterpretation of Article 52(1)(a), the Applicant has failed to discharge its burden of proof*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nOIEG argues that, even under the Applicant\u2019s interpretation of Article 52(1)(a), the Applicant has the burden to prove: (a) the existence of facts that would indicate that Mr. Mourre manifestly lacked independence or impartiality at end of the Underlying Arbitration; and (b) that Mr. Mourre\u2019s loss of those qualities at that stage of the proceeding could have had a material effect on the Award.172 OIEG contends that the Applicant has \"manifestly failed to discharge its burden of proof for both requirements.\"173\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 55.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 55.\n\n\u2022 The Applicant has failed to prove the existence of facts indicating Mr. Mourre\u2019s manifest lack of impartiality or independence\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nOIEG first argues that there is no evidence on the record suggesting a dependency relationship between Mr. Mourre and Dechert.174\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 70.\n\n136.\n\nSecond, OIEG states that the Applicant has failed to prove that Dechert had an interest in the outcome of the Underlying Arbitration.175 OIEG explains that, while it appears that Dechert has represented claimants against the Applicant in a number of proceedings, \"the Applicant has not provided any evidence to suggest that those proceedings were related in even the most remote way to the [Underlying] Arbitration.\"176\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 71-74.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 72.\n\n137.\n\nThird, even assuming that Dechert had an interest in the outcome of the Underlying Arbitration, \"the Applicant has failed to prove that this could have an effect on Arbitrator Mourre\u2019s impartiality or independence.\"177 In this regard, OIEG points out that the Applicant has not provided any evidence that Mr. Mourre \"was privy to any information regarding the arguments made by Dechert on behalf of its clients\" in such proceedings.178 On the contrary, Mr. Mourre\u2019s letter of March 11, 2015 made clear that he did not have access to such information.179 Further, the Applicant has failed to prove that Mr. Mourre would have benefited \"in a material way from Dechert\u2019s success\" in those other cases.180 As Mr. Mourre explained, he would be neither a \"Partner\" nor a \"Dechert lawyer\" and he would \"have a fixed compensation from Dechert and [would] not share in its profits or costs.\"181\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 75. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 141-148.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 75.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 76. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 150-152.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 77.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 77.\n\n138.\n\nOIEG further objects to the Applicant\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged \"refusal\" to provide additional information should lead the Committee to conclude that a conflict of interest existed, or that he lacked independence or impartiality. In this regard, first, OIEG states that it is the Applicant, not the arbitrator, who bears the burden of proving the existence of facts indicating the manifest lack of impartiality or independence.182 Second, OIEG adds that Mr. Mourre did not \"refuse\" to provide the information requested by the Applicant. As it \"is clear from his 11 March 2015 communication, he responded to those of the Applicant\u2019s demands to which he was able to respond and considered reasonable.\"183 Third, \"Arbitrator Mourre explicitly and repeatedly \u2018confirm[ed] [his] total independence and impartiality\u2019. He cannot be expected to provide evidence proving the opposite of what he firmly believed.\"184\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 79.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 80.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 81.\n\n139.\n\nOIEG also rejects the Applicant\u2019s argument that Mr. Mourre lacked impartiality and independence because he failed to disclose his professional relationship with Dechert in the Underlying Arbitration, while disclosing it in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela.185* For OIEG this argument fails as a matter of law because a non-disclosure does not in itself result in disqualification - it is only the facts and circumstances that were not disclosed that can do so.186 Additionally, according to OIEG the argument must fail as a matter of fact, since there are differences between the two proceedings that \"could justify Arbitrator Mourre\u2019s decision to make his disclosure in *Favianca and OldV v. Venezuela* but not in the *OIEG* Arbitration.\"187 In this regard, OIEG points out that Mr. Mourre\u2019s professional relationship with Dechert was to start from May 2015, at which point the *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* case would still be active, while the Underlying Arbitration would have concluded.188\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 82.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 83. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 137, 138.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 84.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 85.\n\n140.\n\nOIEG further objects to the Applicant\u2019s claim that Mr. Mourre\u2019s letter of March 11, 2015 in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* is an implicit admission that his future relationship with Dechert constituted a conflict of interest in such case, as well as in the Underlying Arbitration.189\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 88.\n\n141.\n\nFirst, OIEG states that Mr. Mourre did not admit to any conflict of interest in *Favianca v. Venezuela.* On the contrary, Mr. Mourre made clear that \"his resignation was not based on the existence of a conflict of interest, stating unequivocally that it was based on the Applicant\u2019s \u2018belie[fs]\u2019 regarding his \u2018duties of independence and impartiality\u2019 and on the importance he attached to \u2018having the full confidence of the parties.\u2019\"190\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 90. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 133, 134.\n\n142.\n\nSecond, even assuming that this communication constituted an admission of a conflict of interest in *Favianca v. Venezuela,* \"that would not mean that the same conflict existed in the *OIEG* Arbitration or that Arbitrator Mourre would have resigned in that case, too.\"191 As mentioned before, while Mr. Mourre\u2019s relationship with Dechert \"would have overlapped in time with the proceedings in *Favianca and OldV v. Venezuela* and in *Longreef v. Venezuela,* it could not have overlapped with the *OIEG* Arbitration.\"192\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 91.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 91. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 136.\n\n143.\n\nAdditionally, OIEG rejects the Applicant\u2019s argument that \"the dates of the closure and signature [of the Award] were manipulated and distorted to preclude the exercise of [a] fundamental right of the Republic.\"193 In this regard, OIEG contends that:\n\nIn addition to being serious and lamentable, this accusation by the Applicant is completely devoid of factual support or merit. The Applicant has not offered even the semblance of evidence that there was manipulation, alteration or distortion of the dates of the signing of the Award, much less with the malicious intent of depriving the Applicant of its rights under the Convention.194\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 126.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 127. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 128, 129.\n\n\u2022 The Applicant has also failed to prove that Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged loss of impartiality or independence at the end of the proceeding could have had a material effect on the Award\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nOIEG argues that there are a number of facts that show that any loss of impartiality or independence by Mr. Mourre resulting from his conversations with a member of Dechert could not have had a material effect on the Award.195\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 113.\n\n145.\n\nFirst, OIEG points out that (i) Mr. Mourre expressly confirmed that his conversations with Dechert were conducted shortly before he made his March 4, 2015 declaration;196 (ii) by that date all three members of the Tribunal had signed the Award, in fact, Mr. Mourre had signed it almost two weeks before; and (iii) six days later, on March 10, 2015, the Award was dispatched to the Parties.197 According to OIEG, \"[t]hese facts, by themselves, militate strongly in favour of a conclusion that the Award had been finalised by the time Arbitrator Mourre reached any consultancy agreement with Dechert.\"198\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 114.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 114.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 114. In this regard, OIEG also states that \"[a]rbitrators and experienced counsel know that, in practice, substantive deliberations and finalisation of an award take place well before it is issued to the parties and often even before the proceedings are declared closed.\" Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 124.\n\n146.\n\nOIEG rejects the Applicant\u2019s counter-argument that the conflict of interest began earlier, when Mr. Mourre began his negotiations with Dechert.199 OIEG explains that, as confirmed by *EDF* v. *Argentina,* the burden of proving that the conversations with Dechert could have had a material impact on the Award lies on the Applicant.200 OIEG contends that if, as the Applicant has expressly recognized, \"it is impossible to determine whether the deliberations of the Tribunal were ongoing at the time the conversations took place, then, by definition the Applicant has failed to show that those conversations could have had a material effect on the Award.\"201 OIEG notes that, in any event, the Secretary of the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties on December 8, 2014 stating that at that time the Tribunal was reviewing \"a complete draft of the Award,\"202 which again would be a strong suggestion that Mr. Mourre\u2019s conversations with Dechert took place after deliberations had finished.203\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 117, 118.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 119.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 119.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 120, citing the Communication from the Secretary of the Underlying Arbitration to the Parties, December 8, 2014 (Exhibit OI-70).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 121.\n\n147.\n\nSecond, OIEG argues that, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s arguments, the fact that the Award was unanimous \"firmly indicates that Arbitrator Mourre\u2019s alleged loss of impartiality or independence could not have had a material effect on the Award.\"204\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 122. *See* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 160.\n\n148.\n\nThird, OIEG contends that the fact that \"at any relevant time, Arbitrator Mourre did not have any knowledge of the details of the cases in which Dechert is (or was) involved (or of any other circumstance that could generate a conflict of interest) constitutes yet another factor that strongly indicates that his [relationship with Dechert] could not have had a material effect on the Award.\"205 OIEG relies on *Vivendi v. Argentina II,* where the committee decided not to annul the award, among other reasons, because Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler maintained that she had found out about the connection between UBS (the bank for which she was appointed to the board of directors, and which held shares of one of the claimants) and the claimants only after the issuance of the award.206\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 123.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 123.\n\n***d. The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAs set forth above in Section III.B(1)c, the Committee disagrees with the Applicant\u2019s position that in the circumstances of the present case the only available remedy was the annulment of the Award. Instead, in the Committee\u2019s view, and as argued by OIEG,207 in the case of discovery of relevant new facts after the Tribunal has already closed the proceedings under Arbitration Rule 38(1) but before the issuance of the Award, the Applicant could have requested that the Tribunal reopen the proceedings under Arbitration Rule 38(2).208 If the Tribunal had already issued the Award, the Applicant could have requested the revision of the Award under Article 51.209 It appears based on the chronology that both avenues were available to the Applicant.210\n\n*See supra* Sections III.B(1)b(i) and III.B(2)c(i).\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 38(2) provides: \"Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\"\n\nICSID Convention Article 51 provides in pertinent part as follows: \"(1) Either party may request revision of the award [...] on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.\" Under Article 51(2), the applicant must pursue revision within 90 days after the discovery of such new fact, but in any event within three years from the date of the Award. *See also* *Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 281 (OILA-89); *History,* p. 872.\n\n*See supra* Section III.B(2)a.\n\n150.\n\nAs regards Mr. Mourre\u2019s March 4, 2015 conununication in *Favianca,* the Applicant could have requested the Tribunal prior to the issuance of its Award on March 10, 2015 to reopen the proceeding under Arbitration Rule 38(2) to entertain Mr. Mourre\u2019s disqualification in view of concerns expressed by the Applicant in its letter to the *Favianca* tribunal dated March 9, 2015.211\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 114.\n\n151.\n\nAlternatively, the Applicant could have requested a revision of the Award on the basis of either (i) Mr. Mourre\u2019s communication of March 11, 2015 in *Favianca* as regards his \"undisclosed prior negotiations\" with Dechert which, according to the Applicant, \"embody the elements that show Mr. Mourre\u2019s loss of impartiality\"212 or (ii) Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation in *Favianca* and *Longreef* on March 16 and March 18, 2015 respectively, both of which represent the \"discovery\" of the \"fact\" of Mr. Mourre\u2019s purported lack of independence and impartiality.213 Since both events post-date the issuance of the Award in the Underlying Arbitration, the condition under Article 51 for requesting revision would have been met.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 57.\n\nThe condition for the application of Article 51 is the \"discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award.\" *See supra* footnote 209.\n\n152.\n\nIf the Applicant had raised the issue in the Underlying Arbitration under one of these other mechanisms, Mr. Mourre would have been requested to give his explanations in the context of the *OIEG* Arbitration which, under the scenario that in fact unfolded, were not provided. Such explanations likely would have been different than those he provided in *Favianca* in view of the timeline of that case, as compared to the *OEIG* Arbitration, and the timing of his never-consummated agreement with Dechert.214 The advantage of either a reopening or revision would have been to allow the possibility for the members of the original tribunal to consider the Applicant\u2019s request.215 Such an outcome would have been consistent with the letter and the spirit of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, as set forth and interpreted herein by the Committee.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 139 (as pointed out by OIEG, Mr. Mourre\u2019s professional relationship with Dechert was to start from May 2015, at which point the *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* case would still be active, while the Underlying Arbitration would have concluded); *supra* \u00b6 142 (as argued by OIEG, Mr. Mourre\u2019s relationship with Dechert \"would have overlapped in time with the proceedings in *Favianca and OldV v. Venezuela* and in *Longreef v. Venezuela,* it could not have overlapped with the *OIEG* Arbitration\").\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 45,46.\n\n153.\n\nFor these reasons and those detailed above in Section III.B(1)c, this Committee has found that the Applicant\u2019s charge of Mr. Mourre\u2019s lack of impartiality is inadmissible as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a). Indeed, this Committee has concluded that the ICSID Convention provides other mechanisms for a party to seek redress in circumstances like those present in the Underlying Arbitration.\n\n154.\n\nEven if it were otherwise, the Committee has concluded in Section III.D(2)c below (addressing the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d)) that the Applicant has failed to make a factual showing of a lack of impartiality. Further, even if the Applicant had established Mr. Mourre\u2019s partiality or appearance thereof, the Applicant has failed to establish, especially given the timeline of the allegations, that the alleged partiality had, or even could have had, an impact on the outcome of the unanimous Award. Rather, as elaborated in Section III.D(2)c below, the evidence strongly supports a conclusion that the Tribunal had already prepared \"a complete draft of the Award\"216 even prior to *the start of any* negotiations between Mr. Mourre and Dechert. Not only does the alleged relationship fail to satisfy the disqualification standard, but also there has been no showing that the impugned relationship overlapped in time with the Tribunal\u2019s substantive deliberations.\n\n*See* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 120, citing the Communication from the Secretary of the Underlying Arbitration to the Parties, December 8, 2014 (Exhibit OI-70).\n\n155.\n\nIn this regard, as noted above, both Parties have invoked and addressed at length the decision of the committee in *EDF v. Argentina.217* As also noted above, contrary to this Committee\u2019s finding, the *EDF* committee held that a lack of the qualities \"required under Article 14(1) [...] is [] a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(a).\"218 However, the *EDF* committee also concluded that:\n\nin a case in which an application for annulment is made on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to doubt the independence or impartiality of one of the arbitrators and no proposal for disqualification had been made before the proceedings were declared closed, the role of an *ad hoc* committee is to decide the following questions :-\n\n(a) was the right to raise this matter waived because the party concerned had not raised it sufficiently promptly ?\n\n(b) if not, has the party seeking annulment established facts the existence of which would cause a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts, to consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality ? and\n\n(c) if so, could the lack of impartiality or independence on the part of that arbitrator - assuming for this purpose that the doubts were well-founded - have had a material effect on the award ?219\n\n*See, e.g.,* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43, 76; Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 37-44; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 53 and footnote 157.\n\n*EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6 127 (VLA-03).\n\n*Id*,\u00b6 136 (VLA-03).\n\n156.\n\nThe Applicant has failed to establish either prong (b) or (c), as detailed below in Section III.D(2)c. Thus, applying even this test, this Committee\u2019s decision to reject the application for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) would remain undisturbed.\n\n**C. The Tribunal Has Manifestly Exceeded Its Powers**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn advancing its view that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, the Applicant argues that the Committee should adopt the two-step approach of the most recent and representative annulment decisions, first \"determining whether there was an excess of powers and, if so, whether that excess was manifest.\"220 The Applicant acknowledges that \"[i]t is a dual requirement.\"221\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 70, citing *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 (S\u00f6derlund, Edward, Jacovides), Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Application for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010 *(\"Sempra v. Argentina\"),* \u00b6 212 (VLA-11); *Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/7 (S\u00f6derlund, Bernardini, Silva Romero), Decision on Annulment, December 10, 2010, \u00b6 257 (VLA-12).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 69, citing *CDC* v. *Seychelles,* \u00b6 39 (VLA-10).\n\n158.\n\nAs for the ways in which a tribunal may exceed its powers, the Applicant contends that the excess may arise when a tribunal: (i) inappropriately exercises jurisdiction (or fails to exercise jurisdiction); or (ii) fails to apply the proper law.222\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 72. According to the Applicant, this position has been adopted by several committees, including, for example, in *Pey Casado* v. *Chile* and *Impregilo v. Argentina. See* *Pey Casado v. Chile,* \u00b6 66 (VLA-16); *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17 (Oreamuno, Cheng, Zuleta), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, January 24, 2014 (\"*Impregilo v. Argentina\"),* \u00b6 125 (VLA-17).\n\n159.\n\nWith regard to (i) the \"jurisdictional\" excess of powers, the Applicant points out that multiple annulment committees have explained that awards can be annulled if tribunals (a) assume powers to which they are not entitled; or (b) do not use the powers that have been vested upon the tribunal by the parties.223\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 73,74. The Applicant relies on the annulment decisions in *Occidental v. Ecuador* and *Tza Yap Shum v. Peru,* among others. *See* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 (Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, Feliciano, Oreamuno), Decision on Annulment of the Award, November 2, 2015 (\"*Occidental* v. *Ecuador\"),* \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51 (VLA-18); *Mr. Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6 (Hascher, Hob\u00e9r, McRae), Decision on Annulment, February 12, 2015, \u00b6 76 (VLA-19).\n\n160.\n\nFurthermore, the Applicant argues that in *MHS v. Malaysia224* the \"committee noted that the analysis to be made by it with a view to determining whether there was actually a manifest excess of powers in asserting jurisdiction over a given issue must consist in a *de novo* review.\"225\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn, Bhd v. Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10 (Schwebel, Shahabuddeen, Tomka), Decision on the Application for Annulment, April 16, 2009, \u00b6 74 (VLA-20).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 75.\n\n161.\n\nRegarding item (ii) above,226 the Applicant explains that a \"substantive\" excess of powers happens when a tribunal \"fail[s] to apply the proper law, since it would also be disregarding the powers granted to it by the parties.\"227\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 158.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 77, 78, citing *Soufraki* v. *UAE,* \u00b6 45 (VLA-02); *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 (Guillaume, Crawford, Elaraby), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 25, 2007 *(\"CMS* v. *Argentina\"),* \u00b6 49 (VLA-24); *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 (Guillaume, Crawford, Noriega), Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007 *(\"MTD v. Chile\"),* \u00b6 47 (VLA-25).\n\n162.\n\nAs for the second requirement in the two-step approach, citing the annulment committees in *Sempra* v. *Argentina228* and *Soufraki v. UAE,229* the Applicant states that \"manifest\" means \"clear,\" \"plain,\" \"obvious\" or \"evident\" or easily understood or recognized by the mind.230\n\n*Sempra* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 211 (VLA-11).\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE,* \u00b6 39 (VLA-02).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80.\n\n163.\n\nHowever, the Applicant further argues that \"the need for such excess to be clear does not mean that the committee must not analyze the arguments raised by the parties.\"231 In this regard, the Applicant relies on the statement of the *Pey Casado* v. *Chile* committee that \"extensive argumentation and analysis do not exclude the possibility of concluding that there is a manifest excess of power, as long as it is sufficiently clear and serious.\"232 In similar words, the *Caratube v. Kazakhstan233* and *Occidental v. Ecuador234* committees also reiterated that the manifest requirement does not prevent that in some cases extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that such a manifest excess of power has in fact occurred.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 81.\n\n*Pey Casado v. Chile,* \u00b6 70 (VLA-16).\n\n*Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan,* \u00b6 84 (VLA-21).\n\n*Occidental* v. *Ecuador,* \u00b6\u00b6 57-59 (VLA-18).\n\n164.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicant cites Philippe Pinsolle,235 who explains that:\n\nManifest means obvious, but this adjective relates only to the excess of powers itself. Establishing the existence of an excess of powers, as distinct from assessing its degree, may not be obvious. If the word \"manifest\" relates to degree in which the tribunal exceeded its powers, it does not necessarily imply that the error (in our case, the excess of powers) must be detected easily.\n\nIn other words, \"manifest excess of powers\" is not synonymous with *\"prima facie* excess of powers\".\n\n*Prima facie* review would mean that the excess of powers should be apparent on the face of the award, thereby limiting considerably the extent of review. If the review was a *prima facie* test only, competent drafting of the award would in all likelihood render it immune from subsequent challenge. This cannot be so, especially when jurisdictional issues are concerned. This never was, in any event, the practice of *ad hoc* committees.236\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 71.\n\nPhilippe Pinsolle, \"Manifest Excess of Power and Jurisdictional Review of ICSID Awards,\" 2 Transnational Dispute Management, April 2005, p. 8 (VLA-14).\n\n165.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that the *EDF v. Argentina* committee confirmed that a tribunal\u2019s damages calculation may result in annulment if \"in assessing damages, [it] manifestly exceeds its power by failing to apply (as opposed to arguably misapplying) the applicable law.\"237\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 83, citing *EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6 368 (VLA-03).\n\n166.\n\nIn opposing OIEG\u2019s statement of the standard as biased and incorrect, the Applicant contends that OIEG \"confuses the difference between an annulment proceeding and an appeal with the lack of an effective annulment proceeding.\"238 As regards OIEG\u2019s invocation of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* to assert that \"the Committee cannot replace the tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction with its own decision,\"239 the Applicant responds that it \"does not and could not disregard the validity of [this] principle.\"240 However, this does not mean that the tribunal\u2019s decision on its own jurisdiction cannot be reviewed by an annulment committee.241\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 124.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 125.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 126.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 126.\n\n167.\n\nThe Applicant rejects OIEG\u2019s interpretation of the *MHS* v. *Malaysia* decision \"in support of its unduly restrictive version of the grounds for annulment for manifest excess of powers.\"242 In fact, according to the Applicant, the *MHS v. Malaysia* committee \"firmly rejects OIEG\u2019s biased and restrictive approach, as it does not limit its review to the application or nominal invocation of certain legal rules, but it also analyzes the manner in which these rules were applied, and it is pursuant to this substantial analysis that it makes its decision\" to annul the award on the grounds of manifest excess of powers.243\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 128.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 130. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 132. According to the Applicant, this was clearly explained also by the annulment committee in *Patrick Mitchell v. Congo,* \u00b6\u00b6 45-48 (VLA-51).\n\n168.\n\nFor the Applicant, in addressing whether the applicable law was indeed applied or whether it was invoked in a way that lacked a real normative effect, it is not necessary that the Committee replace the Tribunal\u2019s judgment.244 In fact, OIEG states that when a tribunal\u2019s decision on its jurisdiction is \"reasonable or tenable,\" a committee must not substitute the tribunal\u2019s decision with its own and, \"by saying this, OIEG recognizes that if the decision is unreasonable and untenable, a committee must replace such tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction with its own.\"245 According to the Applicant, \"[t]he only way to determine whether the decision was \u2018reasonable or tenable\u2019 is to assess its content in relation to the applicable legal rules, the positions of the parties and the evidence in the file.\"246\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 134.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 136.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 137.\n\n169.\n\nIn this regard, the Applicant also notes that the *Occidental v. Ecuador247* committee, while affirming the difference between annulment proceedings and appeals, nevertheless performed \"a detailed analysis of the content of the decision in view of the applicable laws and proven facts of the case, which led it to partially annul the award.\"248\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador,* \u00b6\u00b6 56, 262-266 (VLA-18).\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 140.\n\n***b. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment agrees with the Applicant that, to establish this ground for annulment, the Applicant must prove that (a) the Tribunal exceeded its powers and (b) the excess was manifest.249\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 165; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 132.\n\n171.\n\nWith regard to the ways in which a tribunal may exceed its powers, OIEG also agrees that this may be done in two ways: (a) by inappropriately exercising jurisdiction (or failing to exercise its jurisdiction), and/or (b) by failing to apply the proper law.250\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 166; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 132.\n\n172.\n\nHowever, OIEG disagrees with the Applicant\u2019s position as to the scope of review that a committee may undertake to determine whether a tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.251\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 132.\n\n173.\n\nAs for a jurisdictional excess of powers and the standard of review of a tribunal\u2019s decision on its competence, OIEG first recalls that Article 41 of the ICSID Convention embraces the general legal principle of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* and argues that a committee may only annul an award if the tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction is manifestly wrong or untenable.252\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 167, 168; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 137.\n\n174.\n\nIn this regard, OIEG cites the annulment decision in *Soufraki v. UAE,* according to which \"the requirement that an excess of power must be \u2018manifest\u2019 applies equally if the question is one of jurisdiction.\"253 OIEG notes that the explanation in *Soufraki v. UAE* has been confirmed and adopted by several other committees including *Azurix* v. *Argentina, Enron* v. *Argentina* and *Total v. Argentina.254*\n\n*Soufraki v.

Malaysia* on which it relies.255 OIEG further argues that committees \"consistently have refused to annul awards in which a tribunal\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction was sensible or defensible\"256 and quotes the decision in *Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* which observed:\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal and cannot therefore enter, within the bounds of its limited mission, into an analysis of the probative value of the evidence produced by the parties.... Indeed, this is why the Award can only be annulled for a ***manifest***  excess of powers. Such lack of jurisdiction should have been evident on the face of the award and should not require the Committee to reconsider the evidence put before the Tribunal.\n\n[...]\n\n[a]n *ad hoc* committee will not annul an award if the tribunal\u2019s approach is reasonable or tenable, even if the committee might have taken a different view on a debatable point of law.257\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 171. *See also* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 139,140.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 172.\n\n*Rumeli Telekom AS and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri AS v.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThere is no contention between the Parties regarding the fact that a manifest excess of powers may derive either from a jurisdictional or substantive source. Nor is there any disagreement regarding the fact that this ground calls for a two-step process, first determining whether there was an excess of powers and then whether it was manifest. This process has been adopted by several annulment committees including *Sempra v. Argentina, Fraport v. Philippines, Occidental* v. *Ecuador* and *Total* v. *Argentina.266* The Committee shares this view and will therefore apply it.\n\n*Sempra* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 212 (OILA-109); *Fraport v. Philippines,* \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40 (VLA-30); *Occidental v. Ecuador,* \u00b6 57 (VLA-18); *Total v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 171, 172 (OILA-74).\n\n181.\n\nThe Committee concurs with the Parties and confirms that a manifest excess of powers may arise as regards a jurisdictional determination, where a tribunal either fails to exercise jurisdiction when it should have or exercises jurisdiction when it should not have.\n\n182.\n\nIn determining whether a tribunal exceeded its powers in the jurisdictional sphere, two principles, which are deeply engrained in the Convention and have been confirmed in numerous proceedings, are paramount: (i) *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* and (ii) an annulment is not an appeal.\n\n183.\n\nAlthough the principle of *Kompetez-Kompetez* does not shield the Tribunal\u2019s decision on its own competence from scrutiny, the principle favors a presumption of deference to the Tribunal as regards its decision. Taken together with the fact that this process must not be treated as an appeal, it is clear that the Committee cannot conduct a *de novo* analysis of the reasoning underlying the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional decision. On the contrary, and in line with the ICSID Convention\u2019s use of the word \"manifest\" in setting forth this ground for annulment, it is only where the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional decision is untenable or unreasonable, that the Committee may annul the award, if it is to preserve the above-cited principles of the ICSID Convention.\n\n184.\n\nDespite their agreement that a manifest excess of power may be of a substantive nature, the Parties fail to agree on how a Tribunal might exceed its powers regarding the application of the law. Whereas the Applicant maintains that a committee should investigate the \"manner\" in which the proper law was applied and determine whether it was applied \"effectively,\"267 OIEG contends that \"it is well established\" that \"only the complete failure to identify and apply the correct body of law\" \"can constitute annullable error.\"268 Thus, OIEG urges this Committee to find that an error in the application of law, even if serious, is insufficient to give rise to annulment for manifest excess of powers.269\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 130, 131.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 176. *See also* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 146-149.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 152.\n\n185.\n\nConsistent with OIEG\u2019s position270 and that adopted by several other committees in cases such as *Enron* v. *Argentina, MTD v. Chile,* and *CMS* v. *Argentina,271* this Committee finds that an excess of powers of substantive nature may arise only from a complete failure to apply the correct body of law. As is clear from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention, the intention underlying this specific ground for annulment was to exclude the possibility of annulling an award based on an erroneous application of the law:\n\nChairman Broches confirmed during the meetings that failure to apply the proper law could amount to an excess of power if the parties had agreed on an applicable law. One proposal suggested adding the \"manifestly incorrect application of the law\" by the Tribunal as a ground of annulment, but it was defeated by a vote of 17 to 8.272\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 176.\n\n*Enron v. Argentina,* \u00b6 218 (OILA-88); *MTD* v. *Chile,* \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47 (VLA-25); *CMS* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 49 (OILA-126).\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 21 (OILA-117). *See also id.,* \u00b6 15.\n\n186.\n\nMoreover, if this Committee were to delve into how the Tribunal applied the law in the Underlying Arbitration and base its decision on that assessment, the Committee would improperly transform this procedure into one that is in the nature of an appeal. Instead, the Committee\u2019s role in evaluating an application for annulment for manifest excess of powers is limited, as follows:\n\nin determining whether a tribunal has committed a manifest excess of powers, an annulment committee is not empowered to verify whether a tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional analysis or a tribunal\u2019s application of the law was correct, but only whether it was tenable as a matter of law. Even if a committee might have a different view on a debatable issue, it is simply not within its powers to correct a tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts.273\n\n*See, e.g.,* *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23 (Hanotiau, Oyekunle, Sachs), Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016 *(\"TECO* v. *Guatemala\"),* \u00b6 78 (VLA-49).\n\n187.\n\nLastly, as previously suggested, this Committee believes \"manifest\" to mean \"obvious,\" \"evident,\" or \"plain,\" as the Parties\u2019 themselves appear to have agreed.274 This approach, by its nature, excludes the possibility of a \"manifest\" excess of powers which cannot be detected relatively easily. Therefore, for an excess of power to be considered manifest, while some degree of inquiry and analysis may be required, it must not require a deep and complex analysis to be perceived. On the contrary, the excess must be evident to the Committee without difficulty.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 182.\n\n(2) **Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n188.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by (i) asserting jurisdiction without deciding on Venezuela\u2019s objections and (ii) failing to apply the proper law in calculating the compensation.\n\n*(i) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction without deciding on Venezuela\u2019s objections*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction in three aspects.\n\n190.\n\nThe first aspect in which the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers refers to the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of Venezuela\u2019s objection based on the lack of investment. The Tribunal acknowledged that, according to the applicable law, the alleged investment must not only meet the characteristics specified in the BIT but also the objective concept of investment set forth in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which requires the identification of a contribution by the investor.275\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 151, 152.\n\n191.\n\nIn this regard, the Applicant explains that the Tribunal identified two contributions. The first was undistributed reserves, that is, OIEG\u2019s decision not to withdraw its share of the Companies\u2019 profits and instead keep that share as undistributed reserves. However, the Applicant argues that in the Award \"[t]here is no explanation as to how the creation of a reserve [...] may constitute a contribution to the Companies, [...] since the reserves are created from funds of those Companies and no transfer of funds from [OIEG] to the Companies [...] may be identified.\"276\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 87. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 153-158.\n\n192.\n\nFor the Applicant, \"the Tribunal\u2019s decision on this matter is not supported by any applicable rule or legal authority allowing us to claim that the lack of active cash contribution -at least at the beginning of the alleged investment, in the Tribunal\u2019s own terms- can be replaced with a potential - and passive - withdrawal of funds at a later time.\"277 On the contrary, \"compensating for the lack of real contributions using alleged contributions consisting in the lack of transfer of dividends would otherwise lead to the fact that merely nominal changes in equity securities could be sufficient to assume the status of protected international investor.\"278\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 166.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 166. The Applicant adds that \"[t]his is even worse when we realize that there is no evidence in the file -indeed, no evidence to which the Tribunal has referred in the Award- which allows us to contend that OIEG failed to transfer dividends as a means to reinvest in the economic flows of the Venezuelan companies.\" Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 167.\n\n193.\n\nThe Applicant notes that the Tribunal found that OIEG also contributed by managing the companies, indirectly, since 2002, and directly, since 2005.279 This contribution was made by participating and voting in shareholders\u2019 meetings, and appointing directors and managers of the Companies.280 However, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed \"to make any specific reference to the alleged appointments of directors and managers to which it refers or to how those appointments may have actually impacted on the performance of the companies.\"281\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 87.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 87.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 87. *See* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 160. In response to OIEG\u2019s argument that the Tribunal did in fact carefully consider the evidence on the record to conclude that OIEG had been managing the Companies, the Applicant contends that none of the paragraphs of the Award referred to by OIEG \"refer[s] to the management acts that the Tribunal should have established.\" Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 173.\n\n194.\n\nFor the Applicant, these defects \"manifestly\" arise from a reading of the Award282 and are key to the determination of the rights of the Parties to the Underlying Arbitration.283\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 162, 163.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 164.\n\n195.\n\nThe second aspect in which the Tribunal is alleged to have manifestly exceeded its jurisdiction refers to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that OIEG \"suffered losses in the Brazilian market without first addressing the objection put forward by the Republic.\"284 That objection was based on the fact that the alleged damages related to assets that do not belong to OIEG, since they were owned by another company of the Owens-Illinois group of companies (the **\"OI Group\")** that was not a party to the Underlying Arbitration.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 88, referring to \u00b6 259 of the Award.\n\n196.\n\nThe Applicant explains that the Tribunal stated that this objection could not be separated from the substance of the dispute and that the claim would be addressed once the existence of an expropriation is found and in the context of the determination of the compensation due. However, the Tribunal later failed to make any observation on the objection.285\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 90. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 176, 177.\n\n197.\n\nThe third and last aspect with respect to which the Applicant alleges a manifest excess of powers is related to the parallel proceeding in *Favianca v. Venezuela.* Given that the BIT at issue and the object of that proceeding and the Underlying Arbitration \"are exactly the same,\" Venezuela requested that the *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* proceeding be stayed.286 However, in the Award \"the Tribunal refused to come to a decision on the existence of this parallel proceeding and attempted instead to hold that the Republic did not make any claim in this regard.\"287 In this sense, the Tribunal failed to decide on the objection raised by Venezuela, \"which was clearly within its jurisdiction, which entails the serious risk that [Venezuela] be held liable twice for the same act.\"288\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 91.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 93\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 94. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 178. There, the Applicant adds that \"[t]he Tribunal, applying the law applicable to the dispute, should have suspended this proceeding when the parallel arbitration began, or it should have consolidated both proceedings in order to prevent the Republic from wasting time and money due to the duplication of claims for compensation attempted by OIEG. By not doing so, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\"\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law in calculating the compensation*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Applicant argues that, in calculating the damages, the Tribunal disregarded \"the basic principle establishing that the discount rate to be considered must reflect the time value of money.\"289 For the Applicant, the rate applied by the Tribunal results in a negative discount rate for the first four years and, as explained by the expert Daniel Flores, a negative discount rate \"runs afoul of the fundamental economic principle of the time value of money.\"290\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 95.\n\nFirst Econ One Report, \u00b6 13. For the Applicant, \"this total disregard for the most fundamental financial principles cannot be justified -as OIEG tries to do- by referring to an alleged concession made by the Republic\u2019s valuation expert during the proceeding.\" Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 181.\n\n199.\n\nIn addition, the Applicant states that, \"even though the Tribunal maintains that it is carrying out a valuation based on the \u2018market value\u2019, that is not the standard actually applied. Thus, the Tribunal failed to apply the standard suggested by it and exceeded its powers.\"291\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 100, referring to \u00b6 646 of the Award.\n\n200.\n\nFinally, in response to OIEG\u2019s attempt to attack the credibility of the expert Daniel Flores on the basis that he has been retained on various occasions as an expert by Venezuela, the Applicant reaffirms Mr. Flores\u2019 independence and points out that (i) Econ One bills the time spent by its staff in this and all other international arbitrations involving Venezuela and PDVSA according to pre-set hourly rates and, therefore, its compensation is not linked to the outcome of the proceedings; and (ii) matters involving Venezuela and PDVSA represent a very small fraction of Econ One\u2019s billings.292\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 185, citing Second Econ One Report, \u00b6 6.\n\n***b.

In paragraphs 196 to 206 of the Award, the Tribunal established the relevant \"proven facts\". In paragraphs 207 to 211, it correctly identified the \"applicable law\". In paragraphs 212 to 232, it methodically and logically analysed the \"the concept of investment\" and applied its findings on the law to the facts of the case.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Committee will address, under the ground set forth in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: (i) if the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction without deciding on certain of Venezuela\u2019s objections; and then, (ii) if the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law in calculating the compensation.\n\n*(i) The Applicant has failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nEven if this Committee were to find attractive the line of argument as regards whether the Tribunal did or did not address the jurisdictional objections posed by the Applicant in the Underlying Arbitration, a review of the Award in its relevant sections makes plain that no ground for annulment can be sustained on this basis, particularly in view of the fact that the Parties themselves concur that this Annulment is not an appeal.\n\n218.\n\nWith respect to the question of the existence of an investment under the BIT and ICSID Convention, Respondent on Annulment asserts that\n\nthere can be no doubt that the Tribunal \"correctly identified the applicable law, and strove to apply it to the facts that it established\". In paragraphs 196 to 206 of the Award, the Tribunal established the relevant \"proven facts\". In paragraphs 207 to 211, it correctly identified the \"applicable law\". In paragraphs 212 to 232, it methodically and logically analysed the \"the concept of investment\" and applied its findings on the law to the facts of the case.321\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 173 (internal references omitted). *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 163-172; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 186\n\n219.\n\nThe Committee agrees. It has undertaken an independent analysis of the above-referenced paragraphs of the Award, as well as, for example, paragraphs 245 and 246 identifying OIEG\u2019s specific contributions, and paragraphs 238 and 241 setting forth the rationale for the Tribunal\u2019s finding on OIEG\u2019s contributions. On this basis, the Committee cannot conclude other than that the Tribunal did, in fact, conduct a reasonable analysis as regards what constitutes an investment under both the BIT and ICSID Convention, regardless as to whether the Committee agrees, or not, with such analysis.\n\n220.\n\nFurther, this Committee subscribes to the position, as posited by the Respondent on Annulment citing several prior committee decisions,322 that neither disagreement with a tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence, nor a failure to specify the evidence on which a specific finding is based, constitutes a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 203 and footnote 298.\n\n221.\n\nIn regard to the allegation that the Tribunal found that OIEG suffered losses in the Brazilian market without first addressing the Republic\u2019s objection as regards such claims, this Committee considers that the Tribunal did address the Applicant\u2019s jurisdictional objection when it expressly rejected such objection in paragraph 268 of the Award. Further, the Tribunal decided, as summarized in paragraph 893 of the Award, that the effect of Venvidrio\u2019s exports was already included in the DCF model and that the Claimant had not been able to demonstrate the existence of any additional damage, adding even that the burden of proof was on OIEG, and consequently, the Tribunal rejected the corresponding claim.\n\n222.\n\nFinally, the Committee does not find convincing the argument that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to stay the proceedings, notwithstanding the \"parallel\" *Favianca v. Venezuela* proceeding, constituted a manifest excess of powers. As argued by the Respondent on Annulment, and as is evident from a reading of the pertinent sections of the Award, especially its Section V concerning jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal rejected the requested suspension, and the Applicant reserved all its rights with respect to the \"initiation of the parallel proceeding and its impact on the present dispute,\"323 after which the Applicant never again raised the *Favianca* v. *Venezuela* arbitration, neither as a basis on which to object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or for any other reason.324\n\nAward, \u00b6 175.\n\n*Id.*\n\n223.\n\nThese circumstances are set out and addressed in paragraph 175 of the Award, and there is no evidence in the file of the Underlying Arbitration that could lead this Committee to conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation and statement of the circumstances is not true to the facts.\n\n224.\n\nConsequently, for the above reasons, including in particular that this Committee does not serve as an appeal body that is authorized to consider the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, this Committee rejects the Applicant\u2019s above-reviewed arguments that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in asserting jurisdiction without deciding on certain of the Applicant\u2019s objections.\n\n*(ii) The Applicant has failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law in determining the amount of compensation*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nAs summarized above, the Applicant also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in calculating the damages, because the Tribunal disregarded basic or fundamental economic principles, especially those that reflect the economic principle of the time value of money. The Applicant adds that such principles were part of the applicable law, which the Tribunal ultimately did not apply.325\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 198.\n\n226.\n\nAdditionally, according to the Applicant, the Tribunal stated that it was carrying out its valuation based on market value, but ultimately that was not the standard that the Tribunal in fact applied.326\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 199.\n\n227.\n\nThis Committee finds no support for these allegations, even after having heard and considered the presentations of the experts during the Hearing on Annulment, including the Applicant\u2019s appointed expert, Mr. Flores, of Econ One.327\n\nThe Committee does not, however, accept the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s argument to deny any credence to Econ One\u2019s expert reports on the basis of an alleged \"dependency of both Dr. Flores and his firm [on] the Applicant.\" Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 245. *See also* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 228; Tr. Day 1, Cross Examination of Mr. Flores (Econ One) by Mr. Mandelli (Counsel for OIEG), pp. 228-247. Although the Committee had made clear in the pre-hearing exchanges that it did not deem the experts\u2019 oral testimony to be necessary (Letter from the ICSID Secretariat to the Parties of August 29, 2017), the Committee has heard the testimony that was tendered during the Hearing on Annulment on behalf of both Parties and carefully considered that testimony in rendering this Decision on Annulment.\n\n228.\n\nThe Committee, to the contrary, is of the view that the Tribunal undertook a thorough analysis of the economic principles invoked by the Parties during the original proceeding. The Committee has taken particular note of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s point that the Tribunal duly identified and applied the body of law, that is, the compensation standard in Article 6(c) of the BIT.328 Indeed, upon the Committee\u2019s independent analysis of the Award, it is evident that the Tribunal, for example (i) analyzed the compensation standard under Article 6(c) of the BIT;329 (ii) determined an appropriate methodology for calculating the market value of the expropriated companies, namely the DCF method;330 (iii) examined in detail and decided points of contention between the Parties\u2019 experts in the application of the methodology;331 (iv) examined the experts\u2019 models and calculated and applied an appropriate discount rate;332 and (v) confirmed its conclusions using alternative methodologies.333\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 210.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 647-652.\n\nAward, \u00b6 659; *see also generally id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 653-670.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 671-761.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 762-820.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 880, 881.\n\n229.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if, as the Applicant maintains, the Tribunal should have adopted the views advanced by Venezuela and its experts in the Underlying Arbitration as regards the application of certain economic principles (and the Committee expresses no position in this regard), it cannot be maintained that such an error would justify annulment of the Award. As the *TECO ad hoc* committee stated, \"an annulment committee is not empowered to verify whether [...] a tribunal\u2019s application of the law was correct, but only whether it was tenable as a matter of law. Even if a committee might have a different view on a debatable issue, it is simply not within its powers to correct a tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts.\"334\n\n*See, e.g.,* *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23 (Hanotiau, Oyekunle, Sachs), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, April 5, 2016 *(\u201fTECO v. Guatemala\"),* \u00b6 78 (VLA-49).\n\n230.\n\nThus, whether the Tribunal made a *correct* application of the relevant standard and methodology in calculating the damages in Section VII of the Award is a matter outside the scope of this Committee\u2019s mandate, as has been stated in the recitation of the standards applicable, in general, to an annulment proceeding, and in particular under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n231.\n\nAs addressed in paragraph 185 above, according to the 2016 ICSID Paper, the drafting history of the ICSID Convention confirms that a tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that an erroneous application of the law, even if it is serious, could not amount to an annullable error.335 As stated above and as has been expressly recognized by many other *ad hoc* committees, an incorrect tribunal decision is no basis for annulment.336\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 72-74 (OILA-117).\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 90 (OILA-117).\n\n232.\n\nNotably, in setting forth its own position on the nature and scope of an annulment, the Applicant accepted that the mechanism is not intended to address \"reasonable disagreements in terms of the interpretation of the facts and the law,\" but rather is intended to serve as a check against \"certain defects contained in the Award which are so serious that they fit the specific list included in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention as grounds for annulment.\"337 This Committee has carefully reviewed the Award, and heard arguments and expert oral testimony from both Parties during the Hearing on Annulment. Applying the standards of Article 52(1)(b) as reviewed above, this Committee cannot conclude that the Award has a serious defect in regard to the damages determination. Reaching the opposite conclusion, on the grounds called for by the Applicant, would constitute a denaturalization of the mechanism of annulment.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 16 (emphasis added).\n\n**D. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Applicant states that this ground for annulment is subject to a double requirement: (i) the departure must occur in relation to a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) that departure must be serious.338\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 143.\n\n234.\n\nWith regard to the notion of a \"fundamental rule of procedure,\" the Applicant explains that in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, \"Mr. Broches established a connection between the fundamental rule of procedure and the principles of natural justice.\"339 Additionally, the Applicant notes that in *Fraport* v. *Philippines340* the committee stated that the general principles of law are fundamental rules of procedure, and in *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt* the committee construed fundamental rules of procedure to mean the \"minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.\"341 Furthermore, the Applicant explains that the *Impregilo v. Argentina* committee summarized the views of prior committees and identified the following fundamental rules of procedure: \"the equal treatment of the parties, the right to be heard, an independent and impartial tribunal, the treatment of evidence and burden of proof, and deliberations among members of the Tribunal.\"342\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 144, citing *History,* Vol. II, pp. 271, 423, 480, 517 (VLA-47).\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

Egypt* and *Kilic* v. *Turkmenistan. See* 2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 101 (OILA-117); Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 147, 148, citing *Malicorp Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18 (Rigo Sureda, Alexandrov, Silva Romero), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2013 (\u201f *Malicorp* v. *Egypt\"),* \u00b6 37 (VLA-37); *Kilic Insaat Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi Ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi* v. *Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1 (Rigo Sureda, B\u00f6ckstiegel, Shin), Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015 *(\"Kilic v.

As explained by the *Kilic v. Turkmenistan* committee, it is sufficient for the departure to have a potential material effect on the award.344\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 149; *Kilic* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6 70 (VLA-38).\n\n237.\n\nRelying on the annulment decision in *Victor Pey Casado v.

The Committee accordingly considers that, in principle, an *ad hoc* committee can examine under Article 52(1)(d) [...] allegations that the lack of independence and impartiality of an arbitrator meant that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the arbitration as a whole.348\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 152; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 189-194.\n\n*EDF v.

Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nOIEG states that to annul an award under Article 52(1)(d), the Applicant must: (a) identify the applicable rule of procedure; (b) demonstrate that this rule is fundamental; (c) show that the Tribunal departed from the rule; and (d) prove that this departure was serious.349\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 254; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 236. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent on Annulment states that \"[a]s the Applicant rightly points out in its Memorial on Annulment, annulment under Article 52(1)(d) requires the Tribunal to depart from a rule of procedure, that this rule of procedure be fundamental and that the departure be serious.\" (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 256). With respect to the burden of proof, OIEG cites *El Paso* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 268 (OILA-116) (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 258) and refers to the Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 145, citing *Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* \u00b6\u00b6 56, 57 (VLA-29) (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 259).\n\n240.\n\nOIEG maintains that, as recognized by the Applicant, not all rules of procedure qualify as \"fundamental rules of procedure.\"350 Rather, they \"are those that set the minimal standards of procedure, are essential to a fair hearing and necessary to ensure the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.\"351 Further, relying on the 2016 ICSID Paper, OIEG asserts that the principle enshrined in Article 52(1)(d) \"excludes the Tribunal\u2019s failure to observe ordinary arbitration rules,\"352 no matter how serious.353\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 250; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 237.

Turkey,* \u00b6 78 (OILA-75).\n\n***c. The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nArticle 52(1)(d) contemplates the possibility of annulling the award based on the existence of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. This ground necessarily imposes on the Applicant two obligations, first, to identify the rule of procedure the Tribunal purportedly departed from, and second, to satisfy its burden of proof regarding three points: (i) the \"fundamental\" nature of said rule; (ii) the departure by the Tribunal from said rule; and lastly (iii) whether the departure was serious.\n\n246.\n\nThe drafting history of the ICSID Convention sheds light upon the \"fundamental\" nature of certain rules. According to the drafters, the phrase \"fundamental rules of procedure\" was a direct reference to certain principles, including those of natural justice, and necessarily excluding ordinary rules which are not concerned with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.374 As stated above, the burden of proof regarding the departure and its seriousness must be met by the Applicant.\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 99 (OILA-117).\n\n247.\n\nAs for the departure, the Committee considers that it requires a showing, based on specific factual circumstances, that such departure was so substantial that the tribunal effectively deprived the parties of the benefits or protection which the rule was intended to provide.375\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* \u00b6 5.05 (OILA-23); *CDC v. Seychelles,* \u00b6 49 (VLA-10); *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt,* \u00b6 58 (VLA-29); *Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 234 (OILA-89).\n\n248.\n\nFinally, as for the seriousness requirement set forth in Article 52(1)(d), this Committee is aware that some committees have previously adopted an approach under which the requirement is met upon a showing of a potential material effect on the award.376 Although not decisive in this case, this Committee takes note of the position of OIEG and the holdings of prior committees that \"seriousness\" should be interpreted as requiring a showing that the violation did in fact materially change the outcome of the award.377 Annulling an award based on a lesser showing would amount to excessive formalism, speculation and second-guessing of decisions taken in the original arbitration in a manner that is improper for an annulment proceeding, thus frustrating the purpose of the arbitration.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Kilic* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6 70 (VLA-38); *Pey Casado v. Chile,* \u00b6 80 (VLA-16); *Tulip Real Estate v. Turkey,* \u00b645 (OILA-75).\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 100 and footnote 191 (and the authorities cited therein) (OILA-117); *Malicorp* v. *Egypt,* \u00b6\u00b6 33-35 (VLA-37); *Alapli* v. *Turkey,* \u00b6 132 (VLA-27); *Continental Casualty* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 96 (OILA-115).\n\n249.\n\nTherefore, the Committee finds that in the circumstances of the instant case it does not suffice that the alleged departure could potentially have affected the Award; the departure must be shown effectively to have caused the Tribunal to reach a substantially different result from what it would have reached, if the relevant rule had been observed. Notably, however, as explained below in Section III.D(2)c, the Applicant has failed to meet its burden to make the necessary showing under either interpretation of the \"seriousness\" requirement.\n\n**(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Award should be annulled on the basis of Article 52(1)(d) in connection with two circumstances: (i) the allegedly partial and biased conduct of Mr. Mourre, including his failure to disclose his relationship with Dechert in a timely manner; and (ii) the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence in finding that there was an expropriation in violation of the Treaty.\n\n*(i) Mr. Mourre\u2019s conduct*\n--------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Applicant argues that a fundamental rule of procedure was seriously departed from as a result of both Mr. Mourre\u2019s lack of impartiality, and the fact that Venezuela was deprived of its right to be heard on the matter.378\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 205.\n\n252.\n\nFirst, as explained above, the Applicant maintains that Mr. Mourre\u2019s \"lack of impartiality is in itself, a paradigmatic case of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure,\" and an Award rendered with Mr. Mourre\u2019s participation \"must be annulled.\"379\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 197.\n\n253.\n\nThe Applicant objects to OIEG\u2019s argument that Venezuela has failed to explain how Mr. Mourre\u2019s lack of impartiality materially impacted the outcome of the Award. The Applicant contends that it is incorrect to impose this burden on Venezuela since \"neither the Republic nor OIEG can provide documentary evidence proving such aspects.\"380 Furthermore, OIEG errs in assuming that the lack of impartiality of Mr. Mourre occurred only when his negotiations with Dechert concluded \"shortly before\" the issuance of the Award,381 since, as noted above, the conflict was purportedly present \"during the ongoing full deliberation stage to issue the Award.\"382\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 208.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 209.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 210.\n\n254.\n\nSecond, the Applicant argues that Venezuela was deprived of its right of defence given that Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged conflict of interest became known on the same day when the arbitration proceeding was declared closed and hence, the \"Republic was not allowed to activate the mechanism set forth in Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and submit a proposal for disqualification.\"383\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 156. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 201-205.\n\n255.\n\nFor the Applicant, \"[t]his problem is even more serious\" when considering that Mr. Mourre\u2019s signature is dated February 20, 2015 and Mr. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s signature is dated February 26, 2015, that is, before the proceeding was declared closed.384 These circumstances are in conflict with Arbitration Rule 46, which requires arbitrators to sign the Award after the closure of the proceeding.385 The Applicant adds that those signature dates are inconsistent with the procedural history of the Award, which refers to later-in-time events,386 and concludes that:\n\nThis alteration to and distortion of the dates shows not only that the Republic was unable to challenge arbitrator Mourre due to the fact that the proceeding was closed and the Award was signed, but also that the dates of closure and signature were manipulated and distorted to preclude the exercise of the fundamental right of the Republic referred to above, which warrants the annulment of the Award.387\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 157.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 211-214.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 158.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 158. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 218-221.\n\n256.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitration Rule 46 is a fundamental rule of procedure since it is \"a special case of the general rule that provides that parties have the right to be heard.\"388 In this sense, the Applicant explains that \"[i]f the arbitrators could sign an award before the closure of the proceeding, the parties would have their right to petition the arbitral tribunal curtailed.\"389\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 215.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 216. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 223-227.\n\n*(ii) Evidence concerning expropriation*\n----------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it found that Venezuela had unlawfully expropriated OIEG\u2019s investment. This is so \"because the Tribunal did not specify the evidence on which it relied in finding that the failure to make the payment without delay, *i.e.,* in a timely fashion, is attributable to the Republic.\"390\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 161.\n\n258.\n\nThe Applicant states that the only evidence on which the Tribunal relies is a statement made by Venezuela\u2019s expert during the hearing, which the Tribunal distorted to mean that the Companies\u2019 failure to participate in the local expropriation proceedings would not delay the payment of compensation.391 The Tribunal improperly concluded, according to the Applicant, that Venezuela had failed to offer a plausible explanation to justify the delay in the payment of compensation, effectively reversing \"the burden of proof since it is [OIEG] that, in alleging the expropriation, must demonstrate that there was a delay in the payment of compensation and that such delay is attributable to the Republic.\"392\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 164, citing Award, \u00b6 424. The Applicant states that \"[i]ndeed, while the expert maintained that the failure by the expropriated party to participate in the proceeding would not stand in the way of such proceeding, the Tribunal transformed such statement into one allegedly holding, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that the failure to participate would not draw the proceeding out, since without such a distortion the Tribunal\u2019s statement would have no evidentiary basis. That assertion is not included in the statements made by expert Cabrera.\"\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 166. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 229, 230.\n\n***b. Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment contends that the Applicant has failed to show that any of the following constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: (i) Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged lack of impartiality or independence; (ii) Mr. Mourre\u2019s decision not to disclose his conversations with Dechert in the Underlying Arbitration; (iii) the timing of the signature of the Award by arbitrators Mourre and Orrego Vicu\u00f1a; and (iv) the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the evidence.\n\n*(i) Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged lack of impartiality or independence*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment refers to its position regarding the Applicant\u2019s arguments on Article 52(1)(a) and states that *\"[m]utatis mutandis,* the reasons provided in that section apply with equal force to the Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding 52(1)(d).\"393 OIEG recalls in that regard that the annulment mechanism is not the appropriate procedural avenue to challenge the impartiality or independence of an arbitrator394 and that the Applicant had avenues at its disposal to raise its concerns regarding Mr. Mourre that it chose not to use.395 On this basis alone, OIEG contends that the Committee should reject this ground for annulment.396\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 247.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 248, 249.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 253.\n\n261.\n\nOIEG further contends that the Applicant\u2019s arguments fail for two additional reasons.397 First, as previously set forth, \"the Applicant has manifestly failed to prove the existence of facts indicating that Arbitrator Mourre lacked impartiality or independence.\"398\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 253.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 254, citing Rejoinder on Annulment Section II.B.1.

First, the Applicant has failed to identify a fundamental rule of procedure from which the Tribunal allegedly departed, since previous \"committees have confirmed consistently that the tribunals are not required procedurally to specify or itemise the evidence on which their findings are based.\"412\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 275. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 294-296.\n\n269.\n\nSecond, the Applicant\u2019s argument also fails as a matter of fact since \"the Tribunal did analyse and specify the evidence on which it relied to find that the Applicant had failed to comply with its obligation to provide compensation to the Respondent on Annulment \u2018without undue delay.\u2019\"413\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 276, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 297-300.\n\n270.\n\nOIEG objects to the Applicant\u2019s argument that the Tribunal incorrectly interpreted the testimony given by the Applicant\u2019s legal expert in relation to the effects of the Companies\u2019 non-participation in the local expropriation proceeding. First, OIEG points out that this argument from the Applicant \"merely confirms that the real basis of its claim is that it disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the testimony of its legal expert,\" which can not constitute, by itself, a ground for annulment,414 as confirmed by several annulment committees and scholars.415 Second, OIEG also contends that the Applicant\u2019s argument is without merit as a matter of fact, since the Tribunal did not rely exclusively on the expert\u2019s testimony, but \"on a wealth of evidence and on thorough analysis.\"416\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 281-284; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 301.\n\nAmong others, the Respondent on Annulment cites The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, p. 993, \u00b6 330 (OILA-79); *TECO* v. *Guatemala,* \u00b6 349 (VLA-49); *Impregilo* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 160 (OILA-90); *Rumeli v.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) Purported conflict of Mr. Mourre*\n--------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nAt the outset, this Committee observes that whether or not an arbitrator\u2019s purported lack of impartiality or independence is reviewable under Article 52(1)(d) has been a matter of some debate among the Parties and in view of prior committee decisions. Thus for example, in *Vivendi II* and *EDF,* the committees accepted that such challenges could be heard under Article 52(1)(d) (in addition to Article 52(1)(a)), although, as noted above, neither committee annulled on that basis.417 By contrast, in *Azurix,* the committee rejected the admissibility of the challenge under Article 52(1)(d) for the same reasons set forth in its analysis under Article 52(1)(a).418\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 106, 107; *Vivendi* v. *Argentina II,* \u00b6\u00b6 201, 232 (VLA-01); *EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 120-127 (OILA-86).\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 104, 105; *Azurix v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 279-282, 293 (OILA-89).\n\n272.\n\nIn this case, it appears that the Applicant is making two main arguments with respect to arbitrator conflict under Article 52(1)(d): first, that - procedurally - Mr. Mourre\u2019s failure to timely disclose facts that could have led to his disqualification deprived the Applicant of its right to be heard by an impartial tribunal; and second - substantively - that Mr. Mourre actually lacked the requisite impartiality and independence, which also led to a deprivation of that right419 This Committee has already held *(see supra* Section III.B(1)c) that the second argument is inadmissible as a ground for annulment.420 Like the committee in *Azurix,* this Committee holds that this conclusion applies to both Articles 52(1)(a) and (d).421\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 251-256.\n\nOf course, corruption is a ground for annulment under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(c). However, corruption is not being alleged in this case. No annulment committee (as of May 2016) has issued a decision based on a charge of corruption. 2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 97 (OILA-117).\n\n*Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 293 (OILA-89).\n\n273.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s first argument appears to be strictly a matter of procedure and concerns Mr. Mourre\u2019s purported failure to timely disclose his relationship with Dechert (which relationship is said to have given rise to his lack of impartiality and independence). This Committee finds that objection to be admissible under Article 52(1)(d), which by its terms is designed to ensure the availability of procedural protections for the parties. However, for the reasons stated below, the Committee does not consider that the Applicant\u2019s claims regarding the timing and manner of such disclosure support a finding that a fundamental rule of procedure was breached in this case.\n\n274.\n\nMore specifically, in addition to lack of impartiality \"in itself,\"422 as set forth above the Applicant has alleged in connection with Mr. Mourre\u2019s purported conflict a serious departure from (i) the right to timely disclosures under Arbitration Rule 6(2)423 and (ii) the right to be heard, positing that Arbitration Rule 46 is a specific case of the latter right.424 The Applicant specifies that because there are \"overlaps\" in these alleged departures \"that makes it twice as serious.\"425\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 252, citing Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 197.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 198, 201-204.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 215.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 205.\n\n275.\n\nBefore addressing each of the Applicant\u2019s specific allegations in turn, and in particular because of the Applicant\u2019s asserted \"overlaps,\" the Committee first scrutinizes the Applicant\u2019s allegations of lack of impartiality, which are the focal point of and ultimately underpin each of the above-noted Applicant\u2019s arguments in support of annulment under Article 52(1)(d). Indeed, as the Applicant itself has acknowledged, it would make no sense to contend that the [T]ribunal has departed from a fundamental rule of procedure demonstrated by the lack of impartiality [...] if the [Applicant] did not claim and prove, at the same time, that said lack of impartiality occurred.426\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 196.\n\n276.\n\nAs a starting point in the chronology of relevant events, the Respondent on Annulment has argued, and the Applicant has not contested, that ICSID sent a letter to the Parties on December 8, 2014, stating that at that time the Tribunal was reviewing \"a complete draft of the Award.\"427 According to the facts of the case, including Mr. Mourre\u2019s declaration regarding the timing of the conclusion of his conversations with Dechert, this ICSID letter is a strong suggestion that Mr. Mourre\u2019s conversations with Dechert took place after deliberations had finished.428 Taken together with the final part of the procedural history contained in Section II of the Award, it is reasonable for this Committee to conclude that deliberations took place substantially, if not entirely, during the year of 2014, which according to the evidence before the Committee was before Mr. Mourre even began negotiations with Dechert.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 120, 121.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 114, 120,121.\n\n277.\n\nMoreover, as observed by OIEG,429 the fact that Mr. Mourre made his March 4, 2015 disclosure in the *Favianca* arbitration, as opposed to the Underlying Arbitration, is reasonable in light of the timing of the facts concerned. Namely, whereas Mr. Mourre\u2019s professional relationship with Dechert was to begin from May 2015, the Underlying Arbitration would have been already concluded (as opposed to the *Favianca* Arbitration, which would have been ongoing at that time).430 Indeed, as noted above, Mr. Mourre had already signed the Award on February 20, 2015.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 139; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 84.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 111-116, 139 and footnote 214.\n\n278.\n\nThe Committee recalls in this context the applicable holdings of the annulment decisions in *Vivendi II* and *EDF.* In *Vivendi II,* in rejecting the application for annulment, the committee found relevant the fact that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler was not aware of the potential for conflict resulting from her role on the board of directors of the bank concerned, at a time when such role could have affected tribunal deliberations. In *EDF,* the committee found that the \"drafting of the Award had been completed several weeks before\" the purported conflict arose, based in part on the Award\u2019s complexity and the fact that it was to be rendered in two languages.431\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina II,* \u00b6\u00b6 234, 235 (VLA-01); *EDF v. Argentina,* \u00b6 170 (OILA-86).\n\n279.\n\nSo too in this case, the Committee finds that, even if a conflict could have arisen due to Mr. Mourre\u2019s relationship with Dechert, that alleged conflict could not have affected the Award based on the timeline of the facts concerned, and on that basis the seriousness requirement of Article 52(1)(d) is not met. As previously set forth in Section III.B(2)d above, if the Applicant nevertheless had reason to be concerned about such a possible conflict - arising as it did at such a late stage of the proceedings - it could have pursued a reopening of the case or revision under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n280.\n\nIn any event, and for the same reasons as outlined above, the Committee finds that there is no showing on the record of any lack of independence or impartiality on the part of Mr. Mourre. The threshold commonly used to make such a determination is whether an independent third party could, based on the facts of the case, reasonably conclude that the arbitrator obviously was, or appeared to be, influenced by external forces. This standard has been used recently in the *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* case, which was cited by both the Applicant and OIEG.432\n\n*See supra* Sections III.B(1)a and III.B(1)b; *Blue Bank* v. *Venezuela,* \u00b6\u00b6 55-61 (VLA-05).\n\n281.\n\nBased on the facts of the case, Mr. Mourre did not have any occasion to influence his co-arbitrators during the deliberations leading to the decision since, at the relevant time, the evidence strongly suggests that he had not yet even initiated negotiations with Dechert, and therefore, could not have been influenced by that fact. Indeed, Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged conflict is to be excluded on the basis of the fact that when he informed the Parties in *Favianca* by letter of March 4, 2015 that \"[a]s from May 2015\" he would have a consultancy agreement with Dechert he had already signed the Award in the present case on February 20, 2015.433\n\nCommunication from Mr. Mourre to the parties in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela,* March 4, 2015 (Exhibit V-10); *see also* Email from the ICSID Secretariat to the parties in *Favianca v. Venezuela,* March 11, 2015 (Exhibit V-12) (stating in the context of the *Favianca* case that \"my professional relationship with this law firm - which will start on May 1rst - is not such as to generate any conflict\").\n\n282.\n\nFurthermore, even if Mr. Mourre hypothetically had already begun negotiations with Dechert during the Tribunal deliberations period, there has been no showing that his impartiality or independence would have been, or even appeared to have been, compromised, given the explanations that Mr. Mourre provided in the letters delivered in *Favianca v. Venezuela.* The Committee recalls that Mr. Mourre represented - in the *Favianca* arbitration - that the relationship with Dechert would not provide him with access to relevant information concerning cases involving Venezuela or related entities.434 This Committee has no reason to doubt the reliability of that statement, and the Applicant has raised none.435 Moreover, on the evidence, the reality is that the allegations of possible conflict are all the weaker in the present case, given that for all practical purposes deliberations appear to have been completed before the time of any negotiations with Dechert. In brief, the Applicant has made no showing of any \"dependency\" or \"reciprocal partisanship\"436 between Mr. Mourre and Dechert, which would have affected the Underlying Arbitration.\n\nCommunication from Mr. Mourre to the parties in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela,* March 4, 2015 (Exhibit V-10); Email from the ICSID Secretariat to the parties in *Favianca* v. *Venezuela,* March 11, 2015 (Exhibit V-12).\n\n*See Vivendi v. Argentina II,* \u00b6 237 (VLA-01) (stating that the committee had no sufficient reason to doubt the reliability of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler's statements).\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 90, citing *SGS* v. *Pakistan,* \u00b6 26 (OILA-104). The Committee\u2019s conclusion is also consistent with Prof. Schreuer\u2019s commentary, as presented by the Respondent on Annulment, and referenced in paragraph 90 above.\n\n283.\n\nIn view of the above review of the Applicant\u2019s allegations, the Committee addresses each of the Applicant\u2019s specific alleged rule violations in light of the applicable legal analytical framework. The Committee\u2019s recalls *(see* Section III.D(1)c above) that to succeed on annulment under Article 52(1)(d) the Applicant must satisfy its burden of proof regarding: (a) the \"fundamental\" nature of the rule; (b) the departure by the Tribunal from said rule; and lastly (c) whether the departure was serious.\n\n284.\n\nFirst, as the Committee made clear was the case in its analysis under Article 52(1)(a),437 as a factual matter the Applicant has failed to establish the partiality of Mr. Mourre or the appearance thereof, and even if the Applicant had done so, given the timeline of the allegations, there has been no showing that such alleged partiality even could have had an outcome-determinative effect on the Award. Thus, even assuming such a charge were deemed admissible under Article 52(1)(d), the Committee\u2019s ultimate decision rejecting the Application on this basis would remain undisturbed.\n\n*See supra* Section III.B(2)d.\n\n285.\n\nSecond, as for the right to timely disclosures under Arbitration Rule 6(2), the Applicant\u2019s arguments must be rejected for similar reasons. Notably, Arbitration Rule 6(2) requires disclosure of information that an arbitrator \"reasonably believes [...] would reasonably cause his or her reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a reasonable person.\"438 In view of the Committee\u2019s findings above, there was no obligation on the part of Mr. Mourre to disclose his relationship with Dechert in the Underlying Arbitration. While his disclosure may have been temporally relevant in *Favianca v. Venezuela,* the anticipated commencement date of the Dechert relationship was well after the anticipated issuance of the Award. Indeed, Mr. Mourre had signed the Award on February 20, 2015. Further, the evidence strongly suggests that the Tribunal had substantially completed its deliberations already in December 2014, even before any negotiations between Mr. Mourre and Dechert. Accordingly, the absence of a disclosure in the Underlying Arbitration does not constitute a departure from Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and others* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 (Nikken, Salacuse), Decision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, May 12, 2008, \u00b6 46 (OILA-142). *See also* *Alpha Projekt* v. *Ukraine,* \u00b6 66 (VLA-65).\n\n286.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of a disclosure did not result in a breach of the right to be heard. There is no right to be heard about facts that Mr. Mourre was not obligated to disclose. Further, upon learning of Mr. Mourre\u2019s relationship with Dechert through the disclosure in *Favianca,* the Applicant could have, notwithstanding the timing of the closing, pursued (i) reopening under Arbitration Rule 38(2) as a means of having its concerns heard in the Underlying Arbitration, or (ii) revision under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n287.\n\nAs a final point as regards Arbitration Rule 6(2), even assuming Mr. Mourre\u2019s decision not to disclose was a departure from that rule, the Committee finds that the Applicant has not established the requirement of seriousness in terms of Article 52(1)(d). The Applicant has not shown that the disclosure of the information would have (or even could have) resulted in a substantially different outcome in the Award. Among other reasons, the Committee\u2019s findings above make clear that such information would not have resulted in Mr. Mourre\u2019s removal from the Tribunal in the Underlying Arbitration, especially given that it was on a different temporal footing than, for example, *Favianca v. Venezuela.* Even if such a disclosure would have resulted in Mr. Mourre\u2019s disqualification, the December 8, 2014 ICSID letter reported that the Tribunal was reviewing \"a complete draft of the Award\"439 and thus the Underlying Arbitration was at a very late stage. While the Committee acknowledges that under Arbitration Rule 12 a newly-appointed committee member may require that the oral procedure be recommenced, even in such case it is unlikely that a reconstituted Tribunal, including Prof. Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto and Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a as members, would have reached a substantially different conclusion.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 120, citing the Communication from the Secretary of the *OIEG* Tribunal to the Parties, December 8, 2014 (Exhibit OI-70).\n\n288.\n\nThird, and finally, as for the Applicant\u2019s allegations of a right to be heard, this Committee has found immediately above that Mr. Mourre\u2019s decision not to disclose the Dechert relationship in the Underlying Arbitration did not deprive the Applicant of the general right to be heard.\n\n289.\n\nAs noted above, the Applicant also cites Arbitration Rule 46 as a specific case of the right to be heard.440 It provides,\n\nThe award (including any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed within 120 days after closure of the proceeding. The Tribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days if it would otherwise be unable to draw up the award.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 256,274, citing Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 215.\n\n290.\n\nBy way of background, this Committee observes that the proceedings in the Underlying Arbitration were in fact closed on the same date that the President of the Tribunal signed the Award (March 4, 2015), whereas both co-arbitrators signed the Award some days before the proceedings were closed.441\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 115. Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a signed the Award on February 26, 2015, and Mr. Mourre signed on February 20, 2015.\n\n291.\n\nBased on the Award\u2019s procedural history, it can be inferred that there were some administrative issues arising towards the end of the case.442 Once a new Secretary to the Tribunal was appointed, the proceedings were declared closed as the President was ready to sign the Award, which his co-arbitrators had already signed. Consequently, while there may have been an administrative imperfection on the part of the Tribunal in its approach to declaring the closure of the proceedings, the closing was necessary, even if it might have been done at an earlier stage.\n\nAward, \u00b6 77 (\"On 4 March 2015, the Parties were informed that Mr Gonzalo Flores would act as the Secretary of the Tribunal, replacing Ms Ann Catherine Kettlewell who was no longer with the ICSID Office of the Secretary, and the arbitration proceedings were declared closed in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\").\n\n292.\n\nMore importantly for present purposes, to the extent that the sequence of events can be said to have conflicted with Arbitration Rule 46, this Committee cannot conclude that that Rule (stating that the signature should take place after the closure) is \"fundamental\"443 or that any such departure was \"serious\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d).444\n\nThis Committee\u2019s conclusion finds support in the reasoning of prior committees *(see, e.g.,* *CDC v. Seychelles,* \u00b6 62, 65 and footnote 92 (VLA-10) and the leading commentary on the ICSID Rules, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, p. 844, \u00b6 13 (OILA-79).\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 246, 248 and footnote 377.\n\n293.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee finds that there was no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and that even if there had been such a departure, it could not have been so substantial as to deprive the Applicant of the protection which the rules in question were intended to provide.445 Nor has the Applicant established that such alleged violations had a material impact on the outcome of the Award.446\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* \u00b6 5.05 (OILA-23); *CDC* v. *Seychelles,* \u00b6 49 (VLA-10); *Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* \u00b6 58 (VLA-29); *Azurix* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 234 (OILA-89).\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 248, 249 and this Section (III.D(2)c).\n\n294.\n\nAccordingly, this Committee rejects the Applicant\u2019s request for annulment on the basis of its partiality-related arguments under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence concerning expropriation*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nFinally, in regard to Article 52(1)(d), the Applicant argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in finding that there was an expropriation in violation of the Treaty.\n\n296.\n\nThe Applicant rests this allegation principally on its view that the Tribunal did not specify the evidence on which it relied in finding that the failure to make payment without delay, *i.e.,* in a timely fashion, is attributable to the Republic. The Applicant adds that the only possible evidence on which the Tribunal relied was the statement made by Venezuela\u2019s expert during the hearing, which the Tribunal misinterpreted to mean that the Companies\u2019 failure to participate in the local expropriation proceedings would not delay the payment of compensation.447\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 257, 258.\n\n297.\n\nOIEG maintains that the Applicant\u2019s arguments are without merit as a matter of fact, because the Tribunal did not rely exclusively on the expert\u2019s testimony, but \"on a wealth of evidence and on thorough analysis.\"448\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 285-295.\n\n298.\n\nEven assuming that the Applicant\u2019s arguments in this regard were borne out by the record (a matter about which the Committee draws no conclusion one way or another), it is even more evident than in the case of the Applicant\u2019s other causes for annulment that these arguments invite this Committee to evaluate not only the Tribunal\u2019s criteria for assessing which evidence was pertinent or not, but also, and moreover, the interpretation of the evidence, and which facts have been proven or not.\n\n299.\n\nAs this Committee has already made clear above, entering into such an analysis is clearly outside the boundaries of an annulment proceeding. The ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules constrain this Committee from relying on any such disagreements with the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence as a valid cause for partial or total annulment of the Award. These circumstances alone are sufficient to reject the Applicant\u2019s position in this instance.\n\n300.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee dismisses this second line of argument in favor of annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**E. The Award Failed to State the Reasons on Which It Is Based**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe Applicant argues that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention cannot be interpreted separately from Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.449 When these two provisions are read in conjunction, it is clear that \"arbitral tribunals are under a fundamental obligation to provide a reasoned award\"450 and that the tribunal\u2019s failure to provide \"coherent and adequate reasoning\" renders the award of no effect.451\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 103.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 104; *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Eromu Kft v.

The Committee has inserted the words \"that\" and \"does not have an\" because there seems to be a mistake in the English translation of this sentence. The Spanish version reads: *\"La Rep\u00fablica no disputa que el Tribunal no tenga la obligaci\u00f3n bajo los Art\u00edculos 48(3) y 52(1)(e) de brindar una respuesta detallada a todos y cada uno de los argumentos de las partes.\"*\n\n303.\n\nThe Applicant points out that the ICSID Convention \"does not impose any condition upon the failure to state reasons which may give rise to a restrictive interpretation,\" since there is no requirement that the failure be \"manifest\" or \"serious.\"456 The Applicant posits that the only option available under the ICSID Convention in case of a failure to state reasons is the annulment of the award.457\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 108. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 238.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 109.\n\n304.\n\nWith regards to the impact that the failure to state reasons should have in order to render the award annullable, the Applicant contends that the criterion established by the committee in *TECO* v. *Guatemala* should be followed.458 According to such decision:\n\nThe Committee wishes to point out that it cannot determine whether the evidence that was ignored by the Tribunal would have had an impact on the Award or not. What can be ascertained at the annulment stage is that the Tribunal failed to observe evidence which at least had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome of the case.459\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 267.\n\n*TECO* v. *Guatemala,* \u00b6 135 (VLA-49).\n\n305.\n\nThe Applicant further notes that, since a total absence of reasons in a tribunal\u2019s decision is almost unconceivable, annulment committees \"have stated that the provision of *contradictory* reasons and/or *inadequate* or *insufficient* reasons equally amounts to \u2018failure to state reasons.\u2019\"460 Thus, as explained in the decision on annulment in *Iberdrola v. Guatemala,* \"there Eire three possible issues relating to the statement of reasons for the Award: (i) absence of reasons; (ii) insufficient reasons and (iii) contradictory reasons.\"461\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 112 (emphasis in original).

In this regard, the Applicant states that OIEG\u2019s argument that the requirement to state reasons sets \"a minimum standard\" is incorrect.

Guatemala,470* the Applicant further argues that \"the failure to state reasons may also arise where the tribunal ignores the evidence before it.\"471 According to the Applicant, in that case the committee gave high importance \"to the fact that the tribunal\u2019s reasoning with respect to damages was unclear and hard to follow [and that this] defect was not compensated for by the mere reference made to elements that were not actually considered at the time of adopting the decision.\"472\n\n*TECO v.

Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nFirst, OIEG asserts that, as pointed out by previous annulment committees, the scope of review under Article 52(1)(e) is very narrow and the threshold for annulment very high.474 For OIEG, the standard to be applied is whether the Tribunal has failed to satisfy the \"minimum requirement\" to state reasons sufficient \"to explain to the parties the motives that have induced the tribunal to adopt its decision.\"475 As long as \"an \u2018informed reader\u2019 would understand the reasons, discern no material contradiction in them, and the reasons are \u2018sufficiently clear and sufficiently displayed\u2019, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) must be refused.\"476 In other words, \"[f]or annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention to be justified: (a) the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and (b) that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\"477\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 318, 319.

In support, OIEG cites Christoph Schreuer, \"ICSID Annulment Revisited,\" in Legal Issues of Economic Integration 30(2) (Kluwer Law International, 2003), p. 113 (OILA-125). OIEG refers also to *MINE* v. *Guinea,* \u00b6 5.09 (OILA-23) (\"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\").\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 322.

Rather, tribunals are required to: (a) deal with each of the parties\u2019 heads of claim more broadly; and (b) decide questions raised by the parties that are determinative to resolve the dispute between them.\"480\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 326, 327.\n\n*Alapli v.

The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award may be annulled if it has \"failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\" ICSID *ad hoc* committees have considered that annulment under this ground requires a failure by the tribunal to comply with its duty of rendering an award that allows an informed reader to comprehend and follow its reasoning.487\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* \u00b6 5.09 (VLA-33).\n\n316.\n\nThe 2016 ICSID Paper, quoting decisions of other *ad hoc* committees, similarly confirms that \"the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.\"488 As this Committee has already expressed in Section III.A(3), addressing the \"Nature and Scope of the Annulment Mechanism,\" annulment under the ICSID Convention is not in any form an appeal of an award.\n\n2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 105 (OILA-117).\n\n317.\n\nThe Applicant agrees that this Committee should not review the adequacy of the merits of the reasons presented by the Tribunal in terms of factual or legal correctness.489 The Respondent on Annulment maintains the same principle, adding that, despite the Applicant\u2019s statements to the contrary, most of the Applicant\u2019s arguments are directed at showing the Tribunal\u2019s findings on the facts and the law are incorrect.490\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 308.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 297 and footnote 473.\n\n318.\n\nAs stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE v. Guinea,* \"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"491\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* \u00b6\u00b6 5.08, 5.09 (VLA-33).\n\n319.\n\nThis Committee considers relevant and appropriate that in analyzing if this ground on annulment has been established, or not, the Committee should generally seek to construe the language of the Award in a way that results in consistency, as opposed to finding its possible inner contradictions.492\n\n*TECO v. Guatemala,* \u00b6 102 (VLA-49); *CDC v. Seychelles,* \u00b6 81 (VLA-10).\n\n320.\n\nPrior annulment committees have recalled that the standard under Article 52(1)(e) is a minimum standard, which is intended to ensure that a reasonable reader may understand the award.493 Thus, this Committee concurs in the view that, as in the case of the other annulment grounds, the scope of review under Article 52(1)(e) is strict and the threshold for annulment is high.494\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* \u00b6\u00b6 75-83 (VLA-29).\n\n*Alapli v. Turkey,* \u00b6 202 (VLA-27); *Vivendi v. Argentina I,* \u00b6\u00b6 64, 65 (OILA-83).\n\n321.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e), therefore, does not allow a committee to evaluate or assess the correctness or adequacy of the reasoning in the award, even less, inquire into or raise questions regarding the quality of the reasons. Rather, as specified by the *ad hoc* committee in *Alapli,* \"the Applicant bears the burden of proving that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on a point which is essential to the outcome of the case was either unintelligible or contradictory or frivolous or absent.\"495\n\n*Alapli* v. *Turkey,* \u00b6 202 (VLA-27).\n\n**(2) Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Applicant\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Applicant states that the Tribunal failed to state reasons (i) in deciding that there was an expropriation in violation of the BIT and (ii) in calculating the amount of damages.\n\n*(i) The Tribunal failed to state reasons in deciding that there was an expropriation in violation of the BIT*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Applicant explains that the Tribunal concluded that Venezuela violated Article 6 of the BIT \"by purportedly failing to appropriately identify the property subject to expropriation,\" which led the Tribunal to conclude that Venezuela violated the due process of law.496 However, the Applicant notes that the property expropriated is identified in the Award itself, \"which confirms that such property was always identified and known to OIEG.\"497 On this basis, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal\u2019s Award includes a contradiction that is equivalent to a failure to state reasons.498\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 122.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 123.

In fact, the Award\u2019s \"sanity checks\" are contradicted by its own reasoning elsewhere in the Award. Had the \"sanity checks\" been properly performed, they would have shown that the Award\u2019s DCF valuation of the Companies was overstated.505\n\nFirst Econ One Report, \u00b6 29 (internal references omitted).\n\n328.\n\nIn this regard, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal\u2019s multiples calculation did not apply a country risk adjustment that it recognized was necessary in the DCF valuation.506 Similarly, with regard to the second \"sanity check\" (the Companies\u2019 share of the OI Group), the Applicant states that it is impossible to assign the Companies an intrinsic value as a percentage of the entire group without taking into account \"the \u2018risk premium\u2019 which weighs the circumstances to which each of the assets of this \u2018group as a whole\u2019 are exposed.\"507\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 137. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 294-296.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 139.\n\n329.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicant claims that the Tribunal contradicted itself in fixing the value of Bolivars in US dollars terms.508 As explained by expert Daniel Flores:\n\n[...] the Award found that OIEG was not entitled to unfettered access to the official exchange rate and therefore could not claim damages for not being able to exchange bolivars at that rate.\n\nHowever, the Award took a different position with respect to the U.S. dollar value of bolivar denominated \"excess cash balances\" that the Companies held on the valuation date. For those cash balances, [...] the Award assumed that OIEG would have been able to convert its excess cash from bolivars into U.S. dollars using the official exchange rate, which is inconsistent with the Award\u2019s earlier determination that OIEG was not entitled and had not been able to do so in the past. The Award did not state any reason for this inconsistent treatment of the value of bolivars.509\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 140. *See also* Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 290-293.\n\nFirst Econ One Report, \u00b6\u00b6 41,42 (internal references omitted).\n\n330.\n\nLastly, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons based on which it assigned a unified value to both Plants and then calculated the 72,983% equity interest, \"which led to an artificial increase in the value of the [C]ompanies.\"510 According to the Applicant, the Tribunal\u2019s \"mistake is glaring, since it is an undisputed fact that [OIEG] had different levels of participation in the [C]ompanies.

Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nContrary to the Applicant\u2019s arguments, the Respondent on Annulment contends that: (i) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Applicant\u2019s expropriation of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s investments was not carried out in accordance with due process, and (ii) the Tribunal\u2019s valuation of the expropriated investments are both based on sufficient, adequate and coherent reasons.\n\n*(i) The Tribunal\u2019s finding that the expropriation was not carried out in accordance with due process is based on adequate, sufficient and coherent reasons*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nContrary to the Applicant\u2019s arguments, OIEG claims that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion \"that the Expropriation Decree did not clearly identify the assets that were to be expropriated and the fact that, once the effects of the expropriation materialised fully, the Tribunal and some experts were able to assess the value of the assets that had been expropriated.\"512\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 327.\n\n333.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent on Annulment explains that the Tribunal found that, at the time the Expropriation Decree was issued, OIEG could not know precisely which assets would be expropriated513 and on this basis concluded that the expropriation was not carried out in accordance with the \"due process of law\" requirement in Article 6(a) of the BIT.514 However, by the time the Tribunal started its deliberations and issued its Award, \"the effects of the expropriation had materialized fully\" and OIEG \"knew which assets had been taken from it by the Applicant,\" and thus the Tribunal was able to determine the amount of compensation owed by that the Applicant.515\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 329, referring to \u00b6 400 of the Award.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 330, referring to \u00b6 403 of the Award.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 330. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 331-336.\n\n334.\n\nFurther, OIEG also objects to the Applicant\u2019s argument that there is a contradiction between: (a) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Applicant\u2019s failure to identify clearly the assets that would be expropriated constitutes a breach of the BIT\u2019s \"due process of law\" requirement; and (b) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Applicant had not violated due process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT.516 According to OIEG, this argument \"lacks any merit because it is based on a blatant misrepresentation of the Award.\"517\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 337.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 338.\n\n335.\n\nFirst, OIEG argues that the premise that the Tribunal found that the Applicant had not violated due process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT is false. Instead, \"[t]he Tribunal actually concluded that the Applicant violated due process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT in several ways.\"518 OIEG cites as examples paragraphs 560 and 557 of the Award.519\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 339.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 340.\n\n336.\n\nSecond, OIEG claims that \"the Tribunal never stated that a finding of [a] violation of due process in the context of the fair and equitable treatment standard requires that the injured party use avenues available to it to challenge the flaws of the relevant administrative acts.\"520\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 341. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 342-347.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s valuation of the expropriated investments is based on sufficient, adequate and coherent reasons*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nOIEG claims that the Applicant\u2019s argument that the Tribunal contradicted itself by not applying a country risk adjustment to its EBITDA multiples \"sanity check\" must fail. OIEG contends that \"[w]hen undertaking an EV/EBITDA multiples analysis, it is wrong to apply country risk because one of the steps of that analysis involves identifying comparable companies\" and therefore, as explained by the Second Navigant Report, \"[b]y definition, that step takes into account a level of country risk in which those comparable companies operate.\"521\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 358. OIEG cites the Second Navigant Report, \u00b6 79.\n\n338.\n\nOIEG further notes that, indeed, on the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal determined that two companies, Argentina-based Rigolleau and Brazil-based CIV, were truly comparable companies for the purposes of the sanity check and that the Applicant\u2019s own expert in the Underlying Arbitration accepted as much.522 Accordingly, for the Respondent on Annulment, \"the Tribunal\u2019s approach and its reasoning was consistent with economic principles and with the positions of both Parties and their experts in the *OIEG* Arbitration.\"523\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 359.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 360. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 361, 362.\n\n339.\n\nOIEG also objects to the Applicant\u2019s argument regarding the alleged contradiction concerning the conversion of the excess cash balance from Bolivars into US dollars and the Bolivar-denominated DCF valuation. In this regard, OIEG contends that the Tribunal did not find that access to the official exchange rate had not been available for OIEG or the Companies, but that the BIT did not guarantee such access. In fact, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s repatriation claim not because OIEG or the Companies were unable to access the official market, but because the Companies chose not to and opted instead for the \"parallel market.\"524\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 352.\n\n340.\n\nOn this basis, OIEG claims that the Tribunal did not contradict itself by finding that the official exchange rate was the appropriate rate to use to otherwise convert the value of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s investment into US dollars. \"To the contrary, as explained by Messrs Kaczmarek and Shopp in the First and Second Navigant Reports, \u2018the [Tribunal\u2019s] use of the official exchange rate aligns with fundamental economic principles\u2019 and \u2018is consistent with the practice of financial and economic experts.\u2019\"525\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 353.

Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 363.\n\n342.\n\nOIEG explains that the Tribunal \"valued the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s shareholding in both [Companies] on a combined basis\" and then allocated a portion of this combined value to the Respondent on Annulment in accordance with its equity interest.527 OIEG notes that this approach \"was necessary due to the consolidated nature of the [C]ompanies\u2019 financial result and their shared management\"528 which is confirmed by the fact that \"both Parties\u2019 experts valued the [C]ompanies as a combined entity throughout the [Underlying] Arbitration.\"529\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 372.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 373, citing First Navigant Report, \u00b6 77.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 373.\n\n***c. The Committee\u2019s Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nAs set forth above, the Applicant advances two main arguments or grounds in support of the alleged failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based (Article 52(1)(e)), as follows: (i) that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in deciding that there was an expropriation in violation of the BIT; and (ii) that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in calculating the quantum of the damages awarded.\n\n344.\n\nAt the outset, this Committee confirms as part of this final Section of its analysis that it holds the view that the Award, in general, is well motivated.530 Consequently, the Committee has strained to comprehend the position of the Applicant, particularly in view of the very basic point already stated throughout this Decision that annulment is an extraordinary recourse, and not a mechanism of appeal by virtue of which an *ad hoc* committee can revisit the correctness or incorrectness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for its Award.\n\nThis Committee has had no difficulty understanding the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the Award. The present case is by no measure comparable to the *TECO v. Guatemala* case, to which the Applicant refers *(see supra* \u00b6 309). There, the committee stated that \"the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the loss of value claim is not clear at all, such that the Committee, despite having had the benefit of the Parties\u2019 submissions and of the entire record before it, has struggled to understand the Tribunal\u2019s line of reasoning.\" *TECO* v. *Guatemala,* \u00b6 128 (VLA-49).\n\n345.\n\nAs for the finding of expropriation more specifically, the Award sets out detailed reasoning leading to its findings concerning compliance with each of the various requirements for a lawful expropriation under Article 6 of the BIT.531 After analyzing the applicable law and the facts, the Tribunal specifically concluded that the expropriation was carried out in the public interest and was not discriminatory, but also determined that there had been a lack of due process as well as an \"excessive and unjustified delay in the payment\" of compensation.532\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 321-426.\n\nAward, \u00b6 426. *See also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 385-403 (analyzing the due process requirement under BIT art. 6(a)); *id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 413-425 (analyzing the just compensation \"without undue delay\" requirement under BIT art. 6(c)).\n\n346.\n\nThis Committee considers, as the Respondent on Annulment maintains,533 that the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Applicant\u2019s expropriation of OIEG\u2019s investments was not carried out in accordance with due process was sufficiently reasoned, including the Tribunal\u2019s finding that a failure to identify clearly the expropriated assets affects due process. The Committee recalls that the due process requirement, which the Tribunal applied, is contained in the BIT\u2019s expropriation provision (Article 6(a)),534 and that it is for the Tribunal to interpret the BIT as part of its findings on the merits.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 327-330, \u00b6\u00b6 337-343.\n\nAward, \u00b6 385.\n\n347.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal adopted a clear three-step rationale (i) defining due process of law within the meaning of Article 6 of the BIT,535 (ii) explaining why the failure to identify clearly the expropriated property is incompatible with due process,536 and (iii) showing that the expropriation measure in dispute failed to comply with the due process requirement of Article 6(a) of the BIT.537\n\nAward, \u00b6 387. The Tribunal noted that Article 6(a) of the BIT \"does not refer specifically to the regulations of the expropriating State, but to due process in general, a generic concept which must be interpreted in accordance with the requirements of international Law [...].\" *Id.* The Tribunal went on to explain that due process \"is this minimum regulatory standard commonly accepted in all States under the rule of law which guarantees the subject that any decision affecting it will be adopted after having gone through a fair and equitable process.\" *Id.*\n\nAward, \u00b6 395. The Tribunal agreed with the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s view that \"an essential component of due process, required by international Law, is that the party whose property is expropriated must know, with certainty, which assets the State is forcibly acquiring.\" *Id.* The Tribunal then elaborated that \"if the expropriation order, which may have been issued *inaudita parte,* did not clearly and with certainty define which assets are to be expropriated, this would allow the Executive Branch to determine, at its discretion, what set of assets would be expropriated and this would undermine the investor\u2019s right to obtain an independent review of the decision.\" *Id.*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 396-402.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal reviewed the provisions of the Expropriation Decree so as to demonstrate that \"[t]he imprecise language of the Decree prevented the Claimant from knowing precisely which of its assets would be expropriated, and as such, violated its right to due process\";538 the Tribunal then showed how the \"uncertainty regarding exactly which property was being expropriated persisted throughout the expropriation process.\"539 In view of the \"significant weaknesses\"540 the Tribunal had identified, the Tribunal concluded that it was \"a proven fact that in the Expropriation Decree and the subsequent legal action, the Respondent failed to clearly identify the property subject to expropriation, the definition of which constitutes a basic guarantee of due process required by international Law.\"541 This in turn amounted to a violation of due process under Article 6(a) of the BIT.\n\nAward, \u00b6 400.\n\nAward, \u00b6401.\n\nAward, \u00b6 396.\n\nAward, \u00b6 403.\n\n349.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning does not contain references to cases or scholarly comments does not mean that that its reasoning is absent or contradictory. On the contrary, as shown above, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning can easily be followed from point A to point B, as required under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. That is not to say, of course, that this Committee agrees or not with the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning or that it considers such reasoning correct or incorrect. The Committee has been able to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusions, regardless of whether the Committee agrees or disagrees with those conclusions.\n\n350.\n\nIn addition, this Committee is persuaded by the point made by the Respondent on Annulment that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion \"that the Expropriation Decree did not clearly identify the assets that were to be expropriated and the fact that, once the effects of the expropriation had materialised fully, the Tribunal and some experts were able to assess the value of the assets that had been expropriated.\"542\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 327.\n\n351.\n\nSimilarly, the Committee cannot agree with the Applicant\u2019s contention that there is a contradiction amounting to a failure to state reasons based on the Tribunal\u2019s findings that (a) the Applicant violated the BIT\u2019s \"due process of law\" requirement upon failing to identify precisely the assets to be expropriated; and (b) the Applicant had not violated due process as part of the protection against unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT.\n\n352.\n\nThe Award is clear that, in fact, the Tribunal found that the Applicant had violated due process in breach of the BIT\u2019s fair and equitable treatment obligation.543 Indeed, in applying the fair and equitable treatment standard to the facts, the Tribunal began by recalling its conclusion of an unlawful expropriation due to the Applicant\u2019s failure to follow due process as well as \"an excessive and unjustified delay in payment of the due compensation.\"544 In such case, the Tribunal concluded, \"the Republic must have also breached the guarantee of FET.\"545\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 557, 560.\n\nAward, \u00b6 500.\n\nAward, \u00b6 501.\n\n353.\n\nAdditionally, even assuming that the Applicant could establish the asserted contradiction as regards the Tribunal\u2019s findings on due process, as noted the Tribunal also based its finding of unlawful expropriation on \"an excessive and unjustified delay\" in the payment of compensation. Thus, the Applicant has not sustained its burden of proving that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on \"a point which is essential to the outcome of the case\" was absent or contradictory.546 Accordingly, there is no annullable error for failure to state reasons as regards the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Applicant violated the due process requirement under Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n*Alapli* v. *Turkey,* \u00b6 202 (VLA-27).\n\n354.\n\nThe second asserted basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) (failure to state reasons) relates to the calculation of the amount of damages. The Applicant\u2019s principal argument is that there are serious contradictions in the Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n355.\n\nThe debate circles around various topics, including contentions that the Tribunal contradicted itself by (i) not applying a country risk adjustment to its EBITDA multiples \"sanity check\";547 (ii) determining that two companies were truly comparable for the purpose of the sanity check;548 and finally (iii) using the official exchange rate from Bolivars to US dollars to convert the excess cash balance and a Bolivar-denominated DCF valuation.549\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 327, 328, 337.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 327, 328, 338.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 329, 339.\n\n356.\n\nAs regards these and other similar arguments raised by the Applicant as a basis for this ground for annulment, and the counter arguments of the Respondent on Annulment, this Committee confirms what was stated at the outset, at paragraph 344 above: it finds that the Award is abundant in its reasoning as regards matters related to the calculation of damages and, as addressed above, the prior determination that there was an expropriation in violation of the BIT.\n\n357.\n\nSpecifically as regards the calculation of damages, the Tribunal\u2019s findings are set forth in detail, and accompanied by ample reasoning.550 The Applicant\u2019s principal contentions to the contrary are addressed in turn. The first and second contentions are considered together. Namely, the Applicant maintains that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in undertaking sanity checks by not applying a country risk adjustment to its EBITDA multiples analysis (after having done so in its DCF analysis), and by determining that two companies were comparable.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 647-881.\n\n358.\n\nThe Committee rejects these grounds. The expert evidence supports a view that because the EBITDA multiples analysis involves identifying comparable companies, \"[b]y definition, that step takes into account a level of country risk in which those comparable companies operate.\"551 Furthermore, in determining the appropriate comparable companies, the Tribunal methodically reviewed the positions of each Party\u2019s expert in the Underlying Arbitration.552 Indeed, the Award records a measure of agreement on the part of Venezuela\u2019s appointed expert with this aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s determination.553 In the circumstances, the Applicant has not sustained its burden to show the asserted contradiction.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 358. OIEG cites the Second Navigant Report, \u00b6 79.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 857-861.\n\nAward, \u00b6 860.\n\n359.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s third contention concerns the Bolivar-US dollar exchange rate used by the Tribunal in the conversion of (i) the excess cash balance and in (ii) a Bolivar-denominated DCF valuation. The Applicant complains that the Award assumes that the conversion could have been undertaken at the official (\"privileged\") exchange rate, whereas according to the Applicant the Tribunal found in a prior section of the Award that such rate was not available to OIEG.554 However, the Tribunal\u2019s prior finding, which pertains to OIEG\u2019s claim under the BIT transfers provision, was in fact that OIEG, \"had the option of resorting to the official market or the parallel market\" for currency conversion.555 \"By opting for the parallel market,\" the Tribunal explained, \"it is inappropriate for Claimant to complain\" about decisions to reject the transfer requests.556 Thus, the Tribunal rejected the transfers claim based on a finding that OIEG had opted to forego the official market, not that OIEG was not entitled to the official rate or had not been able to obtain that rate in the past. Again, the Applicant has not established the alleged contradiction.557\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 329.\n\nAward, \u00b6 632.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 633-635.\n\nFurthermore, this Committee has been presented with evidence that (i) the Tribunal\u2019s relying on the official exchange rate aligned with fundamental economic principles (Second Navigant Report, \u00b6 54) and (ii) both Parties\u2019 experts appear to have endorsed relying on the official exchange rate in the Underlying Arbitration. Second Navigant Report, \u00b6 55, citing First KPMG Report in the Underlying Arbitration, \u00b6 9 (NAV-A-3).\n\n360.\n\nFinally, the Committee briefly addresses the Applicant\u2019s further contention that \"the Tribunal failed to state the reasons based on which it assigned a unified value to both Plants and then calculated the 72,983% equity interest, which led to an artificial increase in the value of the [C]ompanies.\"558 The Committee notes that the Applicant has elected not to expand on this argument.559 Nor has it provided a response to the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s arguments on this point,560 neither in the Applicant\u2019s Reply on Annulment nor at the Hearing on Annulment. The Committee further notes the statement in the First Navigant Report that, in the Underlying Arbitration, \"[...] both Parties\u2019 experts only ever valued the companies as a combined entity.\"561 In the circumstances, the Committee finds no basis for annulling the Award on this ground.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 141. *See supra* \u00b6 330.\n\n*See* Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 141.\n\n*See* Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 363.\n\nFirst Navigant Report, \u00b6 77; Tr.

Costs**\n------------\n\n363.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, each Party presented its submissions on costs in accordance with Section 22.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 and the Committee\u2019s direction at the close of the Hearing on Annulment.564 Additionally, following a March 9, 2018 decision, as noted at paragraph 40 above, rejecting the Applicant\u2019s proposal to disqualify Dr. Castellanos and condemning the Applicant to bear all the associated costs,565 the Respondent on Annulment provided on March 29, 2018 its statement of costs incurred in relation to the Proposal for Disqualification, followed by the Applicant\u2019s observations. On September 7, 2018, further to the Committee\u2019s invitation, each Party submitted its statement of costs associated with the Second Stay Request.\n\nTr.

Turkmenistan* for the proposition that \u2018\"costs follow the event\u2019, unless a different approach is called for,\"572 and adds that the principle that costs must be charged to the losing party is \"strongly recognized.\"573\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14 (translation of the *ad hoc* Committee). *See generally* Applicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, Section I.B.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20 (translation of the *ad hoc* Committee).\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 20 (translation of the *ad hoc* Committee).\n\n368.\n\nThe Applicant further states that the representation has been managed with complete seriousness and - as the jurisprudence has signalled is important - professionalism,574 and with \"maximum efforts\" for achieving an abbreviated schedule and complying with the payment of advance costs.575 For these same reasons, the Applicant alternatively notes that, in the event that the Committee rejects the Application, the Applicant should not be sanctioned with the payment of costs.576\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 29, citing *Postov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and ISTROKAPITAL SE* v. *Hellenic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/8 (Kettani, Edward, Shin), Decision on Postov\u00e1 banka\u2019s Application for Partial Annulment of the Award, September 29, 2016, \u00b6 172 (OILA-146); *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20 (Von Wobeser, Cremades, Yusuf), Decision on Annulment, February 26, 2016, \u00b6 353 (OILA-84); *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 (Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, Feliciano, Oreamuno), Decision on Annulment of the Award, November 2, 2015, \u00b6 581 (VLA-18).\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 29 (translation of the *ad hoc* Committee).\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 30.\n\n369.\n\nAs for the quantum of its costs, the Applicant seeks reimbursement of its legal costs, including representation costs and the costs of the Applicant\u2019s expert (Mr. Flores), in the amount of **US$2,750,000,577** as well as an additional **US$60,000** for expenses, including those incurred in connection with the September 26-27, 2017 Hearing on Annulment,578 and **US$21,360** for costs arising out of the Applicant\u2019s Second Stay Request.579\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 32.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 33.\n\nLetter from the Applicant to ICSID, September 7, 2018.\n\n370.\n\nAs regards ICSID advance payments, in its December 11, 2017 Submission on Costs, the Applicant claimed to have made advance payments in the amount of US$600,000.580 However, as of that date, the Applicant in fact had made advance payments of **US$394,767.29,** not US$600,000.581 Additionally, the Applicant noted its payment of the **US$25,000** registration fee with its Application.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 31.\n\n*See* Letter from ICSID to the Parties, February 8,2018.\n\n371.\n\nIn its April 9, 2018 observations on the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s statement of costs in relation to the Proposal for Disqualification, the Applicant recorded that \"the Republic has no observations on the economic content of said declaration,\"582 but added,\n\nits absolute disagreement with the early condemnation of costs incurred by the arbitrators Bernardini and Pawlak, which contravenes sustained practice in the matter of challenge and [...] sets a dangerous precedent [...].583\n\nE-mail from the Applicant to ICSID, April 9,2018 at 4:30 PM.\n\n*Id.*\n\n**(2) Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Cost Submissions**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs of December 11, 2017 maintains that the Applicant should bear all costs of this proceeding and all of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s legal fees and expenses, together with interest.584\n\n*See* Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, December 11, 2017 (\"Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs\"), Section 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13,42(2)-(3).\n\n373.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment posits that there is a presumption that the applicant should bear all costs of the proceeding (i.e., ICSID and Committee costs), citing ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), and the annulment decision in *Azurix v. Argentina.585* The Respondent on Annulment contends, \"while an equal distribution of costs was common in early annulment decisions, recent jurisprudence supports OIEG\u2019s position.\"586\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 4 (internal references omitted).\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 8, citing 2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 65 (OILA-117).\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment adds that no special circumstances justify departing from this presumption in this case, and that an award of legal fees and expenses in its favor is necessary to make it whole, if the Application is unsuccessful.587 For support, the Respondent on Annulment cites the annulment decisions in *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan* and *Alapli v. Turkey,* in which the unsuccessful applicants were ordered to bear all costs of the proceeding and all of the responding parties\u2019 legal expenses.588\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10-13.\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9, citing *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6\u00b6 279, 281 (VLA-46); *Alapli v. Turkey,* \u00b6\u00b6 263, 264 (VLA-27).\n\n375.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment further argues that a costs award in its favor, including legal representation costs, is warranted because the Applicant\u2019s Application was \"manifestly meritless,\" citing the annulment decisions in *CDC* v. *Seychelles* and *AES v. Hungary.589* The Respondent on Annulment adds that the Applicant\u2019s litigation tactics improperly delayed the proceeding and increased costs.590\n\n*See generally* Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, Section III, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, 27 (internal references omitted).\n\n*See generally* Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, Section IV.\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment also refers to the Applicant\u2019s failures to comply in a timely manner with the advance payment requests of the Centre pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), which resulted in \"a close-to-six-month suspension of the proceeding\" and \"the consequent postponement of the hearing\" by nine months.591 The Respondent on Annulment adds that the Applicant\u2019s (i) repeated use of evidence not in the record (in breach of the Committee\u2019s procedural orders); (ii) insistence on oral expert testimony at the Hearing on Annulment (although deemed not necessary by the Committee); and (iii) unsuccessful request for a stay of enforcement of the Award, unnecessarily increased costs in this case.592\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33, citing *Repsol v.

Costs of Proceeding***\n----------------------------\n\n384.\n\nWith respect to the costs for the use of the Centre, and the fees and expenses of the Committee members, the Committee finds, consistent with the decisions of a majority of annulment committees in recent years, that an unsuccessful applicant should generally bear the full costs of the Centre and of the Committee members, unless special circumstances warrant otherwise.601 The Committee\u2019s finding is also informed by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), which provides that the applicant is \"solely responsible\" for paying the advances (without prejudice to the Committee\u2019s later discretion to reapportion those costs).602 Regulation 14(3)(e), together with the Applicant\u2019s delays in making advance payments603 and more generally the principle that costs follow the event (which the Applicant has endorsed),604 support the allocation of costs of the proceeding to the unsuccessful Applicant.\n\n*See, e.g.,* 2016 ICSID Paper, pp. 26-29, \u00b6 65 (OILA-117) (\"in recent years, a majority of Committees have decided that the Applicant should bear all or a majority of the Costs of Proceeding when the application for annulment was unsuccessful.\").\n\n*See, e.g.,* *AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6 181 (VLA-28); *Azurix v. Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6 372, 373 (OILA-89).\n\n*See* *Repsol v. Petroecuador,* \u00b6 88 (VLA-36).\n\n*See* Applicant\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 14,17,20.\n\n385.\n\nAccordingly, given that each of the Applicant\u2019s asserted grounds for annulment has failed, the Committee finds that the Applicant should bear the costs of the proceeding in full. No special circumstances exist in this case that justify a different result.605 As noted above, the Respondent on Annulment has paid the third and fourth advances on the Applicant\u2019s behalf in March and July of 2018, and therefore the Applicant must reimburse the Respondent on Annulment the expended portion of the advance payments (and interest thereon) made by the Respondent on Annulment, namely **US$381,862.05.606**\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Azurix v. Argentina,* \u00b6 378 (OILA-89); *Suez* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 434 (OILA-141).\n\n*See* Letter from ICSID to the Parties, February 8, 2018 (in Spanish), pp. 1, 2 (recording the Applicant\u2019s assurances of December 13, 2017 and of January 11, 2018 that payment was imminent, although it never was made); Letter from ICSID to the Parties, March 8, 2018; Letter from ICSID to the Parties, July 25, 2018. *See also* *Repsol v. Petroecuador,* \u00b6 88 (VLA-36) (ordering the unsuccessful applicant to reimburse the respondent on annulment for the costs of the Centre that it had incurred, including the fees and expenses of the committee members); *cf. Suez v. Argentina,* \u00b6 434 (OILA-141) (where the unsuccessful applicant had already paid all ICSID advances, \"no reimbursement order [was] required.\"). The interest earned on the advance payments made by the Respondent on Annulment amounts to US$ 1,892.05. A statement of account will be sent to the Parties separately.\n\n386.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding are summarized as follows:\n\nCommittee\u2019s fees and expenses\n\nDr. Alvaro Castellanos US$133,839.70\n\nProfessor Piero Bernardini US$239,296.30\n\nMr. David Pawlak US$ 189,162.24\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees US$148,000\n\nDirect expenses US$68,296.84\n\nTotal US$778,595.08\n\n387.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of advances made by the Applicant (US$394,767.29 and interest thereon), and the Respondent on Annulment (US$379,970 and interest thereon). As noted above, the expended portion of the advance payments (and interest thereon) made by the Respondent on Annulment amounts to **US$381,862.05.**\n\n***b. Legal representation fees and expenses***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nWith respect to the legal representation fees and expenses of the Parties, the Committee recalls its broad discretion to decide based on the circumstances of the case, which, as noted above, is a position advocated by the Applicant. The Committee also observes that other *ad hoc* committees have ordered the applicant to reimburse the successful respondent on annulment for all or a substantial portion of such fees and expenses.607\n\n*See generally* 2016 ICSID Paper, \u00b6 65, pp. 27-29 (OILA-117); *see also* *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6 281 (VLA-46) (awarding respondent on annulment all of its professional fees and expenses incurred); *Alapli* v. *Turkey,* \u00b6\u00b6 263, 264 (VLA-27) (same); *Repsol* v. *Petroecuador,* \u00b6 88 (VLA-36) (awarding respondent on annulment half of its professional fees and expenses incurred). *See also* *CEAC Holdings Limited v. Montenegro,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/08 (Greenwood, Kim, Oyekunle), Decision on Annulment, May 1, 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 144,155, 156.\n\n389.\n\nIn deciding on the proper apportionment of legal fees and expenses, the Committee has taken into account, first and foremost, that the Applicant has failed to sustain any of the alleged grounds for annulment.608 The Committee, like others before it, tends to agree that generally a party that has been compelled to defend a favorable award against a wholly unsuccessful Application should not suffer the further burden of having to pay for it.609\n\n*See* *AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6\u00b6 181, 182 (VLA-28) (observing that \"Hungary prevailed in totality\" in awarding legal expenses to Hungary); *Alapli* v. *Turkey,* \u00b6\u00b6 263, 264 (VLA-27) (observing that \"the Respondent [on Annulment] has prevailed in totality\" in awarding its legal expenses).\n\n*See* *AES v. Hungary,* \u00b6 181 (VLA-28); *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6 279 (VLA-46); *Alapli* v. *Turkey,* \u00b6 263 (VLA-27).\n\n390.\n\nIn addition, the Applicant has failed in these annulment proceedings to make the requested advance payments in a timely manner. The Applicant\u2019s delays resulted in numerous unnecessary communications and substantial disruption to the proceedings, including a nine-month postponement of the Hearing on Annulment, the date of which had been confirmed already in Procedural Order No. 1. As the Respondent on Annulment has observed, the *Repsol* committee, noting \"exceptional delay\" relating to advance payments, ordered that the applicant \"bear all the costs incurred by the Centre [...] [and] half of the professional fees and related expenses incurred by [the respondent on annulment].\"610\n\nRespondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 33, citing *Repsol* v. *Petroecuador,* \u00b6 88 (VLA-36).\n\n391.\n\nIn the overall circumstances, the Committee exercises its discretion as to the allocation of costs under ICSID Convention Article 61 (2) by deciding that the Applicant shall reimburse all of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the main proceeding.\n\n392.\n\nAs for the legal representation costs associated with the Proposal for Disqualification, it has been decided that those costs shall be borne by the Applicant. As noted, the Respondent on Annulment has claimed **US$206,524** in connection with the challenge to Dr. Castellanos. The Applicant was explicit that it had \"no observations on the economic content of\u2019 the claimed amount.611 While the costs claimed are high,612 the Applicant has not objected as to the amount, and it is understandable that the Respondent on Annulment would defend against the Applicant\u2019s Disqualification Proposal vigorously, especially given that it was presented at a late stage in the proceedings. In the circumstances, the Committee confirms the decision to award the Respondent on Annulment its legal fees associated with the Disqualification Proposal.\n\nE-mail from the Applicant to ICSID, April 9, 2018 at 4:30 PM.\n\nThe Committee observes that the amount claimed by the Respondent on Annulment is equivalent, for example, to approximately 550 hours of work at the rates afforded to ICSID tribunal and committee members. At even triple those rates, the amount claimed is equivalent to approximately 180 hours of work on opposing the challenge. This work necessarily had to have been undertaken during the period from the date of the Disqualification Proposal on December 13, 2017 to the final submission of the Applicant on January 26, 2018 relating to translation issues associated with the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n393.\n\nThe Committee recalls, as recited in paragraph 371 above, the Applicant\u2019s \"absolute disagreement\" with the decision of the Two Members, and the statement that such decision \"contravenes sustained practice in the matter of challenge and [...] sets a dangerous precedent.\"613 However, the Two Members\u2019 directive is consistent with prior cases,614 and with the principle of costs follow the event, both in the context of the ultimate disposition of a case,615 as well as in earlier phases thereof (such as at the time of the decision rejecting the challenge).616\n\nE-mail from the Applicant to ICSID, April 9, 2018 at 4:30 PM.\n\nICSID\u2019s table of cases involving disqualification decisions is available here: https://icsid.worldbank.org /en/Pages/Process/Decisions-on-Disqualification.aspx.\n\n*See, e.g., Koch Minerals S.\u00e1.r.l. and others v.

Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/23 (Lowe, Douglas), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Gary B. Bom, March 16, 2018, Sections G, H (inviting further cost submissions of parties, to inform the Tribunal\u2019s \"decision on costs arising specifically from this proposal\").\n\n394.\n\nThe Committee further recalls that the Applicant filed a Second Stay Request at a very late stage in this proceeding, which gave rise to additional costs **(US$21,360** for the Applicant and **US$34,426.02** for the Respondent on Annulment). As noted in the Committee\u2019s Decision on the Second Stay Request, not only did the Applicant fail in its bid to challenge the rationale of the Committee\u2019s First Stay Decision, but the available evidence confirmed this rationale.617 In addition, the Committee cannot help but note the incongruity of the Second Stay Request at such a late stage and in the circumstances of the Applicant\u2019s failure to make two of the requested advance payments. While, in light of the foregoing, these further costs could have been avoided, they do not appear to be excessive in view of the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Second Stay Request.\n\nFirst Stay Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 79, 80.\n\n395.\n\nMore generally as to the reasonableness of legal fees and expenses claimed by each Party, the Committee records that neither Party has provided any substantiation and only very limited specification of its legal representation costs and expenses, in accordance with the approach that the Parties effectively agreed upon, and the Committee accepted, at the close of the Hearing on Annulment. While the Committee considers that the costs claimed by both Parties are rather high for an annulment proceeding involving one two-day hearing, and that the better practice is at least some degree of substantiation and specification of legal fees and costs, both Parties have advocated for a costs-follow-the-event approach and neither Party has contested the quantum of the legal fees and expenses of the other Party. In fact, although not decisive as to reasonableness,618 the Parties respective claims for legal fees and expenses for the main proceeding are not vastly different (US$2,810,000.00619 for the Applicant and US$3,241,998.98620 for the Respondent on Annulment).\n\n*See* *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6 280 (VLA-46). *Cf.* *AES* v. *Hungary,* \u00b6 179 (VLA-28) (finding both parties\u2019 costs reasonable under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2), where applicant\u2019s costs totaled approximately two-thirds of respondent on annulment\u2019s costs).\n\nThis figure reflects the Applicant\u2019s claim for legal representation fees of US$2,750,000 (which includes expert fees), and US$60,000 in expenses.\n\nThis figure reflects the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s claim for legal representation fees of US$3,241,998.98 until December 11,2017 (which includes Navigant\u2019s expert fees and US$3,512.18 for expenses of OIEG\u2019s representatives). *See supra* \u00b6 378.\n\n396.\n\nUnder the circumstances, in the exercise of the Committee\u2019s discretion, it determines that it is appropriate to apportion all of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s legal fees and expenses, as set out in the table at paragraph 381 above, to the Applicant.\n\n***c. Interest***\n-----------------\n\n397.\n\nAs set forth above, this Committee retains broad discretion to fashion an appropriate cost award,621 and both Parties have called for an award of interest. As observed by the Respondent on Annulment, previous *ad hoc* committees have issued interest on costs awards against unsuccessful applicants.622 Consistent with the principle that costs generally follow the event, this Committee finds that an award of interest (at the rate provided in the Tribunal\u2019s Award) is appropriate in this case to promote the Applicant\u2019s timely compliance with this Decision.623\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 383. Pursuant to the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, this Committee has the same discretion in this regard as a tribunal. *See* ICSID Convention Article 52(4); ICSID Arbitration Rule 53.\n\n*See* Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 41, citing *Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan,* \u00b6282(3) (VLA-46) and *Antoine Abou Lahoud and others* v. *Democratic Republic of Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/4 (Kettani, Hob\u00e9r, Knieper), Annulment Decision, March 29, 2016 *(\"Lahoud v.

Grynberg and others v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6 (Rowley, Nottingham, Tercier), Award, December 10, 2010, Sections 8, 9 (awarding interest on \"legal and other costs\").\n\n*See* *Adem Dogan* v. *Turkmenistan,* \u00b6 282(3) (VLA-46) (ordering interest on cost award \"at the rate provided in [...] the Award\"); *Lahoud* v. *Congo,* \u00b6 243 (OILA-85) (awarding interest at the same rate as in underlying Award *(see* *Antoine Abou Lahoud and others v. Democratic Republic of Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/4 (Park, Hafez, Ngwe), Award, February 7, 2014, \u00b6 664(iv)). Pursuant to the Committee\u2019s discretion and the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s request, this interest shall also apply to the reimbursement of the portion of the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s advances on costs paid out to cover the costs of the proceedings. *See* Letter from Respondent on Annulment to ICSID, March 1, 2018, p. 2; Respondent on Annulment\u2019s Cost Submission, \u00b6 39; Letter from Respondent on Annulment to ICSID, July 16, 2018, p. 2.\n\n***d. Summary of Determinations***\n----------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Committee finds that the Applicant shall be responsible in full for the cost of proceeding in the amount of **US$778,595.08,** and thus must reimburse the Respondent on Annulment the third and fourth advances paid to cover the costs of the proceedings, including interest thereon, namely **US$381,862.05.** Additionally, the Applicant shall bear the Respondent on Annulment\u2019s legal representation costs and expenses in the amount of **US$3,482,949** (including US$3,241,998.98 for the main proceedings up until December 11, 2017, US$206,524 of such costs associated with the Disqualification Proposal, and the US$34,426.02 for costs arising out the Applicant\u2019s Second Stay Request). Interest shall apply to the total amount of the award of costs (US$381,862.05 plus US$3,482,949) as of the date of this Decision until paid at the rate provided in the Tribunal\u2019s Award *(i.e.,* calculated at a LIBOR interest rate for one-year deposits in US dollars, plus a margin of 4%, with annual compounding of accrued interest).\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n399.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously decides that:\n\n(1) the Application for Annulment of the Award dated March 10, 2015 is rejected in its entirety;\n\n(2) the Applicant shall be responsible to pay in full the costs of this proceeding, including the costs of legal representation, and interest thereon, as summarized in paragraph 398 above."}]}
