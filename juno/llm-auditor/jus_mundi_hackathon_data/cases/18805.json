INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute has been submitted to arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the State of Qatar on the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments (the \"**BIT**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nSigned at Doha on July 8, 1996.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane, a national of Algeria and France (the \"**Claimant**\"), and the Respondent is the State of Qatar (\"**Qatar**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n3.\n\nSubsequent to its constitution, the arbitral tribunal in this case (the \"**Tribunal**\") noted that the Parties disagreed on the issue of the arbitration rules applicable to the proceeding. The Claimant considers that the 2006 ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules**\") should apply to this case, while the Respondent considers that it should be instead the 2022 ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe present order sets out the Tribunal's analysis and decision on this issue.\n\n**II. THE RELEVANT PROCEDURAL STEPS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn September 14, 2022, the acting Secretary General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimants on August 22, 2022, as supplemented by information contained in a letter from the Claimant to ICSID dated September 9, 2022, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Centre notified the Parties of the registration. In the notice of registration, the Centre referred to the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of January 9, 2023, the Respondent indicated that it considered the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules to be applicable to this case, in lieu of the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent argued that this was because the Claimant consented to arbitration in his Request for Arbitration on August 22, 2022, and not when the Claimant filed a notice of dispute (in French a \"*Demande de R\u00e8glement Amiable*\") to Qatar on November 15, 2021 (the \"**Notice**\").\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of January 12, 2023, the Claimant indicated that the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules should apply to the dispute. The Claimant argued that pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT, the provision of a notice of dispute is a mandatory prerequisite to the submission of a dispute to arbitration. Therefore, the Claimant submitted that he \"expressly indicat[ed] in his Notice the prerequisite and claim[ed] the right, if no amicable agreement was reached within six months, to initiate proceedings.\" The Claimant therefore concluded that, as he had already indicated to ICSID in his correspondence prior to the registration of his Request for Arbitration, he gave his consent to ICSID Arbitration when he filed his Notice, on November 15, 2021.2\n\nLetter from the Claimant to the Centre, dated January 12, 2023. *See also* Letter from the Claimant to the Centre, dated September 9, 2022.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of January 12, 2023, the Centre took note of the Parties' respective submissions and indicated that the Centre had referred to the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules further to the registration of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration based on the information contained in the Claimant's Request for Arbitration, and in the Claimant's letter of September 9, 2022, supplementing his Request for Arbitration. The Centre also indicated it would continue referring to the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules for the purpose of constituting the Tribunal. The Centre reminded the Parties, however, that this reference to the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules for the purpose of constituting the Tribunal should be made without prejudice to the powers and functions of the Tribunal to decide on this issue in the event the Parties continued to disagree on the arbitration rules applicable to these proceedings following the constitution of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties did not comment on this letter of January 12, 2023 and made no further observations on the issue of the applicable rules.\n\n10.\n\nOn January 26, 2023, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention, and with Rule 6(1) of the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that Ms. Lucinda Low, appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, appointed by the Respondent, and Professor Andreas Bucher, appointed by the Claimant, had all accepted their appointments, and that the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that date. Dr. Jonathan Chevry, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of February 8, 2023, the Tribunal noted that it had reviewed the Respondent's letter of January 9, 2023, the Claimant's letter of January 12, 2023, and the ICSID letter of January 12, 2023, on the applicable arbitration rules to this proceeding, and indicated that it intended to rule on the matter before holding the first session. The Tribunal therefore invited the Parties to provide additional comments on the issue of the applicable rules.\n\n12.\n\nOn February 23, 2023, the Parties sent their additional comments on the issue of the applicable rules.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties' submissions on this issue and, having deliberated, sets forth below its analysis and decision.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. A****nalysis**\n-------------------\n\n14.\n\nArticle 44 of the ICSID Convention states in pertinent part as follows:\n\nAny arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section, and except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nInasmuch as the parties have not \"otherwise agree[d]\", this provision makes the date of the Parties' consent to arbitration the determinative factor with respect to the applicable rules.\n\n16.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that the Respondent has reserved its right to make jurisdictional objections, including on the entry into force of the BIT, the consent of the State in this case is not in dispute, at this stage, as it is reflected in the standing offer contained in the BIT under which the claim is brought. The issue is when the Claimant's acceptance of that offer, through its provision of consent to arbitration, took place.\n\n17.\n\nThe Parties agree that under either the 2006 or 2022 the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the date of such consent cannot be any later than the filing of the Request for Arbitration, but they also agree that a claimant's acceptance and consent can take place earlier.3 The Tribunal notes that this agreement is in accord with the view that other tribunals and authorities have taken in such matters.4\n\n*See* Claimant's Memorandum on Applicable Arbitration Rules, dated February 23, 2023, para. 5; Letter from the Respondent to ICSID, dated February 23, 2023, p. 2.\n\n*See, e.g*., amongst the cases cited by the Parties, *Abaclat and others (formerly Giovanna A. Beccara and others) v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 4, 2011, para. 446; *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award dated December 8, 2008, paras. 10-11.\n\n18.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, as to the factual question whether the notice of dispute that the BIT required be given, in this case, at least six months prior to the filing of the Request for Arbitration, contained such an acceptance and therefore can form the basis for consent. The Respondent submits that such an acceptance, being unusual, must be clearly manifested in the event it is deemed to have been made prior to the submission of the Request for Arbitration.5 The Claimant submits that the BIT's requirement for the submission of a notice of dispute effectively precludes its consent being given at the time of the submission of the Request for Arbitration.6\n\nLetter from the Respondent to ICSID, dated February 23, 2023,p. 4.\n\nClaimant's Memorandum on Applicable Arbitration Rules, dated February 23, 2023, para. 17.\n\n19.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, no special standard of proof should apply to the factual issue of whether and when consent has been given. The Claimant as the moving party on this issue bears the burden of proof of its position that its consent was reflected in the Notice and that the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules therefore apply.\n\n20.\n\nExamining the evidence of consent as reflected in the documents before it, the Tribunal has concluded that it does not sufficiently establish that the Claimant consented to arbitration in the Notice.\n\n21.\n\nAlthough the BIT requires the submission of a notice of dispute as a prerequisite to the commencement of arbitration, and establishes a six-month waiting period, the Tribunal understands that this notice is to put the host State on notice of potential claims and to provide an opportunity to have such claims resolved amicably, without arbitration. Indeed, Article 8(1) of the BIT specifies that :\n\n\"*tout diff\u00e9rend de nature juridique\u2026entre l'une des Parties contractantes et un investisseur de l'autre Partie contractante est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'amiable entre les deux Parties concern\u00e9es.*\"\n\n22.\n\nTo that end, the *Demande* section of the Claimant's Notice stated in paragraph 51 that:\n\n\"*En l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Benabderrahmane entend, par la pr\u00e9sente, engager avec l'\u00c9tat de Qatar, la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement amiable pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'Accord afin de solliciter la restitution de l'ensemble des biens confisques et, a default, le paiement par cet Etat de l'indemnit\u00e9*.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant goes on to reiterate his availability to meet the representatives of the Respondent to reach an amicable resolution of this matter.7\n\nNotice, dated November 15, 2021, para. 60.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant relies on paragraph 61, the final paragraph of the Notice, as the basis of his acceptance of the State's offer to arbitrate in the BIT and therefore his consent. Paragraph 61 states in full as follows:\n\n\"*Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de cet article, la notification de la pr\u00e9sente demande fera courir un d\u00e9lai d'une dur\u00e9e de six mois afin de r\u00e9gler le diff\u00e9rend \u00e0 l'amiable et, dans l'hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 le diff\u00e9rend ne serait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 dans ce d\u00e9lai, Monsieur Benabderrahmane indique qu'il se r\u00e9serve, d'ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0, le droit de soumettre ce diff\u00e9rend \u00e0 l'arbitrage*.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant points to the reservation of rights to submit the dispute to arbitration, at the end of that paragraph, as implicitly reflecting his acceptance and consent to arbitration.8\n\nClaimant's Memorandum on Applicable Arbitration Rules, dated February 23, 2023, para. 14; *see also* Request for Arbitration, para. 58 (quoting this paragraph).\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, considers the language ambiguous. While the Claimant's reservation of rights could potentially be viewed as a present consent to arbitration, it could also equally be viewed as a reservation of the right to consent to arbitration in the future, should the efforts to reach an amicable settlement fail. This latter reading would be consistent with the possibility that settlement efforts (the very context of the Notice) may succeed, rendering any recourse to arbitration proceedings unnecessary. The Tribunal, therefore, interprets this language as the Claimant making clear to Qatar that he is not waiving any rights to pursue arbitration should the effort at an amiable resolution fail. Reading this reservation of rights as a non-waiver only is consistent with the plain text as well as the context in which the reservation was made.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that paragraph 58 of the Request for Arbitration, submitted on 22 August 2022, expresses the view that Claimant \"has already consented\" to Respondent's offer to arbitrate in its Notice.9 That subsequent assertion is not dispositive of the issue of whether the Notice in fact reflected such consent, however. Moreover, that paragraph goes on to state that \"Qatar has refused to even engage in attempting an amicable solution, therefore Mr. Benabderrahmane states that he accepts Qatar's consent to the submission of the present dispute to [ICSID] pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT.\"\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 58.\n\n28.\n\nWhile this latter clause may have been intended to function as \"belt and suspenders\" from the Claimant's perspective, it presents a useful contrast to the ambiguous language in the Notice, expressing in unambiguous terms the consent that the Tribunal has found lacking in the Notice.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that a number of the cases in which other tribunals have found consent of the investor to have been given prior to the submission of the request for arbitration involve factual scenarios in which the consent was explicitly given in a separate instrument (such as a letter or a power of attorney), prior to the filing of the request for arbitration.10\n\n*See* authorities cited at pp. 3-4 of the letter from the Respondent to ICSID, dated February 23, 2023.\n\n30.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant's acceptance of Qatar's offer to arbitrate in the BIT took place on 22 August 2022, at the time of its filing of the Request for Arbitration. Both parties having consented to arbitration as of that date, Article 44 of the ICSID Convention requires the application of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the BIT's requirement of a notice of dispute precludes the consent of an investor to arbitration at the time of the Request for Arbitration. For that to be the result, in its view, the BIT would need to be considerably more prescriptive regarding the effect of such a notice than it is. The Tribunal also notes that many of the cases referenced earlier appear to have involved similar waiting periods.\n\n32.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's conclusion that the reservation of rights in the Notice did not constitute consent of the investor, the Tribunal does not need to reach the Respondent's argument regarding Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.11\n\nLetter from the Respondent to ICSID, dated February 23, 2023, p. 5.\n\n**B. D****ecision**\n-------------------\n\n33.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that Claimant's consent to arbitration was given in its Request for Arbitration of August 22, 2022, and that the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules therefore apply to these proceedings.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n34.\n\nOn the basis of the decision set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal orders that these proceedings shall go forward on the basis of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nDate: March 13, 2023"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Request for Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2023-12-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Request for Provisional Measures)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute has been submitted to arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the State of Qatar on the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments (the \"**BIT**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nSigned at Doha on 8 July 1996.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane, a national of Algeria and France (the \"**Claimant**\"), and the Respondent is the State of Qatar (\"**Qatar**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n3.\n\nThe present order sets out the Tribunal's analysis and decision on the Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary relief dated 3 November 2023.\n\n4.\n\nIt is divided into the following subsections: Procedural History (II); Positions of the Parties (III); The Tribunal's Analysis (IV); and Decision and Order (IV).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 3 November 2023, the Tribunal received from the Claimant an Application for   \nProvisional Measures and Temporary Relief (the \u201c**Provisional Measures Application**\u201d or   \n\u201c**Application**\u201d).\n\n6.\n\nOn 13 November 2023, the Respondent, in response to an invitation from the Tribunal,   \nsubmitted its comments on the Application (the \u201c**Response**\u201d).\n\n7.\n\nOn 16 November 2023, the Claimant submitted a Reply to the Application (the \u201c**Reply**\u201d).\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 November 2023, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant\u2019s   \nsubmission of 16 November (the \u201c**Further Response**\u201d).\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThis section summarizes generally the submissions of the parties. Additional submissions of particular relevance to the Tribunal's analysis will be discussed in the following section as appropriate. The Tribunal has carefully considered all of the parties' arguments, and the fact that a specific point may not be mentioned in this Order should not be taken as an indication that it was not considered.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Application**\n---------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn the Application, the Claimant makes three requests:\n\na) First, for the suspension of the death sentence that was pronounced by the Respondent against the Claimant;\n\nb) Second, for the suspension of the criminal proceedings that the Respondent has initiated regarding the Claimant; and\n\nc) Third, a two-part request, (i) for the protection of witnesses from interference and harassment as well as (ii) the preservation and protection of documentary evidence from destruction. [Application, introductory paragraph]\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimant's claim in this arbitration relates to the consequences of the Claimant's alleged arrest, detention and seizure of the Claimant's assets, a sequence of events that took place between 13 January and 31 October 2020. His claims for expropriation and denial of fair and equitable treatment required by the France-Qatar BIT arise out of these events. [Application, paras. 1-2]\n\n12.\n\nFollowing his release from detention on 31 October 2020, the Claimant left Qatar on 1 November 2020 and returned to France. [Application, paras. 3, 14]\n\n13.\n\nOn 22 August 2023, the Claimant commenced the present proceedings. Since that time, and the constitution of this Tribunal, the Claimant has made numerous document requests of the Respondent relating to his arrest and detention, on which the Tribunal has ruled, and as to which the Respondent voluntarily produced certain documents.2\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, dated 3 October 2023; letters from Respondent to Claimant of 22 June 2023.\n\n14.\n\nFrom press articles published in September 2023, the Claimant became aware of correspondence between the French and Qatari authorities in which the latter advised the former that, on 31 May 2023, the Qatar Criminal Court sentenced the Claimant to death. [Application, paras. 4-6, 18]\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant submits that he was never made aware of the existence of these criminal proceedings nor of the sentence pronounced against him. [Application, paras. 7, 15] He particularly criticizes the Respondent for not mentioning these facts during the course of these proceedings in which he was seeking document disclosure. He notes that the Respondent produced an Arrest Warrant dated 6 December 2020, but that it represented the only document produced for the period after the Claimant left Qatar. [Application, para. 16] It was produced on 22 June 2023, *i.e.*, after the apparent pronouncement of the death sentence on 31 May 2023. [Application, paras. 16-17]\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant argues that these developments \"threaten to undermine the integrity\" of these proceedings, \"radically alter the status quo\" from the time the case was filed, impeding his ability to present his case, and aggravate the dispute. On that basis he submits that provisional measures are necessary. [Application, paras. 8-9]\n\n17.\n\nRelying on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules, and decisions of arbitral tribunals the Application sets forth the reasons why the Claimant submits that he is entitled to the provisional measures requested. He identifies four requirements that a party seeking such measures must meet:\n\n(1) that it holds rights deserving protection;\n\n(2) that those rights are in urgent need of protection;\n\n(3) that the requested measures are necessary; and\n\n(4) that the requested measures are proportional. [Application, para. 28]\n\n18.\n\nHe argues that each of these requirements is met in this case. [Application, paras. 30-54]\n\n19.\n\nHe requests injunctive relief as follows:\n\n\"On the basis of the foregoing, the Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal preserve his rights through the granting of provisional measures. Specifically, the Claimant requests an order by the Tribunal recommending that the Respondent:\n\n(a) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may harm the life and safety of the Claimant, his relatives or other individuals (witnesses, experts etc) directly related to the present arbitration (\"**Request No. 1**\");\n\n(b) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo (\"**Request No. 2**\");\n\nAs a consequence,\n\n(c) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to take all appropriate measures to suspend the criminal proceedings initiated against the Claimant and any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration (\"**Request No. 3**\");\n\n(d) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to take all appropriate measures to suspend the enforcement of any condemnation rendered by Qatar's tribunal against the Claimant, including the condemnation to death pronounced on 31 May 2023 (\"**Request No. 4**\");\n\n(e) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings concerning the Claimant, the Claimant's relatives or other individuals (witnesses, experts etc.) directly related to the present arbitration, or engaging in any other course of action which may jeopardize the procedural integrity of the present arbitration (\"**Request No. 5**\");\n\n(f) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from taking any step or other action that may lead to the intimidation of witnesses or the unavailability or destruction of the documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant (\"**Request No. 6**\");\n\n(g) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to detail the documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant, to make a full copy of them, to preserve the originals and provide such inventory and the documents to the Tribunal and the Claimant (\"**Request No. 7**\")\n\n(h) Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to pay the entirety of the costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the Claimant in prosecuting its requests for provisional measures (\"**Request No. 8**\"); and\n\n(i) Order any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate. (\"**Request No. 9**\").\n\n20.\n\nFinally, the Claimant reserves the right to supplement or amend the requested relief, and indicates the Application is without prejudice to a potential claim for moral damages. [para. 56]\n\n**B. The Respondent's Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Response submitted by the Respondent by letter of 13 November included two documents: (1) the Judgement of the Court of First Instance, Criminal Court \u2013 Felonies First Circuit of the State or Qatar dated 31 May 2023 (in Arabic, with an English translation); and (2) a Decision of the Court of Appeal dated 26 October 2023 (this decision had already been submitted together with a translation by the Claimant on 3 November 2023; the Respondent filed the Arabic version on 13 November 2023, and a translation on 14 November 2023)3.\n\n[not relevant]\n\n22.\n\nThe Response noted that the Court of Appeal decision was not a decision in an appeal but rather a provision of Qatari law that requires the Public Prosecutor to submit a judgment involving the death penalty to the Court of Appeal for consideration. It also indicated that, apparently for the same reason, the case would be referred to the Court of Cassation.\n\n23.\n\nThe Response conceded that the subject matter of the Application is \"of the utmost seriousness\". Without prejudice to its position on jurisdiction, and without engaging in any admissions regarding factual matters which the Response did not address, the Respondent, after expressing itself in relation to the orders requested by the Claimant in paragraph 55 of the Application, set forth in full above, offered five undertakings (respectively as set forth below, \"**Undertakings Nos. 1-5**\"), as follows:\n\n\"1. The State of Qatar shall refrain from engaging in any conduct that may harm the life and safety of the Claimant (or indeed any of his relatives, whilst however noting that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that it would seek to do so).\n\n2. Criminal proceedings against the Claimant will be generally suspended pending the resolution of the arbitration and the Public Prosecution of the State of Qatar will request that the Court of Cassation take no further action on the referral of the Judgment by the Public Prosecution pursuant to Article 302 of Law No. (23) for 2004 Promulgating the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n3. The State of Qatar shall not take any step to enforce the sentence pronounced against the Claimant on 31 May 2023 (or any other analogous sentence or penalty).\n\n4. The State of Qatar shall not, without first notifying the Tribunal and the Claimant via his Counsel in this arbitration, initiate or pursue any other criminal proceedings against the Claimant.\n\n5. The State of Qatar shall preserve all documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant.\"\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent expressed itself prepared to provide these undertakings directly to the Tribunal in a letter from an appropriate official within the Public Prosecution of the State of Qatar.\n\n25.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argued that given its response, there is no basis for a costs order as requested by the Claimant.\n\n**C. The Parties' Further Submissions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's Reply**\n----------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAt the invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimant submitted its Reply to the Response on 16 November 2023. The Claimant maintained its request for provisional measures and argued that the Response and the documents submitted with the Response underscored the necessity and urgency of the requested measures, and confirmed their proportionality. The Claimant particularly underscored that the two court judgments produced by the Respondent with its Response confirm certain factual matters in his previous submissions. [Reply, para. 4]\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the adequacy of the undertakings proffered by the Respondent in the Response in response to the provisional measures he requested, which the Claimant described as comprised of \"two general requests\" [Application, para. 55, subparas. (a) and (b)], \"five specific requests\" [Application, para. 55, subparas. (c) through (g)], and \"two ancillary ones.\" [Application, para. 55, subparas. (h) and (i)]\n\n28.\n\nAs to the first general request (Request No. 1), which was for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to \"Order Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may harm the life and safety of the Claimant, his relatives or other individuals (witnesses, experts etc) directly related to the present arbitration,\" the Claimant takes issue with the Respondent's refusal to give an undertaking as to other individuals such as witnesses and experts in relation to the arbitration in addition to the Claimant and his relatives. [paras. 12-18]\n\n29.\n\nAs to the second general request (Request No. 2), which was for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to \"refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo\", the Claimant disputes the Respondent's position that such an undertaking is rendered unnecessary by virtue of the other proffered undertakings, and continues to maintain that it is necessary and appropriate. [paras. 19-23]\n\n30.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant does not elaborate further on its first two \"specific\" requests (Requests Nos. 3 and 4, listed as (c) and (d) in the Claimant's Application and relating to the suspension of the criminal proceedings against the Claimant in Qatar and to the suspension of the enforcement of the condemnation issued against the Claimant). However, the Claimant maintains these two Requests in its request for injunctive relief, which maintains in its entirety the request for provisional measures made in his Application. [para. 49]\n\n31.\n\nAs to the third specific request (Request No. 5), for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings against the Claimant, his relatives or others related to the present arbitration, or from engaging in any other activity that may jeopardize the procedural integrity of these proceedings, the Claimant decried the limited scope of the undertaking proffered by the Respondent, which was limited to notice of any other proceedings initiated against the Claimant. [paras. 24-28]\n\n32.\n\nAs to the first part of the fourth specific request (Request No. 6), for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to refrain from any actions that could lead to the intimidation or others involved in the arbitration, a request not accepted by the Respondent on the grounds that the request was unjustified, the Claimant essentially argued that the actions already taken by the Respondent were intimidating in nature and reiterated its request. [paras. 29-35]\n\n33.\n\nAs to the second part of the fourth specific request (Request No. 6), for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to refrain from taking any actions leading to the unavailability or destruction of documents or documentary evidence seized from the Claimant, which the Respondent also argued was unjustified, the Claimant submitted that the judgments have made clear that the materials seized from Claimant and now confiscated are at risk given the state security allegations in the case of destruction or unavailability. [paras. 36-44]\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant does not discuss its Request No. 7 in his Reply, relating to its request to preserve, copy, detail and produce the seized documents, but maintains it in the requested relief. [para. 49]\n\n35.\n\nFinally, the Claimant reiterates its request in its Request No. 8 that the Tribunal order the Respondent to indemnify it for the full costs, fees and expenses incurred in the making of the Application. The Claimant disputes the \"cooperative\" position of the Respondent and argues that the Respondent has concealed its actions, resisted providing information, and disrespected the Tribunal, thereby forcing it to make the Application. [paras. 45-48]\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant maintains its request for injunctive relief as requested in the Application. He also reiterates his preservation of rights as set forth in the Application. [para. 50]\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Further Response**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nIn its Further Response of 20 November 2023, the Respondent continued to argue that the five proffered undertakings remove the risk of irreparable prejudice and, consequently, the need for an order. It also addresses the areas where the Claimant has requested broader relief. It continues to maintain that the Tribunal should not issue any order that goes beyond these proffered undertakings, and requests a hearing with a further opportunity to advance more detailed submissions if the Tribunal considers that it would order any of the relief requested by the Claimant. [paras. 5-7]\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's submission that the information contained in the two court judgments it has produced support his position on provisional measures. [para. 8].\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the five proffered undertakings remove the risk of irreparable prejudice and should be given weight, something the Claimant does not engage with. The Respondent cites several International Court of Justice (ICJ) decisions that have given weight to undertakings that have been considered sufficiently comprehensive. [paras. 9-14].\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent then proceeds to address the Respondent's specific requests.\n\na) As to Request No. 1, the Respondent submits that Claimant has not sufficiently shown who is at risk and on what basis beyond those as to whom it has indicated it would be willing to provide undertakings (the Claimant, his relatives, and two individuals, should the Claimant intend to call them as witnesses). The Respondent argues that the cases on which the Claimant relies are distinguishable, and suggests that its suggested approach is supported by the decision of the tribunal in *Pugachev v. Russia,* which rejected the breadth of the order sought by the Claimant as too imprecise and unsubstantiated*.* [paras. 15-21]\n\nb) As to Request No. 2, the Respondent continues to dispute the need or basis for such a general order. [paras. 22-24]\n\nc) As to Request No. 3 regarding the initiation of criminal proceedings, the Respondent first argues that its undertaking to provide notice is sufficient, and the broader order sought by the Claimant would be neither necessary nor proportionate. It further maintains that the standard for granting provisional measures with respect to criminal proceedings is very high, given that this is a \"particularly sensitive\" area of State sovereignty. [paras. 27.1, 28] As to the request in Requests Nos. 1 and 5 to broaden the scope of an order beyond Claimant, Respondent submits that such an order has not been sufficiently justified. [paras. 27.2-31]\n\nd) As to elements of Requests Nos. 1 and 5 regarding witnesses, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not justified the broader order it has sought and that the Respondent's proffered undertaking is sufficient based on the facts currently before the Tribunal. [paras. 32-39]\n\ne) As to Request No. 7 for documents, the Respondent notes that it has already undertaken to preserve all of the documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant. [para. 41]. However, it objects to the production of this evidence, given the nature of the ongoing criminal proceedings. [paras. 40-44]\n\nf) As to Request No. 8 for costs, the Respondent disputes that the authorities cited by the Claimant support the granting of a costs order at this time and indicates *a contrario* that the established practice is to reserve on the issue. [paras. 45-49]\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe standard for the Tribunal's recommendation on the Application is set forth in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n42.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of each party.\n\n43.\n\nRule 47 of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in its subsections (1) and (3) that:\n\n(1) A party may at any time request that the Tribunal recommend provisional measures to preserve that party's rights, including measures to\n\n(a) prevent action that is likely to cause current or imminent harm to that party or prejudice to the arbitral process;\n\n(b) maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute; or\n\n(c) preserve evidence that may be relevant to the resolution of the dispute. [\u2026]\n\n(3) In deciding whether to recommend provisional measures, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including:\n\n(a) whether the measures are urgent and necessary; and\n\n(b) the effect that the measures may have on each party.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent did not dispute the Claimant's submission that four requirements apply to the Tribunal's decision whether to recommend provisional measures: (1) the existence of rights deserving protection; (2) urgency; (3) necessity; and (4) proportionality. The Respondent did, however, dispute the relevance of certain authorities relied upon by the Claimant for the relief sought as well as the application of these criteria to the full set of requests set forth in the Application and maintained by the Claimant in its Reply based on the facts and circumstances of this case. It also contests the breadth of the provisional measures sought and maintains that the undertakings offered by it suffice to meet all the concerns of the Claimant.\n\n45.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is persuaded that the Claimant has rights deserving of protection, as well as of the urgency of and need for protection both for him and for these proceedings, and agrees with the statement of the Respondent that the subject matter of the Application is \"of the utmost seriousness\", it is not persuaded that the full scope of measures requested by the Claimant is justified at this time either in terms of necessity or proportionality, particularly in light of the undertakings proffered by the Respondent. The Tribunal considers that the five proffered undertakings, provided they are issued by an appropriate and duly empowered official on behalf of the State of Qatar and extend to its agencies and instrumentalities, are responsive to the rights deserving of protection under the facts and circumstances currently known to the Tribunal, that they are likewise proportionate to the need currently presented, and that with certain clarifications as set forth below, they represent appropriate provisional measures at this time.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Claimant's Requests are either covered by or overlapping with the five undertakings proffered by the Respondent. Given this observation, and notwithstanding the general denial expressed on page 1 of the Claimant's Reply, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant has wholly rejected the Respondent's undertakings. His position must be rather understood as asserting that he does not consider these undertakings sufficient to ensure his personal protection in general and in relation to the pursuit of this arbitration. Thus, the Claimant's Reply contains several recommended orders to be addressed to the Respondent, but notably does not contain a formal request that the Tribunal disregard and reject the undertakings the Respondent is submitting on behalf of the State of Qatar.\n\n47.\n\nIn particular, both Parties submit, in similar terms, that the Tribunal should order that no steps be taken by the Respondent to enforce the sentence pronounced against the Claimant on 31 May 2023 (Claimant's Request No. 4, Respondent's Undertaking No. 3). Given the irreversible nature of that sentence, this Request specifically seems to the Tribunal to be particularly compelling under the governing criteria.\n\n48.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that requests defined in overly broad and/or unspecific terms, such as those deemed to protect \"his relatives or other individuals (witnesses, experts etc.)\" (Request No. 1), or prohibiting conduct \"that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the *status quo*\" (Request No. 2) are unnecessary and disproportionate and are, therefore, not approved. Likewise, the Claimant's Requests Nos. 5 and 6, which repeat in large part his Request No.1 and are, furthermore, unspecific, while leaving without identification the individuals concerned and the documentary evidence that should be kept available. The Claimant's Application does not specify the criminal proceedings that are still on-going and that should be suspended (Request No. 3), other than those mentioned in the second and fourth undertakings proposed by the Respondent.\n\n49.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal accepts the proffered undertakings as appropriate responses to the facts and circumstances currently known to it, provided they are issued by an appropriate and duly empowered official and bind the State of Qatar along with its agencies and instrumentalities, and with clarifications with respect to certain of them noted in italics below.\n\n50.\n\nUndertaking No. 1, that \"[t]he State of Qatar shall refrain from engaging in any conduct that may harm the life and safety of the Claimant or any of his relatives,\" is responsive to Request No. 1 and is accepted by the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes the Respondent's submission that the Claimant has put forward no evidence that it would seek to harm the life and safety of any of Claimant's relatives and that the undertaking was put forward on this basis. The Claimant's request, included in its Request No. 1, for a similar order in relation to witnesses and experts, is denied at this time as too general in nature; however, the Tribunal addresses the issue of witnesses in paragraph 55 below.\n\n51.\n\nUndertaking No. 2, that \"Criminal proceedings against the Claimant will be generally suspended pending the resolution of the arbitration and the Public Prosecution of the State of Qatar will request that the Court of Cassation take no further action on the referral of the Judgment by the Public Prosecution pursuant to Article 302 of Law No. (23) for 2004 Promulgating the Criminal Procedure Code\" is accepted by the Tribunal as responsive to the first part of Request No. 3 without further modification except to clarify that \"the arbitration\" refers to these proceedings. The Claimant's additional request in Request No. 3 that any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration be suspended is denied for lack of evidence at this time of any such proceedings.\n\n52.\n\nUndertaking No. 3, that \"The State of Qatar shall not take any step to enforce the sentence pronounced against the Claimant on 31 May 2023 (or any other analogous sentence or penalty)\", is accepted as responsive to the Claimant's Request No. 4. Without limiting the generality of this language (\"any step\"), the Tribunal clarifies that this term should include steps such as seeking the issuance of a \"Red Notice\" by Interpol for the arrest of the Claimant, and the making of a request for extradition or other form of judicial assistance from any country.\n\n53.\n\nUndertaking No. 4, that \"The State of Qatar shall not, without first notifying the Tribunal and the Claimant via his Counsel in this arbitration, initiate or pursue any other criminal proceedings against the Claimant\", is accepted by the Tribunal as sufficiently responsive to the Claimant's Request No. 5, with the additional specificity that such notice should be provided in writing by the Respondent at least 30 days in advance of any such action. The broader requests within this Request No. 5, that the Respondent be ordered to refrain from initiating any new criminal proceedings against the Claimant, his relatives or other individuals directly related to this arbitration, or engage in any other activity which may jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration, are insufficiently justified at this time in terms of the relevant standard, and are therefore denied.\n\n54.\n\nUndertaking No. 5, that \"The State of Qatar shall preserve all documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant,\" is accepted as sufficiently responsive to Request No. 7, with the additional provisions that (i) such preservation shall be maintained through this arbitration, and (ii) to ensure that preservation is fully effective, the Respondent should prepare a detailed listing, such as an inventory, of such documents and documentary evidence. The Tribunal does not consider the Claimant's additional requests in Request No. 7, that these documents and documentary evidence be copied and provided to Claimant, to be justified. The Tribunal has already considered two requests for document production and ordered the production of certain documents as a result of those requests.4 The Respondent has also voluntarily produced certain documents. This element of the provisional measures is therefore focused on the preservation of evidence which may be relevant to the resolution of the dispute, in the terms of Rule 47(1) of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n*See* Procedural Order No. 3, dated 3 October 2023.\n\n55.\n\nWith respect to the issue of witnesses set forth in Requests Nos. 1 and 5, as well as in Request No. 6, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has expressed its willingness to provide an undertaking with respect to two individuals, the Claimant's co-defendants in the criminal proceeding (identified as Messrs. Hisam Karmousi and Zuhair Boumadakh), similar to that provided in relation to the Claimant and his relatives [see para. 50, above], should it be the intention of the Claimant to call them as witnesses. The Tribunal considers it important that potential witnesses and experts not be chilled or deterred from participating in these proceedings due to a possible perception of personal criminal risks from doing so. The Tribunal appreciates the offer of the Respondent to provide an undertaking as to the two individuals. The Tribunal at present lacks specific information regarding the identity of such witnesses and experts. If and when such further information is brought to the notice of the Tribunal, it may, after considering all the facts and circumstances, make appropriate recommendations covering such individuals.\n\n56.\n\nThe foregoing deals with Requests Nos. 3-7 in the Application and reiterated in its Reply. The Claimant also in the Application and Reply requested two general orders (Requests Nos. 1 and 2) and two so-called \"ancillary requests\" (Requests Nos. 8 and 9) that require brief discussion.\n\n57.\n\nRequest No. 1 is a requested order that \"Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may harm the life and safety of the Claimant, his relatives or other individuals (witnesses, experts etc) directly related to the present arbitration\". In the Tribunal's view, Undertaking No. 1 adequately addresses this issue at this time.\n\n58.\n\nRequest No. 2 is a requested order that \"Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities to refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the Parties and/or alters the status quo.\" The Tribunal is of the view that this order is not necessary at this time in light of the undertakings that have been proffered by the Respondent, provided they are implemented as set forth in this Order.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal reserves its decision on Request No. 8, costs, albeit not because of an asserted practice of other tribunals in doing so. The Tribunal notes that the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules which govern these proceedings expressly provide that it may make an interim decision on costs at any time. [Article 52(3)] The Tribunal considers that its decision on costs with respect to the Application should be taken at a later stage of the proceedings. Although the Tribunal has not granted the Application on the specific terms requested by the Claimant, the undertakings proffered by the Respondent as confirmed and clarified in this Order, once issued, will in the Tribunal's view provide to a substantial degree the relief requested by the Claimant and ensure that his life and safety is not threatened by the Respondent during the pendency of these proceedings and/or the arbitral process prejudiced.\n\n60.\n\nRequest No. 9 was for \"any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate\". Subject to the above no additional relief has been demonstrated to be warranted at this time. In this respect, the Tribunal does not consider that a hearing is actually required.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**V. ORDER**\n------------\n\n61.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal recommends that an appropriate and duly empowered official of the Public Prosecutor of the State of Qatar issue, within 30 days of the date of this Order, the following undertakings on behalf of the State of Qatar, its agencies and instrumentalities:\n\na. The State of Qatar, on behalf of itself and its agencies and instrumentalities, shall refrain from engaging in any conduct that may harm the life and safety of Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane or any of his relatives.\n\nb. Criminal proceedings against Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane will be generally suspended pending the conclusion of this arbitration, and the Public Prosecution of the State of Qatar will request that the Court of Cassation take no further action on the referral of the Judgment by the Public Prosecution pursuant to Article 302 of Law No. (23) for 2004 Promulgating the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nc. The State of Qatar, its agencies and instrumentalities, shall not take any step to enforce the sentence pronounced against Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane on 31 May 2023 (or any other analogous sentence or penalty), it being understood and accepted that the concept of \"any step\" includes steps such as seeking the issuance of a \"Red Notice\" by Interpol for the arrest of Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane, and the making of a request for extradition or other form of judicial assistance from any country.\n\nd. The State of Qatar, including its agencies and instrumentalities, shall not, without first notifying the Tribunal and Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane via his Counsel in this arbitration in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance, initiate or pursue any other criminal proceedings against Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane.\n\ne. The State of Qatar, including its agencies and instrumentalities, shall preserve all documents and documentary evidence seized from Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane for the duration of this arbitration, and shall prepare a listing of all such materials which shall be provided to the Tribunal and the Claimant within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of this Order.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal orders the Respondent to confirm its acceptance of these recommendations within seven (7) days of the issuance of this Order.\n\n63.\n\nPursuant to Rule 47(5) of the 2022 ICSID Arbitration Rules, any material change in circumstances upon which this Order is based shall be promptly notified to the Tribunal.\n\nDate: 20 December 2023"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Request for Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2024-07-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Concurring Opinion of Makhdoom Ali Khan", "Type": "Concurring Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Concurring Opinion of Makhdoom Ali Khan\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nRespondent's Request for Bifurcation is based on two jurisdictional objections:\n\n(I) Claimant has not made an \"investment\"; and\n\n(II) If Claimant's assets were to qualify as an \"investment\", it was not made in accordance with the laws of Qatar.\n\n2.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's first objection, I agree with my colleagues that it is so intertwined with the merits that bifurcation would neither be expeditious nor inexpensive.\n\n3.\n\nFor the second objection, I agree with my colleagues that bifurcation would materially reduce the time and cost of the proceedings. The only point of divergence between us is that in my view, the second objection is not so intertwined with the merits as to make its disposal inefficient or expensive.\n\n4.\n\nA legal issue cannot be considered in complete isolation from the facts that give rise to it. All jurisdictional objections are, therefore, made within the context of the facts of the case. The issue before the Tribunal is not whether the issue raises a pure question of law. The issue is whether such an issue within the context of its discrete facts can be efficiently and relatively inexpensively decided and, if decided in favour of the Respondent, whether it will result in an expeditious and cost-efficient resolution of the case. In my respectful opinion, the second objection can be so decided. It does not require a plethora of evidence to be produced. The legal submissions too would be pointed and would not consume much time either. Accordingly, the second objection should be bifurcated and decided now.\n\n5.\n\nThe issue of bifurcation is one of efficiency and costs, however. As my colleagues are not persuaded, I do not regard this a matter important enough to merit a dissent. Further, a lengthy dissent would unnecessarily add to the costs of the proceedings. I, therefore, withhold expatiating on the reasons for this difference of opinion. In the interests of collegiality and to progress matters further, I concur in the result."}], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Request for Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute has been submitted to arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the State of Qatar on the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments (the \"**BIT**\" or the \"**Treaty**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nSigned at Doha on July 8, 1996.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane, a national of Algeria and France (the \"**Claimant**\"), and the Respondent is the State of Qatar (\"**Qatar**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n3.\n\nOn April 2, 2024, the Respondent submitted a Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Bifurcation Request**\" or \"**Request**\") to the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the Claimant submitted a Reply to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation (\"the **Reply**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, the Respondent submitted a Rejoinder to the Claimant's Reply to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, the Claimant submitted a Reply to the Rejoinder (the \"**Rejoinder Reply**\").\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal, having reviewed the parties' submissions and considered the issues raised, now issues its decision on the Bifurcation Request. For the reasons set forth below, the Request is denied.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThis section summarizes generally the submissions of the parties. Additional submissions of particular relevance to the Tribunal's analysis will be discussed in the following section as appropriate. The Tribunal has carefully considered all of the parties' arguments, and the fact that a specific point may not be mentioned in this Order should not be taken as an indication that it was not considered.\n\n**A. Submissions of the Respondent**\n------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent's Bifurcation Request is based on two jurisdictional objections, as follows:\n\na. First, that \"the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction because the Claimant does not have, or has not made, an investment in Qatar within the meaning of the France-Qatar BIT, or within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention such that this is not a dispute \"arising directly out of an investment\".\n\nb. Second, that \"the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because even if the Claimant had assets that would otherwise qualify as an 'investment', that investment was not made in accordance with Qatari law and hence is not protected pursuant to the express terms of the Treaty.\"2\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 5.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these are \"manifestly\" serious objections, that if successful would result in the complete dismissal of the claim, and are entirely separate from the merits of the claim. As a result, the Respondent submits, it would be wasteful and inefficient not to bifurcate.3\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 6.\n\n11.\n\nIn support of these two objections, the Respondent reviews the relevant definition of \"investment\" in the Treaty,4 highlighting the need under the Treaty language as it reads it for investments to have been \"made\" by the Claimant in Qatar, the need for assets in the territory of the Respondent to constitute rights that exist under domestic law, and the existence of an express legality requirement in the Treaty.5\n\nExhibit CL-03.\n\nBifurcation Request, paras. 8-9.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent also highlights the criteria under the ICSID Convention for an \"investment\" to be found to have been made.6\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 10.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to factually dispute the Claimant's asserted status in Qatar as a freelance consultant, arguing that he was in its territory as an employee of a privately held real estate business,7 and further disputes that the investments on which the Claimant relies in his Memorial are sufficient to constitute an \"investment\" under either the Treaty or the ICSID Convention.8 Respondent then disputes the relevance of the legal authorities on the issue of investment cited by the Claimant in his Memorial.9\n\nBifurcation Request, paras. 11-12.\n\nBifurcation Request, paras. 13-20.\n\nBifurcation Request, paras. 21-24.\n\n14.\n\nAs to illegality, the Respondent references three laws of Qatar which it asserts have particular relevance to the Claimant or his activities: (1) Law No. 25 of 2004 on Combating Concealment of Illegal Commercial, Economic and Professional Practices by Non-Qataris; (2) Law No. 1 of 201 on Regulating Non-Qatari Capital Investment in the Economic Activity; and (3) Law 25 of 2005 relating to the Commercial Registry.10 It submits that these laws would apply to the Claimant or his activities based on Claimant's own factual position and were not complied with, and that these are not technical or trivial infractions but serious ones that would render his asserted activities in Qatar illegal.11\n\nBifurcation Request, paras. 25-33.\n\nBifurcation Request, paras. 34-38.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent therefore submits that efficiency requires bifurcation.12\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 39.\n\n16.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to grapple with its submissions and has made insufficiently substantiated assertions about the asserted intertwining of the jurisdictional objections and the merits.13 In the Respondent's view, the separateness of the jurisdictional issues from the merits is \"clear\".14 The Respondent reiterates that the objections are serious and substantial, and criticizes the Claimant for his lack of engagement with them.15\n\nRejoinder, para. 2\n\nRejoinder, para. 3.\n\nRejoinder, para. 5.\n\n17.\n\nAs to the issue of whether its jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits, the Respondent argues that the Claimant conflates the question whether the objection as to lack of investment engages some issues of fact with the question whether those issues of fact are inextricably linked to the merits. Respondent disputes that there is an overlap, and submits that the \"factual inquiry in respect of the jurisdictional objections is in any event more limited than the Claimant seeks to suggest\".16 Citing various legal authorities, the Respondent goes on to assert that \"no investment\" objections have \"routinely\" been treated as separate from the merits.17 It also disputes that there should be an 'all or nothing' approach to the request, noting that the success of either of its two objections would result in the end of the case.18 Finally, the Respondent notes its lack of understanding of the relevance of the Claimant's argument regarding a lack of documents due to their alleged expropriation to the issue of bifurcation.19\n\nRejoinder, para. 6.\n\nRejoinder, para. 7, citing *Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v.

Finally, it disputes that it would not be prejudiced by non-bifurcation.25\n\nRejoinder, para. 22.\n\nRejoinder, para. 25.\n\nRejoinder, para. 26.\n\n**B. Submissions of the Claimant**\n----------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that bifurcation is not a matter of right, but is a discretionary decision based on the facts and circumstances of each case.26 He argues that the question of an investment is \"intrinsically linked\" to the merits of the case,27 that a considerable factual analysis is required to determine whether there was in fact an investment, taking into account the broad language of the Treaty and the Claimant's position that he invested not only funds but know-how, goodwill and a clientele. He submits that this will require a review of the Claimant's investments \"from inception to the expropriation\", and cannot be done without touching on the merits of the case.28 In support of his position that bifurcation is inappropriate when the jurisdictional questions are closely linked to the merits of the case, the Claimant cites various authorities.29\n\nReply, paras. 8-9.\n\nReply, paras. 12, and Section 3.1.\n\nReply, paras. 14-21.\n\nReply, paras. 22-24, citing to C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, at p. 537 (CL-073) ; *Mainstream Renewable Power and others v. Germany*, Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation), June 7, 2022, at para. 53 (CL-074); and *A11Y Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/1, Procedural Order No. 2 Decision on Bifurcation, 5 October 2015, at para. 61 (CL-075). .\n\n21.\n\nAs to illegality, the Claimant denies the Respondent's objection, and submits that his investments in Qatar were done \"in full compliance with the application [sic] laws and regulations\".30 He notes that the Qatari authorities have not previously accused him of breaching local laws, and argues that his economic activities in that State were done with the \"full knowledge and even the support\" of the Respondent's highest authorities.31\n\nReply, para. 28.\n\nReply, paras. 28-29.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that an objection of this nature should be joined to the merits, so that the Tribunal has the benefit of the full factual context of the dispute.32 He further submits that the Respondent's refusal to comply with the Tribunal's procedural orders has impeded him from fully presenting his case, and that granting bifurcation on the basis of a lack of evidence or witness testimony in Claimant's Memorial would bolster the Respondent's asserted campaign of harassment and deprivation against him and would constitute a denial of justice.33\n\nReply, paras. 30-32, citing to *Minnotte and Lewis v. Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/10/1, Award, 16 May 2014, at para. 129 (CL-076) ; *Georg Gavrilovic and Gavrilovic d.o.o. v. Republic of Croatia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/39, Decision on Bifurcation, 21 January 2015, at para. 77 (CL-077).\n\nReply, paras. 38-42.\n\n23.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that fairness and efficiency require denial of the request, in particular that the Tribunal would be making a decision based on an incomplete record if it were to bifurcate, and that bifurcation would increase \"dramatically\" both the time and cost required for this arbitration, including through the need to make additional submissions, and duplicate witness and expert testimony.34\n\nReply, paras. 37-47.\n\n24.\n\nAccordingly, he asks the Tribunal to reject the request for bifurcation and join any arguments regarding jurisdiction or admissibility to the merits.35\n\nReply para. 48.\n\n25.\n\nIn his Rejoinder Reply, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's request is frivolous, that bifurcation is impractical given how intertwined the objections to jurisdiction are with the merits, and that bifurcation would concern only a limited portion of the dispute.36\n\nRejoinder Reply, paras. 7 *et seq*.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal's bifurcation decision is governed by ICSID Rule 44(2),37 which gives the Tribunal the power to bifurcate and sets forth a standard of decision as follows:\n\n\"In determining whether to bifurcate, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including whether:\n\n(a) bifurcation would materially reduce the time and cost of the proceeding;\n\n(b) determination of the preliminary objection would dispose of all or a substantial portion of the dispute; and\n\n(c) the preliminary objection and the merits are so intertwined as to make bifurcation impractical.\"\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules 2022 (CL-002).\n\n27.\n\nThe parties largely coincide in their views of the criteria that should be considered by tribunals in determining whether to bifurcate the proceedings. In the Respondent's words:\n\n\"5.1 Whether the objection is prima facie serious (or not frivolous) and substantial.\n\n5.2 Whether the objection to jurisdiction, if granted, results in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase (in other words, the tribunal should consider whether the costs and time of a preliminary proceeding, even if the objecting party is successful, will be justified in terms of the reduction in costs at the subsequent phase of proceedings).\n\n5.3 Whether bifurcation is impractical in that the jurisdictional issue identified is so intertwined with the merits that it is unlikely that there will be savings in time and cost.38\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 5. See also Reply, para 7; and Rejoinder Reply, para. 9. Claimant formulates these criteria using slightly different language drawn from the *Glamis Gold* case (*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, at para. 12 (CL-069), but the key criteria identified are the same.\n\n28.\n\nThe parties sharply diverge, however, in the application of these criteria to the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n\n29.\n\nIn terms of the first criterion set forth in paragraph 24 above, the Tribunal cannot conclude on the submissions before it that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction are frivolous. It agrees with the Claimant that at the stage of a request for bifurcation, the task of the Tribunal is not to consider the objections on the merits. Rather, the Tribunal must assess on the face of the submissions whether or not they are *prima facie* serious or not.\n\n30.\n\nPlainly, the jurisdictional objections as to a lack of investment and as to illegality are facially colourable based on the submissions of the Respondent. Whether or not they will ultimately be borne out is a different question to be addressed at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nAs to the second criterion set forth in paragraph 24, it is likewise satisfied in the view of the Tribunal. It is evident that the success of either jurisdictional objection would result in the elimination of any need to proceed to the merits of the dispute. The Claimant's submission that bifurcation with respect to any one of the two objections, assuming success, would not lead to a material reduction in the scope and complexity of the case, is plainly incorrect.\n\n32.\n\nThe position is more difficult, however, with respect to the third criterion set forth in paragraph 24. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that factual intertwining of jurisdictional and merits issues, rather than mere factual elements of jurisdictional issues, is the relevant consideration. While the Respondent asserts that the jurisdictional objections raise completely separate issues from the merits\u2014which may be true as a legal matter\u2014the Tribunal is not persuaded that they are not factually intertwined in the particular circumstances of this case. For the Tribunal, this interconnection is most readily seen with regard to the first objection\u2014the question whether there is an investment. But the illegality issue, when the parties' submissions are carefully parsed, may also turn on factual issues including the basis, character, and nature of the Claimant's activities in Qatar and the posture of the authorities vis-\u00e0-vis those activities at the time when the investments or investments were made (in relation to the illegality objection). These issues overlap with the question of whether there was an investment or investments, what these investments consisted of, and ultimately lead to the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged expropriation of those investments.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent as a general matter that bifurcation is not an \"all or nothing\" proposition when more than one objection is raised. Each has to be considered on its own merits. In this case, however, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the issues are as distinct as the Respondent submits them to be. The Tribunal accepts as likely, for example, the submission of the Claimant that the same fact witnesses may be called to address both sets of issues.\n\n34.\n\nThe question then becomes how does this linkage, or interrelationship, relate to the ultimate touchstones of fairness and efficiency? In this regard, the Tribunal is not persuaded by certain of the arguments submitted by the Claimant relating to fairness, in particular, that he would be deprived by bifurcation of the opportunity to make its case or denied justice, or that the Respondent's conduct in this matter to date to which the Claimant has objected has relevance to the issue at hand. For the Tribunal, the question is whether there is a sufficient connection between the facts and circumstances that would be relevant and material to the objections and the merits to make it inefficient to treat them separately. On the somewhat unusual posture of this case, and based on its preceding observations, the Tribunal is persuaded that is the case.\n\n35.\n\nThe Request is therefore denied.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n36.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's Request ; and\n\nb. The Tribunal invites the Parties to confer and propose a procedural calendar for the remaining of the proceeding by no later than July 15, 2024.\n\nDate: July 1, 2024"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 7 (Request for Additional Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2024-07-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 7 (Request for Additional Provisional Measures)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present dispute has been submitted to arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the State of Qatar on the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments (the \"**BIT**\" or the \"**Treaty**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nSigned at Doha on July 8, 1996.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Mr. Tayeb Benabderrahmane, a national of Algeria and France (the \"**Claimant**\"), and the Respondent is the State of Qatar (\"**Qatar**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n3.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Claimant submitted a request to the Tribunal styled a Request for an Order Following the Respondent's Non-Compliance with Procedural Orders (the \"**Request**\"), together with an index of cited authorities.\n\n4.\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Respondent submitted its Observations on the Request (\"the **Observations**\"), together with annexed materials.\n\n5.\n\nOn June 18, 2024, the Claimant submitted a Reply to the Respondent's Observations on the Request (the \"**Reply**\"), to which was appended an Annex and supporting documents and authorities. On June 25, 2024, the Claimant submitted an English translation of the expert report of Ms. Celine Lauro submitted (in French) with the Reply (Exh. C-077).\n\n6.\n\nOn July 9, 2024, pursuant to an extension of time granted by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted a Rejoinder to the Request for Additional Provisional Measures (the \"**Rejoinder**\"), together with an Annex commenting on specific documents listed at paragraph 77 of the Claimant's Reply.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal, having reviewed the parties' submissions and considered the issues raised, now issues its decision on the Request. For the reasons set forth below, the Request is denied, subject to the Tribunal's Order set forth in Section IV herein.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThis section summarizes generally the submissions of the parties. Additional submissions of particular relevance to the Tribunal's analysis will be discussed in the following section as appropriate. The Tribunal has carefully considered all of the parties' arguments, and the fact that a specific point may not be mentioned in this Order should not be taken as an indication that it was not considered.\n\n**A. Submissions of the Claimant**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Request**\n-------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimant's Request is based on the Respondent's asserted non-compliance with previous orders of the Tribunal, namely Procedural Order No. 3 of October 3, 2023 (\"**PO3**\"), and Procedural Order No. 5 of December 20, 2023 (\"**PO5**\"). The Claimant maintains that these orders were binding, and that the Tribunal has the authority under Rule 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to issue an order in the face of such non-compliance.2\n\nRequest, paras. 18-19.\n\n10.\n\nPO3 ordered the Respondent to provide all documents related to its decisions to arrest and detain the Claimant for 307 days in 2020. PO5, a provisional measures order issued in the context of the Claimant's having become aware that he had been criminally convicted and sentenced to death by Respondent *in absentia,* ordered the Respondent, *inter alia,* to undertake to refrain from harming the life and safety of the Claimant or any of his relatives or enforcing that death sentence. It also accepted the offer of Respondent to issue an undertaking reflecting its commitments to refrain from certain actions.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to comply with these orders and has engaged in conduct that is deceitful, has aggravated the dispute, and threatens the integrity of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nRelying on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 22 of the ICSID Rules, the Claimant asked the Tribunal, in summary, to issue the following orders:\n\n\"(i) acknowledge that the Respondent did not fully comply with the PO3 relating to document production, given the obvious lack of authenticity of some of the documents so produced;\n\n(ii)acknowledge that the Respondent did not comply with the PO5 relating to provisional measures, given this party's failure (i) to give the requested by the Tribunal to protect the life and safety of the Claimant and of any of his relatives and (ii) to provide the document that it was ordered to produce; [and]\n\n(iii) order the Respondent to refrain from using in the instant proceeding any such irregular documents and discharge the Claimant from its burden of proof regarding all factual information which should have been evidenced by the documents to be produced under the PO3 and PO5.\"3\n\nRequest, pp. 2-3. The full scope of the requested order is set out at paragraph 36 *infra.*\n\na. PO3\u2014Document Production\n--------------------------\n\n13.\n\nWith respect to PO3, the Claimant submits that the documents produced by the Respondent following the issuance of PO3 were largely duplicative of documents produced prior to the issuance of that procedural order,4 and the Respondent has not only failed to produce all of the ordered documents, but has also produced inauthentic documents.5 While the Respondent claims that the ordered documents were first produced on June 22, 2023 (and then reproduced on October 18, 2023), the Claimant highlights what it considers to be \"obvious\" gaps in the production.6 With regard to authenticity, he emphasizes a recent incident during the review of Qatar's report by the United Nations Commission on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (\"CERD\") on April 17-18, 2024, in which the Qatari delegation\u2014which included a [REDACTED] , whose name appeared in documents of the proceedings involving the Claimant\u2014indicated a lack of knowledge regarding the Claimant's case. The Claimant argues that such lack of knowledge was evidence not only of the inauthenticity of the court documents produced, but also of a lack of proper process concerning Claimant in the Qatari proceedings. He also flags what he terms \"formal abnormalities\" in the court decisions produced.7 For the Claimant, this proves the Respondent's \"bad faith\" and disregard of the orders of the Tribunal.8\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent produced 9 documents on 18 October 2023, 7 of which had been previously produced. Request, para. 7.\n\nRequest, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, paras. 25 *et seq.*\n\nSee Request, para. 26.\n\nRequest, para. 3.2.iii., paras. 40 *et seq*.\n\nRequest, para. 46.\n\nb. PO5\u2014Provisional Measures\n---------------------------\n\n14.\n\nWith respect to PO5, granting the Claimant's request for provisional measures and ordering the Respondent to provide an undertaking as further detailed below (the \"**Undertaking**\") with the aim of protecting the Claimant's life and safety and maintaining the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, and to provide, within 45 days of its issuance, a listing of all documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant (the \"**Listing Order**\").9 The Claimant takes issue with the adequacy and authenticity of the Undertakings provided by the Respondent to date in response to PO5 as well as its compliance with the Listing Order.10\n\nPO5, para. 61(e).\n\nRequest, Section IV.\n\n15.\n\nOn January 19, 2024, further to the requirement of PO5 for the issuance of the Undertaking, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal a statement issued by [REDACTED].11 After the Claimant expressed concerns with the authenticity of this first Undertaking, the Respondent, while disputing that the Undertaking was non-compliant with the Tribunal's order, provided a second Undertaking by [REDACTED].12\n\nLetter from the Respondent's counsel to ICSID dated January 19, 2024.\n\nLetter from the Respondent's counsel to the Claimant's counsel dated May 3, 2024.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant takes issue with the authenticity of this second Undertaking as well. He argues that both suffer from certain \"inconsistencies\" with the Tribunal's order in PO5 and particular its direction that the Undertaking be given by \"an appropriate and duly empowered official of the Public Prosecutor of the State of Qatar.\" Specific concerns highlighted by the Claimant are that the Undertakings: a) are drafted in English, rather than a formal language of the State of Qatar; b) are not issued on official letterhead of the Public Prosecutor of Qatar and lack a seal and page footer; and c) lack the barcode that appears on all official documents and the signatures are missing official stamps. In his view, these \"inconsistencies\" with the Tribunal's order impair his rights, including by impeding the Claimant's ability to travel abroad, his ability to seek witnesses and experts to substantiate his claims; and by causing him to be concerned about further retaliation by the Respondent.13 The Claimant cites to a recent filing of a criminal complaint by Qatar against the Claimant as an example of a breach of the latter.14\n\nRequest, para. 54.\n\nRequest, para. 55, citing to C-074.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the powers of the authors of the two Undertakings have not been established,15 and it is therefore not clear that they are \"appropriate and duly empowered officials\" of the Respondent as ordered by the Tribunal. He further submits, based on the Vienna Convention of 1969, that only Heads of State, Heads of Government or Ministers of Foreign Affairs are empowered to act on behalf of a State at the international level.16\n\nRequest, Section 4.1.ii.\n\nRequest, para. 60.\n\n18.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to comply with the Listing Order in PO5.17 The Respondent has relied on an examination report dated February 10, 2020 as constituting a complete listing;18 however, the Claimant argues that this cannot be a complete listing inasmuch as it would not reflect materials that were seized from Claimant at a later date,19 and that the document relied upon is not, by its terms, a listing of all materials but only an examination report.20\n\nRequest, Section 4.2, paras. 62 *et seq*.\n\nExhibit C-051.\n\nRequest, para. 66.\n\nRequest, para. 67.\n\n19.\n\nIn addition to the specific orders requested by the Claimant as set forth in paragraph 12 above, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the Respondent's non-compliance, namely that: (i) the documents that should have been produced in response to PO3 would have shown that the Claimant's detention in 2020 was carried out without due process of law and without appropriate judicial review; and (ii) the information that should have been provided in respond to PO5's Listing Order would have shown that the Claimant had transferred to Qatar both documentary assets and know-how that were real and substantial.21\n\nRequest, para. 79.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant further requests, relying on Rule 36(1) of the ICSID Rules and Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, that the Respondent be barred from using or referring to any document lacking in authenticity.22 Paragraph 83 of the Request goes on to seek a declaration from the Tribunal that the documents specified therein are inadmissible and excluded from the record of these proceedings, and reliance on them is disallowed.23\n\nRequest, Section 5.1.ii, paras. 80 *et seq*.\n\nRequest, para. 83. These documents are: (1) pages 105 and 8-12 of the document \"minutes of Sessions and Orders for Detention dated 10.2.2020\"; (2) the documents \"SQ-TB-Decision dated 16 March 2020\"; \"SQ-TB-Decision dated 15 April 2020\"; \"SQ-TB-Decision dated 28 April 2020\"; \"SQ-TB-Decision dated 17 May 2020\" and \"SQ-TB-Decision dated 25 June 2020; and (3) the document \"Examination Report dated 10.2.2020\", \"insofar as this document is used by the Respondent as an alleged comprehensive detail of all the documents and documentary evidence seized from the Claimant.\"\n\n21.\n\nWith respect to witnesses, in light of the Claimant's submissions as to the chilling effect of the Respondent's conduct, he requests that the Tribunal order that he:\n\n\u2022 be authorized to produce any further witness testimony or expert report in a redacted version, with the name and any identifying information masked, provided a non-redacted version of such testimony or report is remitted to the Tribunal, under the seal of confidentiality, and to refuse any call to examination and for examination by the Respondent, without any inferences being drawn from such refusal;\n\n\u2022 disclose to the Respondent's counsel the unredacted version of any such testimony or report filed by the Claimant, only after a protective order is rendered and under the terms and conditions provided for in such protected order, terms and conditions which shall include, without limitation, (i) the acknowledgement by the Respondent's counsel of the confidential nature of the identity of the said witness or expert and of any such unredacted testimony or report, including in any document of the arbitration to be published, (ii) the obligation for any person requested, on a strict need-to-know basis, to access such unredacted testimony or report to have previously signed an appropriate confidentiality undertaking, and (iii) the commitment by the Respondent's counsel and any person accessing such unredacted testimony or report, to refrain from contacting or communicating with the witness or expert, beyond his/her examination at the hearing.24\n\nRequest, para. 89.\n\n22.\n\nThe full set of rulings and orders sought by the Claimant in its Request is set forth at paragraph 92, pages 32-35 of that Request.\n\n**(2) The Reply**\n-----------------\n\n23.\n\nIn his Reply, the Claimant maintains his position that the Respondent has not complied with PO3 and PO5, and argues that remedial measures are \"necessary and urgent\".25\n\nReply, paras. 4-5.\n\na. PO3\u2014Document Production\n--------------------------\n\n24.\n\nWith respect to PO3, the document production order,26 the Claimant asserts that despite having produced three additional documents beyond its previous productions (two with its October 18, 2023 production, and one on June 12, 2024), the Respondent has nonetheless still failed to produce all of the documents requested by the Tribunal. The Claimant points specifically to the absence of any documents regarding the authorization for or justification of the following events:\n\n\u2022 The Claimant's detention in the period from January 13 to February 10, 2020;\n\n\u2022 The Claimant's detention in the period between February 18 and March 16, 2020;\n\n\u2022 The Claimant's placement under house arrest between July 1 and October 31, 2020; or\n\n\u2022 The location where the Claimant was detained or placed under house arrest from January 13 and October 31, 2020.27\n\n\"(v) [\u2026] the decision(s) to detain the Claimant in an undisclosed detention facility between January 13, and February1, 2020 [\u2026];  \n(vi) [\u2026] the decision(s) to incarcerate the Claimant in the Salwa Road prison and to maintain his detention in this prison until 1st July 2020 [and \u2026];  \n(vii) [\u2026] the decision(s) to place and maintain the Claimant under house arrest between July 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. [\u2026]\"3  \nPO3, para. 27, as cited in Reply, para. 6.\n\nRequest, para. 26.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant therefore seeks an order acknowledging this failure and directing the Respondent to \"promptly and fully comply' with all provisions of PO3.28\n\nReply, para. 14.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant continues to maintain that there is a lack of authenticity in the documents produced and therefore submits they should not be given probative value.29 The Claimant also continues to rely on the lack of knowledge of his case on the part of the Qatari delegation during the CERD meeting, as well as documents submitted in those proceedings, and dismisses the submissions of the Respondent as insufficient.\n\nReply, Section 2.2, paras. 15 *et seq*.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant provides additional detail regarding the discussions regarding his case between UN experts and the Qatari delegation in the CERD meeting. He underscores the \"serious doubts\" expressed by the UN experts regarding the delegation's lack of knowledge of the case, and \"more generally, the lack of good faith of Qatar when questioned.\"30 In his view, this lack of knowledge evidences that the treatment of the Claimant was \"outside of all due process and judicial review.\"31\n\nReply, para. 32.\n\nReply, para. 33.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant also reiterates his prior concerns about the lack of knowledge on the part of [REDACTED] during the CERD meeting, and argues that the statement of the Judge submitted by the Respondent with its Observations [see paragraphs 39-40 below] has no probative value, apparently on the basis that while it makes certain \"formal acknowledgments,\" it does not answer the Claimant's \"critical claims\" of falsehood. The Claimant therefore submits that either the document entitled \"SQ-TB-Decision dated 25 June 2020\" is forged or that the Judge did not respect the proper laws in conducting the proceeding. He reiterates his request for relief, consisting of disregard and exclusion from these proceedings of all of the judicial decisions relating to his case.32\n\nReply, paras. 35-39.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates his position that the Qatari court orders produced by the Respondent contain many \"formal abnormalities.\" In support of this position, the Claimant submits an Annex analysing six of the documents produced in response to PO3 in detail, and an expert opinion of Celine Laur, a graphologist,33 concluding that Documents Q1 and Q2 are the result of computer manipulation, and Documents Q1 and Q3 are from the same hand.34\n\nThe Expert Report of Celine Laur dated 16 June 2024 is exhibited at C-077.\n\nReply, para. 43, citing to C-077, at p. 10.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant continues to cite to a prior unrelated case between Qatar and Bahrain as support for his position that the documents are fraudulent, noting the similarities between the formal abnormalities submitted in that case and those allegedly present here.35\n\nReply, paras. 45-47.\n\n31.\n\nIn terms of requested relief, the Claimant seeks a ruling of non-compliance by the Respondent, and that the documents produced by the Respondent be excluded from the records and an \"appropriate\" inference be taken.\n\nb. PO5\u2014Provisional Measures\n---------------------------\n\n32.\n\nWith respect to PO5, the Reply elaborates on the points made in the Request with respect to both the sufficiency of the undertakings provided by the Respondent and the list produced by the Respondent.36 The Claimant emphasizes the need to ensure that the undertakings \"genuinely protect him and his relatives\".37 To that end, he underscores the importance, in the context of the death sentence that has been proclaimed against him, and similar matters, of the document being in Arabic so that potential witnesses are able to confirm that it is an official document.38\n\nReply, Part III.\n\nReply, para. 59.\n\nReply, paras. 60-65.\n\n33.\n\nTo the Respondent's argument [see paragraph 43 below] that the formal requirements for which the Claimant advocates for the undertakings are not specifically ordered by the Tribunal in PO5, the Claimant's argument seems to be that they were intended at least implicitly, and the Respondent's argument shows a lack of good will. The Claimant also dismisses as absurd the position that he needs to demonstrate the failure of attempts to secure witness evidence in order for his submissions to succeed.39 He disputes any attempt to relitigate these issues and argues without further detail that circumstances have changed, and that he is responding to paragraph 63 of PO5 requiring notice to the Tribunal of such change. He further argues that he has been impaired in presenting his case.40\n\nReply, paras. 66-67.\n\nReply, paras. 68-71.\n\n34.\n\nIn terms of relief, the Claimant reiterates the measures requested in the Request, namely that he:\n\n\u2022 \"be authorized to produce any further witness testimony or expert report in a redacted version, with the name and any identifying information masked, provided a non-redacted version of such testimony or report is remitted to the Tribunal, under the seal of confidentiality, and to refuse any call to examination and for examination by the Respondent, without any inferences being drawn from such refusal;\n\n\u2022 disclose to the Respondent's counsel the unredacted version of any such testimony or report filed by the Claimant, only after a protective order is rendered and under the terms and conditions provided for in such protected order, terms and conditions which shall include, without limitation, (i) the acknowledgement by the Respondent's counsel of the confidential nature of the identity of the said witness or expert and of any such unredacted testimony or report, including in any document of the arbitration to be published, (ii) the obligation for any person requested, on a strict need-to-know basis, to access such unredacted testimony or report to have previously signed an appropriate confidentiality undertaking, and (iii) the commitment by the Respondent's counsel and any person accessing such unredacted testimony or report, to refrain from contacting or communicating with the witness or expert, beyond his/her examination at the hearing.\"41\n\nReply, para. 72.\n\n35.\n\nWith respect to compliance with PO5's Listing Order, the listing of seized documents and documentary evidence, the Claimant questions whether the new listing, provided by the Respondent with its Observations, is \"no more comprehensive or accurate than the previous one\".42 He observes that a comprehensive listing would include all of the documents identified in the Examination Report produced on June 22, 2023, as well as all of the documents detailed by Respondent's courts in the criminal proceedings, providing in paragraph 77 of his Reply a table providing examples of documents identified in both earlier sources but not included in the most recent listing. He appears also to question whether some of the documents listed are his or were possessed by him.43 He therefore maintains his request for an inference from such non-production as to the real and substantial nature of the assets he transferred to Qatar.44\n\nReply, para. 77.\n\nReply, para. 79: \"the Claimant formally contests\u2026.also to have ever detained most of the documents so listed.\"\n\nReply, para. 80.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant maintains in its entirety its request for relief set forth in the Request, referenced at paragraph 22 above. The requested relief is set out in full below:\n\n\u2022 **\"Rule** that Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities did not fully comply with the Procedural Order No. 3 relating to document production;\n\n\u2022 **Rule** that Qatar and/or Qatar's agencies or instrumentalities did not comply with the Procedural Order No. 5 relating to provisional measures;\n\n\u2022 **Rule** that the orders and recommendations of the Procedural Order No. 3 and the Procedural Order No. 5 are binding on Qatar and order Qatar to comply, without delay, with all their provisions, including but not limited, by recommending that appropriate and duly empowered official of the Public Prosecutor of the State of Qatar issue, within 15 days of the date of Order to be rendered, the undertakings on behalf of the State of Qatar, its agencies and instrumentalities listed in para. 61 of the PO5, in Qatar's official language, on an official headed paper of his administration, and with the relevant official signs and stamps, with a copy of this official's power to make such undertaking on behalf of the State of Qatar, and with a translation into English of both the document enacting these undertaking and the official's power;\n\n\u2022 **Rule** that the Tribunal will take into account the Respondent's non-compliance with Procedural Order No. 3 and Procedural Order No. 5 in its evaluation of the respective factual allegations and, notably, that it shall be inferred from the refusal by the Respondent:\n\ni. to fully comply with the Procedural Order No. 3, that the responsive documents would have shown that the detention of the Claimant, from 13 January to 31 October 2020, as well as the location of such detention, was decided without due process of law and without appropriate judicial review;\n\nii. to fully comply with the Procedural Order No. 5, that the responsive list of\n\n\"all documents and documentary evidence seized\" from the Claimant would have shown that he transferred to Qatar, both documentary assets and know-how that were real and substantial.\n\n\u2022 **Declare** inadmissible, exclude from the record of this arbitration and disallow the Respondent from using or drawing any factual or legal conclusion out of the following documents:\n\ni. the pages 1 to 5 and 8 to 12 of the document \"Minutes of Sessions and Orders for Detention dated 10.2.2020\", produced on 22 June 2023;\n\nii. the documents \"SQ-TB - Decision dated 16 March 2020\", \"SQ-TB -Decision dated 15 April 2020\", \"SQ-TB - Decision dated 28 April 2020\", \"SQ-TB - Decision dated 17 May 2020\" and \"SQ-TB - Decision dated 25 June 2020\" produced on 18 October 2023; and\n\niii. The document produced on 12 June 2024 entitled \"the [REDACTED] dated 16 February 2020, renewing the Claimant's detention for 30 days\".\n\n\u2022 **Rule**, with regard to any further witness testimony or expert report produced by the Claimant:\n\ni. that the Claimant shall be authorized to produce any such testimony or report in a redacted version, with the name and any identifying information masked, provided a non-redacted version of such testimony or report is remitted to the Tribunal, under the seal of confidentiality,\n\nii. that the Claimant shall be authorized to refuse any call for examination or for cross-examination by the Respondent, of any such witness or expert, without any inferences being drawn from such refusal; and\n\niii. that the unredacted version of any such testimony or report shall be disclosed to the Respondent's counsel, only after a protective order is rendered and under the terms and conditions provided for in such protected order, terms and conditions which shall include, without limitation, (i) the acknowledgement by the Respondent's counsel of the confidential nature of the identity of the said witness or expert and of any such unredacted testimony or report, including in any document of the arbitration to be published, (ii) the obligation for any person requested, on a strict need-to-know basis, to access such unredacted testimony or report to have previously signed an appropriate confidentiality undertaking, and (iii) the commitment by the Respondent's counsel and any person accessing such unredacted testimony or report, to refrain from contacting or communicating with the witness or expert, beyond his/her examination at the hearing.\"\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant concludes with the submission that the additional measures requests are both \"necessary and urgent for the preservation of his rights in this arbitration\" and reserves the right to seek moral damages.45\n\nReply, para. 83.\n\n**B. Submissions of the Respondent**\n------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Observations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Observations, focuses on the allegedly forged or inauthentic court orders produced in response to PO3 and the allegedly unreliable Undertakings provided in response to PO5.\n\na. PO3\u2014Document Production\n--------------------------\n\n39.\n\nAs to the court orders, the Respondent submits that there is no basis for the \"very serious\" allegations that have been made.46 The Respondent observes that of the five court orders that have been disclosed in this case, the Claimant has taken issue with only one, the order by [REDACTED] of June 25, 2020. The Respondent disputes that the Judge's statement at the CERD meeting regarding his non-recollection of the Claimant's case constituted an admission or that anything can be inferred from the Qatari delegation's lack of familiarity with the Claimant's case at that meeting.\n\nSection 1, paras. 6 *et seq*.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Claimant's case was not on the agenda in advance of the meeting, resulting in there being no advance briefing of the Qatari delegation to the meeting on the case, and that the Judge's lack of recollection of the case at that time was not reflective of any irregularity with respect to it. The Respondent submits into evidence a statement of the Judge confirming that the court decision of June 25, 2020 is \"in all respects a genuine and authentic Court Order which [he] issued on 25 June 2020\"; that his signature appears on the decision; and that the document that has been introduced into the record in these proceedings conforms to the original of the decision in the court's records.47\n\nObservations, para. 7.\n\n41.\n\nAs to the alleged \"formal abnormalities\" of the court orders, the Respondent denies that there is any basis to suspect that court orders have been fabricated or even tampered with, and invites the Tribunal, the Secretariat, or an independent expert appointed by the Tribunal to inspect the relevant court files if it considers it appropriate to do so.48 The Respondent questions the Claimant's reliance on an unrelated incident involving acknowledged inauthentic documents in a dispute between Qatar and Bahrain 30 years ago in a maritime delimitation case.49\n\nObservations, para. 8.\n\nObservations, para. 9.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that there is no basis for the relief sought by the Claimant in relation to the exclusion, inadmissibility, or ability to rely on, any of the court orders and documents at issue, or the adverse inferences sought.50 The Respondent considers these to be issues for the merits phase of the proceedings.51\n\nObservations, paras. 11 *et seq*.\n\nObservations, para. 13.\n\nb. PO5\u2014Provisional Measures\n---------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAs to the allegedly unreliable Undertakings, the Respondent disputes the merits of the Claimant's concerns. It accompanies its Observations with a written confirmation from the Attorney General of Qatar confirming that the two individuals issuing the Undertakings, referred to in paragraph 15 above, are and were duly empowered to do so by the State.52 The Respondent disagrees that international law requires that the Undertakings be given by a Head of State, Head of Government, or Foreign Minister, given the context.53 The Respondent further disagrees with the necessity for the Undertakings to be issued in Arabic, arguing that this was not required by the Tribunal in PO5 and that English, as the language of the arbitration and of Qatar's originally proffered undertaking, was the most appropriate.54\n\nObservations, para. 15.\n\nObservations, para. 18.\n\nObservations, para. 18.\n\n44.\n\nAs to the new proceeding allegedly commenced by the Respondent against the Claimant, the Respondent maintains that it is a proceeding in France involving private defamation of an individual who, although a public official in Qatar, is claiming in his private capacity, and as such fall outside the scope of the required undertakings.55\n\nObservations, paras. 19-21. The Claimant does not contest this in his Reply.\n\n45.\n\nConcerning the relief sought by the Claimant, and in particular the confidentiality regime proposed by the Claimant, the Respondent first emphasizes that the only justification for the relief is the asserted defects in the Undertakings, and that if they have been given in accordance with the Tribunal's order, there is no basis for such relief (or for relitigating matters addressed in PO5). The Respondent further argues that the confidentiality measures sought be the Claimant are \"unfair and oppressive\", and considers the proposal that witnesses tendered by the Claimant not be subject to cross-examination to be not only unworkable but of no assistance to the Tribunal.56 Moreover, the Respondent submits that while requesting relief under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant has not established a case according to the \"usual tests\" for such relief.57\n\nObservations, paras. 28-29.\n\nObservations, para. 30.\n\n46.\n\nWith respect to the alleged non-compliance with PO5 concerning the inventory, the Respondent first confirms that the direction in PO5, paragraph 61(e), to preserve all concerned documents and documentary evidence, has been complied with.58 With respect to the Tribunal's Listing Order, the Respondent attaches as an annex to its Observations a \"comprehensive list\" of the individual documents held on the devices seized from the Claimant, other than material on a telephone that the Respondent asserts to have been stolen, and duplicates of that material on a laptop, hard disk and memory card.59\n\nObservations, para. 32.\n\nObservations, para. 34.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is no basis for the requested inference that the documents seized would show that the Claimant's assets and know-how transferred to Qatar were real and substantial.60\n\nObservations, para. 36.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent suggests that, in making this Request, the Claimant may be seeking to \"construct an explanation\" for the lack of witness testimony submitted with its Memorial.61\n\nObservations, para. 37.\n\n**(2) The Rejoinder**\n---------------------\n\na. PO3\u2014Document Production\n--------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent rejects the suggestion that it is not treating this matter as serious, but denies that the Claimant has stated any basis for measures to be taken under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. It particularly challenges the nature of the relief sought by the Claimant,62 characterizing the Request as \"unprincipled and unorthodox\", noting the absence of any citation to a previous decision that would support the relief sought, and arguing that any decisions regarding inferences to be taken or document admissibility are for the merits stage when the Tribunal has all of the relevant evidence before it.63\n\nRejoinder, paras. 2-3.\n\nRejoinder, para. 8.\n\n50.\n\nWith respect to the CERD proceedings, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's submissions in its Reply regarding the content of those proceedings do not support that the documents produced by the Respondent are inauthentic and that its submission regarding due process and judicial review at paragraph 33 of the Reply is irrelevant at this stage.64 It also contests the Claimant's position that the statement of [REDACTED] lacks probative value and that it should be excluded. It also highlights what it terms the inconsistency between the proposed exclusion and the Claimant's interest in cross-examining the judge at a hearing.65\n\nRejoinder, para. 11.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 12-13.\n\n51.\n\nAs to the issues of inauthenticity of the Qatari court documents put forward by the Claimant, the Respondent continues to maintain that the documents are not forged, and that the Claimant's submissions, including its expert evidence, do not establish forgery. The Respondent submits that the issues of authenticity should be determined during the merits phase, and that there is insufficient basis at this time for the Tribunal to order the relief sought by the Claimant.66 It also reiterates its prior offer to have a representative of the Tribunal or a Tribunal-appointed expert examine the court file.67\n\nRejoinder, paras. 20-22.\n\nRejoinder, para. 18.\n\nb. PO5\u2014Provisional Measures\n---------------------------\n\n52.\n\nAs to the Undertakings, the Respondent disputes that its conduct with respect to the Undertakings provided to date reflects any bad faith on its part, given the Tribunal's prior order, and further disputes that there has been any non-compliance. It again decries the lack of detail provided by the Claimant with respect to witnesses being chilled, and notes the Claimant's lack of engagement with the Respondent's expressed concerns about the confidentiality regime proposed by the Claimant in relation to witness evidence, which are reiterated.68\n\nRejoinder, paras. 24-29.\n\n53.\n\nAs to the Listing Order, the Respondent disputes the Claimant's submission that the list annexed to its Reply has omissions and submits that every document referred to by the Claimant in paragraph 77 of the Reply either appears in that annex or is part of what the Respondent expressly excluded on that basis of its position that it constitutes stolen property. The Respondent goes on to provide, in an annex to its Rejoinder, detailed commentary on each category of document listed in paragraph 77 of the Reply. Finally, it disputes that the Claimant has established a basis for the requested relief or that it would be appropriate at this stage.69\n\nRejoinder, paras. 30-35.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent in conclusion disputes that there is any basis for an order in respect of the Request and argues either for its dismissal or a holding over of the Request to the merits stage. It also requests a hearing if the Request is to be considered, arguing that the \"extreme relief\" sought by the Claimant could have serious implications for the Respondent's due process rights.70\n\nRejoinder, paras. 36-37.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the issues relating to PO3, document production. Second, the Tribunal will address the issues relating to PO5, the provisional measures order. In both cases, it will address the asserted non-compliance by the Respondent and then the requested relief in relation to that asserted non-compliance.\n\n**A. PO3\u2014Document Production**\n------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAs to PO3, the order issued by the Tribunal granted the Claimant's request for production by the Respondent of the following documents:\n\n\"(v) [\u2026] document(s) regarding the decision(s) to detain the Claimant in an undisclosed detention facility between January 13, and February 1, 2020 [\u2026];\n\n(vi) [\u2026] the document(s) regarding the decision(s) to incarcerate the Claimant in the Salwa Road prison and to maintain his detention in this prison until 1st July 2020.[\u2026];\n\n(vii) [\u2026] document(s) regarding the decision(s) to place and maintain the Claimant under house arrest between July 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. [\u2026]\"\n\n57.\n\nThe principal basis for the Claimant's requested declaration regarding the Respondent's asserted noncompliance with this order, and the relief he requests, is an inference based on the alleged inauthenticity of the Qatari court documents produced by the Respondent that the detention of the Claimant from January 13 to October 31, 2020, as well as the location of such detention, was decided without due process of law and without appropriate judicial71 review.\n\n*See* paragraph 36, *supra.*\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimant has sufficiently demonstrated the inauthenticity of the Qatari court documents produced so as to justify the decision and relief he has sought. The evidence submitted by the Claimant with respect to the CERD proceedings earlier this year involving the Qatari delegation does not demonstrate such inauthenticity, nor is it sufficient, in the Tribunal's view, to establish that the Qatari court proceedings lacked due process or appropriate judicial review. While it is perhaps surprising at first blush that a judge who was a member of the Qatari CERD delegation and who was also involved in the Qatari court proceedings involving the Claimant had no recollection of those proceedings, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that such non-recollection could have been a function of the judge's limited involvement and the passage of time.\n\n59.\n\nAs to the so-called \"formal abnormalities\" allegedly associated with the Qatari court documents that have been produced, the Tribunal does not consider that the expert report submitted by the Claimant provides a sufficient basis, given its limited scope and findings, and in light of the submissions of the Respondent, to conclude that those \"abnormalities\" establish a lack of authenticity. It is not probative, in the Tribunal's view, that 30 years ago in a wholly unrelated proceeding, the Respondent acknowledged the submission of inauthentic documents.\n\n60.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal makes no determination at this time regarding the authenticity of the Qatari court documents. It further denies the Claimant's request for those documents to be declared inadmissible at this time. There will be opportunity in the merits phase of this case for additional evidence to be adduced, and if Qatari court document authenticity remains an issue, the Tribunal will consider at that time the Respondent's offer to appoint an expert to examine the court files.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that although some additional documents have been produced by the Respondent pursuant to PO3, none of the documents produced by the Respondent to date appear to be official documents relating to the Claimant's initial detention between January 13 and February 10, 2020, responsive to the Tribunal's order to produce in subparagraph 27(v) of PO3, or official documents relating to the Claimant's house arrest between July 1, and October 31, 2020, as called for by subparagraph (vii) of PO3. If that is confirmed, a request for a negative inference that such documents do not exist if made at the appropriate time, *i.e.*, during the merits phase of this case, will be considered by the Tribunal. In the meantime, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent shall be directed to carry out a thorough search of all official documents related to Claimant's detention in Qatar between January 13, 2020 and October 31, 2020, and provide any such documents to Claimant that are discovered during this search that are responsive to the order in PO3 within 4 weeks of receipt of this PO7.\n\n62.\n\nGiven its view that inauthenticity has not been established, the Tribunal finds no basis for the Claimant's request for the requested relief in the form of an order barring use of the Qatari court documents, including the documents identified in paragraph 83 of the Request, in these proceedings.\n\n63.\n\nThe requested order and relief with respect to PO3 is therefore denied, subject to the Respondent's compliance with the order set forth in Section IV pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph 61 above. Having said that, the Tribunal expects full and timely compliance with its orders. When those orders involve the production of documents, the Tribunal expects that a prompt and diligent search will be made for the responsive documents and they will be produced in good time as ordered by the Tribunal, not provided piecemeal over time. The Tribunal declines to find any bad faith in the conduct of the Respondent to date, but emphasizes the importance of full and timely compliance by the Parties with the Tribunal's orders for the efficient and expeditious conduct of these proceedings.\n\n**B. PO5\u2014Provisional Measures**\n-------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nAs to PO5, the Tribunal will address first, the undertakings and the relief requested with respect to them, and second, the issues related to the Listing Order.\n\n65.\n\nIt bears recalling that PO5 was an order for provisional measures issued under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. As such, it was based on findings by the Tribunal as to: (1) the existence of rights deserving protection; (2) urgency; (3) necessity; and (4) proportionality.72 The Tribunal has applied these criteria, which the Parties agreed in their submissions prior to PO5 were the relevant criteria governing the Tribunal's provisional measures decision, in assessing the Request in relation to matters covered by PO5.\n\nPO5, paras. 44-45.\n\n**(1) The Undertakings**\n------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that, with the statement of the [REDACTED], submitted with the Respondent's Observations as Exhibit R-005, the provisions of PO5 that required that the Undertaking be issued by an \"appropriate and duly empowered official\" of the Respondent have been complied with.73\n\nExhibit R-005 states, in relation to the undertakings signed by [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] [sic], that these two individuals \"are and were duly empowered on behalf of the State of Qatar to provide the undertakings mentioned above.\"\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the present circumstances require an undertaking issued by the Head of State, Head of Government, or Foreign Minister of Qatar. While undertakings of those officials may be necessary for purposes of binding the State at the international level, they are not necessary in the context of a criminal proceeding such as the one at issue here.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded, however, that the Undertakings that have been issued to date, namely, the First and Second Statements made by [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], respectively, are not formally sufficient for the purposes intended by the Tribunal in PO5. While it is true that these proceedings are in English, the Tribunal's expectation with PO5's stipulation that the Undertaking be issued by an \"appropriate and duly empowered\" official was that any Undertaking provided would fully conform to Qatari standards for such official documents. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Claimant that the Undertakings need to be reissued as original Arabic documents (with English translations provided for the convenience of the Tribunal) on official letterhead, and duly signed, stamped or otherwise bearing all markings necessary or appropriate for such official documents under Qatari law.\n\n69.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal has not determined that the Undertakings issued to date are not in compliance with PO5, but rather that a further clarifying order in respect of the Undertakings is warranted under the relevant criteria to make explicit its underlying expectations.\n\n70.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal has so determined does not mean, however, that it considers the relief the Claimant has requested with respect to witness and expert testimony and cross-examination74 to be justified, for several reasons. In the Tribunal's view, the Claimant has not made a sufficient showing of the basis for, necessity, urgency, or proportionality of its requested relief. The Respondent rightly observes that the requested measures would have significant implications for its ability to confront and effectively cross-examine any witnesses and experts. On the basis of the record before it, it would be premature for the Tribunal to grant such relief, and the present determination that a clarifying order is warranted does not support the granting of such relief.\n\n*See* para. 36, *supra*.\n\n71.\n\nNor does the Tribunal find bad faith on the part of the Respondent in its handling of the Undertakings. Bad faith is a serious finding requiring serious evidence of deliberate non-compliance or recurring non-compliance in circumstances in which such intent may be fairly inferred. Having said that, the Tribunal would have expected the Respondent to anticipate that if it did not issue undertakings in the form now ordered, they might not be fit for the purposes that could be reasonably expected of them (such as use with potential witnesses and experts) under the circumstances. It should not have required resort to the Tribunal by the parties to address this issue. But this is not solely the responsibility of the Respondent; the Claimant also has a responsibility to try to address issues of this nature with the Respondent. The Tribunal appreciates that the relationship between the Parties may be highly strained given the history of this matter, but that is not a basis for counsel not to try to address and resolve procedural issues before turning to the Tribunal.\n\n**(2) The Listing Order**\n-------------------------\n\n72.\n\nAs to the Listing Order in PO5, it is important to recall at the outset the reasons for that Order\u2014namely, to ensure the full effectiveness of the Tribunal's decision and order regarding the preservation of evidence set forth therein.75 Accordingly, it was incumbent on the Respondent to produce a proper listing on a timely basis.\n\nPO5, para. 54.\n\n73.\n\nIt is evident from the chronology of this matter that the February 2020 Examination Report could not constitute such a listing, even though it might have constituted an initial listing.\n\n74.\n\nBe that as it may, the Respondent has now produced a listing (excluding documents that it deems to be illegally acquired by the Claimant).76 The Claimant takes issue with that listing, but the Tribunal is not persuaded that it is deficient as the Claimant has submitted.\n\nObservations, para. 34; Annex A to the Respondent's Observations.\n\n75.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal is concerned with the delay in production of Annex A, and reiterates the need for the Parties to fully and timely comply with the Tribunal's orders in this matter. The Claimant should not have had to resort to a further filing to secure such a ministerial act. But given the Respondent's earlier productions and ultimate compliance, the Tribunal finds an insufficient basis for a determination that PO5 has not been complied with in respect of the listing.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal further declines to order the relief requested by the Claimant in terms of drawing any inferences as to the sufficiency of the Claimant's investment or the unlawfulness of his detention. The requested inferences go substantially beyond the purposes of the Tribunal's order in PO5, and have not been shown to have a sufficient basis, or be necessary, urgent or proportional at this time.\n\n77.\n\nThe Request in relation to PO5 is therefore denied in full, except with respect to the reissuance of the Undertakings in conformity with this PO7.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the submission of the Respondent that many if not all of the requests for relief made by the Claimant are more suitable for the merits phase of this proceeding than the current phase. The Tribunal's dismissal is subject to later submission and examination of issues set forth in the Request at a later stage of these proceedings. The Tribunal considers that the provisions of PO3 and PO5 no longer serve as a basis for future exchanges between the parties before entering into the merits phase of this proceeding.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n79.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal denies and dismisses the Request, except as set forth in paragraph 80 below.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent is directed:\n\na. to carry out a thorough search of all official documents related to Claimant's detention in Qatar between January 13, 2020 and October 31, 2020, and provide any such documents to Claimant that are discovered during this search responsive to PO3 within 4 weeks of receipt of this PO7.\n\nb. to reissue, within 15 days of the issuance of this PO7, the Undertakings required by PO5 previously provided by [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], respectively, as the First and Second Statements, as original Arabic documents (with English translations provided for the convenience of the Tribunal) on official letterhead, and duly signed, stamped or otherwise bearing all markings necessary or appropriate under Qatari law for such official documents.\n\nDate: July 31, 2024"}]}
