INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Red Eagle Exploration Limited (\"**Red Eagle**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), filed a Request for Arbitration (\"**RfA**\") against the Republic of Colombia (\"**Colombia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\") pursuant to the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (\"**FTA**\" or \"**Treaty**\"). The Tribunal was constituted on April 19, 2019. Procedural Order No. 1 was issued on December 12, 2019 (the \"**PO1**\"). A decision on the Respondent's preliminary objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) was issued on December 16, 2019.\n\n2.\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the proceeding was stayed for non-payment of the required advances pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d). It was resumed on February 6, 2020, following payment of the required advances.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing the parties' agreement on an extension for the filing of their submissions, an amended Annex B to Procedural Order No. 1 was transmitted to the parties on April 6, 2020.\n\n4.\n\nIn accordance with the amended procedural calendar, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits on May 16, 2020, together with Appendices A to C, Indices of Exhibits and Legal Authorities, Witness Statement of Ana Milena V\u00e1squez with Appendices A and B, Expert Report of Kiran Sequeira with Appendices A to C.5 and Exhibits VP-01 to VP-52, Legal Opinion of Adriana Mart\u00ednez Villegas with Appendices A and B, Exhibits C-0001 to C-0814 and Legal Authorities CL-001 to CL-0152 (the \"**Memorial**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn June 2, 2020, an amended Procedural Order No. 1 was transmitted to the parties reflecting a change in the transmittal of the parties' hardcopies of their submissions.\n\n6.\n\nOn June 16, 2020, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation together with Indices of Exhibits and Legal Authorities; Exhibits R-009 to R-014; and Legal Authorities RL-0011 to RL-0039 (the \"**Bifurcation Request**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn July 16, 2020, the Claimant submitted its Observations on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, together with an Index of Legal Authorities and Legal Authorities CL-0153 to CL- 0187 (the \"**Claimant's Observations on Bifurcation**\").\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent first explains that the Bifurcation Request is \"not intended to be a comprehensive account of Colombia's jurisdictional and admissibility objections and, as such, it does not for example include its objection to jurisdiction in connection with the termination of these proceedings in accordance with Rule 45 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which will be resubmitted at the appropriate jurisdictional phase of this arbitration. The Respondent reserves all rights, including the right to submit any further jurisdictional or admissibility objections that it deems appropriate.\"1\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 2.\n\n9.\n\nBased on Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, Rule 41(1), (3) and (4) of the Arbitration Rules and Article 829 of the FTA, and extensive jurisprudence, the Respondent asserts that there can be no question that the Tribunal has the power to bifurcate the proceedings to rule on jurisdictional or admissibility objections as a preliminary question separate from the merits.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent refers with approval to the test distilled from the practice of tribunals in deciding whether a proceeding should be bifurcated, namely, \"whether the jurisdictional objections at issue (i) were *prima facie* serious and substantial, (ii) could be examined without prejudging or entering into the merits, and (iii) if successful, disposed of all or an essential part of the claims.\"2 Furthermore, the Respondent argues that if the Tribunal finds that \"one jurisdictional objection warrants bifurcation, it can consider it appropriate to decide all the remaining jurisdictional objections in the bifurcated jurisdictional stage as well.\"3\n\n*Id.*, para. 14.\n\n*Id.*, para. 17.\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent raises three jurisdictional objections. First, the Respondent affirms that the Claimant had failed to comply with the FTA's conditions precedent to access arbitration. The Respondent explains that, according to Article 821 of the FTA, failure to meet any conditions precedent nullifies the Respondent's consent to arbitration. The Respondent argues that the dispute submitted to arbitration concerns a different array of measures from those described in the Notice of Intent. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of Article 821(2)(c) to specify the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimant has failed to comply with the FTA's mandatory time limitations. Article 821(2)(e)(i) of the FTA requires that no more than 39 months should have elapsed since the investor acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the alleged breach and of the loss or damage incurred. According to the Respondent, the critical cut-off date is December 21, 2014 (\"**Cut-Off Date** \"), more than 39 months before March 21, 2018, the date on which ICSID's Secretary-General received the Claimant's RfA. The Respondent describes the measures it enacted relevant to the Claimant's mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramos* well before that date. In particular, it refers to Law 1382 passed in February 2010 which introduced a general ban on mining in *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems, including the *Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo* (\"**SP**\"). The Respondent contends that, although Article 3 of Law 1382 grandfathered projects at the exploitation stage with a valid mining title and environmental license issued prior to February 9, 2010, the Claimant did not benefit of the transitional regime because it did not obtain an environmental license prior to that date.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this objection (i) is serious since lack of compliance with preconditions to arbitration nullifies consent, (ii) concerns a discrete set of facts which can be examined without prejudging the merits, and (iii) may dispose of the entire case.\n\n14.\n\nThe second objection raised by the Respondent is a *ratione temporis* objection on the basis of Article 801(2) of the FTA. This article provides that \"the provisions of this Chapter [Eight] do not bind a Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\" The Respondent notes that the FTA entered into force on August 15, 2011 and claims that the ban on mining activities in *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems was put in place before that date by legislation dated February 2010, May 2011 and June 2011. The Respondent affirms that \"the measures challenged by the Claimant are only the 'continuing ongoing effects' of the ban on mining in *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems\"4 enacted before August 15, 2011.\n\n*Id*., para. 54.\n\n15.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this objection meets the requirements of (i) seriousness, (ii) it can be examined without pre-judging the merits since it only requires the Tribunal to assess whether the dispute existed prior to the date of entry into force of the FTA, and (iii) it is capable of disposing of the entire claim.\n\n16.\n\nThe third objection of the Respondent concerns the denial of benefits to the Claimant. The Respondent observes that, according to Article 814(2) of the FTA, a Party may deny benefits to an investor or its investment if the investor or its investment is owned or controlled by nationals of a non-Party and the investor has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under the law of which it is constituted. The Respondent explains that, on April 19, 2018, it denied the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA to Red Eagle because it is owned or controlled by investors of a non-Party to the FTA and Red Eagle does not have substantial business activities in Canada.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"the requirements of control and ownership must be assessed by reference to ultimate ownership and control of Red Eagle, and not its nominal ownership.\"5 According to the Respondent, Red Eagle operates exclusively in Colombia and does not have substantial business activities in Canada.\n\n*Id.*, para. 63.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the objection is serious because there is credible evidence that the Claimant is owned and controlled by non-Canadian nationals and has no substantial business activities in Canada. This is a discrete factual scenario completely independent from the merits of the dispute that can be examined without prejudging them. It is also capable of disposing of the entire case since the benefits denied include the possibility of submitting the dispute to arbitration.\n\n19.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that the merits should also be bifurcated into liability and quantum phases. According to the Respondent, \"[d]ue to the complex fact pattern ingrained in Red Eagle's damages claims and the copious amount of information required to assess them, it is impossible at this juncture to accurately calculate the amount of Red Eagle's damages.\"6 The Respondent asserts that \"it would be in the interests of efficiency and judicial economy to await for the Tribunal's decision on liability before proceeding to the quantum stage.\"7\n\n*Id.*, para. 73.\n\n*Id.*, para. 73.\n\n20.\n\nAs relief, the Respondent requests that \"the Arbitral Tribunal bifurcate these proceedings and hear the Republic of Colombia's jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase, and/or bifurcate the merits into liability and quantum phases.\"8\n\n*Id.*, para. 75.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant disputes that there be a presumption of bifurcation and that preliminary objections must be decided as a preliminary question in a bifurcated proceeding. In fact the trend in the ICSID Arbitration Rules and other rules indicates an evolution away from bifurcation.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant agrees in that whether bifurcation is granted depends on a three part test consisting of the following factors: (i) the seriousness and substance of the objections, (ii) whether the objections may be decided without prejudging the merits, and (iii) whether the objections, if decided in the Respondent's favor, would dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the first factor requires a higher threshold than being non-frivolous. The second factor requires that the facts underlying the objection are \"distinct from those involved in determining the merits of the claim\" and the legal questions raised by it are \"likely to be separate and distinct from those arising on the merits.\"9 The third factor requires that an essential part of the claims or a material portion of them would be disposed of in the jurisdictional phase.\n\nClaimant's Observations on Bifurcation, para.13, citing *Mesa Power v. Canada*, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Procedural Order No. 2, 18 March 2013 (CL-182).\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant adds that, in applying these factors, tribunals have been guided by principles of fairness and procedural efficiency, and that the Tribunal should weigh the benefits of applying these principles against the risk of delay, wasted expense and prejudice. In the Claimant's view, the Respondent \"mischaracterizes the threshold required to meet the standard and, tellingly, argues for an interpretation of the various factors that has already been rejected in other cases under the Treaty.\"10\n\nClaimant's Observations on Bifurcation, para. 15.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant affirms that the Respondent has the burden of proving the need for bifurcation. Each objection needs to be decided *prima facie* on the basis of the Claimant's pleadings, and \"bifurcation of one objection does not necessarily weigh in favor of bifurcating other objections that would not otherwise warrant bifurcation.\"11\n\n*Id.*, para. 17.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant then addresses each of the objections. The first objection concerns the Notice of Intent; it has two components, the alleged insufficiency of the Notice and the contention that the claims are barred by the Treaty's 39-month prescription period. The Claimant argues that the \"Respondent has not identified any provision of the Treaty that requires a claimant to include all facts and legal argument on which it will rely in its notice of intent.\"12 In fact, in the Claimant's view, the Treaty contemplates the notice of intent as a first step progressing to the request for arbitration, memorial, etc. The Claimant contends that consideration of this objection is intertwined with the merits since, \"the Tribunal would have to assess each of Respondent's measures and how the measures referenced in the Notice relate to Respondent's subsequent acts and omissions.\"13 Furthermore, this objection is not capable of disposing of the entire case because \"there is at minimum, perfected consent for claims arising out of the measures that Respondent admits are detailed in the Notice of Intent.\"14\n\n*Id.*, para. 28.\n\n*Id.*, para. 31.\n\n*Id.*, para. 32.\n\n27.\n\nAs to compliance with the prescription period, the Claimant argues that to claim, as the Respondent does, that an \"objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial merely because Article 821 establishes conditions precedent to consent is a misapplication of the legal standard.\"15 Furthermore, \"this objection would require the Tribunal to analyze and rule on the measures that impacted Red Eagle's investment, when the loss or damage was incurred, and when Claimant has a reasonable degree of certainty of it before the cut-off date, among potential other issues.\"16 According to the Claimant, the Respondent does not explain how this could be a stand-alone assessment. In any case and at a minimum, consent was perfected in respect to claims that are not barred by the prescription period.\n\n*Id.*, para. 37.\n\n*Id.*, para. 38.\n\n28.\n\nIn addressing the non-retroactivity objection, the Claimant affirms that it does not meet the serious and substantial criteria since Respondent ignores that the \"Claimant's claims are all premised on events that post-date the Treaty's entry into force, a fact that Respondent itself admits elsewhere.\"17 The Claimant argues that, \"regardless of Respondent's prior conduct, which the Respondent has mischaracterized, it remains possible that its acts and omissions following the entry into force of the Treaty constitute breaches subject to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"18\n\n*Id.*, para. 43.\n\n*Id.*, para. 45.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant contends that consideration of this objection would require the Tribunal to determine merits issues. According to the Claimant, \"Even if the Tribunal were to conclude that a ban on mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramo* arose prior to the Treaty, it would still have to determine, among other things, when that ban became applicable to Claimant's investment and whether Respondent's actions constitute independent Treaty violations.\"19\n\n*Id.*, para. 46.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the arguments of the Respondent seem to focus only on the claim of expropriation under Article 811 of the Treaty, and draws attention to its additional claim that that the Respondent failed to grant fair and equitable treatment in violation of Article 805. This claim \"encompasses a range of actions by Respondent that go beyond the prevention on mining activities.\"20\n\n*Id.*, para. 47.\n\n31.\n\nNext the Claimant denies that the third objection is serious or substantive. The Claimant reaffirms that it is the burden of the Respondent to establish the requisite factual basis beyond assertions that there is no credible evidence in the Memorial of the Claimant. The Claimant contends that \"[v]ague, unsubstantiated allegations are not enough to warrant bifurcation.\"21 Furthermore, Respondent communicated its purported denial of benefit after Claimant had submitted its claims to arbitration. The Claimant recalls that under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention consent once given may not be withdrawn.\n\n*Id.*, para. 52.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, the Claimant addresses the request for bifurcating the merits into liability and quantum phases. The Claimant observes that this is a novel request not raised by the Respondent in the joint comments on the draft Procedural Order No.1 or in the procedural consultation with the Tribunal. Furthermore, this request is inconsistent with the procedural scenarios contemplated in that order. In the Claimant's view, the bifurcation of the merits would make the case unnecessarily protracted and inefficient.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent gives no basis for its contention that the calculation of damages is impossible or Claimant's calculation insufficient. The Claimant contests the Respondent's assertion that the calculation will be \"intricate and costly\" since the claim for full reparation in this case consists of the Claimant's sunk costs, plus interest, which can be determined on the basis of the audited financial statements of the Claimant.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that there is no justification for bifurcating the merits and that the request for splitting the merits phase shows that \"Respondent's real concern is to delay a final resolution of this case and to make the proceeding as protracted as possible. This is the opposite of the efficiency that bifurcation is meant to serve.\"22\n\n*Id.*, para. 59. The Claimant refers to the Bifurcation Request, para. 51.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant has requested as relief that the Tribunal rejects the Bifurcation Request and order the Respondent to pay all costs incurred by the Claimant associated with the Bifurcation Request.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Preliminary observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered all of the arguments presented by the Parties. The fact that this decision may not expressly reference all of them does not mean that such arguments have not been analyzed or taken into consideration. The Tribunal further considers it prudent to note that, at this stage of the proceedings, any decision for or against bifurcation will necessarily be based on a preliminary review of the claims and the objections to its jurisdiction. The Tribunal's decision on bifurcation does not reflect its views on the merits of the objections to jurisdiction or on the merits of the dispute itself.\n\n**B. The applicable norms and standards**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nArticle 829 of the Treaty provides:\n\n1.The Tribunal shall have the power to rule on preliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n2. Any preliminary objection that the dispute should not be submitted or registered, is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, or for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be made in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules as early as possible.\n\n38.\n\nThe ICSID Arbitration Rules are the applicable rules for purposes of Article 829 of the Treaty. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 on Preliminary Objections provides in relevant part that,\n\nUpon the formal raising an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objection.23\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal \"may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\"24\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4).\n\n40.\n\nAccording to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, the Tribunal has discretion to bifurcate or not depending on the circumstances of each case. The Tribunal *may* bifurcate a proceeding to decide a preliminary objection. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 does not establish a presumption in favor or against bifurcation. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 is silent on the circumstances, criteria or factors that the Tribunal may take into account in the consideration of objections to its jurisdiction.\n\n41.\n\nThe parties agree in substance that, in order to warrant bifurcation, a jurisdictional objection must be *prima facie* serious and substantial, capable of being examined without prejudging the merits and, if successful, capable of disposing of all or an essential part of the claims. However, they disagree on the level of seriousness and substantive nature of an objection. While for the Respondent it is sufficient that the objection is not frivolous, the Claimant affirms, based on *Eco Oro* that, \"a higher threshold must be applied than merely requiring that the objection is not frivolous or vexatious.\"25 The Claimant refers to other decisions of arbitral tribunals that support this contention. Thus the *Gran Colombia* tribunal held that the \"'frivolous on their face' is a starting point \u2026 [b]ut this does not mean that every jurisdictional objection that surpasses that low threshold presumptively warrants bifurcation.\"26 Furthermore, an objection may be found to be non-frivolous but not \"sufficiently serious and substantial to justify bifurcation.\"27\n\n*Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 June 2018 (CL- 154) para. 51.\n\n*Gran Colombia Gold Corp. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/23, Procedural Order No. 3, Decision on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, 17 January 2020 (CL-153) para. 27.\n\n*See* *Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Limited v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2016-39, Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on Bifurcation), 31 January 2018 (CL-156) paras. 42, 50, 51.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that in its ordinary meaning \"serious\" may be considered as the opposite of frivolous. Something frivolous has \"no useful or *serious* purpose\"28. \"Substantial\" is defined as something of \"considerable importance\" or \"weighty\"29. The Tribunal is of the view that between frivolous and serious there may be degrees of seriousness that do not carry the weight to justify bifurcation. It is relevant here to recall that, in deciding whether or not to bifurcate the proceeding the Tribunal has discretion and needs to consider not only procedural efficiency but also fairness; it needs to strike a balance between the two. Both parties agree that the Tribunal needs to conduct an efficient and fair proceeding.30\n\nOnline Oxford Dictionary.\n\nOnline Oxford Dictionary.\n\nSee Chapter II of the Bifurcation Request and Claimant's Observations on Bifurcation, para. 14.\n\n43.\n\nAs regards the second factor, a jurisdictional objection is not intertwined with the merits if it concerns a self-contained, limited set of facts different from those relating to the merits of the dispute.\n\n44.\n\nThe third factor of the test is met if a preliminary jurisdictional or admissibility objection is capable of disposing of the entire case or at least narrowing the scope of issues to be briefed at the merits stage. Bifurcating the proceedings may thus result in a reduction in the time and costs of any future phase of the proceedings.\n\n45.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the Respondent's objections meet these factors. The Tribunal considers them below.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Objections**\n----------------------------------\n\n***a) Red Eagle's alleged failure to comply with FTA's conditions precedent***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAs pleaded, this objection has two components: failure by the Claimant to state in its written notice of intent the legal and factual basis for its claims and failure by the Claimant to comply with mandatory time limits. The Tribunal considers them separately.\n\n*(i) Failure to state legal and factual basis for its claims*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nResolution 2090/2014, that was cited by Claimant in its Notice of Intent, triggered (or contributed to trigger) the dispute as it allegedly (i) delimited the SP in a manner that overlapped with 10 out of 11 of Claimant\u00b4s mining titles; (ii) created doubts on the coverage of the existing grandfathering provisions for continuing activities therein; and (iii) prohibited renewal of permits.31\n\nMemorial, paras.72-73; art. 5 of Resolution 2090/2014, and Mart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, paras. 126-127 and 135138.\n\n48.\n\nThe fact that Resolution 2090/2014 was allegedly flawed and subsequently declared unconstitutional in May 2017, created further uncertainty when the Constitutional Court ordered the Ministry of the Environment to conduct a new delimitation of the SP.32\n\nMemorial, para. 77.\n\n49.\n\nJudgment C-035/16 of the Colombian Constitutional Court (\"**Judgment C-035**\"), also cited in Claimant's Notice of Intent, declared unconstitutional Law 1753, that had been enacted in 2016, for failing to provide sufficient environmental protection to *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems by authorizing mining activities with pre-acquired environmental licenses. In this way, and subject to further analysis and Respondent's rebuttal on these issues, Judgment C-035 might be deemed to have eliminated in practice the grandfathering provision for mining titles issued prior to February 9, 2010. Allegedly, the Ministry of the Environment stated that Article 5 of Resolution 2090/2014, that had recognized grandfathering provisions had forfeited legal force.33 Claimant's claim appears *prima facie* to be based to a large extent on an alleged disregard by Colombia of the grandfathering provision and on the mining stability rights that Claimant purportedly enjoyed. In other words, Colombia's alleged disregard of this stabilization clause seems to be the opening for a number of actions by Colombia that subsequently banned and/or restricted the Claimant's activities in several areas and ordered the Claimant to return the Real Minera area to the State.34\n\nMemorial, para. 81, and Mart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, para. 130.\n\nMemorial, paras.81-86, and Mart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, paras. 131-134 and 137-138.\n\n50.\n\nThese considerations lead the Tribunal to conclude, first, that the Respondent's objection does not appear to be \"serious and substantial\" because it omits to consider that the Notice of Intent did identify a legal and factual basis of Claimant's claim.\n\n51.\n\nSecond, as explained above in relation to the implications of Resolution 2090/2014 and Judgment C-035, resolving the Respondent's objections will require an analysis of the facts of the case and the relationship between the different events and the measures taken by Colombia, including the impact of Resolution 2090/2014 and Judgement C-035 (both cited in the Notice of Intent) on the Claimant's alleged rights, the subsequent measures and actions taken by Colombia.\n\n52.\n\nThird, the Respondent's objection, even if successful, will not dispose of the entire case. Indeed, there would still be a \"consent\" to arbitrate in relation to the measures that are specified in the Notice of Intent and the proceeding would continue as to these measures.\n\n*(ii) Failure to comply with mandatory time limits*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIf the Claimant had an environmental license on February 9, 2010 or was otherwise entitled to protection or stability under the grandfathering provisional/transitional regime or other provisions of Colombian law enacted prior to the Cut-Off Date, there may be potentially measures subsequent to said date that violated such protection that are relevant to its claim and within the temporal limit of the FTA.35\n\nSee, for example, allegations in the Memorial at paras. 56- 69 and paras. 70-77.\n\n54.\n\nAs currently alleged by Claimant, if the Claimant were to be entitled to protection under the transition regime or other provisions, the following measures might not be precluded by the FTA time limit: (i) Resolution 2090/2014;36 (ii) Law 1753 enacted in 2015 that banned activities within the SP except those protected by the transition regime;37 (iii) Judgment C-035 issued in February 2016 that allegedly eliminated in practice the grandfathering provision by declaring Law 1753 unconstitutional;38 (iv) the Ministry of the Environment subsequently declared that Article 5 of Resolution 2090/2014 that had recognized the grandfathering provision had no legal force;39 (v) subsequent measures allegedly banned and/or restricted Claimant's activities in several areas and ordered Claimant to return the Real Minera area to the State;40 (vi) CC Judgment T-361 allegedly ordered another delimitation of SP and indicated that further restrictions could be expected;41 (vii) allegedly, no compensation was paid to Claimant as had been indicated by the Constitutional Court.42\n\nMemorial, paras. 72 *et seq*.\n\nMemorial, paras. 80-81.\n\nMemorial, para. 81; *see also* Mart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, para. 130 and 135-136.\n\nMart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, para. 130.\n\nMemorial, paras. 81-84; *see also* Mart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, paras. 137-138.\n\nMart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, paras. 131-133.\n\nMart\u00ednez Villegas Legal Report, paras. 133-134.\n\n55.\n\nTo conclude, first, this objection seems to be predicated on the assumption that for deciding this matter the Tribunal could merely examine the measures listed by the Claimant in its Notice of Intent. As explained above, the case at hand seems to be more complex. Thus, it is questionable whether Respondent's objection qualifies as *prima facie* \"serious and substantial\". Second, the above analysis suggests that *prima facie*, the Respondent's objection is predicated on conclusions reached as to merits issues, and cannot be resolved without an analysis of the relation between the different events and measures alleged as the basis of the Claimant's claims. Third, the Respondent's objection even if successful would not dispose of those claims arising from non-time barred measures.\n\n***b) The claims are outside the jurisdiction ratione temporis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent's argument seems to be premised on the assumption that since the first measures banning mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramos* took place prior to August 2011, all subsequent measures are irrelevant. However, in this early phase in the arbitration, it is unclear to what extent the measures enacted before August 2011 applied to Claimant's investments or whether the Claimant was otherwise entitled to transitional protection. This, because, as Claimant argues, the measures that allegedly disregarded the grandfathering provision established by Law 1382 in February 2010 were issued after August 2011, starting with Resolution 2090 of December 2014 onwards. These issues warrant further debate and analysis during the merits phase.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Colombia's measures constitute not only expropriation, but also a breach of the FET standard through a number of measures that were enacted after the entry into force of the Treaty, including Resolution 2090/2014; communications from the *Autoridad Nacional de Miner\u00eda* (\"**ANM**\") between January and June 2015; Law 1753 of June 9, 2015; Judgment C-035/16; other communications from the ANM banning activities in portions of Claimant's mining titles; Judgment of the Constitutional Court T-361 of May 2017; communication of ANM of August 2017 and letter from *Corporaci\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma Regional para la Defensa de la Meseta de Bucaramanga* of December 2019 banning activities in a large portion of one of the mining properties of the Claimant and informing that no further authorizations would be issued until further delimitation of the SP.43\n\nMemorial, para. 142.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant further claims that a number of measures and actions and omissions of Colombia subsequent to August 2011 lacked transparency,44 and were arbitrary and unreasonable,45 disproportionate,46 and discriminatory.47\n\nMemorial, paras. 144 *et seq*.\n\nMemorial, paras. 155 *et seq*.\n\nMemorial, paras. 160-161\n\nMemorial, para. 163.\n\n59.\n\nThe analysis of the aforementioned claims, their relationship with the Claimant's investments and the measures, actions and omissions of Colombia for purposes of determining whether they fall within the time limits of the Treaty, can only be made in relation to the discussion of the merits.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the above analysis raises doubts as to whether Respondent's objection meets the first test of being *prima facie* \"serious and substantial\", the objection is merits related, and, even if successful, it would not dispose of the claims arising out of Colombia\u00b4s measures, actions or omissions subsequent to August 2011.\n\n***c) Colombia denied benefits of the FTA to the Claimant***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn its Memorial and attachments, the Claimant provided *prima facie* evidence that it is a company incorporated in, and in accordance with the laws of Canada, and that as of the date of filing of the RfA on March 21, 2018, it was owned and controlled by Canadian nationals.48\n\nMemorial, para. 89, and documents identified in footnotes 230 to 232.\n\n62.\n\nRespondent has not provided any evidence to support its objection, other than a general statement that it will do so in the bifurcated proceeding.49 Thus the Tribunal has only the evidence submitted by the Claimant to make a *prima facie* assessment of the objection.\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 64.\n\n63.\n\nRespondent admits to having presented its denial of benefits after the date on which Claimant filed its RfA and the Claimant has contended that under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention consent may not be withdrawn.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches the following conclusions: first, the Respondent has not met the burden of proof even on a *prima facie* basis, particularly in light of the fact that in its Memorial, the Claimant submitted evidence purporting to demonstrate that it is a Canadian company owned and controlled by Canadian nationals. The denial of benefits objection would fail if either: (i) Claimant is owned and controlled by Canadian nationals, **or** (ii) it has substantial business activities in Canada (Article 814 (2) of the FTA). While it is correct that consent may not be withdrawn, the Claimant has to meet the conditions set forth in the Treaty for the consent of the Respondent.\n\n65.\n\nSecond, the objection is not merits related and, if successful, would actually dispose of the entire case, but in view of the lack of evidence in support of the contentions of the Respondent, the Tribunal considers that bifurcation would not be justified.\n\n66.\n\nIn sum, on the basis of the materials available to it the Tribunal does not find merit in the objections raised by the Respondent.\n\n67.\n\nIt remains a final point to be considered by the Tribunal. The parties disagreed on whether bifurcation of one objection weighs in favor of bifurcating other objections that would not otherwise warrant bifurcation. Since the Tribunal has not upheld any of the three objections, the Tribunal does not need to address the parties' arguments on this matter.50\n\nSee Bifurcation Request, para. 17 and Claimant's Observations, para. 17.\n\n**D. Bifurcation of the merits into liability and quantum**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe damages calculation put forward by Claimant does not appear *prima facie* to be complex since it claims full reparation of sunk costs based on its audited financial statements. The bifurcation requested by Colombia would only be justified if it can be assumed or *prima facie* determined from the outset that the damages determination will be a complex matter. Claimant's claim based on sunk costs backed by audited financial statements suggests otherwise. Therefore, at this stage the Respondent's request for bifurcating the merits phase into liability and quantum is not justified and is premature. This conclusion does not prevent the Respondent from demonstrating at a later stage the complexity of the calculation of damages to sustain a bifurcation request of the merits.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n69.\n\nEach party has requested the Tribunal to order the other party to pay for the costs incurred associated with the Bifurcation Request. The Tribunal considers that a decision on costs at this early stage of the proceeding would be premature, and that it is a decision more appropriately made at a later stage when the Tribunal has an overall view of the proceeding.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n70.\n\nFor the preceding reasons the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. To reject the Request for Bifurcation.\n\n2. To declare that the procedural calendar set forth in Scenario 3 of Annex B, as amended, of Procedural Order No. 1 is now in effect, and the Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections are due 90 days from the date of this Decision.\n\n3.

Signals to Investors. Regulatory Framework and Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1. Initial comment\n--------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Parties discussed at length during the proceedings the signals that investors generally, and Claimant in particular, would have received from Colombia regarding the likelihood of the imposition by Respondent of a ban or restrictions on mining operations in the areas forming part of the Santurb\u00e1n p\u00e1ramo (SP or P\u00e1ramo), and their implications on the legitimate expectations of Claimant. This matter was also addressed in detail in both Parties\u2019 Post-Hearing Briefs (PHBs\") in response to the first question that the Tribunal directed to the Parties on March 2, 2023.1\n\nQuestion 1 of Section on Overarching issues of general consequence.\n\n7.\n\nI will first review the signals invoked by each of the Parties in relation to the regulatory framework in force at the time Claimant acquired its 11 mining titles (the Mining Titles\") and the subsequent measures and actions taken by Colombia\u2019s authorities. I will afterwards analyze the depth of the due diligence carried out by Claimant and finalize with my conclusions on this first issue.\n\n2.2. Signals stemming from the regulator framework in force prior to Resolution 2090/2014\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nRespondent argues that at the time Claimant acquired its Mining Titles between May 2010 and April 2012, Red Eagle knew that there was a substantial risk that they would overlap with the final delimitation of the Paramo, and that the Aquaprocesos Report prepared by Mr. Franco in December 2009 identified this risk.2 Moreover, Respondent points out that, long before Red Eagle was even incorporated, under the 2001 Mining Code (the \"Mining Code) Colombia had already signaled that it could prohibit mining in certain areas for environmental considerations, and that in 2002, through Judgement C-339, the Colombian Constitutional Court specifically identified p\u00e1ramo ecosystems as one of the types of areas in which the Colombian legislature was likely to enact a ban on mining in the future.3\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b62 and 8.\n\n*Id,* \u00b6 10.\n\n9.\n\nLaw 1382, enacted in 2010, amended the Mining Code and specified for the first time that p\u00e1ramo ecosystems could be declared mining exclusion zones (Mining Exclusion Zones). However, Article 3 thereof (that amended Article 34 of the Mining Code), did not establish itself a prohibition of mining activities in p\u00e1ramo areas.4\n\nLaw 1382/2010, September 2010, (Exhibit C-655), Article 3.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent concedes that according to Law 1382, restrictions in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and national parks would apply insofar as three requirements were met: (i) restrictions would only apply to areas delimited by the competent environmental authority *\"based on technical, environmental and social studies\";* (ii) for a restriction to apply the Ministry of Mines and Energy should issue a previous non-binding opinion approving the restriction; and (iii) restrictions would apply to mining titles (x) issued after Law 1382 was enacted (this is, after February 9, 2010); (y) that did not have an environmental license or equivalent; and (z) where no construction, mounting and exploitation activities had been undertaken.5\n\n*Id. See* also CI. Mem., \u00b6 57; CI. Reply, \u00b6 103; Resp. C-Mem., Section III.G; and CI. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n11.\n\nThus, Law 1382 was a forward-looking regulation; though it contemplated the possibility that the competent authorities could establish new Mining Exclusion Zones, it also established that their identification and delineation would be subject to a number of requirements. In any case, Law 1382 fell short from identifying specific areas within the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem subject to a mining ban. Additionally, it established a transitional or \"grandfathering\" regime in respect of mining titles issued prior to February 9, 2010, which had an environmental license or equivalent\n\n12.\n\nOn the other hand, Colombia had a tradition of balancing the protection of property rights and environmental considerations. In fact, Colombia\u2019s Constitution protects both property rights and the right to engage in mining as well as the right to the environment and does not contain a specific prohibition on mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.6 Also, Law 99 of 1993, setting forth the principles of Colombian environmental policy, did not contain any specific prohibition on mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.7 Moreover, although Resolution 769 of 2002 provided for a study of the p\u00e1ramos, it did not establish any mining prohibition.8\n\nColombian Constitution, (Exhibit C-565), Articles 58, 79,80 and 360. See also Hearing Tr. Day 3 (English) 698:11-14 (De Vivero Cross).\n\nSee Hearing Tr. Day 3 (English) 700:3-5 (De Vivero Cross).\n\nCI. PHB, \u00b619 and Hearing Tr. Day 3 (English) 705:7-12 (De Vivero Cross).\n\n13.\n\nConsistently with the above-mentioned principles, although Article 36 of the Mining Code allows for the retroactive effect of environmental regulations, it also states that compensation is payable in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution if the investor suffers a loss of an acquired right.9\n\nArticle 36 of the Mining Code (Exhibit C-570) and Article 58 of the Colombian Constitution. (Exhibit C-565) See also, Eco *Oro Minerals Corp. v. The Republic of Colombia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, September 9, 2021, (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6\u00b6 469-476. (\"Eco *Oro v. Colombia* or \"Eco *Oro\").*\n\n14.\n\nIn its submissions, Respondent also draws attention to the fact that through the *Atlas de P\u00e1ramos de Colombia* (the 2007 IAVH P\u00e1ramos Atlas or the IAVH Atlas), published in May 2007, investors should have been put on notice by Colombia of the areas that could be considered to form part of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem. Though the IAVH Atlas was prepared on a large scale of 1:400.000, Mr. Franco relied on this Atlas in the Aquaprocesos Report and concluded that three Mining Titles fell within the p\u00e1ramos as mapped by the IAVH Atlas.10\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 11.\n\n15.\n\nRespondent also emphasizes that the IAVH Atlas, although not binding, was prepared as part of a long-running effort from the Ministry of the Environment to acquire knowledge about the p\u00e1ramos and was the official cartography designated by the Colombian legislature as a minimum reference for the ban on mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Ms. Baptiste also explained in her witness testimony that the *Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Alexander Von Humboldt* (IAVH) had prepared a map on 1:250.000 scale that was available upon request.11\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Witness Statement of Ms. Baptiste, \u00b6 26: fn 12.\n\n16.\n\nHowever, regardless of the discussion on whether the 1:400.000 scale of the IAVH Atlas was adequate or not for precising the extent to which Claimant\u2019s Mining Titles could eventually overlap the SP, it is a fact that the Atlas itself did not prohibit mining in any of the areas identified therein nor established any Mining Exclusion Zones, as recognized by Respondent\u2019s witness, Ms. Baptiste.12\n\nCI. PHB, \u00b619 and Hearing Tr. Day 2 (English) 480:7-10 (Baptiste Cross).\n\n17.\n\nAs explained above, Law 1382 was forward looking, did not establish any mining prohibition in respect of specific areas and set forth several requirements applying to the declaration and delimitation of Mining Exclusion Zones that had not been met at the time Red Eagle acquired its Mining Titles.13\n\nSee Ministry of Mines and Energy Concept 2011-05791 of September 27, 2011 (Exhibit C-669). See also Eco *Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6\u00b6 479 et seq.\n\n18.\n\nColombia\u2019s Constitutional Court declared Law 1382 unconstitutional because the government had failed to carry out community consultations. Shortly thereafter, Colombia enacted Law 1450 of 2011 which prohibited mining activities in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and tasked the Ministry of the Environment with the responsibility of delimiting the p\u00e1ramos on the basis of economic, technical, environmental and social studies. It established a process for delimiting p\u00e1ramo Mining Exclusion Zones at a scale of 1:25.000, a scale more than ten times more precise than the IAVH Atlas. Law 1450 was also forward looking as it referred to future delimitations. Moreover, as recognized by the Head of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Mines and Energy in a letter of September 2011, at that time the requirements for delimiting the p\u00e1ramos had not been met.14\n\nLaw 1450 of June 16, 2011 (Exhibit C-576) and Ministry of Mines and Energy Concept 2011-05791 of September 27, 2011 (Exhibit C-669). See also Cl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 61-63, Cl. Reply, \u00b6 139 and Cl. PHB, \u00b6 19.\n\n19.\n\nResolution 937 of 2011 of the Ministry of the Environment adopted the cartography elaborated by the IAVH at a scale of 1:250.000 for identifying p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, and stated that delimitations made by the authorities would be given legal effect *provided that the* scale of the map was equal or more detailed than 1:25.000 (ten times more detailed as provided by Law 1450). This Resolution also fell short of determining the existence of any Mining Exclusion Zones, which had to be expressly established following the requirements set forth by Law 1382.15\n\nResolution 937 of May 25,2011 (Exhibit R-11). See also Cl. PHB, \u00b6 19 and Eco *Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6\u00b6 485 et seq.\n\n20.\n\nIt has been evidenced that Claimant\u2019s process of acquisition, transfer and registration of the Mining Titles, involved 22 separate approvals from Colombian authorities for its 11 Mining Titles during the course of four years between 2010 and 2013.16 Red Eagle filed environmental guidelines for 5 titles permitting it to carry out exploratory work. Six of the Mining Titles acquired by Claimant already had Planes de Manejo Ambiental (\"PMAs) and it requested the authorities to transfer to it those 6 PMAs. The authorities approved the transfer of the PMAs for 4 Mining Titles while the approval of the transfer of the PMAs for the 2 other titles remains pending without Colombia having stated any reasons for its inaction.17\n\nColombia approved the transfer of all 11 Mining Titles between May 2010 and April 2012 and their registration between June 2010 and October 2013. See Cl. Reply, \u00b6 502 and Cl. Rej., \u00b6 52.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 93 and 504, and Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. See also Resolution 517 (Exhibit C-644).\n\n21.\n\nIt has also been evidenced that Colombia granted Red Eagle the permissions required to protect existing rights associated with several Mining Titles, while authorizing a suspension of exploitation activities, so Claimant could continue with remediation activities and conduct detailed exploratory work. The record shows that Colombia also continued to approve the transfer of PMAs to Red Eagle after Resolution 937 and Law 1450 were enacted, even though the *Corporaci\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma Regional para la Defensa de la Meseta de Bucaramanga* (CDMB) knew that the Mining Titles in question could eventually form part of p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Moreover, in 2012, the Colombian authorities approved the conversion of exploitation licenses over several Mining Titles into concession contracts, and in 2015 Colombia granted 5 Concession Contracts to Red Eagle.18\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 141 and 502, and Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent argued that these signals lacked relevance by clarifying that the CDMB had warned Red Eagle that mining exploration and exploitation was prohibited in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, as identified in the IAVH Atlas, but that it had no authority to stop such activities until a final delimitation was completed. Respondent also points out that, between August 2011 and May 2013, when the CDMB approved the assignment of the PMAs associated to 4 Mining Titles, it warned Red Eagle that it would have to modify the PMAs prior to commencing with exploitation activities, and that any intended mining activities would have to take into account any restrictions resulting from the overlapping with the SP.19\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 20 and 24.\n\n23.\n\nRespondent adds that in December 2011, the *Agenda Nacional de Miner\u00eda* (ANM) alerted Red Eagle that it would not be able to process its *derecho de preferencia* application with regards to the areas in the Mining Titles overlapping the p\u00e1ramo areas, and that following the delimitation made in December 2014 by Resolution 2090 (as defined below), the ANM explicitly stated that mining was not permitted in areas of the titles overlapping the Preservation Area (as defined below) created by said resolution.20\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 26.\n\n24.\n\nFinally, Respondent states that the Colombian authorities never represented to Red Eagle that its Mining Titles would be exempted from mining prohibitions related to the p\u00e1ramos, and that it had never given an authorization to develop a large -scale mining project in those areas.21\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 28-36.\n\n2.3. Signals stemming from Colombia's actions after the issuance of Resolution 2090/2014\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nResolution 2090 of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of December 19, 2014 (Resolution 2090) delimited the SP for the first time, establishing a Mining Exclusion Zone over the P\u00e1ramo.22\n\nResolution of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development No. 2090 of December 19, 2014 (Exhibit C-580).\n\n26.\n\nAlthough in Section 4 below I will review in more detail the implications and impact of Resolution 2090, this resolution imposed a ban and restriction on mining activities in respect of certain areas that until then had not been specifically delimited as Mining Exclusion Zones or subject to other restrictions.\n\n27.\n\nResolution 2090 distinguished two situations: (i) p\u00e1ramo or Preservation Areas identified in green and (ii) Restoration Areas identified in yellow.\n\n28.\n\nIn the Preservation Areas, (i) as from February 9, 2010, new concession contracts would be prohibited as well as the granting of mining titles or environmental licenses authorizing mining activities in those areas, but (ii) mining activities covered by concession contracts or mining titles, with an environmental license or environmental control instrument or equivalent environmental management *[manejo ambiental)* granted prior to February 9, 2010, would be able to continue until their expiration, with no possibility of extension, subject to strict control by the mining and environmental authorities.23\n\nResolution 2090, Article 5 (Exhibit C-580).\n\n29.\n\nThe Restoration Areas, although part of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem identified in the IAVH Atlas, were not part of the Exclusion Mining Zone, but were considered to be functionally linked to the SP. In the Restoration Areas, mining activities could be authorized subject to applicable environmental regulations and management plans ensuring that these activities would not expose to risk the conservation of the SP.24\n\nResolution 2090, Article 9 (Exhibit C-580).\n\n30.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Article 5 of Resolution 2090 provided for the grandfathering of existing rights, such that mining activities were allowed to continue in areas corresponding to mining titles and environmental licenses or their equivalent that were issued prior to February 9, 2010.25\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 45.\n\n31.\n\nWhile Claimant characterizes the scope of the aforementioned grandfathering on the basis of the existing titles, according to Colombia, the grandfathering did not apply to the title *per se,* but to pre-existing \"activities\". Thus, the right to exploit would only materialize when a PMA or environmental license was granted or approved for a specific activity. Since Red Eagle's Vetas Project (the \"Project\") comprised a large-scale integrated project with activities that according to Colombia were not covered by an environmental license or equivalent issued prior to February 9, 2010 (Red Eagle never conducted activities pursuant to the PMAs associated to 6 of its Mining Titles and 5 of the Titles did not have any environmental license or equivalent), Colombia argues that the Project was not grandfathered.26\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 109 et seq., and Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 77-86.\n\n32.\n\nI will address the implications of the aforementioned matter when analyzing the impact of Colombia\u2019s measures on Red Eagle\u2019s investment in Section 4 below. In any event, regardless of the issue relating to the scope of the grandfathering provided by Article 5 of Resolution 2090 and Law 1382, it is a fact that Resolution 2090 implied a change in the applicable rules by creating for the first time a Mining Exclusion Zone in the SP in areas that were found to overlap Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles and establishing restrictions in adjacent areas; this is, the Restoration Areas.\n\n33.\n\nOn June 9, 2015, Colombia enacted Law 1753 (Law 1753). Article 173 thereof prohibited mining in areas delimited as p\u00e1ramos. It mandated the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Ministry of the Environment) to delimit the p\u00e1ramo areas within the area defined by the IAVH Atlas at a scale of 1:100.000 or 1:25.000 when available on the basis of technical, environmental, social and economic criteria. It also provided for the grandfathering of mining exploration and exploitation activities with a contract and environmental license or instrument of environmental control and management issued prior to February 9, 2010.27\n\nLaw 1753, Article 173 (Exhibit C-17).\n\n34.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether Law 1753 banned mining in the Restoration Areas. According to Claimant, the text of Article 173 *\"generated uncertainty by banning mining within the interior of the area delimited as p\u00e1ramo (potentially also within Restoration Areas).28* Colombia disagrees, and states that mining is not allowed in *\"areas delimited as p\u00e1ramos,* that the only areas delimited as such by Resolution 2090 were the Preservation Areas, and when referring to Restoration Areas Article 9 thereof states that they are *\"functionally linked* to, but not part of the SP.29 This circumstance would confirm that the entire p\u00e1ramo area identified in the IAVH Atlas did not coincide with what became the Mining Exclusion Zone *(i.e.,* the Preservation Areas) under Resolution 2090.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 47.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89.\n\n35.\n\nIn any case, on February 8, 2016, the Colombian Constitutional Court issued Judgement C-3530 (\"Judgement C-35) that held that the transitional regime established by Law 1753 was unconstitutional *\"because it determined that allowing mining activities to continue in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems did not fully protect the p\u00e1ramos from the harmful effects of the extraction of non-renewable natural resources.31*\n\nConstitutional Court Judgement C-35 (Exhibit C-18), pp. 143-144.\n\nResp. PHB. \u00b6 92.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent concedes that the elimination of the grandfathering regime of Law 1753 meant that Article 5 of Resolution 2090 lost its *base legal* (statutory foundation) and as a result ceased to be in force.32\n\nI*d.*\n\n37.\n\nColombia argues that the elimination of the grandfathering regime of Law 1753 (and by extension, Resolution 2090) had no practical effect on the Project because it was never grandfathered. Although I will return to this matter in Section 4 when analyzing the impact of Colombia's measures, it is nevertheless a fact that Judgement C-35 implied a new change of rules for the mining sector and of criteria to the extent it held that environmental protections prevailed over the acquired rights of private parties.33\n\nJudgement C-35 (Exhibit C-18), pp. 125-126, 142, 222-223.

PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\n38.\n\nSubsequent to the issuance of Judgement C-35, the ANM sent several notices to Claimant enforcing the ban on portions of several of the Mining Titles that overlapped the SP.34\n\nANM letter to Minera Vetas regarding Real Minera, dated May 17, 2016 (Exhibit C-21); ANM Letter to Minera Vetas regarding La Tr\u00edada de Oro, dated May 17, 2016 (Exhibit C-490); and ANM Technical Concept No. 168 relating to La Vereda, dated August 25, 2016 (Exhibit C-727).\n\n39.\n\nOn May 30, 2017 Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court issued Judgment T-361 (\"Judgement T-361) which held Resolution 2090 to be unconstitutional and ordered the Ministry of the Environment to issue a new delimitation within one year.35 The Constitutional Court found that the aforementioned Ministry had not conducted an adequate and effective consultation process, and ordered it to cure the defect by holding an appropriate consultation process at the end of which a new delimitation of the SP should be published. The Constitutional Court also ruled that the new delimitation should be more expansive. However, no precisions were given as to what this meant in terms of whether the new demarcation should cover additional land or different areas or take a different form.36\n\nJudgement T-361 of May 30, 2017 (Exhibit C-22), pp. 248, 283.\n\n*Id, pp.* 262-263 and 282-284.\n\n40.\n\nThe Parties agree that Resolution 2090 remains in force. However, to date, after more than six years, Colombia has failed to issue a new delimitation of the SP as ordered by Judgement T-361. This situation increased the legal uncertainty, and as explained below, prevented in practice any subsequent mining activities and the CDMB from issuing approvals and other decisions in relation to the Claimant's Mining Titles.\n\n41.\n\nIn this regard, the record shows that following the issuance of the aforementioned judgment, the CDMB and ANM sent notices to Claimant identifying areas of the Mining Titles that could not be mined on grounds of the need to wait for a final delimitation of the SP, including also portions of Restoration Areas.37 In addition, the CDMB failed to approve the transfer of PMAs of two titles due to the same reasons,38 and the authorities also refused to allow Red Eagle to retain portions of its Mining Titles that could not be economically exploited, thus risking forfeiture of the title.39\n\nANM letter to Minera Vetas in relation to Real Minera of August 31, 2017, (Exhibit 020).

Claimant\u2019s Due Diligence\n-----------------------------\n\n44.\n\nClaimant argues that it undertook an extensive due diligence in support of its investment decision. This includes the hiring of legal, technical and environmental experts to establish the compliance of Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles with the existing mining regulations, and their conclusion was that the compliance with such standards permitted the development of a large-scale project.43 In that regard, Claimant notes that it worked with the Colombian law firm Cardenas & Cardenas, which examined the legal status of each of the Mining Titles that Red Eagle considered acquiring. According to Claimant, this shows that it considered the possible implications of Law 1382 for the creation of Mining Exclusion Zones in the future, as well as the requirements for such purpose, and that Respondent\u2019s legal expert affirmed that no delimitation of the P\u00e1ramo for the purpose of creating an Exclusion Mining Zone had been completed until Resolution 2090 in December 2014.44\n\nCl.

Day 3 (English) 711:4-736:18; and 749:19-751:8 (De Vivero Cross).\n\n45.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert confirmed that at the time of acquisition of Red Eagle's Mining Titles there was no official mining exclusion for those areas, that the IAVH Atlas only constituted a preliminary approximation of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem and did not offer sufficient detail for the creation of mining exclusion zones.45 Claimant\u2019s witness Ms. Vasquez testified that she met the Minister of Mines and various Colombian officials to understand the scope of the law and that *the conclusion we reached at that point was that all titles that had been granted before this law [Law 1382] would continue with their operation.46*\n\nHearing Tr.

(Vasquez Cross).\n\n46.\n\nMr. Franco, the author of the 2009 diligence report that was later hired by Claimant, testified that the titles were accompanied by the necessary exploitation licenses, and that various titles had PMAs; and that this gave Claimant reasonable grounds to believe that environmental permits could be transferred, as most were, and that it could submit new environmental guidelines for those titles that lacked environmental management plans.47\n\nAquaprocesos Diligence Memorandum (Exhibit c-603); Hearing Tr. Day 2 (Spanish) 438: 15-16 (Franco Direct). See also Cl. PHB, \u00b6 29.\n\n47.\n\nClaimant contends that it also commissioned technical due diligence reports that conformed to the stringent National Instrument 43-101 standard that regulates disclosure of information related to mineral projects that are governed by Canadian securities laws, and they confirmed the viability of Red Eagle's project.48\n\n*See* Cl. PHB, \u00b6 30.\n\n48.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimant\u2019s assertions on the due diligence it conducted. First, it argues that in the Aquaprocesos Report, Mr. Franco warned Red Eagle, among other matters that the titles under assessment were located in a p\u00e1ramo system, that the p\u00e1ramos would be identified in accordance with the IAVH Atlas and that three of the titles overlapped the SP. Noting that the IAVH Atlas was not a definitive delimitation, Respondent points out that Mr. Franco recommended Red Eagle to consult lngeominas, the IAHV and the Ministry of the Environment as well as legal counsel.49\n\nAquaprocesos Diligence Memorandum (Exhibit c-603), pp. 24-26. See also Resp. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n49.\n\nRespondent noted that in her testimony, Ms. V\u00e1squez was unable to provide documentary evidence of her purported meetings with government officials.50\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n50.\n\nRespondent also noted that the opinion of the Cardenas & Cardenas law firm did not actually advise Red Eagle on the implications of the mining ban on the Project, and that it did not contain a meaningful analysis of Law 1382, still less any specific advice on its impact on the Project. Respondent characterizes the aforementioned opinion as merely having paraphrased Law 1382 at a high level and omitted to advise on a number of relevant issues, including the ability to obtain compensation under Article 58 of the Colombian Constitution or whether the existing PMAs could be modified to accommodate a large-scale project. Respondent notes that at the hearing Ms. V\u00e1squez confirmed that the Cardenas & Cardenas law firm was not even asked to advise on whether any activities different from those covered in the existing PMAs would be permitted.51\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 44 and Hearing Tr. Day 2 (English) 327:15-20 (Vasquez Cross).\n\n51.\n\nRespondent also contends that the Cardenas & Cardenas opinion includes some errors and that Red Eagle failed to produce certain documents related to its due diligence, and thus that the Tribunal should conclude that no further documents related to its due diligence exist.52\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.\n\n52.\n\nIn my view, Claimant's due diligence should be evaluated against the backdrop of the regulatory framework described in Section 2.2 above, including the absence of existing Mining Exclusion Zones over any of the areas of the Mining Titles at the time Red Eagle acquired the same, Colombia's policy of grandfathering and the lack of specific delimitation of the SP until December 2014 after Red Eagle had completed the acquisition of its Mining Titles.53\n\nSee Eco Oro *v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 499.\n\n53.\n\nAlthough the IAVH Atlas identified the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem in 2007, it did so at a very large scale which lacked the necessary precision to make a final determination on the extent to which the Mining Titles of Red Eagle overlapped with the SP.54 After the publication of the IAVH Atlas in 2007, Colombia took more than seven years until it formally delimited for the first time the SP through Resolution 2090.\n\nThe fact that, as Respondent concedes, the Restoration Areas did not form part of the SP, would confirm that the entire area identified in the IAVH Atlas did not coincide with what became a Mining Exclusion Zone (i.e the Preservation Areas).\n\n54.\n\nIn my opinion, considering the regulations in force at the relevant time and in the absence of defined Mining Exclusion Zones when Red Eagle acquired its titles, Colombia\u2019s position requiring Red Eagle to anticipate future regulatory changes and the delimitation of the SP is unsupported. In fact, such position, if upheld, would have led, in practice, to a total freeze of all mining investments in the region. Colombia\u2019s general statements and regulations as to environmental protection could not reasonably be considered to have alerted Red Eagle to very specific issues associated to the delimitation of the SP and the scope of future potential restrictions, as well as to the uncertainty created by the measures and actions of the Colombian authorities that followed Resolution 2090. In my opinion, Colombia's position implies shifting onto the investor the responsibility for constantly anticipating potential changes in the regulations and governmental delays in the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos.\n\n55.\n\nIn the same vein, the *Eco Oro* tribunal stated that:\n\n*\"If Eco Oro should have been aware of the presence of p\u00e1ramo, surely all parts of the State machinery should also have been aware: the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo was first identified as p\u00e1ramo as early as 1851. If Eco Oro Is to be criticised for not understanding the potential implications of generalised statements as to environmental protection on the scope and validity of its concession rights, prior to entering into the Concession, so too should Colombia. Colombia should have understood that It should not grant concession rights over such environmentally sensitive land. If the State did not have this foresight, it cannot be right to expect Eco Oro to have had it.\"55*\n\n*Eco Oro v. Colombia,* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 695.\n\n56.\n\nThe *Eco Oro* tribunal further concluded that:\n\n*\"Eco Oro could not have anticipated through due diligence the immense confusion in the applicable legal regime created by the contradictory State decisions and changing positions of different State organs, including from the highest courts of the land, on vital State and international environmental matters, such as the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo, impacting on a natural resource invaluable for Colombia and the World.56*\n\n*Id,* \u00b6 696.\n\n57.\n\nMoreover, the fact that, at the time of acquisition by Red Eagle of its Mining Titles, the Constitution of Colombia imposed the need to balance environmental protection with property rights and that Colombia's regulatory framework actively provided for the development of the mining activity and included grandfathering provisions protecting existing projects, created a reasonable expectation that regulatory changes affecting existing rights would be subject to compensation.57\n\n*Id,* \u00b6\u00b6 476 and 768.\n\n2.5. Conclusions in relation to the Regulatory Framework and the Parties' conduct\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nIn my opinion, the signals from the regulatory framework and Colombia's actions and omissions were mixed and unclear.\n\n59.\n\nOn the one hand, the delimitation of the SP was uncertain until Resolution 2090 was issued in December 2014.\n\n60.\n\nAs explained above, Law 1382/2010 specified for the first time that p\u00e1ramo ecosystems could be declared Mining Exclusion Zones. However, it did not establish itself a prohibition of mining in p\u00e1ramo areas.58\n\nSee Eco *Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 496.\n\n61.\n\nMoreover, the text of Law 1382 evidences that it was forward looking. Although it contemplated the possibility that the competent authorities could establish new Mining Exclusion Zones, not only their identification and delineation was subject to specific requirements, but also the law did not identify specific areas within the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem subject to a mining ban. In this regard, there is reasonable evidence on the record that, at the time Red Eagle acquired its Mining Titles, no Mining Exclusion Zone had been approved in respect of the areas covered by said titles.59\n\nSee *Id,* \u00b6 499.\n\n62.\n\nThe IAVH Atlas was published in 2007, and it generally identified p\u00e1ramo areas. The scale used by the cartography was very large (1:400.000) (as evidenced by the fact that subsequent regulations required the delimitations to be made using a much more precise scale), and though it gave a general idea as to the location of the p\u00e1ramos and potential overlapping of Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles with p\u00e1ramo areas, it did not constitute a definitive delimitation and was insufficient to establish with precision the details and form of the areas located within the SP. This is proven by the fact that subsequent regulations required delimitations to be carried out with a much accurate scale and stated that the IAVH Atlas would only serve as a minimum reference. Moreover, insofar Resolution 2090 did not include the Restoration Areas within the SP (and only established that they would be only *\"funcionalmente vinculadas\"* to the SP60), this would confirm the lack of coincidence of the areas identified by the IAVH Atlas as part of the SP with the delimitation made by Resolution 2090.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 88.\n\n63.\n\nIt should also be considered that the IAVH Atlas did not contain any prohibition to mining activities, and Colombia delayed more than seven years until it formally delimited the paramos for the first time in December 2014 through Resolution 2090. Colombia\u2019s criticism to Red Eagle for allegedly having ignored the signals stemming from the IAVH Atlas of 2007, would imply that even in the absence of the existence of a Mining Exclusion Zone (required by the regulatory framework to ban mining activities) over the areas of its Mining Titles, Claimant and other investors in a similar situation should have frozen investments and activities during such period.\n\n64.\n\nLaw 1450 of 2011 was enacted after the Constitutional Court of Colombia declared unconstitutional Law 1382. Although it prohibited mining activities in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems and tasked the Ministry of the Environment to delimit the p\u00e1ramos, it was also forward looking as it referred to future delimitations. In fact, as explained above, there is evidence in the record that the Head of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Mining and Energy recognized in a letter of September 2011 that the requirements for delimiting the p\u00e1ramos had not been met.\n\n65.\n\nResolution 937 of 2011 of the Ministry of the Environment adopted the cartography elaborated by the IAVH at a scale of 1:250.000 for identifying p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, and provided that delimitations made by the authorities would be given legal effect when the scale of the map was equal or more detailed than 1:25.000 (ten times more detailed as provided by Law 1450). This Resolution did not declare any Mining Exclusion Zones.\n\n66.\n\nIn addition, in my view, Article 36 of the Mining Code does not support Colombia\u2019s position regarding what should have been the Claimant\u2019s expectations. Although such provision allows the retroactive application of environmental regulations, it also requires compensation in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution of Colombia if the investor suffers a loss of an acquired right.\n\n67.\n\nIt has also been evidenced that Colombia issued several signals of approval. During the course of three years between 2010 and 2012, the authorities issued 22 approvals in relation to 11 Mining Titles. Red Eagle also sought and obtained the approval for the transfer of PMAs in relation to 4 Mining Titles, some of which took place after the enactment of Resolution 937 and Law 1450. Colombia qualified the relevance of these approvals and pointed out that the CDMB had warned Red Eagle that mining was prohibited in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems (although it recognized it had no authority to stop such activities until a final delimitation was made), and that Claimant would have to modify the PMAs prior to commencing exploitation activities as well as taking into account any restrictions resulting from overlapping the SP. Nevertheless, none of these circumstances reasonably suggested the outcome that resulted from the compounded impact of Resolution 2090, Law 1753, Judgement C-35, Judgement T-361 and the subsequent communications sent by the Colombian authorities which, in practice, impaired mining in the entirety of Claimant\u2019s Mining Titles.\n\n68.\n\nResolution 2090 delimited the SP for the first time in December 2014. Resolution 2090 implied a change in the rules by creating also for the first time a Mining Exclusion Zone in the SP in areas overlapping Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles and establishing restrictions in adjacent areas; this is, the Restoration Areas.\n\n69.\n\nIn June 2015, Colombia enacted Law 1753 that introduced changes to the grandfathering rules established by Resolution 2090. It also created some uncertainty as to whether it also banned mining in the Restoration Areas established by Resolution 2090.\n\n70.\n\nIn any event, Judgement C-35 of February 2016 declared Law 1753 unconstitutional and, as admitted by Colombia, this deprived the grandfathering regime created by Article 5 of Resolution 2090 from its statutory foundation. Regardless of the discussion of the extent, if any, of the practical effect of Judgment C-35 on the Project, it is clear that it implied a new change of the rules in the sector.\n\n71.\n\nIn May 2017, Colombia\u2019s Constitutional Court, by means of Judgement T-361, declared Resolution 2090 to be unconstitutional and ordered a new delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos to take place within one year without giving any precisions on the criteria of the new delimitation. This delay created further uncertainty. After more than six years Colombia has not yet issued a new delimitation of the SP as ordered by said judgement.\n\n72.\n\nJudgement T-361 was not without consequence. As explained above, subsequently, the CDMB and ANM sent notices to Claimant identifying areas of the Mining Titles that could not be mined on grounds of the need to wait for a final delimitation of the SP, affecting also portions of Restoration Areas. The CDMB failed to approve the transfer of PMAs of two titles due to those same reasons. The authorities also refused to allow Red Eagle to retain portions of its Mining Titles that could not be economically exploited, thus risking forfeiture of the title. The unavoidable consequence of these actions was a paralysis of any mining activity in Red Eagle\u2019s titles.\n\n73.\n\nIn fact, these communications aggravated the situation of uncertainty created by the sequence of Resolution 2090, Law 1753, Judgement C-35 and Judgement T-361. As a result of the compounded practical effect of the aforementioned legislative and regulatory changes and the letters from the authorities, Claimant could not to carry out any mining activity in the entirety of the Mining Titles, including the Restoration Areas.\n\n74.\n\nThe above shows that Colombia repeatedly changed its policies and rules, significantly altering the pre-existing balance between mining development and environmental concerns included and recognized in Colombia\u2019s regulatory framework in effect at the time the Claimant acquired the Mining Titles.\n\n75.\n\nMoreover, it is also a proven fact that Colombia had a legal obligation to delineate the p\u00e1ramos and to do so with precision on the basis of technical, environmental, social and economic studies as required by applicable law and court orders.61 As of this date, the delimitation has not been approved. This failure is at the center of the dispute before this Tribunal.\n\nSee *Eco Oro v. Colombia,* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 766.\n\n76.\n\nAs pointed out by the *Eco Oro* tribunal, in a case involving substantially the same measures, it does not appear reasonable to require Claimant to anticipate the change in the policies and rules, and to exercise a due diligence that Colombia itself did not exercise when granting mining titles over environmentally sensitive areas.62 In fact, it has been evidenced that Colombia approved the assignment and registration of Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles, and subsequently the transfer of PMAs in several titles knowing that they were located in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem, even after the IAVH Atlas was published in 2007, although a final delimitation of the SP had not yet occurred. Colombia did not deregister any of the 5 Mining Titles that did not have PMAs.63\n\n*Eco Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6\u00b6 695-696 and 766.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 137.\n\n3. Whether Claimant had Vested Rights\n-------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nClaimant argues that pursuant to its Mining Titles it acquired the right to explore and exploit the minerals in the subsoil of those areas.64\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n78.\n\nAs explained above, Claimant contends that Colombia recognized these rights in relation to the process of acquisition, transfer and registration of its 11 Mining Titles, which, during the course of four years, involved 22 separate approvals from the Colombian authorities. Claimant also observes that Colombia approved the transfer of PMAs for 4 titles, granted permissions to protect its existing rights by authorizing a suspension of exploitation activities until Red Eagle could continue remediation activities and exploratory work, and in 2015 granted 5 Concession Contracts.65\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 21-22 above.\n\n79.\n\nClaimant also points out that even in relation to the transfer of one of the PMAs which Colombia failed to approve, the ANM de *facto* recognized that the title could operate, by having requested the payment of insurances, the approval of the *Formato B\u00e1sico Minero,* and the approval of a revenue declaration, among others.66\n\nCl. PHB, Appendix ll, Response to Tribunal\u2019s Question No. 11.\n\n80.\n\nClaimant further argues that, as a result of its investments in the acquisition of the Mining Titles and transfer of vested rights, it was able to proceed with a \"systematic gold exploration program that did not exist on paper alone but involved actual investments, time and efforts in exploratory works.67 In that regard, according to Claimant, the need for an environmental approval does not change the nature of the vested right because those authorizations *\"accompany the right, but this does not mean that they give rise to the right, but, rather, they allow for its exercise.68*\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 35.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 15.\n\n81.\n\nColombia disagrees and argues that Red Eagle had no acquired or vested right to develop the Project because it never obtained the environmental authorization (whether a PMA or an environmental license) to allow its development. If anything, Red Eagle might have acquired a right to conduct small-scale exploitation activities in certain limited areas in accordance with the terms of their respective PMAs. Colombia also contends that even if Claimant had been deprived of an opportunity to apply for such a license it would have been exceedingly unlikely to obtain one.69\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 68 et seq.\n\n82.\n\nColombia explains that the grandfathering established by Article 5 of Resolution 2090 and Article 173 of Law 1753 only applies to *mining activities* conducted under concession contracts or mining titles, as well as environmental licenses or equivalent environmental control and management instruments, granted before February 9, 2010. According to Colombia, the Project was not covered by this grandfathering provisions because that project contemplated activities that were not mining activities contemplated under the existing PMAs or any environmental license issued prior to February 9, 2010, and moreover, Red Eagle never conducted any mining activities pursuant to the PMAs associated to 6 of the 11 Mining Titles because it focused on exploratory work that did not require any authorization.70\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\n83.\n\nColombia also states that the Project was not grandfathered because 5 of the 11 Mining Titles that comprised that project, including the flagship Real Minera, did not have any environmental license or equivalent instrument whatsoever.71\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 80.\n\n84.\n\nColombia further explains that the regulations, including Decree 1076 of 2015, do not allow the modification of an existing PMA to include additional activities when it intends to include activities subject to environmental licensing in areas not covered by the existing PMA.72 In such cases a new environmental license must be sought. Thus, irrespective of the scope of the grandfathering provisions, Red Eagle could not have possibly modified the existing PMAs to incorporate new activities subject to licensing requirement and would have inevitably required to apply for a new environmental license.73\n\nMinistry of Environment and Sustainable Development Decree 1076 of 2015 (Exhibit C-791).\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74 and 82.\n\n85.\n\nColombia further argues that, in any event, Red Eagle would have relinquished any rights under the existing PMAs when in 2015 it signed the Concession Contracts which expressly provide that mining was not allowed in the Preservation Areas of the SP.74\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 84.\n\n86.\n\nClaimant contests Colombia\u2019s affirmations in relation to the interpretation of Decree 1076 of 2015 and the impossibility to amend the existing PMAs in order to adapt them to an integrated project comprising the different Mining Titles. According to Claimant, title integration without the need of a new environmental license is possible.75 In support of its position, Claimant cites and quotes the testimony of both Claimant\u2019s and Respondent's witnesses, Mr. Franco and Mr. Pinz\u00f3n.76\n\nCl.

Based on the record, in my view, under the applicable regulatory framework, the holder of a mining title had the right to explore and exploit the minerals therein, although the exercise of this right would be subject to compliance with the applicable environmental regulations and the approval of an environmental license or equivalent environmental instrument.78 Thus, regardless of the outcome of any debate on which is the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of Decree 1076, at the inception of the Mining Titles, Red Eagle, as the holder thereof, had the right to apply for either (i) a modification of the existing PMAs to adapt them to a large-scale project such as the Project, or (ii) seek the issuance of a new environmental authorization or equivalent instrument covering the activities required for such project.\n\nSee Eco *Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6\u00b6 439 and 632.\n\n89.\n\nColombia argues that in any event it is *\"exceedingly unlikely that Red Eagle would have secured the required environmental authorization to develop the Vetas Gold Project.79* According to Colombia, *\"of the Mineral Resources which were rendered inaccessible, 90% of the Indicated and 33% of the Inferred Mineral Resources were open-pit resources. Open pit mining is highly environmentally destructive, and the only mooted open pit project in the p\u00e1ramo was abandoned due to social opposition and its impact on the p\u00e1ramo.80* Colombia further states that *\"there is not a single large-scale project licensed in the p\u00e1ramo, nor a single other company in the whole of Colombia even planning on pursuing an open-pit project in the p\u00e1ramo\".81*\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 75.\n\n*ld,* \u00b6 120.\n\n*ld,* \u00b6 121.\n\n90.\n\nColombia also states that SRK\u2019s declaration of open-pit mineral resources is untenable in light of the fact that Red Eagle was not expecting to mine them, and that \"Red *Eagle unequivocally stated in its Reply Memorial that it* was not *pursuing an open-pit mine.82*\n\n*ld,* \u00b6 122.\n\n91.\n\nClaimant disagrees with Respondent\u2019s views on these matters. Claimant denies having abandoned its plan for an open-pit mine and argues that the 2014 Technical Report prepared by SRK contemplated that Real Minera (the title containing all of the Project\u2019s valuable Indicated Resources) would be exploited via an open-pit (while other portions of the project would be exploited via underground mining methods), and estimated resources on that basis. While open-pit was a convenient method to exploit the Real Minera title, it was not the only method available to Red Eagle since the Real Minera mineralization could have been accessed via an underground method.83\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 94-96.\n\n92.\n\nClaimant further argues that Real Minera was an obvious target for an open-pit mining scenario because the material was *\"right there at surface.84*\n\n*Id,*\u00b696 and Hearing Tr. Day 4 (English) 788:1-7 (SRK Direct).\n\n93.\n\nIn addition to expressing its views on the reasons that supported its position that open-pit mining was viable, Claimant states that *\"it is undisputed that there is no ban on open pit mining in Colombia.85*\n\n*Id,*\u00b6\u00b697-99, and Hearing Tr. Day 4 (English) 902:10-20 (Rossi Cross). See also Cl. PHB, Appendix ll, Response to Tribunal's Questions Nos. 19 and 20.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant finally states that, in any case, foregoing the open-pit method would have resulted in the reduction of some of its mineral resources due to the increased costs of underground mining, but not their total elimination.86\n\nCl. PHB, Appendix ll, Response to Question 20.\n\n95.\n\nColombia argues that the authorities rejected an environmental application by Eco Oro in an area close to Claimant\u2019s Mining Titles due to its overlapping with the SP.87 This would confirm, in Respondent\u2019s view, that it was extremely unlikely that Red Eagle would have been able to obtain an environmental license for the Project.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 87-95.\n\n96.\n\nClaimant contends that after its environmental application was rejected, Eco Oro redeveloped its project as an underground mine and that Respondent has not offered any reason why the same could not have been done in relation to Red Eagle\u2019s Project. Claimant notes that at the Hearing, Respondent\u2019s expert, Mr. Rossi, conceded that in his report it had failed to take into account this possibility.88 The outcome of the *Eco Oro* case also casts queries on Colombia\u2019s arguments.89\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 95.\n\nSee Eco Oro v*.* Colombia (Exhibit CL-285).\n\n97.\n\nIn light of the aforementioned debate, it cannot be concluded with certainty that an application by Red Eagle to amend its PMAs to adapt to a large-scale project or a prospective application of a new environmental license or equivalent environmental instrument, would have been inevitably denied.90\n\nSee Eco Oro v. *Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 632.\n\n98.\n\nBased on its Mining Titles and considering the absence of any Mining Exclusion Zones over the areas covered thereby at the time of acquisition of said titles, Claimant had the right to explore and exploit mineral resources subject to obtaining the appropriate PMAs or equivalent environmental license.91 Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the compounded impact of Colombia\u2019s measures starting with Resolution 2090, and the uncertainty and confusion derived therefrom and from certain inconsistent measures and actions of Respondent, deprived Red Eagle of its ability to access a very substantial portion of the mineral resources in its Mining Titles, and also, at least, of the opportunity to either (i) amend the existing PMAs in relation to 4 titles and the 2 other PMAs whose transfer had been sought and the authorities failed to approve in order to adapt them to a large-scale integrated project such as the Project, and/or (ii) to apply for a new environmental license or equivalent environmental instrument covering the new activities in its Mining Titles to be undertaken in relation to the Project.\n\n*Id,*\u00b6 623.\n\n99.\n\nAs a result of Colombia\u2019s measures and actions it is a fact that Red Eagle lost the possibility to obtain any of those instruments in relation to any prospective activities within the Preservation Areas and the Restoration Areas.92\n\n*Id,*\u00b6\u00b6632-633.\n\n100.\n\nThe fact that these rights may be difficult to value cannot mean that there is no acquired right to the extent explained above. Determining their value is a separate and distinct matter.93\n\nSee Eco *Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 439.\n\n4. Impact of the Measures\n-------------------------\n\n101.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Colombia\u2019s measures caused Red Eagle to lose access to a significant majority of the gold reserves identified in its exploration work, in particular:\n\n\u2022 100% of the Indicated class mineral resources disclosed in the SRK 2014 Technical Report (the SRK 2014 Report) are within the P\u00e1ramo and restricted from mining.\n\n\u2022 99% of the entire resource is affected by the P\u00e1ramo delimitation and Restoration Area.\n\n\u2022 77% of the gold disclosed in the SRK 2014 Report is contained in the 3 most mineral rich Mining Titles and is within the P\u00e1ramo and restricted from mining.\n\n\u2022 66% of the total mineral resource of gold disclosed in the SRK 2014 Report is within the Paramo restriction.\n\n\u2022 51% of the total mineral resource of silver disclosed in the SRK 2014 Report is within the P\u00e1ramo restriction.94\n\nSRK 2014 Technical Report, \u00b6\u00b6 85-93 and Cl. PHB, \u00b652. See also Hearing Tr. Day 4 (English) 796:19-14 (SRK Direct).\n\n102.\n\nClaimant points out that Respondent did not challenge any of these conclusions, and that Colombia\u2019s expert, Mr. Rossi, confirmed during the Hearing that he does not dispute those conclusions.95\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 53; and Hearing Tr. Day 4 (English) 932:12-19 (Rossi Cross).\n\n103.\n\nRespondent does however challenge the weight of the 2014 SRK Report. According to Respondent, the mineral resources declared by the SRK 2014 Report, and in particular the Indicated Resources, \"are *illusory\" and \"there were never any reasonable prospects for eventual economical extraction.96*\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 116.\n\n104.\n\nRespondent argues that the SRK 2014 Report was prepared on the basis of assumptions which are both materially inaccurate and in direct contradiction with Red Eagle\u2019s contemporaneous knowledge of the relevant p\u00e1ramo risk. Moreover, Respondent points out that SRK testified that it was unaware of any risk associated with the protection of the paramos.97 Respondent contends that SRK's failure to conduct an independent analysis denotes lack of professionalism.98\n\n*Id.*\u00b6 117. See also Hearing Tr. Day 4 (English) 816:14-817:5 (Dishaw Cross).\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 119.\n\n105.\n\nRespondent also argues that the open-pit resources should not have been declared by the SRK 2014 Report because there was no prospect of them being developed, and that of the mineral resources which were rendered inaccessible, 90% of the Indicated and 33% of the Inferred mineral resources were open-pit.99\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 120. See also \u00b6\u00b6 89-96 above.\n\n106.\n\nRespondent further states that *\"if Red Eagle\u2019s licensing prospects were not zero, they would, at best, be exceedingly speculative.\"100*\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 137. See also \u00b6\u00b6 89-90 above.\n\n107.\n\nRespondent also contends that Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles were not rendered valueless by the measures taken by Colombia because they retained exploration potential.101 Claimant notes that on cross examination, Colombia\u2019s expert, Mr. Rossi, conceded that exploration targets cannot support an economic viability of the Project (which can only be based on Indicated and Measured Resources), and that he admitted that his analysis was based on the incorrect assumption that mining was permitted in the areas of the Project that were designated as Restoration Areas (yellow).102\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 112.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b654-56.\n\n108.\n\nIn relation to the impact of Respondent\u2019s measures that gave rise to the controversy, both Parties have addressed extensively in their submissions and at the Hearing the legal implications of the status of Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles and of the different laws, regulations, judgments and other actions of the authorities of Colombia. These arguments have been summarized in previous sections of this Dissenting Opinion.103 Hence, to avoid repetitions, I will only refer briefly to the respective positions of the Parties.\n\nSee Section 2 above.\n\n109.\n\nRespondent argues that the Project was not grandfathered by Resolution 2090 or Law 1753 because, among other reasons, it contemplated activities that were not mining activities conducted pursuant to an environmental license or equivalent instrument issued before February 9, 2010.104 Colombia also contends that the different measures had no practical implications on Red Eagle\u2019s rights nor on the acreage and development of the Project and did not introduce additional restrictions.105\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 77-86.\n\n*Id,*\u00b6\u00b6 87-105.\n\n110.\n\nClaimant focuses on the series of actions of Colombia's authorities recognizing the Mining Titles and the right to exploit associated thereto, on its ability to amend the existing PMAs or to apply for a new environmental license, as well as the repeated changes in the rules and regulatory criteria, and the uncertainties and confusion resulting from Resolution 2090, Law 1753, Judgment C-35, Judgment T-361 and the communications issued by the ANM and CDMB, and their practical effect of banning mining in the entirety of the areas covered by the Mining Titles.106\n\nSee Sections 2 and 3 above.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimant recognized in public presentations and in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A\") for the first quarter of 2016, after the issuance of Judgment C-35, that Colombia\u2019s measures had not affected the Project or its Mining Titles, and that it failed to write-off the Vetas Project.107 Respondent also cites the MD&A for the first quarter of 2018 in which Red Eagle stated that the company *\"will be able to progress the Vetas Gold property* and a presentation made by Mr Slater, Red Eagle\u2019s CEO, in a conference in Vancouver in May 2018 in which he did not mention that the Project had been destroyed by Colombia\u2019s measures.108\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 95-103. See also Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 463.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 103 and 109-111.\n\n112.\n\nClaimant responds to these arguments pointing out that Colombia continued to enforce the mining restrictions even after the Constitutional Court through Judgement T-361 ruled that Resolution 2090 that had delimited the p\u00e1ramos was unconstitutional. As a result of this ruling, and pending the final delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos as ordered by such Court, the authorities prohibited mining in the entirety of the Mining Titles of Red Eagle, even in the Restoration Areas (yellow), and refrained from approving any transfer or updating of PMAs. Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Dishaw, testified that they were under the impression that mining was only restricted in the Preservation Areas (green), but not in the Restoration Areas.109\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 57-60.\n\n113.\n\nRegardless of the divergent views of the Parties on most of the relevant issues, in my opinion, as explained above, the reiterated changes of rules imposed by Colombia since Resolution 2090, as well as the uncertainty and confusion derived therefrom and from the inconsistencies of some of these measures and actions, had the compounded effect of impeding Red Eagle to access a very substantial portion of the mineral resources in its Mining Titles. They also deprived Claimant, at least, of the opportunity to amend the existing PMAs to adapt them to a large-scale integrated project as the Project or to apply for a new environmental license or equivalent instrument for such a project.\n\n114.\n\nThe uncertainty associated to the fact that the viability of exploration projects, such as Claimant\u2019s activities, is confirmed at a later pre-feasibility or feasibility stage, and that their value is difficult to assess, does not mean that these projects do not have any value at all. These and the other uncertainties identified by Respondent such as those related to the viability of open-pit mining in the context of the p\u00e1ramos and its impact on the volume of recoverable mining resources, particularly the Indicated Resources, and the licensing risk of the Project, do have an impact on the value of Red Eagle's project and on the compensation payable to Claimant for having been deprived from the aforementioned loss of opportunity. This matter will be addressed in Section 6 below.\n\n5. Did Colombia Violate the Treaty?\n-----------------------------------\n\n5.1. Article 805 of the FTA\n---------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Parties discussed at length the issues relating to the scope of the minimum standard of treatment (\"MST). the extent to which such standard evolved and its convergence with the standard of fair and equitable treatment (\"FET). and in particular whether the MST encompasses protection of, *inter alia,* legitimate expectations and transparency.110 The Award has also summarized the positions of both Parties in Section VI.111\n\nCl. Mem. Section lll-B-1; Cl. Reply, Section IV -A-l; Resp. C-Mem, Section Vll-B; and Resp. Rej. Section Vlll-A.\n\nSee Award, Section Vl-B-1.\n\n116.\n\nArticle 805 requires each contracting party to:\n\n\"1. *Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*\n\n*2. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide \"fair and equitable treatment Includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings In accordance with the principle of due process.*\n\n*3.* A *determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.112*\n\nTreaty (Exhibit CL-1), Article 805.\n\n117.\n\nAs mentioned, the Parties disagree on the relationship between MST and FET. The starting point of the analysis should be the text of the Treaty.\n\n118.\n\nBy stating that the Contracting Parties must accord investments *\"treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment\",* Article 805 of the Treaty indicates that FET is considered part of international law. However, in clarifying this rule, paragraph 1 thereof specifies that the concept of fair and equitable treatment does *\"not require treatment In addition to beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*\n\n119.\n\nThis can only mean that FET is prescribed by Article 805 of the Treaty to the extent that standard of treatment is mandatory under the customary international law minimum standard.\n\n120.\n\nThe foregoing leads to the question of the content of the MST and of the FET obligation incorporated into it.\n\n121.\n\nIt is now broadly accepted that in light of the evolutionary character of the concept of the international law minimum standard of treatment, the high threshold test formulated almost a century ago in *Neer,113* is no longer the applicable standard. Thus, most tribunals reject the idea that today a breach of the MST can only be found in the presence of an \"outrageous\" behavior in *Neer* and its progeny.114\n\n*L.F.H.

Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6755.\n\n130.\n\nThus, although I share the view that the MST has evolved and is nowadays broader than the standard set out in *Neer,* in analyzing whether Colombia's conduct infringes Article 805 of the Treaty, I will not consider the FET as a standalone standard, but the minimum standard as described above without interpreting expansively Colombia\u2019s obligation thereunder.\n\n131.\n\nBased on the factual and regulatory background described in Sections 2 and 3 above, in my opinion, Red Eagle had legitimate expectations at the time it acquired the Mining Titles that: (i) it would be entitled to undertake exploration and exploitation activities in the areas covered thereby, including the right to apply for and pursue the issuance of the necessary environmental licenses or equivalent; (ii) in the event Colombia were to deprive it from any portion of such rights (including the right to adapt existing PMAs to a large-scale integrated project such as the Project or to apply for a new environmental license or equivalent for such purpose), compensation would be payable by Colombia; and (iii) Colombia would ensure a predictable legal framework for business planning and investments in the aforementioned activities.\n\n132.\n\nAs explained in Section 2, Colombia repeatedly changed its policies and rules governing the activities covered by Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles. Resolution 2090 of December 2014 implied a change in the rules by creating for the first time a Mining Exclusion Zone in areas overlapping with Claimant\u2019s Mining Titles and established restrictions in adjacent areas (Restoration Areas) also overlapping said titles. In June 2015, Colombia enacted Law 1753 that introduced changes to the grandfathering rules established by Resolution 2090. Some of the subsequent changes were inconsistent with previous changes, such as the case of Law 1753 and Judgment C-35. This judgement held that the transitional regime established by Law 1753 was unconstitutional because it considered that allowing mining activities to continue in the p\u00e1ramos did not protect the p\u00e1ramos from the harmful consequences of mineral extraction. Judgment C-35 not only implied a change of rules and of criteria to the extent it held that environmental protections prevailed over the acquired rights of investors, but moreover, by eliminating the grandfathering regime of Law 1753, it deprived Article 5 of Resolution 2090 of its statutory foundation, and as a consequence such regime ceased to be in force.126\n\nSee Sections 2.3 and 2.5 above.\n\n133.\n\nIn May 2017, Judgment T-361 implied a new change in the rules as it declared unconstitutional Resolution 2090 and ordered a new delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos to take place within one year.\n\n134.\n\nIn addition to the reiterated regulatory changes, through its constant omissions, actions and inconsistent behavior, Colombia created uncertainty, that coupled with the modifications of the rules, in practice, rendered unviable mining activities in the entirety of Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles, including in the Restoration Areas.127\n\n*Id.*\n\n135.\n\nAlthough the IAVH Atlas of 2007 contained a preliminary delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos at a large scale, Colombia delayed more than seven years until it delimited the p\u00e1ramos in December 2014 at a more precise scale through Resolution 2090. Colombia\u2019s fluctuating regulations created uncertainty and confusion, when, for example, Law 1753 cast doubts on whether it had banned mining also in the Restoration Areas. This situation worsened, when as explained, Judgement C-35 deprived the then existing grandfathering regime of its legal basis.128\n\n*Id.*\n\n136.\n\nThe uncertainty and confusion was compounded by Judgement T-361 when it declared Resolution 2090 to be unconstitutional and ordered a new delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos more expansive than the one set forth by Resolution 2090, but without giving any precisions as to what this meant in terms of whether the new demarcation should cover additional land or different areas or take a different form, thus affecting any planning on mining activities within Red Eagle\u2019s Mining Titles. Moreover, although Judgement T-361 ordered that the new delimitation be made within one year, after more than six years Colombia continues to fail to issue a new delimitation of the SP. Unsurprisingly, this uncertainty prevented mining in Red Eagle's Mining Titles as it led the mining authorities, pending delimitation of the SP, to issue notices halting any mining or to reject the approval of the transfer to Claimant of certain existing PMAs. The authorities also refused to allow Red Eagle to retain portions of its Mining Titles that could not be exploited in these circumstances, thus risking forfeiture of the title.129\n\n*Id.*\n\n137.\n\nThe aforementioned constant changes and sometimes contradictory decisions of the different authorities of Colombia, as well as the ensuing uncertainty, caused - *inter alia -* by its (continuing) delay to delimit the p\u00e1ramos, derived in what the Eco Oro tribunal characterized as a *\"regulatory roller-coaster\"* and a situation of *\"limbo\"* for mining investors.130\n\n*Eco Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6\u00b6 695-696, 791,806 and 814-815.\n\n138.\n\nIn my opinion, although there is no evidence that Colombia acted in bad faith, the confusion and uncertainty created by the aforementioned actions and omissions of Respondent, viewed as a whole, amount to a failure to ensure a predictable and stable regulatory framework in a way that constitutes gross unfairness and manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards. This is not a minor derogation of Colombia\u2019s international obligations nor a minor inconsistency or inadequacy of conduct, but a behavior that amounts to a failure to accord Red Eagle\u2019s investment a treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment as required by Article 805 of the Treaty.\n\n139.\n\nRespondent has argued throughout this arbitration that Claimant did not have legitimate expectations regarding the possibility of developing the Project, due to the absence of specific representations from the Colombian authorities that they would not impose a ban and/or restrictions on mining activities in the p\u00e1ramo areas covered by Red Eagle's Mining Titles, and the absence of a due diligence by Claimant that would have alerted it as to the existence of the risk of such ban on mining in the p\u00e1ramos.131\n\n*See* Section 2.4 above.\n\n140.\n\nIn Section 2.4 above, I addressed the issue of due diligence, and concluded that when evaluated against the backdrop of the regulatory framework in force when Red Eagle acquired the Mining Titles and the absence of Mining Exclusion Zones in the areas covered by such titles at such time, Colombia\u2019s position on this point implies shifting onto the investor the responsibility of anticipating constant changes in the regulations and delays in the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramos.132\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 54-57 above.\n\n141.\n\nAs to the question of the extent, specificity and significance of the representations given by Respondent, as explained above, Colombia\u2019s breach of Article 805 of the Treaty derives from a number of actions and omissions described in this Opinion, including its failure to delimit the SP in a precise and definitive manner that, viewed as a whole, exceed the issue of a breach of any specific representation, but rather constitute a behavior of gross unfairness and manifest arbitrariness that falls below acceptable international standards.\n\n5.2. Article 2201(3) of the FTA\n-------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nClaimant133 and Respondent134 also discussed the meaning and implications of Article 2201(3) of the Treaty. I will therefore not replicate this debate.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 557-593; and Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 81-85.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 488-505; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 397-413; and Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 60-67.\n\n143.\n\nArticle 2201(3) provides that:\n\n*3. For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:*\n\n*(a) to protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health;*\n\n*(b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or*\n\n*(c) for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.135*\n\nTreaty (Exhibit CL-1), Article 2201(3).\n\n144.\n\nThe Treaty includes a number of provisions whereby investment protections are not subordinated to environmental protections, but rather that both types of protections are mutually supportive.136\n\nSee, for example Article 1701: *\"Affirmations. (1) The Parties recognize that each Party has sovereign rights and responsibilities to conserve and protect its environment and affirm their environmental obligations under their domestic law, as well as their international obligations under multilateral environmental agreements to which they are party. (2) The Parties recognize the mutual supportiveness between trade and environment policies and the need of implementing this Agreement in a* manner *consistent with environmental protection and conservation and sustainable use of their resources.'* Article 1704 establishes that \"[the] *Parties recognize the importance of balancing trade obligations and environmental obligations, and affirm that the Agreement* on the *Environment* complements this *Agreement, and that the* *two are mutually supportive.* Treaty, (Exhibit CL-1), Articles 1701 and 1704 (emphasis added).\n\n145.\n\nThe Treaty provisions should be analyzed as a whole. On this basis, it can be reasonably inferred that had the intention of Canada and Colombia been that a measure taken pursuant to Article 2201(3) would not entail any liability for compensation, it would be expected that this Article would have been drafted in similar terms as Annex 811(2)(b) which expressly excludes the characterization of indirect expropriation in respect of any measure that meets the requirements set forth in said Annex,137 thus excluding liability for compensation. As stated by the *Eco Oro* tribunal *\"it is simply not credible that the Contracting Parties left such an important provision of non-liability to be implied when considering the operation of Article 2201(3).138*\n\nAnnex 811(2)(b): Except *in rare circumstances,* such as when a measure or series of measures is so *severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith, non-discriminatory measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, for example health,* safety and the protection of the *environment, do not* constitute indirect *expropriation.* Treaty (Exhibit CL-1), Annex 811 (emphasis added).\n\nEco *Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit C-285), \u00b6 829.\n\n146.\n\nMoreover, if Article 2201(3) were interpreted to exclude liability in the circumstances contemplated thereby for any damages caused by Colombia as a result of a breach of its obligations under Chapter Eight of the Treaty, then the text of Annex 811 would become unnecessary or redundant.139\n\nCanada supported Colombia\u2019s view in relation to the consequences of Article 2201(3) of the Treaty. See Canada\u2019s Non-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 48-56. However, the expression of this view does not constitute a binding joint declaration under the Treaty.\n\n147.\n\nThus, in my opinion, Article 2201(3) of the Treaty does not necessarily exclude the wrongfulness of an action or conduct of the State in violation of the Treaty such as Article 805.\n\n148.\n\nIn this regard, Article 2201(3) of the Treaty is not comparable with certain provisions contained in some bilateral investment treaties that provide that the State is not precluded from taking certain measures in exceptional circumstances. This is the case of Article XI of the Argentina-U.S.A. bilateral investment treaty that provides that *\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security or the Protection of its own essential security interests.\"140*\n\nTreaty between United States of America and the Republic of Argentina concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, signed on November 14, 1991, and entered into force on October 20, 1994, Article XI.\n\n149.\n\nThe exceptional circumstances referred to in the aforementioned provision are not comparable to those contemplated in Article 2201(3).\n\n150.\n\nEven if it were assumed that Article 2201(3) would preclude the wrongfulness of an action of Colombia otherwise in breach of the Treaty, international law contemplates situations in which the invocation of a circumstance that precludes wrongfulness does not exclude the obligation to compensate. Such is the case of Article 27(b) of the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n\n151.\n\nPursuant to Article 27(b) thereof:\n\n*\"Consequences of invoking a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. The invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter is without prejudice to.... (b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.141*\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (Exhibits CL-17/CL-202/RL-115).\n\n152.\n\nThus, in my opinion Article 2201(3) of the Treaty does not exclude Colombia's obligation to compensate Red Eagle for any damages arising out of a breach of Article 805 thereof.\n\n5.3 Article 811 of the FTA\n--------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Award describes in detail the position of the Parties on whether Colombia\u2019s measures constituted an expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment.142\n\nSee Section VI-C-1 of the Award.\n\n154.\n\nClaimant\u2019s claim is for indirect expropriation143 and is based on Article 811 of the Treaty. The concept of indirect expropriation is set forth in Annex 811(2) of the Treaty that provides:\n\n\"2. *The second situation is indirect expropriation, which results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.*\n\n*(a) The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitute an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers among other factors:*\n\n*(i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,*\n\n*(ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and*\n\n*(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;*\n\n(b) *Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith, non-discriminatory measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, for example health, safety and the protection of the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.144*\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 168.\n\nTreaty (Exhibit CL-1), Annex 811(2).\n\n155.\n\nThus, in order to succeed on its indirect expropriation claim, Claimant must establish that (a) it had vested rights which were covered investments under the Treaty at the time of Colombia\u2019s measures, and (b) that the fact-based inquiry to be made pursuant to Annex 811(2)(a) leads to the conclusion that the measures constitute an indirect expropriation considering, among other factors, (i) the economic impact of the measures; (ii) the extent to which the measures interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (iii) the character of the measures.\n\n156.\n\nIn Sections 4 and 5 above, I concluded that, in my opinion, Colombia's measures and actions deprived Red Eagle from certain vested rights, including the access to a very substantial portion of the mineral resources in its Mining Titles and the opportunity to adapt its existing PMAs to a large-scale mining project and/or apply for a new environmental license or equivalent instrument. I also concluded that these rights had economic value, although such value may be difficult to assess.\n\n157.\n\nI do, however, agree with Respondent and the majority of the Tribunal that Claimant has been unable to identify any distinct reasonable investment-backed expectations on which it relied.145 As explained in Section 5.1 above, in my opinion, Red Eagle had reasonable expectations (different from investment-backed expectations required by Annex 811 of the Treaty)146 that Colombia would maintain a stable and predictable legal framework and not create the regulatory confusion and uncertainty described above.147 However, Red Eagle has not identified any specific representations from Colombia\u2019s authorities in the sense that they would not impose a ban or restrictions in p\u00e1ramo areas overlapping Claimant\u2019s Mining Titles or that it would be able to develop the Project.148\n\nSee Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 382-383 and Award, \u00b6\u00b6 403-404.\n\nSee *Eco Oro v. Colombia* (Exhibit CL-285), \u00b6 861.\n\nSee Sections 2.4 and 2.5 above.\n\nSee Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 382-383 and Award, \u00b6\u00b6 403-404.\n\n158.\n\nRegarding the character of Colombia\u2019s measures, I also agree with Respondent and the majority of the Tribunal that the measures were *bona fide* regulatory measures adopted to protect the environment and did not target Claimant\u2019s Mining Titles in particular.149\n\nSee Resp. Rej., \u00b6 387 and Award, \u00b6 308.\n\n159.\n\nThus, for Colombia's measures to constitute an actionable indirect expropriation under Article 811 and Annex 811 of the Treaty, as opposed to a legitimate exercise of State police powers, there must be an aggravating element or factor in the conduct of the State that does not appear in this case.\n\n160.\n\nIn spite of the uncertainty and confusion created by Colombia, I do not find elements to conclude that Colombia did not act in good faith in the exercise of its regulatory powers.\n\n161.\n\nTherefore, the measures taken by Colombia qualify as an exercise of police powers, and do not constitute an indirect expropriation, unless they were to comprise a rare circumstance mentioned in Annex 811(2)(b) that, in my view, does not exist in this case.\n\n6. Damages\n----------\n\n162.\n\nIn light of the decision of the majority of the Tribunal dismissing Claimant\u2019s claim for violation of the Treaty, I will not elaborate in detail on this matter.\n\n163.\n\nClaimant based its calculation of damages on its sunk costs by reference to its audited financial statements. Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Sequeira, concluded that Red Eagle invested a total of USD 70,704,000 (before interest) in pursuit of the Project.150\n\nCI. PHB, \u00b6 112 and CI. Reply, \u00b6 666.\n\n164.\n\nClaimant criticizes Respondent's arguments (i) that it should not receive compensation for areas outside the Mining Exclusion Zones determined by Resolution 2090, on grounds of the absence of the residual value of the mineral resources in those areas due to the integrated nature of the Project, and (ii) in relation to the non-exploration expenses incurred by Red Eagle because such expenses were also incurred in pursuit of the Project.151\n\nCI. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 114-115.\n\n165.\n\nClaimant also rebuts Respondent\u2019s argument that sunk costs would overcompensate Claimant because the loss it suffered would fluctuate (according to Colombia) between USD 1.6 and USD 4.5 million. Claimant criticizes Brattle\u2019s alternative fair market value (\"FMV\") methodology which it characterizes as \"fatally flawed\" on grounds that (i) it is based on the wrong assumption that Red Eagle could continue to carry out mining activities in the Restoration Areas (yellow), and (ii) that the but-for FMV of the Project was based on the historical purchase terms of the Mining Titles agreed to by Red Eagle, ignoring the integrated nature of the Project.152\n\nId, \u00b6\u00b6 116-118.\n\n166.\n\nClaimant offers three alternative calculations for the value of the Project. The first one is based on the \"but-for\" FMV of the Project at the end of 2012 and adjusts that value using three market indices of gold mining companies. The second alternative is based on the analysis of comparable transactions for similar gold mining assets, and the third alternative is based on a multiple of exploration costs approach. These alternative valuations yield a value between USD 46.81 million (calculated *ex-ante)* and USD 87.21 million (calculated ex-post; *i.e.* at the date of the award). Claimant compares these figures with its purported sunk cost of approximately USD 70 million, stating that there is no significant deviation.153\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 120 and Cl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 650-652.\n\n167.\n\nRespondent criticizes Claimant\u2019s approach in relation to the first FMV alternative on grounds that it ignores the supposedly disappointing 2014 SRK Report on Maiden Resources estimate as well as the Colombian asset market turndown between 2013 and 2016.154 Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s second FMV alternative based on comparable transactions is flawed because the transactions were not adequate comparators.155 As to Claimant's third FMV alternative, Brattle argues that although admitted by the CIMVAL Code for the Valuation of Mineral Properties of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Sequeira, was not qualified to apply the Prospectivity Enhancement Multiplier.156\n\nHearing Tr. Day 4 (English) 1067:16-1068:1 (Brattle Direct). See also Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 150-153.\n\nId, 1068:2-17 (Brattle Direct). See also Resp. PHB, \u00b6 154.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 155.\n\n168.\n\nIn any case, Respondent points out that Claimant\u2019s allegation that its FMV estimate of the Mining Titles as at the date of the award is higher than its sunk costs claim, is misleading. This because, although the FMV of the Mining Titles as at the date of the award (approximately USD 87 million) is higher than the approximately USD 70 million sunk cost figure claimed by Red Eagle, the latter figure does not include interest that Claimant claims from September 2017 onwards, which would drive the figure upto between USD 112 million and 130 million. In contrast, when claiming damages on the basis of FMV of the Mining Titles as at the date of the award, there would be no pre-judgement interest.157\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 133.\n\n169.\n\nI concluded in Sections 3 and 5 above that Respondent\u2019s measures deprived Red Eagle from access to a very significant portion of the mineral resources in its Mining Titles and the opportunity to obtain a modification of the existing PMAs to adapt them to a large-scale integrated project or to obtain a new environmental license for such purpose; this is, Claimant was deprived from the opportunity to pursue the Project and eventually make a success of it.\n\n170.\n\nAs stated above, exploration projects may be difficult to value, but they are not worthless. Moreover, the aforementioned opportunity had some value. However, it is necessarily less valuable than the value of a developed project or one with a favorable pre-feasibility or feasibility study which would require assessing the environmental licensing risk.\n\n171.\n\nThe facts of the cases cited by Respondent relating to the circumstances in which sunk costs have been admitted involving projects in a more advanced stage than the Project differ from the circumstances in this case.158 This circumstance, coupled with the significant difference between the sunk cost figure claimed by Red Eagle (including interest) and a purported conservative FMV of the Mining Titles, leads me to conclude that the use of sunk costs in this case would be inappropriate.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 138-146.\n\n172.\n\nMoreover, Claimant has not submitted an alternative valuation on the value of its loss of opportunity of pursuing the Project. This circumstance prevents quantifying such value, due to the speculative nature of such an exercise without additional information as the one that could have been obtained in a subsequent quantum phase in this proceeding in the context of a different decision of the majority of the Tribunal.\n\n7. Conclusions .\n----------------\n\n173.\n\nBased on the foregoing, in my opinion, through the different measures and actions taken by the Colombian authorities beginning with Resolution 2090, Respondent breached its obligations under Article 805 of the Treaty.\n\n174.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing conclusion, the amount of any compensation payable to Claimant should be determined considering that it was deprived by the aforementioned measures of the opportunity to pursue the Project, whose loss of opportunity is less valuable than the value of a developed project or one with a favorable pre-feasibility or feasibility study. The assessment of this value, which should include a discount based on the uncertainties inherent to the development of a large-scale mining project (including the licensing risk) cannot be carried out in this case on the basis of the information submitted by the Claimant and, in any event, would depend on additional information that could be potentially produced during a subsequent quantum phase of this arbitration had there been a finding of the Tribunal or a majority of the Tribunal that Colombia violated the Treaty.\n\nFebruary 23, 2024"}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| ANM | *Agencia Nacional de Miner\u00eda* |\n| BCSC | British Columbia Securities Commission |\n| C-[#] | Claimant's Exhibit |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia, dated November 21, 2008, which entered into force on August 15, 2011 (the \"**Treaty**\" or \"**FTA**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Red Eagle Exploration Limited (\"**Red Eagle**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Canada.\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Colombia (\"**Colombia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to certain measures taken by the Colombian government that allegedly modified the terms of the Mining Titles acquired by Minera Vetas, Red Eagle's wholly owned branch in Colombia.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Red Eagle Exploration Limited against the Republic of Colombia (the \"**Request for Arbitration**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn April 18, 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Jos\u00e9 A. Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, a national of Argentina, appointed by the Claimant; and Philippe Sands, a national of the United Kingdom, France and Mauritius, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 19, 2019, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Senior Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 19, 2019, the Respondent filed a preliminary objection under Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 20, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to respond to the Respondent's preliminary objection.\n\n13.\n\nOn May 30, 2019, the Claimant filed its Answer on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session on June 12, 2019, by teleconference.\n\n15.\n\nOn December 4, 2019, the Tribunal held a preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed schedule for the proceeding.\n\n17.\n\nOn December 16, 2019, the Tribunal issued a Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection.\n\n18.\n\nOn January 27, 2020, the Acting Secretary-General moved that the Tribunal stay the proceeding for non-payment of the required advances pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d). On January 28, 2020, the Tribunal suspended the proceeding for lack of payment.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 6, 2020, the proceeding is resumed following payment of the required advances.\n\n20.\n\nOn May 16, 2020, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits together with the First Witness Statement of Ms. Ana Milena V\u00e1squez (Spanish); the First Expert Report of Versant Partners; the First Legal Opinion of Ms. Adriana Mart\u00ednez Villegas (Spanish); Appendix A \u2013 Index of Fact Exhibits C-1 to C-814; Appendix B \u2013 Index of Legal Authorities CL- 1 to CL-187; Appendix C \u2013 Compendium of Claimant Mining Titles (\"**Cl. Mem.**\").\n\n21.\n\nOn June 16, 2020, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation.\n\n22.\n\nAt the invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimant submitted its Observations on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation on July 16, 2020.\n\n23.\n\nOn August 3, 2020, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Bifurcation, rejecting the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n24.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and separately its Memorial on Jurisdiction; a Consolidated List of Exhibits; Factual Exhibits R-0015 to R-0125; Legal Authorities RL-0040 to RL-0151; the First Witness Statement of Mr. Juan Manuel Pinz\u00f3n (Spanish); the Legal Opinion of Professor De Vivero (Spanish), along with an Index of Annexes and Annexes PFDV-01 to PFDV-10; and the Expert Report of The Brattle Group (ENG), along with Appendix A to Appendix C, and Exhibits BR-001 to BR-188 (\"**Resp. C-Mem.**\" and \"**Resp. Mem.**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn January 4, 2021, both Parties submitted to the Tribunal their requests for production of documents in the form of a Redfern Schedule.\n\n26.\n\nOn January 18, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning production of documents.\n\n27.\n\nOn March 18, 2021, the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with the Witness Statement of Mr. Juan A. Franco Quintero (Spanish); the Second Witness Statement of Ms. Ana Milena V\u00e1squez (Spanish); the Expert Report of SRK Consulting; the Second Expert Report of Versant Partners; the Second Legal Opinion of Ms. Adriana Mart\u00ednez Villegas (Spanish); Appendix A \u2013 Index of Fact Exhibits C-815 to C-1142; and Appendix B \u2013 Index of Legal Authorities CL-188 to CL-267 (\"**Cl. Reply**\").\n\n28.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, the Respondent submitted a letter to the Tribunal indicating that the Claimant had submitted \"a massive volume of exhibits onto the record on which it [did] not specifically rely in its Reply, witness statements or expert reports, including the entirety of the Parties' production of documents presented by the Claimant as two 'exhibits.'\" As such, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order that (i) the Claimant's Exhibits C-815, C-816, C-819, C-820, C-933, C-1007, C-1008, C-1009, and C-1010 be stricken from the record; and (ii) the Claimant replace the references made to Exhibit C-815 at paragraphs 56, 170 and 250 of its Reply by new exhibits, which may only contain references to a single, specific document.\n\n29.\n\nFollowing the invitation from the Tribunal, on April 25, 2021, the Claimant filed its observations on the Respondent's letter arguing that there was no basis to strike the exhibits from the record because the Respondent \"attempt[ed] to unilaterally impose new procedural limitations on Claimant.\" Accordingly, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's request.\n\n30.\n\nOn April 28, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 denying the Respondent's request, finding that it was not convinced that \"fairness would be served by the removal of a large number of documents from the record, as requested by the Respondent*.*\"\n\n31.\n\nOn July 23, 2021, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and separately its Reply on Jurisdictional Objections, along with the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Juan Manuel Pinz\u00f3n; the Witness Statement of Ms. Brigitte Baptiste; the Second Expert Report of The Brattle Group; the Second Expert Report of Professor Felipe De Vivero; the Expert Report of Mr. Mario Rossi, along with Factual Exhibits R-126 to R-176 and Legal Authorities RL-152 to RL-194 (\"**Resp. Rej.**\" and \"**Resp. Reply**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with Appendix A \u2013 Index of Fact Exhibits C-1249 to C-1288; and Appendix B \u2013 Index of Legal Authorities CL-268 to CL-284.\n\n33.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3), the Centre requested an advance payment of USD 200,000 on October 14, 2021.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated October 27, 2021, the Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum dated September 9, 2021 in the case of *Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41 (hereinafter \"***Eco Oro***\").\n\n35.\n\nFollowing the invitation from the Tribunal, the Respondent confirmed it had no objections to the introduction of the *Eco Oro* decision as it is a public document.\n\n36.\n\nIn view of Colombia's no objection, the Tribunal granted the Claimant's request to introduce the *Eco Oro* decision into the record by letter dated November 4, 2021.\n\n37.\n\nOn November 8, 2021, the Claimant introduced the *Eco Oro* decision as granted by the Tribunal and clarified that it had proposed the introduction of the document pursuant to Article 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 and that the document was ultimately being incorporated into the record \"by consent (not because it is in the public domain, which does not make a document or legal authority part of the record).\"\n\n38.\n\nOn the same date, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Claimant's portion of the advance payment requested on October 14, 2021.\n\n39.\n\nOn November 9, 2021, the Government of Canada filed a Non-Disputing Party Submission pursuant to Article 827(2) of the Treaty, which was transmitted to the Tribunal and the Parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal on the same date.\n\n40.\n\nOn January 3, 2022, after exchanges with the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would be held on the week of February 27 \u2013 March 3, 2023 (holding March 4, 2023 in reserve).\n\n41.\n\nHaving not received the Respondent's portion of the advance payment requested on October 14, 2021, on July 14, 2022, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the Respondent's default and invited either party to pay the outstanding amount of USD 200,000 by July 29, 2022, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d).\n\n42.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, the Claimant informed the Centre that it required additional time to \"assess and make relevant arrangements.\"\n\n43.\n\nBy letter dated August 1, 2022, the deadline extension for the parties to make default advance payment until August 12, 2022 was notified.\n\n44.\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the Claimant requested that, considering (i) Colombia's duty to pay; (ii) Colombia's failure to pay; and (iii) the date of the hearing being set for the week of February 27, 2023, with no procedural steps envisioned until November 16, 2022; the date for the advance payment be fixed on or around November 13, 2022, and encouraged the Respondent to comply with its payment obligations.\n\n45.\n\nOn August 31, 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it considered \"reasonable\" the November 13, 2022 proposed by the Claimant to make the default payment.\n\n46.\n\nHaving not received a payment by the Respondent, by letter dated November 11, 2022, the Claimant informed the Centre that it would be submitting the payment imminently.\n\n47.\n\nOn November 16, 2022, the Respondent submitted its Comments on Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission of November 9, 2021, together with Legal Authorities RL-195 to RL-200. On the same date, the Claimant also submitted its Comments to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, together with Factual Exhibits C-1289 to C-1302; and Legal Authorities CL-286 to CL-291.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated November 30, 2022, the Centre acknowledged receipt of a wire transfer in the amount of USD 200,000 from the Claimant, corresponding to the Respondent's portion of the advance requested on October 14, 2021.\n\n49.\n\nBy correspondence dated December 9, 2022, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's introduction of Factual Exhibits C-1289 to C-1302 submitted with their Comments to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, and requested they be stricken from the record.\n\n50.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's invitation, on December 19, 2022, the Claimant submitted its observations on the Respondent's objection of December 9, 2022.\n\n51.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the Centre circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 4 on the organization of the hearing, and invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal advising the Tribunal of any agreements they are able to reach on the draft, or of their respective positions where they are unable to reach an agreement.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter dated December 23, 2022, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's request to exclude Factual Exhibits C-1289 to C-1302 from the record and invited the Respondent to address this matter, including with any additional evidence, during the hearing.\n\n53.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, a pre-hearing organizational meeting between the Parties and the Tribunal was held by videoconference to discuss any outstanding procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the hearing, including the draft Procedural Order No. 4 and the Parties' respective positions where no prior agreement had been reached.\n\n54.\n\nOn January 30, 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the Organization of the Hearing.\n\n55.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of new documents \"for the purpose of responding to the new factual allegations raised in the Claimant's Comments to Canada's [Non-Disputing Party] Submission.\"\n\n56.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant filed its observations on February 17, 2023, requesting the introduction of the new documents be denied.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal decided on the admissibility of the new documents on February 22, 2023, rejecting the Respondent's request \"on the basis of the immediacy of the upcoming Hearing.\"\n\n58.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, merits and *quantum* was held in Washington, DC from February 27 to March 3, 2023 (the \"**Hearing**\").

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe dispute concerns the prohibition for gold mining in the Respondent's *p\u00e1ramos*. The Claimant is a gold mining company which acquired eleven gold mining titles in the Santurb\u00e1n area over the period June 2010 and October 2013 (\"**Mining Titles**\").1 The Claimant argues that, following the acquisition of the Mining Titles, it pursued a gold exploration program to develop a large-scale project in Vetas (\"**Vetas Project**\", \"**Vetas Gold Project**\" or \"**Project**\").2\n\nMining Titles acquired by the Claimant:  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Figure 1 Claimant's Mining Titles |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *Title* | *Option* | Acquisition | Assignment | *Approval* | *Registration* | *Environmental Permit* |\n| **Real Minera** | Oct. 23. 2009 | Apr. 19.2010 | Apr. 26. 2010 | May 21. 2010 | Jun. 9.2010 | Environmental-Mining Guidelines submitted to the CDMB on 5 April 2010 |\n| **San Alfonso** | Apr. 14. 2009 (signed Apr. 15, 2009) | Oct. 27. 2011 | Dec. 6.2011 | Apr. 18. 2012 | Sept. 17.2013 | Environmental-Mining Guidelines submitted to the CDMB on 6 November 2013 |\n| **La Vereda** | Aug. 4. 2009 | Jun 12 2012 | 8 Mar 2012 | 12 Apr. 2012 | 12 Feb 2013 | Environmental-Mining Guidelines submitted to the CDMB on 13 November 2012 |\n| **Los Delirios** | Dec. 11.2009 | 25 Aug. 2010 | Sept. 30. 2010 | 28 Oct. 2010 | 9 Feb. 2011 | Environmental management plan approved in 2002; transfer to Minera Vetas on 12 August 2011 |\n| **La Peter** | Dec. 11. 2009 | 21 May 2010 | 24 Jun. 2010 | 13 Jul. 2010 | 10 Aug. 2010 | Environmental management plan approved in 1998: transfer to Minera Vetas on 19 August 2011 |\n| **El Dorado** | Dec. 13. 2009 | 22 Jul. 2010 | 27 Jul. 2010 | 31 Aug. 2010 | 2 Dec. 2010 | Environmental-Mining Guidelines submitted on 16 February 2011 |\n| **Arias** | Jan. 21.2010 | 15 Oct. 2010 | 22.

The Parties debate as to whether this exception applied to new activities within titles where existing activities were carried out. Law 1382 was effective as from the date it was adopted. The Constitutional Court found Law 1382 to be unconstitutional because it was enacted without consulting indigenous and afro-descendant people (Judgment C-367 of May 11, 2011).5\n\nLaw 1382, February 9, 2010, **Exhibit C-655**.\n\n*P\u00e1ramos* are described in Resolution 769 of the Ministry of the Environment as a \"High mountain ecosystem, located between the upper limit of the Andean forest and, if applicable, with the lower limit of glaciers or perpetual snow, in which a herbaceous and grassland vegetation dominates, frequently *frailejones* and may have low and shrubby forest formations and present wetlands such as rivers, ravines, streams, peat bogs, swamps, lakes and lagoons.\" Ministry of Environment, Resolution No. 769, August 5, 2002, Article 2, **Exhibit C-15**.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-367, May 11, 2011, **Exhibit C-575**.\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent has explained that the *p\u00e1ramos* are diverse, extremely fragile and rare ecosystems,6 and that under the existing legal framework, to acquire vested rights is necessary to obtain an environmental license and an approved mining works program (*plan de trabajos y obras* or \"**PTO**\"). A requisite for the license is the preparation and approval of an EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment).7\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 17-21.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 139.\n\n66.\n\nIt is notable for purposes of this case that in 2011 the Colombian authorities rejected an application by Eco Oro for an environmental license for a large-scale mining project adjacent to Red Eagle's Mining Titles.8\n\nCDMB, Resolution No. 125 (La Triada de Oro Title PMA), February 18, 2002, **Exhibit R-48**.\n\n67.\n\nThe Resolution No. 937 of May 25, 2011,9 adopted the cartographic information of the 2007 Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Alexander von Humboldt (\"**IAVH**\") P\u00e1ramo Atlas to identify and delimit Colombian *p\u00e1ramos*, further to the mandate of Law 1382.\n\nMinistry of Environment, Resolution No. 937, May 25, 2011, **Exhibit R-11**.\n\n68.\n\nLaw 1450 of June 16, 2011, reinstated the ban on mining in *p\u00e1ramos* ecosystems with immediate effect.10\n\nLaw 1450, June 16, 2011, **Exhibit C-576**.\n\n69.\n\nThe delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* by Resolution 2090 of December 19, 2014 was nearly identical to the 2007 P\u00e1ramo Atlas delimitation.11\n\nMinistry of Environment and Sustainable Development, Resolution No. 2090, December 19, 2014, **Exhibit C-580**. *See also* Investigation IAVH, *P\u00e1ramo* Atlas, January 1, 2007, **Exhibit C-508**.\n\n70.\n\nLaw 1753 of June 9, 2015 ratified the mining ban in the *p\u00e1ramos*.12 This law was challenged at the Constitutional Court in February 2016. In Judgment C-035,13 the Court declared portions of Article 173 of Law 1753 as unconstitutional because they authorized mining activities in projects with pre-acquired environmental licenses. Judgment C-035 eliminated the grandfathering provision for mining titles issued prior to February 9, 2010.14\n\nLaw 1753, June 9, 2015, **Exhibit C-17**.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-035, February 8, 2016, **Exhibit C-18**.\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-035, February 8, 2016, **Exhibit C-18**.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the correctness of Red Eagle's assertion that there were no restrictions or prohibitions on mining in the *p\u00e1ramos* prior to 2010. The Respondent recalls that the Constitutional Court in Judgment C-339 of May 7, 2002 ruled that environmental authorities could designate mining exclusion zones within Claimant's titles by creating a natural park or delimitation of a *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem as a mining exclusion zone.15\n\nConstitutional Court, Judgment C-339, May 7, 2002, **Exhibit R-109**. *See also* Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 154-158.\n\n72.\n\nOn May 17, 2016,\n\nthe ANM informed Claimant that mining was banned in 76.95% of the Real Minera concession area and requested that Claimant return areas falling within the concession contract. That same day, the ANM informed Claimant that mining activity was banned in 33.40% of La Tr\u00edada de Oro. Subsequently, on December 2016, the ANM sent another letter to Claimant, advising it that portions of the Real Minera concession overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo and therefore, mining activities would be restricted.16\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 18.\n\n87.\n\nColombia argues that the acts and facts on which the Claimant's claims are based are the \"mere continuation of measures adopted prior\" to the date of entry into force of the Treaty.37 On the basis of Article 13 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (\"**ILC Articles**\"), the Respondent argues that \"an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time that the act occurs.\"38 According to Colombia, the dispute between Red Eagle and Colombia arose on February 9, 2010, when Colombia adopted Law 1382 that protects the *p\u00e1ramo* by prohibiting mining. This mining prohibition, Colombia states, had its roots in Law 99 of 1993 and it was adopted and immediately became effective on February 9, 2010 together with the IAVH P\u00e1ramo Atlas.39 This fact, the Respondent argues, was known to the Claimant at that time. Colombia recalls that Mr. Franco, Claimant's witness, had prepared an environmental due diligence report concerning three of the mining titles (Real Minera, San Bartolo and San Antonio). When Claimant considered the acquisition of these mining titles, it analyzed the draft bill of Law 1382 which was later enacted in September 2010.40 According to Colombia, Mr. Franco confirmed that \"in accordance with the Atlas of Colombian P\u00e1ramos [\u2026] the evaluated mining projects [\u2026] are located in areas of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystem that are part of the Santurb\u00e1n Complex.\"41\n\nResp.

The Respondent explains that the Ministry of Environment confirmed in Resolution 937 dated May 25, 2011, that IAVH's 'cartographic information' referred to in Law 1382 was the 2007 IAVH P\u00e1ramo Atlas.

According to the Respondent, there were no additional restrictions introduced by Resolution 2090.43 Colombia argues that there was a clear overlap of 95.5% [95.1] of the Claimant's titles with the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* as shown in the map below:44\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//64c8333b71250b40bff438bd53ff0710e0040b6c.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1: Map showing the overlap of Red Eagle's titles with the 2007 IAVH P\u00e1ramo Atlas (in purple squares), Resolution 2090 (in light green) and the Santurb\u00e1n Regional Park (in dark green) (Resp.

Consequently, Colombia argues, the 'damage' would have occurred immediately after the prohibition became effective. The Respondent also argues that this mining prohibition has remained in force uninterruptedly since that date.46\n\nResp. Reply, \u00b6 29.\n\n92.\n\nSeparately, Colombia adds that Red Eagle had not obtained environmental licenses or an environmental management instrument for the Vetas Gold Project to avail itself of the protection of the transitional regime under Article 3 of Law 1382. According to the Respondent, the existing licenses were limited to small-scale artisanal mining activities and the Claimant would not have qualified for the transitional regime by applying to modify these licenses for a different set of activities at a different scale.47 Consequently, Colombia alleges that \"because the same prohibition on mining in the p\u00e1ramo areas has remained in force ever since 9 February 2010, the same dispute has continued, and no new dispute has arisen since the FTA entered into force.\"48\n\nResp.

The Respondent further states that \"the designation of part of said Mining Titles as mining exclusion zones is a mere consequence and constitutes the natural application of Law 1382 of 2010.\" Consequently, Colombia alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* as the claims arose from measures adopted prior to the Treaty's entry into force on August 15, 2011.51\n\nResp.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent's objection *ratione temporis* has no basis in the law or any fact.52 According to the Claimant, Colombia offers an incomplete reading of the text of the Treaty. The Claimant argues that a reading of Chapter Eight of the Treaty should be consistent with its object and purpose. The Claimant adds that the Respondent is trying to unilaterally limit the scope of said Chapter by excluding from its protection any disagreement on a point of law that continues to exist after the Treaty came into force. According to the Claimant, \"Article 801 serves to define the temporal scope of certain substantive protections afforded to the investors of a party for covered investments in the territory of the other party, including in situations where the act or fact continues to occur or exist after the treaty has come into force.\"53\n\nCl.

The Claimant argues that \"various tribunals have confirmed that a claimant may only be precluded from asserting its claims if the dispute was 'crystallised' before the Treaty's entry into force.\"54 The Claimant states that several tribunals have rejected similar objections. They have held that \"the critical date [for assessing jurisdiction] is the date when the dispute arose rather than the date when events and actions that may have given rise to the dispute took place.\"55 The Claimant argues that, even if the facts and acts occurred prior to the entry into force of the Treaty, that does not preclude the Tribunal from assessing jurisdiction over such breaches because tribunals should take into account the factual background that pre-dates the Claimant's complained measures.56 The Claimant also alleges that in order to preclude jurisdiction, the facts must concern the same subject matter as the claims.57\n\nCl.

Red Eagle argues that the Respondent changed its initial argument from whether the dispute existed before the Treaty's entry into force to whether the concerned acts or facts occurred before the entry into force.58 According to the Claimant, the Respondent is relying on an incomplete reading of the Treaty which expressly limits the temporal restriction to acts or facts that ceased to exist prior to the entry into force of the Treaty.59\n\nCl.

It was not until September 2011, after the Treaty entered into force, that the Head of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Mines issued a letter indicating that \"at no moment the zones excluded for mining have been determined.\"71\n\nCl.

The basis of this objection concerns the date on which the dispute arose with respect to the date on which the Treaty came into effect. The Claimant has argued that the first formal delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* was through Resolution 2090 of December 21, 2014, while for the Respondent the dispute arose when Law 1382 was enacted on February 9, 2010, prior to the FTA entered into force on August 15, 2011.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that all the measures on which the Claimant bases its claims are dated later than August 15, 2011, starting with Resolution 2090. In fact, the documents of the Respondent indicate the inexistence of a dispute before August 2011.74 The Tribunal considers that the formal delimitation made by Resolution 2090 should be used for purposes of determining when the dispute crystalized, namely, on December 22, 2014, the date of publication of Resolution 2090.\n\nCl.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nColombia alleges that the Claimant did not comply with the mandatory conditions precedent of the Treaty. Specifically, the requirement of submitting the claim within the limitations period and the complete notice of intent.75 The Respondent argues that, being consent a cornerstone of arbitration, the non-compliance of the mandatory requirements under Article 821 of the Treaty is fatal to any claim. Colombia reiterates that it is the Claimant's burden to demonstrate that it has met these requirements.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 25-57. *See also* Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 40-63.\n\n107.\n\nArticle 821 of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n1. The disputing parties shall hold consultations and negotiations in an attempt to settle a claim amicably before a disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration. Consultations shall be held within 30 days of the submission of the Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under subparagraph 2(c), unless the disputing parties otherwise agree. Consultations and negotiations may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures. The place of consultations shall be the capital of the disputing Party, unless the disputing parties otherwise agree.\n\n2. A disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Article 819 or Article 820 only if:\n\n(a) the disputing investor and, where a claim is made under Article 820, the enterprise, consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Section;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(c) the disputing investor has delivered to the disputing Party a written notice of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration (Notice of Intent) at least six months prior to submitting the claim. The Notice of Intent shall specify:\n\n(i) the name and address of the disputing investor and, where a claim is made under Article 820, the name and address of the enterprise,\n\n(ii) the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions,\n\n(iii) the legal and the factual basis for the claim, including the measures at issue, and\n\n(iv) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(e) in the case of a claim submitted under Article 819:\n\n(i) not more than 39 months have elapsed from the date on which the disputing investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the disputing investor has incurred loss or damage thereby[...]\n\n108.\n\nFirst, the Respondent addresses the limitations period objection.76 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Red Eagle's claims because Article 821(2)(e)(i) provides for \"a mandatory cut-off date of 21 December 2014 in this case [\u2026], and Red Eagle had knowledge of such prohibition on mining in the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, and any damage associated with such prohibitions, before that date.\"77 In its Reply, Colombia further argues, based on the analysis of other tribunals, that Article 821(2)(e)(i) is a 'clear and rigid' requirement which cannot be extended or circumvented because a course of conduct is continuing.78\n\nResp.

According to Colombia, the Claimant \"failed to adduce any evidence of its contemporaneous understanding of the mining ban and existing framework of the protection of the p\u00e1ramo\" when it acquired the Mining Titles.81 Colombia refers to the environmental report prepared by Mr. Franco in 2009.

First, the Respondent argues, as Mr. Franco indicated in his witness statement, \"between 2010 and 2011, the CDMB expressly rejected a number of Red Eagle's PMA requests on the basis of the ban on mining in p\u00e1ramo ecosystems.\"83 Another example, was the approval of the assignment of four *Planes de Manejo Ambiental* (\"**PMA**\") by the CDMB in August 2011 and April 2013 on condition that Minera Vetas \"would only be able to conduct mining exploitation activities in those titles provided Minera Vetas applied to amend its PMAs to allow the large-scale exploitation activities associated with the Vetas Gold Project.\"84 The Respondent alleges that the Claimant did not submit any application to amend the PMAs.85 The Respondent's third example is that \"the mining authorities deferred any decision on Red Eagle's conversion requests until the Resolution 2090 delimitation was issued in order to ensure that the mining exclusion zones as finally delimited were properly recorded.\"86\n\nResp.

As for Judgment C-035, the Respondent recalls that this judgment overturned the transitional regime of Resolution 2090, which was not applicable to the Claimant and, therefore, did not impact the Vetas Gold Project. As to Judgment T-361, the Respondent notes that this judgment required the Ministry of Environment to cure certain deficiencies with respect to the public consultations for the *p\u00e1ramo* delimitation but that too had no impact on the Claimant's Mining Titles because Resolution 2090 already prevented Red Eagle from carrying out the Vetas Gold Project.98\n\nResp.

The measures that Red Eagle challenges are a continuation of the prohibition on the mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem first adopted on February 9, 2010 by Law 1382 and confirmed on December 19, 2014 through Resolution 2090 delineating the *p\u00e1ramo*.

The Respondent alleges that, while Red Eagle identified Resolution 2090 and Judgment C- 035 in its Notice of Intent, the actual dispute submitted by Red Eagle concerns a much broader array of measures.104\n\nResp.

Reply, \u00b6 302, *citing* Claimant's Observations on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 43.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its claims are timely. They arise from various measures that impaired Red Eagle from developing the Project following Colombia's delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* in Resolution 2090. None of the prior dates is relevant. According to the Claimant, Law 1382 did not restrict the mining activities in the Mining Titles. Even if the delimitation covered them, the Claimant argues, they were protected by the 'grandfathering clause' because they were issued prior to the enactment of Law 1382, they had appropriate environmental permits, and exploitation activities had been covered by them prior to the Claimant's acquisition. The Claimant concludes that because Law 1382 did not impact Red Eagle's Mining Titles, the Constitutional Court judgment declaring Law 1382 unconstitutional had no impact either, neither did Resolution 937 and Law 1450.\n\n128.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's retroactive assertion of a prohibition on mining is inconsistent with the Respondent's efforts to promote mining in Colombia.119 Red Eagle alleges that Colombia has failed to identify any contemporaneous record of having advised about the mining prohibitions that it asserts existed at the time. The Claimant argues that there was no prohibition on mining upon the publication of Law 1382. First, the Claimant supports this allegation by saying that the Respondent had not delimited either the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* or any *p\u00e1ramo* area in 2010 and that Law 1382 only established the requirements for eventual restrictions on mining. Furthermore, regarding the mining restrictions, Red Eagle maintains that the Mining Titles were not subject to restrictions because of the 'grandfathering clause' in Article 3 of Law 1382, and that Law 1382 was subsequently declared unconstitutional.120 Second, the Claimant argues that the 2007 P\u00e1ramo Atlas did not precisely identify the boundaries of the future Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo*.121 Third, the Claimant affirms that the Mining Titles met the relevant statutory requirements to be grandfathered under Law 1382 because such titles had a PMA. Specifically, the Real Minera title was a vested right because Colombia (i) confirmed on December 22, 2010 that exploration activities could continue, (ii) approved in 2011 the conversion of the exploitation license into a concession contract, and (iii) confirmed in 2011 that Real Minera was not located within the park proposal and that the *p\u00e1ramo* area did not exist.122 Fourth, the Claimant notes that Red Eagle's Due Diligence report addressed the possibility of the prohibition on mining activities and \"concluded that there were 'important criteria that favor[ed] the development of mining activity and counter[ed] the possibility of any declaration of [mining] exclusion areas.'\"123 Fifth, the Claimant alleges that it has demonstrated that Resolution 937 of May 2011 recognized that the 2007 *P\u00e1ramo* Atlas map was \"inadequately precise to determine the impact of future mining restrictions, if any.\"124 Lastly, the Claimant argues that it has demonstrated that Law 1450 identified future steps for the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* that did not occur.125\n\nCl.

In response to the Respondent's argument that the PMAs were issued with a warning that the Claimant would have to amend the PMAs to ensure compliance with the mining prohibition and that the amendment application was never submitted, the Claimant points out that it has engaged in responsible and sustainable mining, and that the Claimant's efforts to continue developing its project were impeded by the Respondent's breach which did not allow for additional exploration to determine a necessary modification to the PMA. The Claimant notes that the Respondent had approved the conversion of six mining titles into concession agreements and continued encouraging the Claimant to invest following the issuance of Law 1450. Lastly, the Claimant notes that Resolution 2090 did not prohibit mining with respect to the Claimant's Mining Titles because they were excepted under the 'grandfathering clause.' The Claimant concludes that before the publication of the maps necessary to determine the boundaries of the delimitation, the Claimant could not have had knowledge of the breach or the damage.132\n\nCl.

The Notice, the Claimant says, serves to inform the State of the existence of a dispute and to trigger the cooling-off period; this has been accepted by investment arbitration tribunals repeatedly.135 In this case, the Claimant adds, Colombia cannot argue that it was not informed of the existence of this dispute.136 The Claimant further supported the difference between the present case and *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control v. Costa Rica*137 and *Guarachi v. Bolivia*;138 in the case of the former because the treaty required a much stricter standard and the claims were different and not directly related, and in the case of the latter because they were new claims that were distinct from the main claim.\n\nCl.

According to the Claimant, its narrative has been consistent throughout the submissions. In the Notice of Intent it explained that it had acquired eleven titles and that the Respondent's actions were limited to the rights of four mining titles.141 In the Request, the Claimant also pointed to its acquisition of the eleven titles, four of which had been severely affected.142 In its Memorial, the Claimant alleges also that it confirmed how the Respondent's measures impacted those titles which rendered the project unviable.143\n\nCl.

The Claimant argues that this is inconsistent with the holdings of numerous tribunals which have held that the purpose of a notice of intent is to inform the State of the existence of a dispute and trigger the cooling-off period.145 Moreover, the Claimant adds, tribunals have rejected attempts to deny jurisdiction on the basis of insufficient notice of intent and the Respondent has failed to identify any cases in which the Treaty's notice requirements (or a similar language) has been interpreted to require the complete list of measures.146 The Claimant further argues that the Tribunal has \"already considered this issue in connection with Respondent's request for bifurcation and found that 'the Notice of Intent did identify a legal and factual basis of Claimant's claim.'\"147 Moreover, the Claimant adds, the Respondent has not suffered any damage resulting from the alleged defect.148 Finally, the Claimant argues that the Treaty does not impose any restrictions on the investor's reservation to provide a more detailed and ample description of the claims at a later stage.149\n\nCl.

This causes the Respondent to argue that the Claimant was aware of the Resolution 2090 on December 19, and not from the date when it was published. In so arguing, the Respondent assumes an instant knowledge by the Claimant in a manner not contemplated by the FTA, which allows at least time to gain awareness of the damage or loss incurred by the measure concerned. Thus, the Request for Arbitration filed with ICSID on March 21, 2018 is within the time limit of 39 months counted as from December 22, 2014, which is the date of publication of Resolution 2090.\n\n**D.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimant's claims because Colombia has validly exercised its right to deny benefits of the Treaty pursuant to Article 814(2) of the Treaty which reads as follows:\n\nA Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of that investor if investors of a non-Party or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is constituted or organized.\n\n141.\n\nOn April 19, 2018,151 Colombia exercised its right to deny benefits to Red Eagle on the grounds that it was owned or controlled by nationals of non-Parties to the Treaty and that it did not have substantial business in the territory of Canada. According to the Respondent, as the benefits denied to the Claimant include the right to arbitrate, the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction over this dispute.152\n\nLetter from the National Agency for the Legal Defense of the State (ANDJE) (Mr. V\u00e9lez Cabrera) to Red Eagle Exploration Limited (Mr. Slater), April 19, 2018, **Exhibit R-14**.\n\nResp.

Additionally, the Respondent argues that the various professional services that the Claimant lists are activities of third parties upon which Red Eagle cannot rely to satisfy the 'substantial business requirement.' Finally, the Respondent argues that the *Gran Colombia v. Colombia* tribunal's decision which did find 'substantial business activities' is not applicable in this case because the Claimant has not provided evidence of the core corporate functions carried in Canada, or full-time employees in Canada.159 Even if the *Gran Colombia v. Colombia* case was analogous, the Respondent adds, it would not be applicable because the tribunal in that case failed to distinguish between 'business' activities, and ancillary, corporate or financing activities which relate to the corporate existence and financing of a company.

According to the Respondent, Colombia only needs to establish that on March 18, 2018, Red Eagle was either (i) owned by non-Canadian nationals, or (ii) controlled by non-Canadian nationals. It is an alternative and not a joint requirement, as the Claimant alleges. The Respondent also responded that Article 838 (Definitions) does not qualify or limit the Treaty's denial of benefits provision. It is not limited to 'direct' ownership.162 As to the Claimant's argument regarding control, the Respondent argues that the content of the concept of 'control' has to be determined by domestic corporate law as it has been determined by tribunals and commentators.163 Finally, Colombia alleges that the evidence shows that Red Eagle was owned and controlled by non-Canadian nationals as of March 18, 2018.164\n\nResp.

The Claimant argues that the Respondent \"cannot unilaterally withdraw its consent to arbitration after that consent has been perfected nor can it seek to apply the denial of benefits clause retroactively.\"170\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 337.\n\n151.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent is trying to invoke the denial of benefits retroactively which is inconsistent with the Treaty's text. The Claimant supports this argument by saying that there has been a consistent line of jurisprudence that confirms that \"an attempt to deny benefits once the arbitration has started is not plausible.\"171 It also adds that the retroactive denial would be inconsistent with the Treaty's object and purpose as it would undermine its goals.172 In support of this argument, the Claimant refers to the *Khan v. Mongolia, Plama v. Bulgaria* and the *Masdar v. Spain* cases.173\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 340, *citing Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

The consent was perfected by both Parties when the Request for Arbitration was received by the ICSID Secretary-General. The Claimant refers to the Tribunal's Decision on Bifurcation where the Tribunal noted that it was correct that consent cannot be withdrawn.174 The Claimant finds support for this argument in the *Bayindir v. Pakistan*175 and *Ampal-Israel v. Egypt*176 cases. Accordingly, the Claimant requests that the Respondent's denial of benefits should fail because consent cannot be unilaterally withdrawn.177\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 350.\n\n153.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has failed to establish that (i) the Claimant is owned and controlled by investors of a non-Party or of the denying party, and (ii) the Claimant has no substantial business activities in Canada.178 The Claimant argues that this is a cumulative test, and that Respondent has the burden of proof with respect to the denial of benefits. The Claimant argues that the legal standard has been mischaracterized by the Respondent.179\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 351-378; Cl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 82-119.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 97.\n\n154.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Treaty refers to ownership without further distinction while it does refer to 'direct' or 'indirect' control. The Claimant argues that tribunals have analyzed control to mean that it can be exercised in various manners and that it is to be defined by its ordinary meaning, as a matter of international law and not domestic law. On this basis, the Claimant argues, the Respondent's argument to define control in reference to the British Columbia's Securities Act would be incorrect.180 The Claimant responds to the Respondent's argument regarding ownership indicating that the Respondent has not explained to the Tribunal why it should depart from the ordinary interpretative principle of giving the same term a consistent meaning.181 In relation to control, the Claimant responds to the Respondent's definition through domestic law that it should be rejected because the cases cited by the Respondent are not applicable to this case as there was no reference to national law.182\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 97.\n\n155.\n\nWith respect to substantial business activities, the Claimant argues that, as required by the Treaty, 'any' substantial business activity in Canada would prevent the application of a denial of benefits objection as it has been decided in cases such as *Gran Colombia v. Colombia* which analyzed the same Treaty provision.183 On the basis of the same case, the Claimant argues that the Treaty contains no limitations as to what is considered business so long as those activities \"are not merely a 'sham with no business activity whatsoever, other than an objective of maintaining its corporate existence.'\"184\n\nCl.

In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant confirms that the evidentiary record with respect to ownership and control has been clearly established by the following: (a) at the time of the filing of the Request of Arbitration, Red Eagle Mining Corporation, a Canadian company, owned 76.43% of Claimant's shares; (b) on March 21, 2018, over 97% of Claimant's shareholders were Canadian nationals; (c) on December 31, 2017, only 3.05% of Claimant's shareholders were non-residents, and (d) on February 28, 2018, over 99% of Claimant non-objecting beneficial owners had Canadian addresses.186\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 373; Cl. Rej., \u00b6 84 (citations omitted because they include confidential documents).\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, even if the BCSC were relevant to determine 'control' in this proceeding, under the BCSA a 'control person' means \"each person in a combination of persons, acting in concert by virtue of an agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding, which holds in total a sufficient number of the voting rights attached to all outstanding voting securities of an issuer to affect materially the control of the issuer.\"191 On the basis of this definition, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has failed to prove its argument of 'control.' According to the Claimant, the record as to the Claimant's Canadian ownership and control is clearer than what has been considered by other investment tribunals that have rejected the matter.192\n\nBritish Columbia Securities Act, Chapter 418, **Exhibit RL-44**, Article 1(1).\n\nCl.

The incorporation of a company, the officers and the office space all in fact involve an action. The Claimant also responds to the Respondent's argument of \"ancillary or supportive to Red Eagle's actual and only 'business' activity, namely mining exploration in Colombia\" alleging that it is not a standard that has support in the Treaty. On the engagement of professional services, the Claimant adds that it was also addressed in the *Gran Colombia v. Colombia* case which concluded that \"annual purchases of goods and services in Canada\" are \"clearly 'substantial'\" activities.194 Finally, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's arguments to differentiate this case from *Gran Colombia v. Colombia* are futile. According to the Claimant, there are several examples that show that this is incorrect. For example, all of the Claimant's directors and officers were Canadian nationals or residents as of March 18, 2018.195 The Claimant argues that the \"documentary record confirms that Claimant has vastly exceeded [the substantial business activities] threshold.\"196\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 378.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Claimant has proven that on March 21, 2018, the critical date, Red Eagle was owned or controlled by Canadian parties and as listed above, the activities of the Claimant in Canada were substantial. There is no room in the Treaty text for the introduction of an ancillary category of activities or to require that the investor engage also in mining activities in Canada as argued by the Respondent.198\n\n*See* \u00b6 153, *supra*.\n\n165.\n\nIt remains to be considered the time-limit by which a respondent State may invoke the denial of benefits clause. The Treaty does not set such a deadline, but the applicable arbitration rules may (and usually do) set a deadline by which jurisdictional objections may be raised.\n\n166.\n\nWhile it is correct that consent under ICSID Rules may not be withdrawn, the Claimant has to meet the conditions set forth in the Treaty for the consent to be perfected. There is no time limitation for a State to deny benefits in the Treaty itself.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, even though the denial of benefits was timely raised, the Respondent did not provide evidence to prove that the Claimant was owned or controlled by non-Parties to validly deny the Claimant the benefits of Chapter Eight of the Treaty.\n\n**E.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this dispute concerns \"Colombia's sovereign right to adopt measures to protect the p\u00e1ramo from human interference, including through mining and other extractive activities, and climate change.\"199 Article 2201(3) of the Treaty provides that the Contracting Parties have the ability to adopt measures which are necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. According to the Respondent, the claims asserted by the Claimant concern measures withing the scope of Article 2201(3) of the Treaty. Therefore, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over such claims.200\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 78.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 79. *See also* Resp. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 123-127.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent adds, \"where the measures are taken for the purposes set out under Article 2201(3) sub-paragraphs a, b or c, provided that the measures are (i) necessary, (ii) do not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, and (iii) are not disguised restrictions on international trade, no claim for breach of any obligation under the FTA can arise.\"201 Colombia argues that the mining prohibition in the *p\u00e1ramo* has not been applied in a manner that constitutes arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors. The Respondent affirms that the prohibition has been applied to all holders of mining rights in a non-discriminatory manner.202\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 81.\n\nResp. Mem., \u00b6 86.\n\n***b. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it has established that it made investments in Colombia protected by Article 838 of the Treaty. The Claimant notes that since 2009, it acquired the Mining Titles in the Department of Santander, including exploitation and exploration licenses, as well as some concession contracts. The Claimant states that it made further investments to carry out a systematic exploration program in the area.203\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 379; Cl. PHB, \u00b6 69.\n\n171.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"per the text of the Treaty, read consistently with the object and purpose, the exceptions in Article 2201 only apply once that there has been a determination of breach of the Treaty.\"204\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 380.\n\n172.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant argues that this objection is not proper and that the exception does not apply.205 The Claimant alleges that this is not a jurisdictional objection but rather a defense on the merits which is also contrary to the object and purpose of the Treaty. The Claimant argues that this defense is not a ground for the Respondent to have a *carte blanche* to implement measures against covered investments by way of an environmental justification. The text of Article 2201, the Claimant says, \"expressly confirms an investor's right to submit a claim against 'environmental measures' and is not excluded from the protection of the Treaty as the Respondent argues.\"206 The Claimant adds that it is Colombia who bears the burden of proving this objection, as indicated by the Joint Commission of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Colombia:207\n\n(i) [T]hat all of the measures Claimant is submitting to arbitration fall within the scope of the exception provided in Article 2201(3); (ii) that such measures are necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health; (iii) that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors; (iv) that such measures relate to one of the policy objectives set out in paragraphs (a)-(c); and (v) that such measures are not a disguised restriction on international trade or investment. Respondent has failed to meet this burden.208\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 120-128.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 123.\n\nCl.

According to the Claimant, Colombia has had an opportunity since 1997 to exclude a class or classes of disputes from the jurisdiction of the Centre and has decided not to do so.209 The Claimant argues that \"because the Respondent has failed to comply with this requirement, its objection should be dismissed.\"210\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 128.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of the analysis of the same article of the Treaty by the *Eco Oro v. Colombia* tribunal, which addressed:\n\n379. [\u2026] the relevance of Article 2201(3) in terms of Colombia's jurisdictional objection and not in terms of the merits of Eco Oro's claim.\n\n380. The Tribunal construes Article 2201(3) in accordance with its ordinary meaning pursuant to the [Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ('**VCLT**')] to consider its applicability to the question of jurisdiction. The title of this Article is 'General Exceptions' and Article 2201(3) commences with the words '*For the purposes of Chapter Eight* [\u2026].' Given these words, it is difficult to construe Article 2201(3) other than as in principle being of application when Chapter Eight is engaged, rather than applying it to exclude the totality of the application of Chapter Eight. Had it been intended, as contended for by Colombia, that environmental measures *per se* were entirely outside the scope of Chapter Eight, the measures listed in Article 2201(3) would not be referred to as 'exceptions' to Chapter Eight; the words would be redundant. The fact that there is a detailed description of the specific purpose and necessity of the environmental measures provided for in Article 2201(3) (which list is a contained list and not just examples of measures that are to be regarded as exceptions) is inconsistent with Colombia's construction. Were it intended that all forms of environmental measures are excluded from Chapter Eight, this level of detail would also be redundant. The Tribunal's analysis is supported by Canada's submissions that these exceptions only apply once there has been a determination that there is a breach of a primary obligation in Chapter Eight.211\n\n*Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, September 9, 2021, \u00b6\u00b6 379-380.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that Article 2201(3) is not an objection to the jurisdiction but rather a defense on the merits. The Tribunal will revisit this matter if it determines that there has been a breach of a primary obligation.\n\n**F.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimant argues that pursuant to Article 805 of the Treaty, \"Colombia is under the obligation to grant the Claimant and its investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment ('**MST**'), including fair and equitable treatment ('**FET**').\"212 The Claimant adds that pursuant to the most favored nation (\"**MFN**\") clause in Article 804 of the Treaty, the Claimant and its investment must be granted treatment no less favorable than it accords investors of other States, including the FET standard that is provided in other investment treaties with Colombia as a standalone standard not necessarily linked to customary international law.213\n\nCl.

PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimant responds to the Respondent's argument that the Contracting Parties chose not to include a standalone FET standard in the Treaty but rather a limited customary international law standard by stating that the text of Article 805 of the Treaty is clear.214 A footnote to Article 805 says \"[i]t is understood that the term 'customary international law' refers to international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law, in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 38 of the Statue of the International Court of Justice.\"215 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's interpretation would deprive the reference to include fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security of meaning in contravention with the *effet utile* principle of interpretation. This, the Claimant argues, is confirmed by the preamble of the Treaty as well.216\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 395.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 387.\n\nCl.

United States* to support its argument of the minimum standard of treatment is an outlier which has been criticized by other tribunals. The Claimant contends that there has been an evolution of customary international law since the *Neer v. Mexico* decision.218\n\nCl.

The Claimant affirms that the tribunals that have interpreted the minimum standard provisions have converged in substance with the FET standard which has evolved to a more significant level of protection. Both in the NAFTA and DR-CAFTA context, the Claimant says, tribunals have found that the international minimum standard does not represent a lower standard than FET. Other tribunals have adopted a broad standard that has been widely accepted as reflecting the fundamental standards of good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.219\n\nCl.

According to the Claimant, the fact that Colombia's measures were taken on the basis of a legitimate public policy, which the Claimant does not accept, does not make the investment protections inapplicable. The Claimant argues that the measures that Colombia adopted to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* do not meet the test of being necessary to achieve the objective pursued.224\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 103; Cl.

The Claimant requests the following:\n\nShould the Tribunal consider that the FET standard referred to in Article 805 is somehow limited by the application of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, through the application of Article 804 of the Treaty, Claimant, and its investments, are entitled to benefit, at a minimum, from the substantive protections that Colombia has granted to investors from third States, and that are not provided in the present Treaty.226\n\nCl.

The Claimant supports its argument in the *Bayindir v. Pakistan* case where the claimant relied on an MFN clause to import the FET standard from other treaties and the respondent opposed it on the grounds that the FET provisions pre-dated the applicable treaty. The tribunal in that case decided that the \"chronology does not appear to preclude the importation of an FET obligation from another BIT concluded by Respondent.\"229 In any event, the Claimant adds, there are treaties that have been concluded by Colombia that entered into force after the Treaty and undertake a similar obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment such as the Colombia-United Kingdom treaty and the Colombia-France treaty.\n\nCl.

The Claimant argues that through this decision, Colombia permanently banned all mining activities regardless of any pre-existing rights;250\n\n(e) Communications from the ANM to Minera Vetas between May 2016 and April 2017 \u2013 according to the Claimant, these communications enforced the ban on mining activities on portions of Real Minera and La Tr\u00edada de Oro and on unspecified portions of La Vereda overlapping with the *p\u00e1ramo* based on the delimitation of Resolution 2090;251\n\n(f) Constitutional Court Judgment T-361 of May 30, 2017 \u2013 declared Resolution 2090 unconstitutional on the basis of lack of participation by communities located within the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* and ordered environmental authorities to issue a new, broader delimitation through a participatory, effective and deliberative process;252\n\n(g) Communication from ANM to Minera Vetas in August 2017 \u2013 ratified the mining ban on portions of Real Minera that overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* based on Resolution 2090 and Judgment C-035,253 and\n\n(h) Letter from CDMB to Minera Vetas in December 2019 \u2013 informed that 74.51% of the La Vereda overlapped with the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* based on Resolution 2090 and Judgment T-361.254\n\nCl.

The Claimant contends that \"[a]nother essential element of the FET standard [is] the obligation of the host State to act transparently.\"261 According to the Claimant, this obligation is understood to refer to the absence of any administrative ambiguity or opacity and that the regime applicable to the investment must be readily apparent.262\n\nCl.

The Claimant also refers to the *Metalclad v. Mexico* case where the tribunal concluded that the respondent had breached the FET standard for lack of transparency.263 The Claimant adds that in the *Electrabel v. Hungary* case the tribunal noted that transparency includes the obligation of the State to give in advance information about intended changes in policy and regulations that may significantly affect investments.264\n\nCl.

First, the Claimant argues that while the Ministry of Environment issued a preliminary delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* in April 2014, it was not until Resolution 2090 that the final delimitation was announced. According to the Claimant, the impact on the Claimant's Mining Titles remained unclear with Resolution 2090 and contradicted by the ANM communications addressed to Minera Vetas from January to June 2015.\n\n209.\n\nSecond, the Claimant refers to Law 1753 which provided the general ban with the exception of those contracts that had an environmental license or an \"equivalent handling and control instrument in place prior to February 9, 2010.\"265 The Claimant adds that this, when compared with Judgment C-035, which declared the grandfather provision of Law 1753 as unconstitutional, shows the Respondent's pattern of inconsistent and contradictory conduct.266 According to the Claimant, the Constitutional Court itself recognized this lack of transparency in its Judgment T-361 when it declared that the government had \"failed to comply with basic transparency standards in the delimitation of the p\u00e1ramo under Resolution 2090 and, on that basis, annulled Resolution 2090\" and ordered a new delimitation of the *p\u00e1ramo*.267\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6 151.\n\n210.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refers to Judgment T-361 which ordered a new delimitation which cannot be less extensive and also to the ANM rejections and pending decision of Minera Vetas' applications to extend the suspension of exploitation obligations. All these measures, the Claimant argues, has increased the uncertainty preventing Minera Vetas from developing the Mining Titles and frustrating the Project.268\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 152.\n\n211.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant responds to the Respondent's allegation that the policy of protecting the *p\u00e1ramo* had been in place before the Claimant made its investment. The Claimant alleges that it has established that the Respondent failed to act with transparency towards the Claimant and its investment.269 According to the Claimant, Colombia's actions did not refer to the policy protecting the *p\u00e1ramo*.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 442.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent induced investment in the mining sector by promising stability and protection of those investments. The Claimant asserts that, when it invested, there was no restriction on mining in the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* and there was protection for 'vested rights' under Colombian law. Additionally, the Respondent had acted to advance the Project, including approving the assignment of the Mining Titles and four PMAs, and the registration in the Mining Registry.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimant also recalls that in May 2011, Law 1382 was declared unconstitutional creating uncertainty and with no clear measure on the mining restriction in the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo*, delaying the publication of the delimitation and even publishing inconsistent drafts. The Claimant argues that the Respondent continued to encourage the Claimant to make additional investments in the Project including after the issuance of Resolution 2090. The Claimant also argues that after enacting Law 1753, the Constitutional Court declared it unconstitutional, effectively eliminating grandfathering provisions. The Claimant also recalls the Constitutional Court decision that declared Resolution 2090 unconstitutional for failing to meet transparency requirements. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has deprived the Claimant of its 'vested rights' in violation of Colombian law. The Claimant also argues that the Respondent has not issued the final delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* to date and continues failing to prevent illegal and unregulated mining in the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo*.270\n\nCl.

According to the Claimant, in that case the tribunal incorrectly applied the *Neer* standard that has been rejected by tribunals and commentators. The Claimant argues that the \"State must afford protection against the measure that 'inflicts damage on the investor without serving an apparent legitimate purpose' or is 'not different from those put forward by the decision maker;' or 'taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.'\"277 The Claimant adds that the violation of one of these aspects would result in Colombia's violation of its obligation under the Treaty.\n\nCl.

There must be a reasonable relationship between the burden imposed on the foreign investor and the objective sought by the measure. The Claimant argues that Colombia's measures were disproportionate. According to the Claimant, the measures have resulted in the impossibility for the Claimant to access its mineral resources which has resulted in the Project being economically unviable. The measure of the delineation of the *p\u00e1ramo* is disproportionate, according to the Claimant, because the illegal mining has not been addressed. The Claimant points out that Colombia's actions are disproportionate because it dismantled the legal and regulatory framework with no sound and reasonable economic, social and environment reasons, and had a harmful effect on Claimant's investment.278\n\nCl.

Mexico* is not the only case that has held that the fair and equitable treatment standard requires proportionality. The Claimant recalls other cases such as the *Cairn Energy v. India* where the tribunal confirmed that tribunals have identified proportionality as one of the core principles of the FET standard and that \"measures should not be more burdensome for individual's rights and interests than required by the pursued public purpose, especially if a less burdensome measure would be available to satisfy the same public purpose.\"279\n\nCl.

The Claimant sustains that the Respondent dismantled the legal framework imposing a retroactive mining ban which deprived the Claimant of its mining rights. Additionally, the Claimant argues that it has demonstrated that the Respondent sought to enforce the mining restrictions against Claimant even though its Constitutional Court has ruled them to be unlawful which has resulted in the Claimant's impossibility to access the mineral and rendering the Project economically unviable. The Claimant also alleges that it has demonstrated that the Respondent's measures were not based on economic, social and environmental studies and its disproportionate effects have impacted the Vetas population.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 805(1) of the Treaty requires that Colombia treat covered investment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. According to the Respondent, \"Red Eagle's claim under Article 805(1) is without merit not least because Canada and Colombia deliberately eschewed any 'standalone FET' standard under the FTA, and the FTA's MFN provision cannot be used to circumvent Canada and Colombia's agreement.\" The Respondent adds that regardless of the standard, the claims fail on the facts because the Respondent's measures aimed to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* never changed and the Mining Titles were always treated fairly and equitably.288\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 372. *See also* Resp. NDP Comments, \u00b6 24.\n\n*(i) Minimum Standard of Treatment*\n-----------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the standard of protection of the Treaty is the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.289 According to Colombia, it was the State parties that decided not to provide treatment in accordance with the standalone FET standard but rather limited it to the customary international law standard. The Respondent requests that the Tribunal give effect to the State parties' policy decision not to accord treatment beyond the customary international law standard.290 The Respondent argues that Article 805(3)291 of the Treaty is clear in that the MFN provision cannot be used to establish a breach of Article 805.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 377-385; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 274-281. *See also* Resp. NDP Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 23-32.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 375-376.\n\nArticle 805(3) \"A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.\"\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even as a matter of treaty interpretation, the Claimant's argument would fail because it was the State parties that specifically and explicitly limited the FET standard to the customary international law MST. Therefore, the intention would not have been to offer a broader standard of protection found in other treaties on the basis of an MFN provision.\n\n231.\n\nEven if Article 804 of the Treaty allowed for importation of standards, it is a prospective obligation, according to the Respondent. Colombia entered into the Spain-Colombia Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"**BIT**\") and the Switzerland-Colombia BIT before the Treaty entered into force. Those treaties cannot give rise to any breaches under Article 804 of the FTA.\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant has failed to refer to anything in both BITs or their *travaux preparatoires* that supports the broad interpretation that the Claimant seeks to import into the Treaty. The decisions that the Claimant used to support its 'standalone' FET provision are of no probative value insofar the Spain-Colombia and Switzerland-Colombia BITs are concerned. The Respondent requests that the Tribunal \"assess Red Eagle's claims in accordance with the customary international law MST standard of FET as agreed by the State Parties to this FTA, and not any extraneous standard imported through the FTA's MFN provision.\"292\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 385.\n\n233.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent affirms that Claimant's argument that FET should be read as an autonomous obligation that is not limited to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens is without merit. First, the Respondent argues, Article 805(1) is clear in its text and confirms that \"'fair and equitable' is not to be read as imposing any obligation 'beyond [the treatment] required by the customary international law minimum standard.'\"293 Second, the Respondent adds, the Claimant's interpretation cannot be reconciled with Canada's statement of the meaning of this provision.294 Third, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant's interpretation conflicts with the legislative history of Article 805(1) \"from which it is clear that the State Parties intended to provide treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, and no more.\"295 According to the Respondent, it was precisely the decisions of NAFTA tribunals which prompted the incorporation by Canada and the United States in their model treaties of language confirming that treatment above customary international law MST is not required.296 Finally, the Respondent adds, contrary to the Claimant's assertions, MST fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security are applicable to the extent that they are part of customary international law.297\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 279-280.\n\n234.\n\nIn relation to the importation of an autonomous FET standard through an MFN clause argued by the Claimant, in its Rejoinder, the Respondent affirms that Article 804 cannot serve to import FET provisions from other treaties because (i) doing so would be contrary to the plain language of Article 805(3) of the Treaty which prohibits it; (ii) the customary international law MST standard set forth in Article 805 is *lex specialis* with respect to the FET standard; and (iii) \"Red Eagle failed to prove that the provisions it intended to import from third BITs are not merely reflective of customary international law, and provisions from BITs concluded before the entry into force of the FTA cannot be imported through the MFN clause of Article 804.\"298 As noted by Canada in its Non-Disputing Party submission, Article 804 cannot be used to alter the substantive content of the minimum standard of treatment obligation of Article 805, or to broaden the treatment beyond treatment that is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.299\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 386-395.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the minimum standard of treatment incorporates a set of rules which are part of customary international law of State responsibility with respect to injuries to aliens. The purpose of the rules, Colombia says, is to ensure that the treatment of aliens does not fall below a floor or 'civilized standard'.301 The investor alleging a breach must prove the existence and binding nature of the customary international law. The Respondent argues that the ICJ and international investment tribunals have confirmed that \"where a party seeks to rely on a rule of customary international law, it must prove that this custom has become binding on the State party.\"302 Thus, according to the Respondent, the Claimant must prove (i) a general and consistent State practice; and (ii) *opinio juris*.303\n\nResp.

Mexico* case in which it was held that \"investment treaty awards 'do not create customary international law but rather, at most, reflect customary international law.'\"304 The Respondent responds that the decisions relied upon by the Claimant interpret FET standards from other treaties which are not qualified by international law.305\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 396-415.\n\n240.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is generally accepted that the formulation of customary international law minimum standard of treatment was established in the *Neer v. Mexico* case which held that \"the standard is only violated where the government measures 'amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.'\"309 The Respondent states that tribunals have held that this standard is a high bar for claimants and remains rooted in its origin in the *Neer* case.310 The Respondent argues that, in line with this case, customary international law (i) does not recognize a principle that would give rise to an obligation of legitimate expectations; (ii) does not amount to a guarantee of stability of the regulatory environment; (iii) does not establish a general, self-standing duty of transparency; (iv) is not related to arbitrariness; and (v) contains no general prohibition against discrimination.311\n\nResp.

The Respondent recalls on this point the decision in *Thunderbird v. Mexico* where the tribunal also concluded that the minimum standard of treatment remains high.312 The tribunal in the *Al Tamimi v. Oman* case held that \"it is broadly accepted that the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law imposes a relatively high bar for breach.\"313 The Respondent added that the *Tecmed v. Mexico* award has been widely rejected and criticized as a standard. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (\"**UNCTAD**\") observed, Respondent notes, that the *Tecmed* standard is nearly impossible to achieve, and this is why it should be rejected.314\n\nResp.

The Respondent refers to international courts and tribunals that have reviewed public policy measures under international law which have concluded that it is apposite to accord States a wide margin of appreciation.315 The Respondent supports this argument with the award of the tribunal in the *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* case where the tribunal confirmed that great deference should be given to governmental judgments of national need in matters such as the protection of health.316 The Respondent also recalls the tribunal decision in *RREEF v. Spain* where the tribunal observed that Spain had a margin of appreciation and that it would not substitute its views on the appropriateness of the measures.317 Similarly, in the case of *Electrabel v. Hungary*, the tribunal referred to Hungary's margin of appreciation in taking measures related to regulatory pricing of electricity.318 The Respondent asserts that,\n\n[t]here can be no doubt that the protection of a rare and biodiverse ecosystem, the integrity of which is essential to supply of water to an entire region and which is already being impacted by climate change, is also an important area of public policy to which the State must be granted a particularly 'wide' margin of appreciation.319\n\nResp.

The Respondent maintains that it has shown that the threshold required to establish violations is high and particularly with respect to measures adopted to protect the environment.321 The Respondent alleges that the Claimant has not seriously disputed these principles.322\n\nResp.

This, the Respondent adds, was done in accordance with international legal obligations and Colombia's domestic law.323\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 408-415.\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it is legally bound to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* under international law and must apply the precautionary principle reflected in its Law 99 of 1993. This law provides for a series of steps to strengthen the protection of the *p\u00e1ramo* over time. The Respondent recalls some examples: (i) the introduction of a general ban on mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* contained in Laws 1382, 1450 and 1753 to prevent harm from occurring while Colombia continued to work on the precise delineation of the *p\u00e1ramo*; (ii) Judgment C-366 which would allow sufficient time for the legislature to reinstate the mining ban after striking down Law 1382 and to avoid a legal vacuum for the protection of the *p\u00e1ramo*, and (iii) Judgments C-035 and T-361 that maintained the prohibition in accordance with Resolution 2090 until a new delimitation was completed.324\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 409.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, had the Claimant conducted any due diligence, it would have understood that Colombian law and policy precluded large-scale mining projects in the *p\u00e1ramo*. The Respondent adds that with due diligence, the Claimant would have ascertained that Colombia's Constitutional Court was bound to apply the precautionary principle in all decisions to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* and no large-mining project would have been permitted. The Respondent alleges the Claimant knew that the Eco Oro's environmental license application on a nearby site had been rejected in April 2010 and there was also social opposition to mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* areas.325\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 410-411.\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, starting in 2007, the legislature had been preparing the law prohibiting mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* which resulted in Law 1382 enacted on February 9, 2010. Judgment C-035, Law 1382, Resolution 2090 and Law 1753 grandfathering provisions did not apply to the Claimant's Project. The Respondent argues that the Claimant should have known that the limited grandfathering provision could be subject to review by the Colombian Constitutional Court. The Respondent adds that the Claimant cannot argue that Resolution 2090 was arbitrary or not adopted on a reasonable and proportional basis to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* because it had participated and argued to uphold Resolution 2090 during the proceeding before the Constitutional Court resulting in Judgment T-361.326\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 412-413.\n\n248.\n\nFinally, the Respondent refers to Judgments C-035 and T-361 to confirm that all parties had a fair opportunity to be heard and the Court applied the constitutional principles and law to protect the *p\u00e1ramo*. The Respondent noted that the Claimant did not adduce any expert evidence to challenge the reasonableness of the delimitation. The Claimant rather argued that Judgment T-361 did not consider social and economic studies. The Respondent contends, in response, that in Judgment T-361 was a challenge to Resolution 2090 and the Court was not asked to pronounce itself on social or economic studies.327 For these reasons, the Respondent concludes, \"neither the decisions of the Constitutional Court, nor any of Colombia's other measures adopted for the protection of the p\u00e1ramo amount to violations of the MST.\"328\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 50.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 415.\n\n*(iv) Legitimate expectations, transparency, reasonableness and not arbitrary, proportionate, non-discriminatory*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that there is no general obligation on legitimate expectations under the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. Furthermore, none of Colombia's measures violated such standard.329\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 416-444; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 305-353.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that investor's legitimate expectations are protected pursuant to a standalone FET standard in narrow circumstances: (i) legitimate expectations may arise from a State's specific commitment or representation made to the investor on which this has relied upon, and (ii) the investor must be aware of the general regulatory environment to balance its expectations against legitimate regulatory activities.330\n\nResp.

As an example, the Respondent recalls that in the *Micula v. Romania* case, the tribunal held that absent an assurance to the contrary, a State cannot be expected to freeze its laws and regulations.332\n\nResp.

The Respondent further argues that \"in light of Red Eagle's failure to prove that Colombia made any specific commitment to it that it would not change the regulatory regime, Red Eagle's claim must be dismissed.\"333\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 31.\n\n253.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Colombia argues that the Claimant's claim should be rejected because it has failed to establish that it actually relied on the alleged expectations it purports to have at the time of the investment.334 According to the Respondent, tribunals have required investors to prove the expectations they relied upon at the time of the investment.335 The Respondent alleges that the Claimant did not offer any evidence that \"it invested in reliance on any expectation that Colombia would grandfather Red Eagle's 'Vetas Gold Project' or delimit the p\u00e1ramo in a manner that would not impact such a project.\"336\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 323.\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that the legal framework expressly prohibited mining in the *p\u00e1ramo*. Specifically, when the Claimant acquired its Mining Titles, (a) it knew or should have known that Colombia was committed as a matter of international law to protect the *p\u00e1ramos* from mining activities; (b) the Project required an environmental license which the environmental authorities would not grant because they were under the legal obligation to reject any potential harm in the *p\u00e1ramo* on the basis of the precautionary principle; (c) the Project did not benefit from a grandfathering provision because it applied only to existing small-scale exploitation activities on four of the Claimant's Mining Titles; (d) Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code did not provide a 'stabilization' of the environmental requirements applicable to mining projects but rather it reserved the right of the State to declare any part of a concession contract as a mining exclusion zone without payment of compensation; (e) the alleged 'measures to encourage investment' that the Claimant argues did not concern the Project and did not suggest any intention on part of the State to allow the Claimant to develop mining projects that did not comply with Colombia's environmental laws, and (f) the administrative acts and communications referred to by the Claimant were not endorsements from Colombia and in no manner were authorizing the Project which would have been inconsistent with the commitment to protect the *p\u00e1ramo*.337\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 418.\n\n255.\n\nOn this last point, the Respondent clarifies that the ANM visited the Mining Titles to monitor compliance of existing obligations and not to monitor the progress in the development of the Project, like the Claimant asserts. At that time, Red Eagle had not even applied for an environmental license or a mining works program for the Project. On the conversion of the Real Minera exploitation license into a concession contract, the Respondent explains that this was nothing more than a standard certificate issued by the ANM requested by the title holder which does not confer any new rights. As to the confirmation by the ANM that six of the Mining Titles were not within the boundaries of the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo Park, this confirmation concerned the delineation of the park and not the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem. They were separate delineations carried out under different legislation, criteria, and objectives.338 The alleged recognition by ANM of the Minera Vetas right to convert La Peter exploitation license to a concession contract only acknowledges the right to change the legal form of the existing title. The alleged ANM's approval of the assignment of all Mining Titles was not derogating from the environmental restrictions. It was just approval of the assignment process which did not require the ANM to give notice of any restrictions or limitations on the mining activities. As to the alleged registration by ANM of the contract for Real Minera, this did not mean that it was conferring any additional rights or derogated from existing restrictions or conditions. The alleged recognition of Minera Vetas' right to convert two licenses into concession contracts was only ANM's recognition of the right to change the legal form of the titles. Finally, the alleged confirmation by ANM of the Minera Vetas' rights over El Dorado, did not indicate that the title would be exempt from the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem delimitation process but was only concerned with the overlap with the Santurb\u00e1n P\u00e1ramo Park, which was delimited separately and on the basis of different criteria.339\n\nLetter from Colombian Geologic Service to Leyhat, 31 May 2012, **Exhibit C-577**.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 418.\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's reliance on a series of administrative acts and communications from ANM to decide to invest was no basis to have a legitimate expectation to be permitted to carry out a large-scale project in the *p\u00e1ramo*. Rather, the Respondent states, these communications confirm that ANM treated the Claimant equitably, in accordance with the law and fairly at all times with respect to all of the Mining Titles when processing each of its requests. If the Claimant had applied for an environmental license for the Project in the *p\u00e1ramo* area, the Respondent asserts that this would have been denied.340\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 419.\n\n257.\n\nAlso in its Rejoinder, the Respondent argues that Red Eagle's legitimate expectations claim should fail because the Claimant failed to show that the alleged expectations were 'legitimate' or 'reasonable' in all circumstances, including the regulations and stated policy objectives at the time the Claimant invested.341 The Respondent also argues that it is uncontroversial that investors have the duty of due diligence when investing in a particular State. As such, the Respondent adds, if an investor has reason to expect a potential course of action by the host State, its expectations that such a course of action will not be pursued is not reasonable.342\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 420. The Respondent referred to tribunal decisions recognizing an investor's failure to exercise due diligence as a significant consideration against finding a breach of the FET standard on the basis of legitimate expectations and supports this argument on the following examples: *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.

Republic of Latvia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/33, Award, December 22, 2007, **Exhibit RL-90**, \u00b6 837.\n\n260.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's argument that Colombia violated its legitimate expectations by failing to provide a stable and predictable legal framework is without merit.346\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 421-428; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 331-337.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, as elaborated previously, the legal framework that applied to the Mining Titles remained stable and predictable and never had a material change. The *p\u00e1ramos* had been under constitutional and legal protection at least since 1993 and Law 1382 banning mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramo* took immediate effect on February 9, 2010, before the Claimant acquired any of its Mining Titles. The Respondent argues that the effect of the different laws is the same because the Claimant's limited rights conferred in the Mining Titles were not materially impacted by Colombia's measures even if the Project had been exempted from Law 1382. Colombia's policy of guaranteeing the protection of the *p\u00e1ramo* from mining activities based on the precautionary principle guided the legislative measures and was the basis for the Constitutional Court decisions.347\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 422.\n\n262.\n\nColombia argues that for a \"State to violate the legitimate expectations of an investor by amendments to the legal framework applicable to its investment, the State must have undertaken not to amend that framework.\"348 The Respondent further argues that, on the basis of the Treaty's objective reflected in its preamble, changes taken for the purpose of enhancing or enforcing environmental laws and regulations cannot violate the Treaty in absence of a very specific and binding commitment with the investor.349 According to the Respondent, the Claimant has not provided any evidence to demonstrate Colombia made a commitment, such as a 'stabilization contract' with respect to the Claimant's Mining Titles.350\n\nResp.

The Respondent states that it has not conceded this but rather to the contrary, it has shown that the Claimant's reliance on *Tecmed v. Mexico* was inapposite, and that this decision has been widely criticized. The Respondent adds that the *Tecmed v. Mexico* case does not provide persuasive basis that there is a duty of transparency under MST but rather the UNCTAD and tribunals have concluded that transparency has been unsuccessfully linked to the FET standard by past tribunals and it has not been proven that it is part of the customary law standard.351 The Respondent also refers to the *Metalclad v. Mexico* decision, on which the Claimant relies, to point out that it has been set aside by the Supreme Court of British Columbia because it wrongly considered there to be a duty of transparency in NAFTA's Article 1105.352 The Respondent argues that the reference to the *Electrabel v. Hungary* award is not applicable since that decision was based on the Energy Charter Treaty which contains a wording that does not exist in the Treaty in this case.353\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 428. The Respondent adds that the Claimant cannot rely on changes to the law as it was prior to the entry into force of the FTA in August 2011 as explained in its objections to the jurisdiction. *See* Section V.B(1)a, *supra*.\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's claims regarding lack of transparency and consistency of Colombia's actions are without merit.355 The Respondent alleges that it has never approved or endorsed in any manner Red Eagle's large-scale mining project in the *p\u00e1ramo*. Contrary to the Claimant's contentions, Colombia says, Resolution 2090 was issued on December 19, 2014, and there was no preliminary delimitation in April 2014 as Claimant argues.356 The impact of the Resolution 2090 was not unclear either. The Respondent argues that the Ministry of Environment published an electronic file on its website with the delineation at a 1:25,000 scale and it was clear on the prohibition of the mining activities, except for the ones that benefitted from the grandfathering provision under Law 1450 of 2011.357 According to the Respondent, this meant that the Claimant was not allowed to conduct any large-scale mining in the delineated preservation area.358 The Respondent also argues that Law 1753 was not inconsistent with Resolution 2090.\n\nResp.

The Respondent states that these decisions were not referring to transparency with respect to investors but rather towards the local community members and the impact on them. In any case, these decisions were consistent with the Constitution and Colombia's legal framework.360 Finally, the Respondent argues on this point that, while the ANM rejected Minera Vetas' applications to extend the suspension of exploitation for seven Mining Titles, the ANM's decisions were adopted for well-founded reasons, consistent with Judgment T-361 noting that mining was allowed in Restoration Areas of Resolution 2090. Therefore, there was no *force majeure* preventing the Claimant from conducting exploitation activities in those areas.361\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 431(d).\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 431(e).\n\nResp.

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has not provided evidence to make such finding.365\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 433-440.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 433, *citing Cargill, Inc.\u00a0v.

United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2008, **Exhibit CL-61**, \u00b6 626.\n\n269.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent argues that the *Cargill v. Mexico* tribunal correctly applied the customary international law MST which is also consistent with the ICJ's authoritative explanation of the concept of 'arbitrariness' in the *ELSI* case, in which the ICJ defined arbitrariness as a \"willful disregard of due process of law, and act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.\"366 The Respondent argues that other tribunals correctly applying the customary international law MST have applied similar formulations of the concept of arbitrariness.367\n\nResp.

Contrary to the Claimant's arguments, Colombia says that the ANM did not willfully disregard the provisions of Resolution 2090 or enforce restrictions on mining activities of Minera Vetas. The Respondent argues that it was not inconsistent with the 'enforcement' of the banning of mining activities when the ANM granted the Claimant's applications to convert the licenses into concession contracts of some of Claimant's Mining Titles without mentioning the grandfathering of the titles that applied to small scale mining.368 As to the Constitutional Court decisions, these praised the quality of the labor of the Ministry of Environment in fulfilling its mandate under Law 1450 and just directed the Ministry to carry out economic and social studies in order for the delimitation of the *p\u00e1ramo* to take into account the impact on local communities. This, the Respondent says, was not in the interest of mining companies, therefore, it is not an arbitrary treatment towards the Claimant.369\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 434(a).\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 434(b).\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that, contrary to the Claimant's arguments, Colombia has prohibited all mining in *p\u00e1ramo* areas whether it covered mining companies or artisanal and illegal miners with no exception. According to the Respondent, the authorities have issued *amparos administrativos* enjoining any mining activities to be carried out. In any case, the Respondent argues, this does not relate to the reasonableness of the measure but rather it points to the threat to the integrity of the *p\u00e1ramo* by any mining activity.370 According to the Respondent, it did not deprive the Claimant from any vested right in the Project and as such, there is no compensation payable under Colombian law.371\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 434(c).\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 434(d).\n\n272.\n\nColombia further argues that Red Eagle's claims must fail because none of the allegedly violating measures has any merit. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that (a) the Respondent did not deprive the Claimant of any acquired rights under Colombian law; (b) the delimitation contained in Resolution 2090 was based on extensive technical research carried out by the IAVH, which included a detailed study of social and economic aspects of the *p\u00e1ramo* as a socioecosystem; (c) it was not unreasonable nor arbitrary that the ban on mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* contained in Laws 1382 and 1450 would result in prohibition of a mining town's main activities; (d) the inclusion of transformed areas within the definition of the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem was a rational and deliberate methodological decision resulting from the Ministry of Environment's own definition of *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems and the objective of allowing for the restauration of the ecosystem; (e) deferring the effects of Judgment T-361 until a new delimitation was completed allowed Colombian mining and environmental authorities to rely on the existing delimitation to enforce the ban on mining in the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo*; (f) given the social and economic interests involved and due to the complex process, the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* remains in progress,372 and (g) illegal miners are not permitted and the Respondent has taken steps to combat illegal mining in the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* in general and the Claimant's Mining Titles, in particular.373\n\n*See* Ministry of Environment, \"The Administrative Tribunal of Santander Extends Deadline for the New Delimitation of Santurb\u00e1n\", October 9, 2018, **Exhibit R-156**; Administrative Tribunal of Santander, Order, October 9, 2018, **Exhibit R-155**; Request submitted by the Ministry of Environment before the Administrative Court of Santander, July 5, 2019, **Exhibit R-159**; Administrative Tribunal of Santander, Order, December 2, 2019, **Exhibit R-163**; Ministry of Environment, Press Release, December 18, 2019, **Exhibit R-164**; Administrative Tribunal of Santander, Order, May 15, 2020, **Exhibit R-165**; Request submitted by the Ministry of Environment before the Administrative Court of Santander, August 15, 2020, **Exhibit R-167**.\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 435.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that it is a flawed argument to claim that Colombia's measures violated the FET standard because they were 'disproportionate' to the aim of protecting the paramo.\"375 First, the autonomous FET standard does not impose a 'proportionality' requirement.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 436-440.\n\n275.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's 'proportionality' argument, if sustainable, would \"require the tribunal to second-guess the appropriateness of Colombia's environmental authorities' regulatory judgments and scientific basis on which [the public policy measures] rest[].\"376\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 438, citing *Glamis Gold\u00a0Ltd. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2008, **Exhibit CL-61***, \u00b6 805*.\n\n276.\n\nThird, the Respondent notes that the Claimant accepts that, to show disproportionality, it would need to show the existence of a less intrusive measure to achieve the same goal, which the Claimant did not do.377\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 439.\n\n277.\n\nFourth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant would need to establish that there were other measures available to achieve the same policy goal. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has \"adduced no evidence that any measures short of prohibition on mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramo* would have achieved the aim of protecting the *p\u00e1ramo*.\"378\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 440.\n\n278.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent argued that the Claimant had not been able to cite to a tribunal decision, *opinio juris* or evidence of State practice which would point to 'proportionality' being a requirement of MST.379 The Respondent alleges that, in any case, the Claimant has not demonstrated that Colombia's measures were disproportionate. Specifically, according to the Respondent: (a) the Respondent has not 'dismantled the legal framework' in place at the time of the Claimant's investment rather it has applied the existing framework banning mining in *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems since February 9, 2010 and allowed mining exclusion zones in which mining is banned; (b) the Respondent's mining and environmental authorities through Judgment T-361 are allowed to enforce the mining ban until a new delimitation is completed; (c) the Respondent's measures have not prevented the Claimant from accessing the resources of its Mining Titles; (d) the Resolution 2090 was based on economic, social and environmental studies and the Ministry of Environment and the IAVH carefully considered the scientific definition of *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem with the aim of preserving their integrity, and (e) the Respondent has outlawed illegal mining and has taken steps to remove illegal miners from the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* in general and the Claimant's Mining Titles, in particular.380\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 346-349.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 348.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Colombia's measures were not discriminatory.381 First, even if the discriminatory treatment is capable of violating the MST obligation, the Claimant would need to point to a particular investor or investment difference of treatment on the basis of nationality or another characteristic, which the Claimant has not done.382\n\nResp.

The majority of the tribunal in that case noted that illegal mining was an issue of concern, and that Colombia should have taken steps to prevent it. In the *Eco Oro* case, the Respondent argues, the claimant did not argue that Colombia's conduct with respect to illegal mining was discriminatory or a breach of international law. The tribunal in that case, contrary to this one, was not informed as to the situation of illegal mining when it made its decision. The Respondent argues that it has put before this Tribunal submissions and evidence in this regard.390\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 59.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe following analysis and conclusions of the Tribunal on whether Colombia breached Article 805 of the Treaty are taken by the majority of the Tribunal formed by President Dr. Rigo Sureda and Prof. Sands, with Mr. Mart\u00ednez de Hoz dissenting in a separate opinion.\n\n284.\n\nFor ease of reference, the text of Article 805 of the Treaty is reproduced below:391\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n2. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide 'fair and equitable treatment' includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.\n\nFootnote 2 of Article 805 states that \"it is understood that the term 'customary international law' refers to international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law, in accordance with subparagraph 1(b) of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\"\n\n285.\n\nArticle 805 establishes the Treaty Parties' intention to ensure that fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security are applicable as part of the MST, and that \"all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens\" are also applicable. At the same time, the Treaty Parties affirm \"for greater certainty\" that the concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment additional to that required by the MST.\n\n286.\n\nThere is an ambivalence in the text of Article 805 between the recognition of what is included in the references to the MST and, at the same time, a concern for limiting in paragraph 2 the consequence of such recognition. This ambivalence leads the Treaty Parties to explain that such concepts 'do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard and do not create additional substantive rights.' Article 805(3) extends this limitation to ensure that breaches of other provisions of the Treaty or of other international agreements do not establish a breach of Article 805.\n\n287.\n\nIn sum, the Treaty Parties affirm their obligation to accord investments of investors fair and equitable treatment, but without extending the treatment beyond the MST. This conclusion raises the question of the nature of the relationship between fair and equitable treatment as linked by the Treaty to the minimum standard of treatment. After a review of case law, the *Waste Management v. Mexico* tribunal offers the following approach:\n\nTaken together, the *S.D. Myers*, *Mondev*, *ADF* and *Loewen* cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.392\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/03, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CL-32**, \u00b6 98.\n\n288.\n\nIn this respect, the interpretation of the MFN clause agreed by the Treaty Parties is of relevance. It provides as follows:\n\n30. The text of the binding Decision of the Canada-Colombia Joint Commission Interpretation of Certain Chapter Eight Provisions (the 'binding interpretation') reflects the Parties' joint understanding of the provision:\n\n2. National Treatment and Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment\n\n(a) Whether treatment is accorded in 'like circumstances' under Article 803 and 804 depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or covered investments on the basis of legitimate policy objectives.\n\n(b) The 'treatment' referred to in Article 804 does not include procedures for the resolution of investment disputes between investors and States provided for in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements. In addition, substantive obligations in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements do not in themselves constitute 'treatment', and thus cannot give rise to a breach of Article 804, absent measures adopted or maintained by a Party.\n\n31. This binding interpretation confirms that Article 804 cannot be used to alter the substantive content of the minimum standard of treatment obligation of Article 805, or to broaden the treatment beyond treatment that is required by the customary international law minimum of standard of treatment of aliens.393\n\nCanada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n289.\n\nThe Parties to the Treaty agreed that the FET is not self-standing and that changes in their standard agreements reflected their intent. They further agreed that the MST cannot be extended or broadened by the operation of the MFN clause.\n\n290.\n\nIn its arguments, the Claimant appears not to have had full regard to these provisions, the effects of which are to provide that the norm by reference to which the Respondent's conduct is to be assessed is FET as part of the MST, and not the FET standard applied alone. As noted above, the conduct of the State has to reach certain level in order for it to rise to a breach of the MST. One element that is lost in the arguments of the Claimant is, for the sake of completeness, addressed below.\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the breach of the MST is based on: (a) a frustration by the Respondent's actions of the Claimant's legitimate expectations; (b) a lack of transparency in the actions of the State; and (c) actions by the State which are said to be arbitrary, irrational or disproportionate or discriminatory.\n\n*(i) Legitimate expectations of the investor*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nAt the outset, it is necessary to consider whether the customary MST protects the Claimant's legitimate expectations. As with any rule of customary international law, it is necessary to consider whether the existence of such a rule is supported by the existence of state practice and *opinio juris*. Previous decisions by international courts and tribunals may, in some instances, provide helpful guidance in assessing the possible existence of a customary rule, but such decisions cannot themselves be determinative.\n\n293.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is of the view that on the record before it there is insufficient evidence to support the proposition that the doctrine of legitimate expectations, which forms a part of the FET standard in other treaties, is part of the customary MST. The Claimant has not provided the Tribunal with any evidence of either state practice or *opinio juris* to support the existence of such a rule, and the Tribunal is aware of none. The most that can be said is that a State's failure to fulfil a promise made to an investor *may* amount to a breach of the customary MST if it can be shown that the State's actions fall foul of the usual standard outlined above. Legitimate expectations do not, however, receive any privileged treatment under the MST.\n\n294.\n\nIn this respect, the majority of the Tribunal agrees with the awards of tribunals which have considered the MST as it is established in the context of NAFTA. As explained by the tribunal in *Glamis Gold v. United States*, the MST may be breached where the claimant demonstrates the existence of \"at least a quasi-contractual relationship between the State and the investor, whereby the State has purposely and specifically induced the investment.\"394 It bears repeating, however, that the mere existence of such a relationship does not necessarily or as such mean that there has been a breach of the MST.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, **Exhibit CL-61**, \u00b6 766.\n\n295.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant has relied heavily on the award of the tribunal in *Tecmed v. Mexico*. In that case, the tribunal suggested that the investors have a wide range of legitimate expectations relating to the stability and consistency of a host State's regulatory framework, without the need to show the existence of a representation, the existence of a reasonable expectation or reliance on that representation. The *Tecmed* tribunal also stated that a State's failure to fulfil such expectations would amount to a breach of the customary MST.395 It is not a surprise that the award in *Tecmed* is often cited by claimants in investor-state disputes, in seeking to claim the broadest possible protection under the relevant investment treaty. With respect to the tribunal that sat in *Tecmed*, however, the majority of this Tribunal is very far from being persuaded that this view of the MST is correct or even plausible. As explained above, that award relied on no evidence of state practice or *opinio juris* to support its conclusion as to the existence of such a customary rule, and it appears there is none. It is striking that the *Tecmed* standard is now rarely (if ever) followed by tribunals and has been strongly criticized in explicit terms by the annulment committee in *MTD v. Chile*.396 The *Tecmed* award is not one on which reliance may be placed.\n\n*Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, May 29, 2003, **Exhibit CL-31, \u00b6** 154.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n296.\n\nThe issue for the majority of the Tribunal in the present case is whether any of Respondent's statements or acts could be described as giving rise to a quasi-contractual relationship such that the Respondent may have breached the customary MST under Article 805 of the Treaty. Much of the Claimant's claim relies on general expectations of stability and consistency which are not supported by any specific representation or promise on the part of the Respondent. For the reasons explained above, these aspects of the claim must fail.\n\n297.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal refers here to the evidence of the expectations which the investor had at the time it made the investment. When the investor bought the eleven Mining Titles, the *p\u00e1ramo* mining ban was already in place, in effect and known to the Claimant. The Claimant could not have expected that the large-scale Vetas Project would be permitted because: (a) mining had already been banned as of February 9, 2010; (b) the Project was never grandfathered; (c) Law 1450 continued the ban on mining contained in Law 1382 banning all mining without exceptions or grandfathering; (d) Colombia's authorities enforced this ban with respect to the Claimant's Mining Titles at all times; (e) the Claimant did not engage in 'mining' because it only conducted exploration activities; (f) Article 46 of the 2001 Mining Code did not 'stabilize' the laws applicable to the Claimant's mining projects; (g) the approval of the assignment of the Mining Titles to Claimant or non-binding opinions concerning conversion requests for some exploitation licenses did not amount to any form of approval of the Project; (h) the Respondent did not make any specific representations to the Claimant that a large-scale project would be permitted or exempted from prohibition; (i) neither the Ministry of Environment nor IAVH stated that the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* would be identical to the area that the CDMB chose to protect as part of the Santurb\u00e1n Park; (j) a reasonable diligent investor would have studied the Ministry of Environment's rejection of the Eco Oro environmental license request in 2011, and (k) no reasonable investor would have assumed that because a State has not been able to fully prevent illegal mining activities from being carried out, the restrictions on mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* areas would not apply to the Project.397\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 329. *See also* Witness Statement Mr. Juan Pablo Franco, \u00b6 24; Witness Statement of Ms. Brigitte Baptiste, \u00b6 30.\n\n298.\n\nHowever, the Claimant also argues that it relied on a number of alleged representations from the Respondent. In the majority of the Tribunal's view, the evidence of such reliance is not substantiated and none of these alleged representations may be said to give rise to the quasi-contractual relationship which the Claimant needs to establish in order to show a breach of the customary MST. This is because:\n\n(i) the visits to Canada of Colombian officials between 2009 and 2013 in order to attract Canadian miners amounts to no more than a generalized factual statement articulated without any link to the investor;\n\n(ii) the statement that \"the Respondent mining laws provided a clear framework to facilitate and promote mining investments\"398 is the expression of a favorable opinion by the Claimant and not a commitment by the Respondent; and\n\n(iii) the fact that State officials attended meetings with the Claimant where the Project was discussed is immaterial.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 430.\n\n299.\n\nIn the absence of any evidence as to what \u2013 if anything \u2013 was said or offered in these meetings, the majority of the Tribunal plainly cannot infer or assume that any representations were made, or that reliance was placed upon them.\n\n300.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is particularly troubled by the absence of specific evidence on the record that may demonstrate that the Claimant actually relied on, or was induced by, the alleged representation. Evidence of such reliance or inducement is an essential part of any claim based on legitimate expectations, whether an MST or FET claim, as it demonstrates the causal connection between the representation and loss.399 This evidential failure alone is fatal to the Claimant's MST claim, insofar as it is based on legitimate expectations.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A., and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability, July 30, 2010, **Exhibit RL-100**, \u00b6 226; *Ioan Micula and others v. Romania I*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, December 11, 2013, **Exhibit CL-106**, \u00b6\u00b6 688 and 722.\n\n301.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not demonstrated the existence of a legitimate expectation, and certainly not the existence of a quasi-contractual relationship. The Claimant's claim that there has been a breach of the MST based on the existence of legitimate expectations therefore fails.\n\n*(ii) Lack of transparency*\n---------------------------\n\n302.\n\nIn arguing that the Respondent acted with a lack of transparency, the Claimant relies heavily on its allegation that the Respondent failed to respect its legitimate expectations. For the reasons outlined above, the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate expectations arose, or were relied upon. Such arguments therefore cannot lend any support to the claim that the Respondent has failed to act with transparency.\n\n303.\n\nIn support of its argument on transparency, the Claimant has also relied on (i) the existence of a preliminary delimitation of the *p\u00e1ramo* before the final delimitation in Resolution 2090; (ii) Judgment C-035 declaring Law 1753 to be unconstitutional, and (iii) Judgment T-361 of the Constitutional Court annulling Resolution 2090 and ordering a new delimitation of the *p\u00e1ramo*. The majority of the Tribunal has concluded that none of these arguments supports the existence of a lack of transparency on the part of the Respondent.\n\n304.\n\nWith regard to (i), the public availability of *p\u00e1ramo* maps in draft form (and clearly marked as such) is an indication of openness rather than obscurity. It is difficult to conceive how the provision of *more* information whilst the final delimitation is being confirmed could ever lead to the conclusion that a host State has acted with a lack of transparency. With regard to (ii) and (iii), the list of items in support of the argument of lack of transparency includes judgments of Colombian courts, including the Constitutional Court. These are public judgments that serve to confirm transparency in the legal system. At no time has the Claimant asserted that it had no access to the courts or referred to any failures of due process. The system established to protect the *p\u00e1ramos* is obviously complex, which requires the investor to pay close attention and learn how it works. The Treaty does not prohibit complexity. Rather, it imposes on an investor the need to act with care and due diligence.\n\n305.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument of lack of transparency is bound to fail, and the majority of the Tribunal so concludes.\n\n*(iii)Arbitrary and unreasonable conduct*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *EDF v. Romania* that arbitrary or unreasonable conduct may be demonstrated in a number of ways, including measures which harm the interests of the Claimant but do not have a legitimate purpose, measures that are taken for reasons other than those put forward, and decisions taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.400 However, in this case, the Claimant has failed to provide sufficient evidence of any of these elements of arbitrariness or unreasonableness.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, October 8, 2009, **Exhibit CL-249**, \u00b6 303.\n\n307.\n\nAt the outset, it must be emphasized again that the measures in issue did not deprive the Claimant of any acquired right. The Claimant had planned to carry out a mining project in the *p\u00e1ramo* area, but was never granted the legal right to do so. The Claimant's argument that the Respondent acted arbitrarily or unreasonably due to a failure to respect its right under domestic law therefore fails.\n\n308.\n\nContrary to the Claimant's arguments, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Resolution 2090 was based on extensive technical research, including the social and economic aspects of the *p\u00e1ramo*.401 The fact that the Respondent entered into a deliberative process considering a variety of interests and factors does not show that it failed to act for a legitimate purpose; to the contrary, the existence of this exercise demonstrates that the Respondent gave meaningful consideration as to how to weigh these competing economic, environmental and social interests to produce a balanced policy. There are almost an infinite number of other ways in which this balance could have been reached, some of which may have been less harmful to the Claimant's economic interests. However, the mere existence of these alternatives does not, in any way, undermine the legitimacy of the conclusion adopted by the Respondent. As long as the Tribunal is satisfied that the Respondent has acted for a legitimate purpose \u2013 which in this case, it very plainly has, as the Tribunal is unanimous in concluding,402 then it has no business questioning how the Respondent has chosen to balance these competing interests (unless it can be shown that the choice was made in an arbitrary or discriminatory way).\n\n*See* Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 272-278 and 434(b); Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 154-176 and 345; Witness Statement of Ms. Brigitte Baptiste, \u00b6 53; Ministry of Environment, *Memoria t\u00e9cnica para la gesti\u00f3n integral del Territorio para la conservaci\u00f3n del P\u00e1ramo Jurisdicciones \u2013 Santurb\u00e1n \u2013 Berl\u00edn.

The Respondent was plainly involved in a difficult exercise, in seeking to act to protect the environment and to do so by means which are reasonable and proportionate. In determining whether measures taken by a State are arbitrary to the point of being shocking, a tribunal is bound to be sensitive to the real-world difficulties of government decision-making in the face of legitimate objectives that may pull in different directions. In the search for balance, and in the face of competing pressures, different arms of the same government may give expression to different and potentially conflicting priorities, and over time the direction taken may change. This is particularly the case when the protection of the environment or human health is at stake. On the basis of the evidence before it, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the measures taken by the Respondent do not come close to being characterized as arbitrary, were genuinely intended to protect the environment and were reasonable and proportionate on the basis of the objectives they sought to achieve. To be clear, the majority does not consider that the unpredictability or instability identified in the Dissenting Opinion (in relation to a legitimate expectation) may be said to have crossed a line of arbitrariness. To the contrary, it is inevitable that on a matter of complexity, such as the one in the present case, a degree of uncertainty is inevitable, as the path to be taken is considered and ultimately determined.\n\n310.\n\nThis conclusion is not affected by the possible existence of illegal artisanal mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* area. As discussed below in relation to the Claimant's argument on discrimination, the prohibition on mining did not discriminate between the Claimant and artisanal mining, and the evidence shows that the Respondent has taken steps to enforce eviction orders against artisanal miners. That some illegal mining may still take place despite the Respondent's efforts merely serves to demonstrate the practical difficulties the Respondent faces in seeking to protect the *p\u00e1ramo*. It does not, however, in any way throw any doubt on the legitimacy of its purpose, or the authenticity of the environmental concerns it sought to address.\n\n311.\n\nFor these reasons, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not proven that the conduct of the Respondent was unreasonable or arbitrary.\n\n*(iv) Proportionality*\n----------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimant's arguments on proportionality overlap to a large extent with its arguments on arbitrariness and unreasonableness, particularly in relation to (i) the purpose of the balance struck by the Respondent between competing interests, and (ii) the actions being taken against artisanal illegal mining. The majority of the Tribunal therefore repeats its conclusions on these issues.\n\n313.\n\nWith regard to (i), the majority of the Tribunal is satisfied that the Respondent was pursuing legitimate public policy objectives when it banned mining in the *p\u00e1ramo*, as demonstrated by the extensive social, economic and environmental studies carried out.403 Further, and importantly, the Respondent did not go further than was necessary to pursue its objectives. The mining ban is limited to the *p\u00e1ramo* area, and the Claimant is still able to access the resources within its Mining Titles which are located outside of the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems. It is notable that the Claimant has not identified any alternative measures which would have achieved the same level of environmental protection whilst having a lesser effect on the Claimant's economic interests.\n\nIAVH, *Aportes a la delimitaci\u00f3n del p\u00e1ramo*, 2014, **Exhibit R-92**, p. 16.\n\n314.\n\nWith respect to (ii), the Respondent has taken, and continues to take steps to remove illegal miners from the *p\u00e1ramo*. It cannot reasonably be said, on the basis of the evidence in the record, that the Respondent has not sought to take measures to end illegal mining activity. Accordingly, it is difficult to see how illegal mining could support the Claimant's argument that the measures adopted by the Respondent were disproportionate.\n\n*(v) Discrimination*\n--------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe claim of discrimination for favoring the illegal artisanal miners ignores that they are small-scale miners. They cannot be said to be in like circumstances to the large- or medium-scale mining of the Vetas Project. In any case, the Respondent asserts that it has enforced eviction orders against the illegal miners, a fact not rebutted by the Claimant.404 No reasonable investor would have assumed that because a State has not been able to fully prevent illegal mining activities from being carried out, the restrictions on mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* areas would not apply to the Project.405\n\n*See* Resp. Rej., \u00b6 410, *citing* ANM, Resolution No. GSC 562, September 20, 2018, **Exhibit R-154**, pp. 8-9; ANM, Resolution No. GSC-ZN 619, October 18, 2018, **Exhibit R-157**.\n\n*See* Resp. Rej., \u00b6 329.\n\n316.\n\nHaving considered all the circumstances, and carefully considered all of the evidence before it, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not acted in breach of the MST. The conduct of the Respondent did not rise to the level required to breach the MST as interpreted by the Parties to the Treaty and understood by the Tribunal.\n\n**C.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Colombia has unlawfully expropriated Claimant's investments, contrary to the requirements set in Article 811 of the Treaty by substantially depriving Claimant of the economic benefit, enjoyment and value of their returns under the Mining Titles.406\n\nCl.

The Claimant adds that under international law an investment is expropriated when: \"seizure, confiscation, nationalization, sequestration, condemnation \u2013 and an even larger number of ways that property can be expropriated. Expropriation can be direct, indirect, regulatory, creeping, *de facto*, or a government act may be 'tantamount to,' 'equivalent to,' or 'have similar effects as' expropriation.\"407\n\nCl.

Colombia*, where the claimant's rights were substantially similar, the majority of the tribunal rejected Colombia's identical argument and affirmed that the claimant's rights in the ten titles constituted vested property rights capable of being expropriated.410\n\nCl.

Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ('date of expropriation'), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. To determine fair market value a Tribunal shall use appropriate valuation criteria, which may include going concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria.\n\n3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n359.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article 811 \"requires Colombia to pay, without delay, compensation to Claimant in the amount of the fair market value of its investments in Colombia, plus interest from the date of the expropriation until payment, as a result of its expropriation of Claimant's rights over the Project.\"482 Considering that the Respondent's expropriatory measures were conducted without any compensation, Article 811 of the Treaty renders the expropriation of the Claimant's investments as unlawful.483\n\nCl.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent argues that for the Claimant to be successful in its indirect expropriation claim, two conditions must be satisfied:\n\n\u2022 The rights alleged to have been expropriated were covered investments under the FTA and were vested in Red Eagle at the time of Colombia's measures.\n\n\u2022 The 'fact-based inquiry' to be conducted pursuant to Annex 811(1)(a) leads to a prima facie conclusion that the measures constitute an indirect expropriation, having regard, inter alia, to:\n\n(i) the economic impact of the measures\n\n(ii) the extent to which the measure[s] interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and\n\n(iii) the character of the measures.489\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 448.\n\n363.\n\nEven if the fact-based inquiry conducted pursuant to Annex 811(2)(a) leads the Tribunal to a *prima facie* conclusion that the Respondent's measures constitute indirect expropriation, the Claimant must show that 'rare circumstances' apply, because the measures were \"non-discriminatory regulatory actions designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as the environment.\"490\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 449.\n\n*(i) No deprivation of Claimant's rights*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal must consider the scope of the rights constituting an investment under Colombia's governing laws to assess whether a deprivation of rights has occurred. Accordingly, it argues that the Claimant must demonstrate that it had a vested right *in rem* recognized by Colombian law before claiming that the right has been expropriated. However, the expropriation claim fails in that the Claimant's Mining Titles never conferred any right to carry out the Vetas Gold Project, which the Claimant asserts is the alleged investment. Thus, since the Claimant argues that the Project was contingent upon its ability to conduct exploitative mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramo* area, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant never had such a right for three reasons.491\n\nResp.

The Respondent argues that, under Colombian law, the right to exploit minerals becomes an \"acquired right\" only when approval is obtained for the two, while \"the mere assignment of a mining title does not confer an acquired right to exploit*.*\"492\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 365. *See also* De Vivero Second Report, Section III.B; Tr.

C-Mem., \u00b6 456; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 363.\n\n367.\n\nSecond, citing the expert report of Prof. De Vivero and Articles 34 and 36 of the 2001 Mining Code, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant's Mining Titles were subject to the State's reservation of its right to designate exclusion zones at any time without payment of compensation. In response to the Claimant's argument that the Colombian Constitution provides a guarantee of compensation when vested rights are expropriated,494 Colombia argues that Article 58 of the Constitution provides for such compensation when the taking of acquired rights is a result of \"*leyes posteriores*\" enacted by Congress.495 In the present case, however, the Respondent argues that restrictions to Claimant's ability to conduct mining were adopted in accordance with the Mining Code, which existed before the Mining Titles were issued.496 The Respondent further argues that the Claimant has provided no evidence that acts of the judiciary, such as the Colombian Constitutional Court, give rise to compensation under Article 58 of the Constitution.\n\n*See* Cl.

Even assuming, however, that Red Eagle were entitled to compensation, it never asked for any such compensation before the Colombian courts. As such, it cannot claim that Colombia has frustrated its expectation that it would receive such compensation.498\n\n*See* Resp. PHB, \u00b6 35, *citing* Tr. Day 3 (Spanish), p. 776:17-20.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 35.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant voluntarily assumed such risk, the materialization of which does not constitute a dispossession of proprietary rights.499 Indeed, according to the Respondent, the approval of the assignment to the Claimant of its Mining Titles was not an endorsement or an approval of the project, nor was it an indication that such a project would be exempt from a mining ban.500 Further, the approval of the Claimant's conversion requests did not amount to an approval of the Project, nor did it confer any acquired rights to exploit in the *p\u00e1ramo* areas. Rather, these were accepted \"with the express caveat\" that concession contracts would be subject to the mining ban.501\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 457; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 364, Resp.

The Respondent argues that, had Colombia's measures resulted in a substantial deprivation of the Claimant's value of investments, the share price would show a sharp drop after the disclosure, but the drop had occurred well before any of those measures. Accordingly, the measures cannot amount to an indirect expropriation through a substantial deprivation of value.521\n\nResp.

The Respondent argues that the Claimant's belated reliance on the SRK report is untenable because the report relies on the false assumption that the entire resource estimated by SRK in April 2014 formed part of the Project prior to the measures and would have been mined but for the Respondent's measures.

The Respondent argues that, even having conducted \"the most basic\" due diligence, it would have been clear to the Claimant that mining on at least a portion of that area would be prohibited in light of Colombia's long-lasting policy of *p\u00e1ramo* protection. Thus, the Claimant could not have held legitimate expectations that it would be permitted to conduct mining exploitation activities throughout the area covered by its Mining Titles despite the presence of *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems.530\n\nResp.

Mexico*, *Feldman v. Mexico*, *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, and *AWG Group v.

Thus, according to the Respondent, mining activities pose a threat to water resources and require the alteration of surface and subsoil sources, as well as additional infrastructure, and waste and residue management. As such, the Respondent contends that mining activities \"were incompatible with the conservation and restoration of the p\u00e1ramo ecosystems*.*\"539\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 387.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 387.\n\n389.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the delimitation of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* did not target the Claimant's investment but was rather imposed on all 36 of Colombia's *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems, and thus applied to all titles overlapping with these regions, also restricting other activities beyond mining.540 The Respondent further argues that the courts acted reasonably to defer the effects of the ban until the new delimitation was completed, even though the Claimant could not have reasonably expected to benefit from any grandfathering clause. Moreover, Colombian authorities have adequately and appropriately protected the Claimant from illegal mining by processing, deciding and enforcing eviction orders to remove illegal miners operating within the Claimant's Mining Titles.541\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 387.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 387.\n\n390.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to provide any \"workable alternative methodology\" to the Ministry of Environment that would have allowed the government to protect the 36 *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems, since the Guayacanal Foundation and the Municipality of Vetas proposals excluded areas that no longer presented visual characteristics of *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems.542\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 388.\n\n*(iii) Non-discriminatory measures*\n-----------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's argument that the phrase 'except in rare circumstances' provided under Annex 811(2)(b) of the Treaty does not create a blanket exception for discriminatory measures,543 the Respondent argues that the Claimant does not \"seriously dispute\" the fact that Colombia's measures were intended to protect the environment, and as such, *prima facie*, they cannot amount to indirect expropriation under the Treaty.544\n\n*See* Cl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 181-182.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 479-480; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 389.\n\n392.\n\nPursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, the burden of proving the existence of 'rare circumstances' must thus be interpreted in good faith and in light of (i) the object and purpose of the Treaty; (ii) Canada and Colombia's mutual undertakings, under Article 1702 of the Treaty, not to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the levels of protection afforded in each State Party's respective environmental laws; and (iii) the Environment Agreement, which, *inter alia*, recognizes *\"*the sovereign right of each Party to establish its own levels of national environmental protection and environmental development policies and priorities, and to adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and policies\" and obligates each Party to \"ensure that its environmental laws and policies provide for high levels of environmental protection.\"545\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 482.\n\n393.\n\nAlthough the Treaty does not define the term 'rare circumstances,' the Respondent argues that it does provide an example, namely, \"a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith.\" By providing this example, which tribunals have generally recognized as a very exceptional finding of a severe and bad faith regulation, the Respondent argues that the Treaty makes clear that a claim of indirect expropriation for non-discriminatory regulatory measures must face an extremely high bar in order to establish that the circumstances were 'rare.'\"546\n\nResp.

Instead, according to the Respondent, the Claimant argues that the measures were disproportionate because the Mining Titles covered only a small part of the *p\u00e1ramo* area, and the Claimant should have thus been allowed to conduct mining activities in the entirety of its Mining Titles.551 According to the Respondent, the Claimant appears to argue \"that it was entitled to be treated differently\" for that reason, despite the government's long-standing environmental policy, without552 exception.\n\nResp.

The measures adopted by the Respondent were not arbitrary but were rather based on scientific studies showing that mining activities negatively impact the environment in their area of influence.553 The Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot prove that 'rare circumstances' existed to support its non-discriminatory claim and as such, Colombia's measures do not amount to an indirect expropriation under the Treaty.554\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 395.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nThe following analysis on whether Colombia breached Article 811 of the Treaty is adopted by the majority of the Tribunal.\n\n398.\n\nThe Claimant's claim for indirect expropriation of the Mining Titles by the Respondent is based on Article 811 of the Treaty, as supplemented by the Treaty Parties' shared understanding of this Article which is set forth in Annex 811:\n\n1. Paragraph 1 of Article 811 addresses two situations. The first situation is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated as provided for under international law.\n\n2. The second situation is indirect expropriation, which results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\n(a) The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitute an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:\n\n(i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,\n\n(ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and\n\n(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;\n\n(b) Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted in good faith, non-discriminatory measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, for example health, safety and the protection of the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.\n\n399.\n\nBy way of introduction, it is to be noted that for any claim of expropriation to get off the ground, the Claimant needs to demonstrate the existence of a vested right of which it has been deprived. The existence of such a right is a matter of domestic rather than international law; international law does not contain any rules on the existence or scope of private rights, and only regulates the manner in which an investor may be deprived of those rights. The majority of the Tribunal is not satisfied that, as a matter of domestic law, the Claimant ever acquired a vested right to engage in mining activities in the *p\u00e1ramo* area. The Claimant's 'right' to carry out mining in relation to the Vetas Project was always conditional on being granted an environmental license or the approval of a PTO, which was at the discretion of the Respondent.555 The Claimant's expropriation claim fails at the first hurdle.\n\n*See* Legal Opinion of Professor De Vivero, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106.\n\n400.\n\nGiven this, it is not strictly necessary to carry out a further analysis into whether the measures fall within the scope of the Respondent's police powers outlined in Annex 811 of the Treaty and therefore are not expropriatory in nature. For the sake of completeness, however, the Tribunal is of the view that the measures do fall within the scope of the Respondent's police powers. As can be seen from the extensive documentary evidence, discussed in more detail above, the measures were plainly designed and applied to protect the public policy goal of environmental protection.\n\n401.\n\nAlthough the text of Annex 811 leaves open the possibility that in \"rare circumstances\" public policy measures may fall outside the scope of a State's police powers, the Tribunal has concluded that no such circumstances exist in this case. Tribunals have generally found that such \"rare circumstances\" will only exist where the host State has acted contrary to a specific commitment made to the investor.556 Yet, as explained above in relation to legitimate expectations, no such commitment has been made in this case.\n\n*Methanex\u00a0Corporation v.

The Respondent explains that the ANM visited the Mining Titles to monitor compliance of existing obligations and not to monitor progress in the development of the Project like the Claimant asserts. At this point, Red Eagle had not even applied for an environmental license or a PTO for the Project. On the conversion of the Real Minera exploitation license into a concession contract, the Respondent explains that this was nothing more than a standard certificate issued by the ANM requested by the title holder and which does not confer any new rights. As to the confirmation by the ANM for six of the Mining Titles that were not in the boundaries of the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* Park, this confirmation concerned the delineation of the park and not the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystem which were separate delineations and carried out with different legislation, criteria and objectives. The alleged recognition by ANM of the Minera Vetas right to convert La Peter exploitation license into a concession contract only acknowledges the right to change the legal form of the existing title; it is not an actual change of a legal form of a title. The alleged ANM's approval of the assignment of all Mining Titles was not derogating from the environmental restrictions but rather just approval of the assignment process which did not require the ANM to give notice of any restrictions or limitations on the mining activities. As to the alleged registration by ANM of the contract for Real Minera, this did not mean that it was conferring any additional rights or derogated from existing restrictions or conditions. The alleged recognition of Minera Vetas' right to convert two licenses into concession contracts was ANM's recognition of the right to change the legal form of the titles. Finally, the alleged confirmation by ANM of the Minera Vetas' rights over El Dorado, did not indicate that the title would be exempt from the paramo ecosystem delimitation process but only concerned the overlap with the Santurb\u00e1n Park, which was delimited separately and on the basis of different criteria.557\n\nResp.

After listing the measures taken by the Respondent since Resolution 2090, the Claimant considered as specific commitments of the Respondent the visits to Canada of Colombian officials between 2009 and 2013 in order to attract Canadian miners.558 The statement that \"the Respondent mining laws provided a clear framework to facilitate and promote mining investments\"559 is the expression of a favorable opinion by the Claimant but not a commitment by the Respondent.

The Claimant explains that the intent of the Parties of the Treaty was to maintain the existing environmental measures instead of providing a *carte blanche* to implement new measures. The Claimant also refers to the obligations under Articles 1701, 1702, 1703, and 1704 on the environment as being \"mutually supportive\". According to the Claimant, \"these articles, read in the context of the entire Treaty, including its object and purpose, refer to the 'mutual supportiveness' of investment/trade and environmental policies.\"564 Accordingly, the Claimant argues, they relate only to existing environmental measures and they do not have 'primacy' over investment protection.565\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 589.\n\n412.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent failed to establish that the measures are not applied in a manner that is not arbitrary or discriminatory between investors or investments. According to the Claimant, Colombia's measures cannot comply with these requirements because the Respondent has sought to enforce mining restrictions with respect to the Claimant, even though the Constitutional Court has ruled them unlawful and has allowed illegal mining to continue within the delimitation of the *p\u00e1ramo*.576\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 590.\n\n413.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that the Respondent has failed to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* from illegal mining and, consequently, failed to establish that the measures relate to environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health.577\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 592.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the measures implemented in this case fall squarely within the scope of Article 2201(3) and cannot therefore give rise to liability under Chapter Eight.578 Article 2201(3) provides as follows:\n\nFor the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:\n\na. To protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health;\n\nb. To ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; or\n\nc. For the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 488-505; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 397-413; Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 60-67.\n\n415.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this provision, interpreted in accordance with the object and purpose of the Treaty and Chapter Seventeen and the Environmental Agreement, \"provides for the subordination of the investment protections under Chapter Eight to the State Parties' sovereign rights and duties to protect the environment.\"579\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 490.\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 2201(3) is to be read consistently with Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\"**GATT**\") on which the Environmental Agreement and the carve out are based and to which both Canada and Colombia are parties. The Respondent supports this argument with the tribunal's decision in the *Continental Casualty v. Argentina* case to observe that GATT would be an appropriate reference in relation to necessity.580 GATT Article XX excludes from the ambit of GATT any non-discriminatory measure taken to protect human, animal or plant life and health which is similar language to that of Article 2201(3) of the Treaty.\n\nResp.

Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, September 5, 2008, **Exhibit RL-92**, \u00b6 96.\n\n417.\n\nIn its comments to Canada's Non-Disputing Party Submission, the Respondent noted that Canada confirmed that the general exception operates as a 'safety net' to protect State's exercise of regulatory powers in certain specific cases with legitimate objectives. Canada further explained that in the application of these regulatory powers there is no violation of the Treaty and therefore no State liability which means no payment of compensation is required. According to the Respondent, Canada explained that any other interpretation would render this general exception meaningless.581\n\nResp.

Republic of* Colombia, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, February 27, 2020, **Exhibit RL-134**, \u00b6 23.\n\n418.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes three requirements with respect to an environmental measure: (i) it is 'necessary', (ii) it does not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, and (iii) it is not a disguised restriction on international trade or investment.582 Thus, the Respondent concludes,\n\n[P]rovided that these narrow conditions are satisfied, where a measure falling within Article 2201(3) would otherwise amount to a breach of the investment protections provided under Chapter Eight of the FTA, that Article provides that a State will not be liable for any violation of Chapter Eight with respect to that measure.583\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 494.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 495.\n\n419.\n\nColombia argues that the measures were taken for purposes of protecting the *p\u00e1ramo* ecosystems with respect to the Claimant's Mining Titles as well as throughout the 36 *p\u00e1ramo* complexes in Colombia. First, the Respondent says, the measures, which resulted from a considered and elaborate policy-making process involving several governmental agencies and scrutiny of the Constitutional Court, are squarely within the autonomy enjoyed by States to determine their own policies under international law. Second, the Respondent alleges that these measures were necessary.584 The Respondent explained that in this case, the prohibition of mining in the *p\u00e1ramo*, a rare and fragile ecosystem, serves the objective of protecting the *p\u00e1ramo*. The Respondent contends that the burden is on the Claimant to show that the measures that would have permitted the Project to proceed would contribute to protecting the *p\u00e1ramo*.585 Third, the Respondent argues that the measures do not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investment or investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment as the prohibition on mining extends to all *p\u00e1ramo* areas, and all of the measures on which the Claimant relies apply indiscriminately to all investors and mining projects in Colombia.586\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 501.\n\n420.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's interpretation that Article 2201(3) only concerns the enforcement of existing environmental regulations and does not apply where measures impact an investment. The Respondent argues that this interpretation is unfounded and would render Article 2201(3) meaningless.587\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 400.\n\n421.\n\nFirst, Colombia argues that its interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of that provision's clear and unambiguous language. According to the Respondent, there is no indication in the language of Article 2201(3) that the Treaty Parties intended to be read 'restrictively' nor there is any basis for implying the limitation of 'environmental measures' constrained to existing measures.588 Second, the Respondent alleges that its interpretation is consistent with Canada's understanding of the meaning of Article 2201(3), read in the context of the Treaty's objective and purpose.589 Third, the Respondent argues that the 'restrictive' interpretation given by the Claimant under which any impact of an environmental measure on an investment would amount to a 'disguised restriction on international investment' would conflict with the Treaty's recognition of 'mutual supportiveness between trade and environmental policies.'590\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 403, *citing* Treaty, **Exhibit CL-1***,* Preamble.\n\n422.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the tribunal decisions cited by the Claimant in support of its interpretation. According to the Respondent, none of the authorities cited by the Claimant concerned the interpretation of Article 2201(3) or any equivalent provision. The Respondent also argues that the *Enron v. Argentina* and *Sempra v. Argentina* were cases that were based on different treaties, with different objects and purposes, based on different facts, and in the context of Argentina invoking a different exception, therefore, of no assistance to the present case.\n\n423.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates in its Rejoinder that the Claimant's claim falls within the Treaty's environmental exception.591 The Respondent argues that the measures were 'necessary' to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* through the prohibition of mining activities and other environmentally destructive activities, such as exploitation of hydrocarbons, which was achieved through Law 1450. According to the Respondent, because of the extreme sensitivity of the *p\u00e1ramo* to such activities, no other alternative exists to achieve this objective. The Respondent argues that the measures were 'necessary' and include the following: (i) Judgment T-361, which ensured the continuity in enforcing the prohibition on mining in *p\u00e1ramo* areas;592 (ii) Resolution 2090 taking into account social and economic criteria; (iii) transitional regimes in Law 1382 and Resolution 2090 demonstrate that the Ministry of Environment and the legislature sought to allow mining but the Constitutional Court, in looking at the effect on the protection of the *p\u00e1ramo*, invalidated a law that it considered contrary to the Constitution; (iv) the illegal mining activities have not been condoned by Colombia and is taking steps to combat and prevent it, and (v) the Claimant cannot show alternative proposals to protect the *p\u00e1ramo* which would need to take into account the methodology developed by the IAVH and the Ministry of Environment.593\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 407-413.\n\nDe Vivero Second Expert Report, Section VI.E.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 409.\n\n424.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that Colombia's measures did not constitute \"arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination.\"594 According to the Respondent, the Claimant has not demonstrated that Colombia's laws or policies allow illegal mining to continue. To the contrary, the Respondent says that it has taken actions prosecuting individuals, issuing and enforcing *amparos administrativos*, closing illegal mines, seizing and destroying materials and equipment to conduct illegal mining.595\n\nResp.

The Respondent adds that it did not prohibit mining in the *p\u00e1ramo* areas to allow illegal miners to operate in it. As explained, the Respondent says, Colombia is engaged in serious efforts to combat illegal mining in the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo*.596\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 411.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the measures were not a 'disguised restriction on international investment.' Once again, the Respondent explains, the purpose is to protect the Santurb\u00e1n *P\u00e1ramo* from harmful effects of mining exploitation activities, not to restrict foreign trade or investment.597\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 412.\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to put forward credible arguments disputing the applicability of the Treaty's environmental exception to the Claimant's claims. Therefore, the Respondent requests, \"should the Tribunal find any *prima facie* violations of the FTA on the facts of this case, it should find that Article 2201(3) applies and deny Red Eagle's claims in full on this basis.\"598\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 413.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the interpretation of Article 2201(3) where the Tribunal confirmed that the exceptions under this Article apply once there has been a determination that a primary obligation in Chapter Eight has been breached. Since no such breach has been determined by the majority of the Tribunal, there is no need to consider the scope or effect of Article 2201(3).\n\n**VII. DAMAGES**\n----------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Parties have presented extensive arguments on the *quantum* of damages. The majority of the Tribunal, having decided to reject all of the claims presented by the Claimant on their merits, the issue of damages does not require further consideration.\n\n430.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal takes note of, and agrees with, the conclusion of Mr. Mart\u00ednez de Hoz that \"on the basis of the information submitted by the Claimant\" it is not possible to assess that value of damages \"without additional information as the one as the one that could have been obtained in a subsequent quantum phase...\".599\n\nDissenting Opinion of Mr. Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, \u00b6 174.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**A. The Claimant's Statement on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n431.\n\nIn its Statement on Costs, the Claimant argues that the Respondent should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by the Claimant, including legal fees and expenses totaling USD 6,765,834.00, broken down as follows:\n\n**CLAIMANT\u2019S STATEMENT ON COSTS**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Experts | USD |\n| Legal Expert | 53,429 |\n| Technical Experts | 98,934 |\n| Quantum Experts | 399,451 |\n| Counsel |  |\n| Preparation of Case: Procedural Phase | 343,014 |\n| Bifurcation Phase | 137,249 |\n| Written Phase | 3,218.464 |\n| Hearing Post Hearing Phase | 1,651,901 |\n| Costs (as of 31 May 2023) |  |\n| General Costs | 63,362 |\n| ICSID Costs - Claimant | 400,000 |\n| ICSID Costs - Respondent | 400,000 |\n| **TOTAL** | **USD 6,765,834** |\n\n432.\n\nThe Claimant makes its claim on the basis that the Respondent has violated the Treaty and has refused to make advance payments to ICSID \"in blatant contravention of its obligations under the ICSID Convention and applicable rules.\" As such, the Claimant argues that it is entitled to the costs related to Colombia's repeated defaults in these proceedings.600601\n\nCl. Statement on Costs, p. 1.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that after the Claimant submitted its Statement on Costs, on May 16, 2023, ICSID made a third call for funds for a total of USD 400,000. On August 24, 2023, the Claimant made the advance payment to ICSID for USD 400,000. On August 30, 2023, ICSID confirm its receipt on August 24, 2023 of a wire transfer in the amount of USD 400,010 from the Claimant. The total of payments advanced to ICSID by the Claimant was USD 1,200,010.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Statement on Costs**\n------------------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nIn its Statement on Costs, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including the Respondent's legal fees and expenses totaling USD 2,900,042.24, broken down as follows:\n\nRespondent\u2019s Statement of Costs\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **A.** | **LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES:** |\n| Latham & Watkins LLP | US$ 2,065,000.00 |\n| **B.** | **PROFESSOR DE VIVERO (COLOMBIAN LAW EXPERT):** |  |\n|  | Fees | US$ 93,096.03 |\n|  | Expenses | US$ 4,802.46 |\n| **C.** | **THE BRATTLE GROUP AND MARIO ROSSI (QUANTUM AND MINING EXPERTS):** |\n|  | Fees and expenses | US$ 624,656.00 |\n| **D.** | **COLOMBIA'S IN-HOUSE COSTS:** |  |\n|  | In-House Team Salaries | US$ 98,862.081 |\n| **E.** | **HEARING COSTS:** |  |\n|  | Travel to Washington DC. accommodation and sustenance for the Respondent\u2019s representatives | US$ 9,538.96 |\n|  | Travel to Washington DC. accommodation and sustenance for the Respondent\u2019s witnesses | US$ 4.086.71 |\n| **F.** | **TOTAL (A + B + C + D + E) USS 2,900,042.24** |  |\n\n434.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should reject the Claimant's claims and order it to pay all of Colombia's costs, in line with established practice. Alternatively, should Red Eagle prevail, the Claimant should still bear Colombia's costs, \"in light of Red Eagle's abusive conduct in these proceedings which the Respondent has highlighted in its prior submissions and correspondence.\"602\n\nResp. Statement on Costs, p. 1.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n436.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs, including attorney's fees and other costs of arbitration, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n437.\n\nThe Claimant claims USD 5,965,834 in attorney's fees and expenses and USD 1,200,000 in advance payments to ICSID for the costs of arbitration. The Respondent claims USD 2,900,042.24 in attorney's fees and expenses and has not made any advance payments to ICSID.\n\n438.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |  |\n| Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, President | 144,475.00 |\n| Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, Co-arbitrator | 250,595.04 |\n| Prof. Philippe Sands, Co-arbitrator | 129,434.00 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 252,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 145,733.85 |\n| **Total** | **922,237.89** |\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal has rejected the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction of the Tribunal and found the Claimant's claims to have no merit. In light of these circumstances, with respect to the claimed attorney's fees and expenses, the Tribunal considers reasonable that each party bear its own attorney's fees and expenses.\n\n440.\n\nIn allocating the arbitration costs, the Tribunal bears in mind that the Respondent ignored the Tribunal's requests to pay its corresponding share of the advances notwithstanding the mandatory wording of the ICSID Convention Article 61(2); ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14 (2006); and Arbitration Rule 28, and that the Claimant paid for the entirety of the advances requested. The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent's bifurcation request and objections to the jurisdiction have been rejected.\n\n441.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, and subject to the Declaration of Professor Sands, the Tribunal considers reasonable that, notwithstanding the fact that the Claimant's claims have been rejected, the Respondent pay its corresponding half of the costs of arbitration.\n\n442.\n\nThe costs of arbitration have been paid out of the advances made by the Claimant.603 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 461,118.95.\n\nThe remaining balance of the advance payments will be reimbursed to the Claimant.\n\n443.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to reimburse USD 461,118.95 to the Claimant for its corresponding share of the arbitration costs.\n\n**IX. AWARD**\n-------------\n\n444.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) dismisses all objections to its jurisdiction presented by the Respondent;\n\n(2) by majority of Arbitrators Rigo and Sands rejects all the claims presented by the Claimant;\n\n(3) by majority of Arbitrators Rigo and Mart\u00ednez de Hoz orders the Respondent to pay the Claimant USD 461,118.95 towards the costs of the arbitration detailed above.\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez de Hoz dissents with the opinion of the majority of the Tribunal in a separate Dissenting Opinion that is attached hereto. Professor Sands adds a Declaration attached hereto."}]}
