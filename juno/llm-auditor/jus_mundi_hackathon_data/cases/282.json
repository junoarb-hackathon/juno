Haigh\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI respectfully disagree with the majority's findings at \u00b6\u00b6 627 and following of the Award that the refusal of the Government of Qu\u00e9bec to make provision for compensation for the revocation of the River Permit was not inherently unjust conduct.\n\n2.\n\nWhile I accept the view of the majority of the Tribunal that Claimant may have become ambivalent about its argument concerning the Qu\u00e9bec Government's failure to compensate it for the cancellation of its River Permit, my ultimate concern is with what occurred in the National Assembly and in the Government. The opposition parties had cornered the Government with their more absolutist objection to oil and gas exploration either on or under the St. Lawrence River. On this matter, the Government was not going to be out-bid in demonstrating its virtue and thus proposed the measure at issue in this arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nThe statement by Minister Normandeau that she did not believe the population would support compensation to oil and gas companies was undoubtedly a popular stance. I do not question Minister Normandeau's political instincts nor the fact that the legislation was passed unanimously. Clearly, nobody was going to oppose this bill; not one single member of the National Assembly voted against it. In my opinion, however, that political unanimity does not equate to fairness or the legitimate exercise of authority. The government did not implement the measure as part of a transparent and cohesive plan, based on proper analysis and considerations. Instead, the Minister simply announced her government's decision not to compensate the holders of the River Permit, clearly to great acclaim.\n\n4.\n\nIn my view this was an abusive exercise of authority and disregarded what, until then, had been properly pursued exploration activity and legitimately incurred expenditure. It is merely *post facto* rationalization to say that the costs incurred by Claimant were not directly spent on the permitted holdings under the river; in my view they were part of an inextricably logical and sequential geological exploration program leading to the ultimate exploitation of that holding.\n\n5.\n\nWhen governments, even ones supported by the unanimous votes of the legislature, choose to end rights like exploration permits, they should have regard for what they have previously encouraged and allowed. I consider the decision taken by the National Assembly of Quebec to cancel the River Permit without compensation to have been callous and unjust and contrary to even the minimum standard of treatment that a party such as Claimant was legitimately entitled to expect. Confiscating Claimant's investment without compensation in this case was without any proper basis, was unprincipled and simply politically expedient. Such abusive action should not be condoned."}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**TABLE OF DEFINED TERMS**\n--------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Term** | **Description** |\n| 2001 FTC Note | FTC's Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions dated 31 July 2001 |\n| Act | *Act to limit oil and gas activities,* passed in the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly on 10 June 2011, which entered into force on 13 June 2011 |\n| Adam First Statement | Witness Statement of Mr. Marc-Antoine Adam dated 3 August 2017 |\n| Arbitration Costs | Costs excluding costs of legal representation and assistance, referred to in Article 40(a)-(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules |\n| Asselin First Statement | Witness Statement of Ms. Luce Asselin dated 16 July 2015 |\n| Asselin Second Statement | Witness Statement of Ms. Luce Asselin dated 28 July 2017 |\n| Assignment Agreements | Forest Oil - Enterprise Assignment Agreement, Original Permits Assignment Agreement and the River Permit Assignment Agreement, collectively |\n| Axani First Statement | Witness Statement of Mr. Douglas W.

Claimant contends that the actions of the Government of Qu\u00e9bec violate the substantive protections offered under NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent, the Government of Canada (**\"Canada\"** or **\"Respondent\"**), objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and also denies Claimant\u2019s assertions regarding the alleged violations of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110.\n\n4.\n\nThis Final Award is divided into the following Sections.

Veeder Q.C. as President of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the Tribunal held the first procedural meeting by telephone conference. The Parties confirmed during the procedural meeting, *inter alia,* that (i) the Tribunal has been duly constituted in accordance with NAFTA Article 1123; (ii) the place of arbitration is Ottawa, although hearings in the arbitration could be held at other locations if so ordered by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties; (iii) NAFTA Article 1131 sets out the governing law for the dispute; and (iv) the applicable arbitration rules are the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as revised in 2010 and as adopted in 2013, except to the extent that they conflict with or are modified by Section B of Chapter 11 as per NAFTA Article 1120(2) or the forthcoming Procedural Order No. 1. The agreement of the Parties was embodied in the Minutes of the First Session signed by the President of the Tribunal and subsequently issued to the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nBy emails of 16 January 2015, the Parties jointly requested that ICSID administers the proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 19 January 2015, ICSID informed the Parties that it accepted their request to administer the proceedings. The case was assigned ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/2. Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nOn the same date, *i.e.,* 19 January 2015, the Parties submitted a joint written submission on two matters on which they had disagreed during the first procedural meeting, referred to in \u00b6 17 above: (i) the language(s) of the arbitration; and (ii) the procedural schedule regarding document production.\n\n21.\n\nOn 23 January 2015, Claimant filed a written submission on the two disputed issues, referred to in \u00b6 20 above. Claimant submitted that English should be the language of the arbitration. On the document production issue, Claimant submitted that the Parties should simultaneously exchange requests for document production after the first exchange of substantive written pleadings (i.e., Claimant\u2019s Memorial and Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, but before Claimant\u2019s Reply and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder).\n\n22.\n\nOn the same date, i.e., 23 January 2015, Respondent filed a written submission on the two disputed issues, referred to in \u00b6 20 above. It submitted, *inter alia*, that the languages of the arbitration should be both English and French (as each Party may choose), with no requirement for any translation imposed on either Party. It also submitted that document production should take place before the first exchange of substantive written pleadings, *i. e.*, after Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration but before Claimant\u2019s Memorial.\n\n23.\n\nOn 6 February 2015, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order on the Two Disputed Issues (**\"Procedural Order on Two Disputed Issues\"**), which provided in relevant part that:\n\n18. The Tribunal has decided that English and French shall both be the languages of this arbitration. [...]\n\n24. The Tribunal decides that, whilst requests for document production can be made in advance of the Parties' Memorial and Counter-Memorial (even now, as is the case), the stage of document production and the Tribunal's involvement over disputed requests shall take place after the Respondent's Counter-Memorial and before the Claimant's Reply Memorial, with the Parties' simultaneous requests for the production of documents.\n\n25. Given the high level of co-operation between the Parties in this arbitration, the Tribunal is content to leave the Parties to work out the time-tabling consequences of the Tribunal's decision and to complete accordingly their joint draft of the first procedural order, as soon as practicable.\n\n24.\n\nOn 10 February 2015, the Centre requested an advance payment of USD 100,000 from each Party.\n\n25.\n\nOn 27 February 2015, Respondent submitted its Response to the Notice of Arbitration (**\"Response\"**).\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 establishing the procedural rules governing the arbitration (**\"PO 1\"**). PO 1 records, amongst others, that:\n\n(i) the Parties agree and confirm that the Tribunal has been duly constituted in accordance with NAFTA Article 1123;\n\n(ii) the place of arbitration is Ottawa;\n\n(iii) the law governing the disputes in the arbitration is NAFTA Article 1131;\n\n(iv) the applicable arbitration rules are the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as revised in 2010 and as adopted in 2013, except to the extent that they conflict or are modified by Section B of Chapter 11 as per NAFTA Article 1120(2) or PO 1. Should the UNCITRAL Rules and PO 1 not address a specific procedural issue, the Tribunal shall, after consultation with the disputing parties, determine the applicable procedure;\n\n(v) the Tribunal shall consult Articles 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 of the International Bar Association's Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration 2010 (**\"IBA Rules\"**) as guidance for deciding evidentiary matters; and\n\n(vi) English and French are the languages of the arbitration.\n\n27.\n\nAlso on 11 March 2015, the Tribunal issued another Procedural Order addressing matters concerning the confidentiality of the arbitration (\"**Confidentiality Order**\").\n\n28.\n\nOn 19 March 2015, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Parties\u2019 payments of the requested advances on costs, referred to in \u00b6 24 above.\n\n29.\n\nOn 10 April 2015, Claimant filed a Memorial (**\"Memorial\"**), accompanied by Exhibits C-1 to C-102, Legal Authorities CLA-1 to CLA-64, Witness Statement of Mr. Douglas W.

Respondent requested the Tribunal to stay the document production deadline fixed in said Order by 15 days until the requested clarifications were provided by the Tribunal.\n\n54.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, Claimant submitted that one of the clarifications requested by Respondent was in fact an attempt by Respondent to re-argue its position and opposed such attempt. Claimant also opposed Respondent's request for stay and reserved its right to request an amendment of the procedural timetable such that its Reply was only due eight weeks after receipt of Respondent's documents.\n\n55.\n\nOn 1 March 2017, the Tribunal provided the clarifications requested by Respondent. The Tribunal rejected Respondent's request for a stay of its Order on Withheld and Redacted Documentation but extended the deadline for production of documents by a maximum of seven days.\n\n56.\n\nOn 17 March 2017, Respondent provided Claimant with 14 out of the 23 documents, which the Tribunal had ordered Respondent to produce in its Order on Withheld and Redacted Documentation.\n\n57.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, Claimant filed an application alleging that Respondent has failed to comply with the Tribunal's Order on Withheld and Redacted Documentation and requested the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) issue a declaration that Respondent is in a deliberate violation of an Order from the Tribunal and of its obligations under NAFTA and international law;\n\n(ii) draw adverse inferences from Respondent's refusal to produce documents;\n\n(iii) strike out portions of Respondent's pleadings and evidence;\n\n(iv) declare that Respondent is precluded from making a number of specific submissions to the Tribunal in relation to Bill 18;\n\n(v) direct Respondent to pay an interim award to Claimant in the amount of USD 50,000;\n\n(vi) direct Respondent to transmit certain documents referred in its privilege log to the Tribunal for determination whether they in fact meet the requirements of solicitor-client privilege;\n\n(vii) confirm that the procedural timetable fixed in the arbitration did not require Claimant to file its Reply earlier than 12 May 2017; and\n\n(viii) modify the procedural timetable such that the filing date of Claimant\u2019s Reply would be postponed to 26 May 2017 (with a corresponding curtailment of time for the filing of Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder).\n\n58.\n\nOn 10 April 2017, Respondent requested the Tribunal to reject in entirety Claimant\u2019s requests, referred to in \u00b6 57 above, and proposed that the deadline for the filing of Claimant\u2019s Reply may be postponed to 4 May 2017.\n\n59.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent also informed Claimant about 26 additional responsive documents that were unaccounted for in its production index or privilege logs. Respondent explained that 10 of these documents could be produced by it entirely or in a lightly redacted form and had been uploaded to the case\u2019s folder on ICSID\u2019s file sharing platform. Respondent added that the remaining 16 documents were withheld entirely, pursuant to solicitor-client privilege and/or special political or institutional sensitivity. Respondent also stated that in its view, this additional production of documents had no significant impact on the timetable of the proceedings.\n\n60.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, Claimant indicated to Respondent that it had no objection to the non-production of the additional documents over which Respondent asserted solicitor-client privilege. However, Claimant objected to the non-production of additional documents over which a claim of political or institutional sensitivity was asserted and requested the production of further additional documents. Claimant further added that it disagreed with Respondent\u2019s assertion that the production of additional documents had no significant impact of the procedural timetable.\n\n61.\n\nOn 21 April 2017, Respondent addressed Claimant's position and arguments and reiterated that in its view, its limited additional production of 10 documents did not warrant any further modifications to the procedural timetable than those proposed in Claimant's letter to the Tribunal of 10 April 2017.\n\n62.\n\nOn 27 April 2017, Claimant filed an application seeking a further postponement of the deadline for filing its Reply, until at least 5 June 2017.\n\n63.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, Respondent opposed Claimant's application, referred to in \u00b6 62 above, submitting that the deadline for Claimant's Reply may be extended at the latest until 9 May 2017.\n\n64.\n\nOn 4 May 2017, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order on Claimant's Applications dated 31 March 2017 and 27 April 2017 regarding production of documents and the procedural timetable (**\"Procedural Order on Claimant\u2019s Applications of 31 March and 27 April 2017\"**).\n\n65.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, Claimant filed its Reply (**\"Reply\"**), accompanied by Exhibits C-103 to C-160, Legal Authorities CLA-65 to CLA-108, Witness Statement of Mr. Douglas W.

Gagn\u00e9 (expert);  \n\u2022 Mr. Cary Mamer (expert);  \n\u2022 Mr. Robin G. Bertram (expert); and  \n\u2022 Mr. Larry D. Boyd (expert).\n\n92.\n\nOn 5 November 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to address the following questions and topics (**\"Tribunal\u2019s Questions to the Parties\"**) in the forthcoming one-day hearing, which was scheduled for 24 November 2017 for the Parties to make oral closing submissions (**\"November 2017 Merits Hearing\"**):\n\n***(A) Jurisdiction/Admissibility \u2014 NAFTA Articles 1139(g) and 1139(h)***\n\n1. Generally, what is the Claimant's \"investment\", as an objective fact: (i) the River Permit 490 only or (ii) the River and Land Permits as a whole? As regards the factual evidence, it will be recalled that the Claimant's witnesses (particularly Mr Axani) testified that the permits were seen as a whole, not individually.\n\n2. For this purpose, is the test under NAFTA Article 1139 an objective or a subjective test? In other words, as to the latter, can a claimant for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction subjectively carve out a particular \"investment\", as a stand-alone \"investment\", from a larger \"investment\" assessed objectively as regards both jurisdiction and the merits?\n\n3. The Claimant\u2019s \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139(g), as \"intangible property rights\": If the Claimant\u2019s investment under Article 1139 were to comprise the River and Land Permits as a whole (and not merely the River Permit), does the Respondent accept that such investment would satisfy the requirements of NAFTA Article 1139(g) - subject to Quebec law as to real and personal rights?\n\n4. The Claimant\u2019s \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139(h), as \"interests arisingfrom the commitment of capital\": If the Claimant\u2019s investment under Article 1139 were to comprise the River and Land Permits as a whole (and not merely the River Permit), does the Respondent accept that such investment would satisfy the requirements of NAFTA Article 1139(h) - subject to Quebec law as to real and personal rights?\n\n5. As to NAFTA Article 1101(1) and Bill 18 as the relevant measure, the Tribunal understands the Parties to be agreed as to the test formulated in Methanex v USA (i.e., a \"legally significant connection\"): does the Claimant accept that there was no targeted malice committed by the Respondent towards the Claimant or its \"investment\"?\n\n6. If not, the Claimant should identify from its existing pleadings the specific allegations upon which it relies, together with all evidential references said to support such allegations.\n\n7. In regard to the Agreements of 29 November and 14 December 2006, does Quebec law (as the applicable law) recognise any doctrine of rectification or reformation, as distinct, if different, from contractual interpretation to determine the common intentions of the contracting parties (Junex and Forest Oil)? If so, is that doctrine relevant in the present case?\n\n8. For the purpose of applying international law under NAFTA in determining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, is there a distinction between a bare legal title and a beneficial interest; and, if so, would such a distinction be relevant to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections in the present case?\n\n***(B) NAFTA Article 1105 \u2014 Customary Standard***\n\n9. The Tribunal understands the Parties to be agreed to the application under NAFTA Article 1105 of the customary international law standard confirmed or established by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission of 2001. The Parties are invited to elaborate further upon the specific content of that customary standard, particularly if and to the extent that it may have evolved since the *Neer Case* and/or 2001.\n\n10. The Parties' pleadings and certain of the witnesses referred to a general consideration of \"pr\u00e9caution\" (principally: the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 110 and 363; the Respondent's Rejoinder, paragraphs 46 and 236; the oral testimony of Mr. Gosselin; and the statement of Mr. Arcand in C-054): is there such a legal principle of \"precaution\" under international law; and, if so, is it relevant to the content of the customary standard in the present case as part of any margin of appreciation to be afforded to the Respondent?\n\n11. Have the Claimant and/or its quantum expert witnesses advanced any separate methodology for compensation under NAFTA Article 1105 (as distinct from expropriation under NAFTA Article 1110)?\n\n12. If so, the Claimant should identify from its existing pleadings the specific methodology upon which it relies in regard to NAFTA Article 1105, together with all evidential expert references said to support such methodology.\n\n13. If and to the extent relevant to this case, the Tribunal here draws the Parties' attention to the Institute of International Law's Resolution: \"Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor Against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-State Treaties\" of 13 September 2013, Article 13, paragraph 3 (\"Compensation due to an investor for violation of the FET standard shall be assessed without regard to compensation that could be allocated in case of an expropriation, in accordance with the damage suffered by the investor\").\n\n***(C) NAFTA Article 1110 \u2014 (Uncompensated) Expropriation***\n\n14. On the assumption (here assumed for the sake of argument only) that the Claimant's \"investment\" comprised the River and Land Permits as a whole (and not merely the River Permit), the Claimant should clarify its pleaded case on the alleged expropriation of such investment as a whole under NAFTA Article 1110, given that (as the Tribunal understands), in contrast to the River Permit, the Land Permits are not alleged to have been similarly expropriated by the Respondent.\n\n***(D) Compensation***\n\n15. The Parties, but particularly the Respondent, should explain, by reference to the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the factual basis for the Respondent's decision not to pay any compensation to the Claimant and, specifically, whether there was any specific assessment by the Respondent of the wasted expenditure to be sustained by the Claimant under Bill 18. In both cases, the Tribunal requests a list of the relevant evidential references. (The Tribunal does not thereby require the Respondent to waive any privilege as to legal advice).\n\n16. Mirroring the topics listed above (see Nos 11 and 12), the Claimant is requested to confirm that its methodology as to quantum is based on expropriation under NAFTA Article 1010 and not separately under NAFTA Article 1105.\n\n***(E)** \"**Adverse Inferences\" Etc.***\n\n17. The Tribunal refers to the Claimant\u2019s submissions regarding the Respondent\u2019s non-compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s procedural orders regarding document production and redaction by the Respondent.\n\n18. First, the Tribunal wishes to be taken through the specific documentation said by the Claimant to constitute the Respondent\u2019s non-compliance and its materiality to the issues before the Tribunal, particularly the contemporary documentation and related testimony for the period from January 2010 to June 2011.\n\n19. Second, the Parties are requested to address the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s powers in the event of such material non-compliance, both as to any adverse inferences as well as any costs order, other sanction or compensation for breach of any duty to arbitrate in good faith.\n\n***(F) The Claimant\u2019s Prayer for Relief***\n\n20. The Claimant is requested to confirm or complete its final claim for relief, as currently pleaded in its Reply Memorial:\n\n*\"714. As a result of Canada's breaches of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA described above, the Enterprise has suffered significant loss and damage for which the Claimant requests the following relief pursuant to NAFTA Article 1117:*\n\n*(a) A declaration that Canada has breached its obligations under Article 1110(1) and Article 1105(1) of NAFTA and is liable to the Claimant therefore;*\n\n*(b) An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at the hearing but which the Claimant currently estimates to be US$103,600,000 inclusive of pre-award interest;*\n\n*(c) An award of the full costs associated with this arbitration, including professional and legal fees and disbursements, as well as the fees and disbursements of the Tribunal and the Administrative Authority;*\n\n*(d) An award of pre-award (as included in compensatory damages) and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal;*\n\n*(e) An award of compensation equal to any tax consequences of the award, in order to maintain the award's integrity; and*\n\n*(f) An award of any such further relief that the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate. \"*\n\n***(G) The Respondent\u2019s Prayer for Relief***\n\n21. The Respondent is requested to confirm or complete its final claim for relief, as currently pleaded in its Answer dated 27 February 2015:\n\n*\"114. Pour ces motifs, le Canada demande respectueusement au Tribunal de:*\n\n*a) Rejeter la totalit\u00e9 de la demande de LPRC [Lone Pine Resources Inc.]; et*\n\n*b) Ordonner \u00e0 la demanderesse de supporter la totalit\u00e9 des frais d'arbitrage, incluantles frais juridiques du Canada en vertu de l'article 1135(1) de l'AL\u00c9NA et de l'article 42 des r\u00e8gles d'arbitrage de la CNUDCI; et*\n\n*c) Ordonner toute autre indemnit\u00e9 qu 'il estime appropri\u00e9e. \"*\n\n***(H) Costs***\n\n22. The Tribunal understands that the Parties jointly seek from the Tribunal a first partial award deciding issues of jurisdiction/admissibility and merits (including pre-award and post-award interest), excepting only issues as to the allocation and quantification of arbitration and legal costs to be addressed later, after hearing the Parties in writing, by a separate final award. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties are invited to confirm such request.\n\n93.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal and ICSID of their agreement to hold the November 2017 Merits Hearing at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Montreal. On 7 November 2017, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' agreement and confirmed that the November 2017 Merits Hearing would take place in Montreal.\n\n94.\n\nOn 17 November 2017, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that, for medical reasons, he would likely be unable to travel to Montreal to attend the November 2017 Merits Hearing in person, but would be able to attend by video conference from London.\n\n95.\n\nOn 17 November 2017, ICSID informed USA and Mexico that the November 2017 Merits Hearing would be held at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s de Montr\u00e9al, 1001 Jean-Paul-Riopelle Pl, Montreal QC H2Z 1H5, Canada on 24 November 2017.\n\n96.\n\nOn 20 November 2017, USA informed ICSID that its representatives would not be attending the November 2017 Merits Hearing.\n\n97.\n\nOn 21 November 2017, Mexico informed ICSID that its representatives would not be attending the November 2017 Merits Hearing.\n\n98.\n\nOn 22 November 2017, ICSID confirmed to the Parties that the President of the Tribunal would participate in the November 2017 Merits Hearing by video conference. ICSID confirmed that the participants in the Hearing room in Montreal would be able to see and hear the President, and that the President would hear and see the Hearing room, including documents and presentations shown by the Parties. The Parties were invited to provide the President with an electronic copy of their presentations and any demonstrative exhibits that they intended to display at the Hearing, at least 30 minutes in advance of their presentations.\n\n99.\n\nOn 24 November 2017, the Tribunal held the November 2017 Merits Hearing.

On 23 December 2017, Claimant indicated that it would respond in substance to Respondent's requests in the new year.\n\n101.\n\nOn 9 January 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimant to respond to Respondent's requests of 21 December 2017 at the latest by 12 January 2018.\n\n102.\n\nOn 12 January 2018, Claimant responded to Respondent's request, objecting to all but one of Respondent's requests.\n\n103.\n\nOn 9 March 2020, ICSID informed the Parties that the President of the Tribunal had passed away, and that, pursuant to Articles 1 and 14 of the UNCITRAL Rules and NAFTA Article 1123, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.\n\n104.\n\nOn 17 April 2020, the Parties requested the remaining members of the Tribunal to provide additional information about the status of their deliberations with respect to the issues in dispute and drafting of the Award, before the passing of the President of the Tribunal.\n\n105.\n\nOn 27 April 2020, the remaining members of the Tribunal conveyed the following message to the Parties:\n\nThe Tribunal has indeed had some deliberations which reflected a different approach by the two remaining arbitrators as well as the position of the President, but nothing was recorded in writing at that point.\n\nThey think however that once a new President is appointed, it should be her or his decision to ask the two co-arbitrators to inform her or him of the status of their discussions, and/or to indicate whether she or he prefers to start from a \"tabula rasa\" and hold a new hearing.\n\n106.\n\nOn 28 August 2020, the Parties transmitted to ICSID a statement of availability from the candidate they were considering appointing as president of the Tribunal. The Parties requested the remaining members of the Tribunal to provide feedback, if any, regarding the candidate\u2019s availability in light of their own schedules.\n\n107.\n\nOn 9 September 2020, ICSID transmitted to the Parties the statements of availability of the remaining members of the Tribunal.\n\n108.\n\nOn 18 September 2020, the Parties appointed Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg as President of the Tribunal.\n\n109.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, Professor Dr. van den Berg accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal, thereby reconstituting the Tribunal. Professor Dr. van den Berg\u2019s address is:\n\nProfessor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg  \nHanotiau & van den Berg  \nIT Tower, 9th Floor  \nAvenue Louise 480 bte 9  \n1050 Brussels  \nBelgium  \nT: +32 2-290-3913  \nE: ajvandenberg@hvdb.com\n\n110.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, the Tribunal proposed to organize a case management conference with the Parties to discuss the resumption of the arbitration and the next steps in the proceedings. The Tribunal shared a draft agenda for the proposed case management conference with the Parties, inviting them to provide their comments on the agenda and to confirm their availability for the conference.\n\n111.\n\nOn 5 October 2020, following Respondent's email of 2 October 2020, wherein Respondent advised the Tribunal that it was not available for the proposed case management conference on the date indicated by the Tribunal, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their comments on the draft agenda in writing, following which a case management conference could be organized with the Parties to resolve any outstanding issues, as required. The Tribunal further advised the Parties of its intention to conduct a short, two-day \"refresher\" hearing through video conference as a result of the reconstitution of the Tribunal, with the view that each Party would present its case, without re-hearing witness and expert evidence. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit, prior to this \"refresher\" hearing, simultaneous post-hearing briefs, which recapitulate the evidence submitted during the October 2017 Merits Hearing and the November 2017 Merits Hearing (together, the **\"2017 Hearings\"**), with appropriate references to the transcripts of the 2017 Hearings.\n\n112.\n\nOn 9 October 2020, Claimant posed certain queries to the President of the Tribunal with respect to a disclosure made by Respondent. Claimant also requested an extension of time, until 19 October 2020, to submit the Parties' comments on the draft agenda of the case management conference.\n\n113.\n\nOn 10 October 2020, Respondent provided the Tribunal with the entire disclosure, which it had transmitted to Claimant, referred to in \u00b6 112 above.\n\n114.\n\nOn 12 October 2020, the Tribunal granted Claimant's request for an extension of time to submit the Parties' comments on the agenda of the case management conference and their proposals on the next steps in this arbitration, referred to in \u00b6 112 above.\n\n115.\n\nOn 12 October 2020, the President of the Tribunal responded to Claimant's queries, concerning Respondent's disclosure, referred to in \u00b6\u00b6 112 and 113 above.\n\n116.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, Claimant confirmed that it was satisfied with the President's responses, referred to in \u00b6 115 above, and had no further queries in that regard.\n\n117.\n\nOn 19 October 2020, the Parties provided their comments on the draft agenda of the case management conference and their proposals on the next steps in this arbitration. The Parties confirmed that they agreed to the application of Articles 15 and 17 of the UNICTRAL Rules for the resumption and conduct of this arbitration. The Parties jointly proposed the deadline for filing the simultaneous filing of their post-hearing briefs and provided their availabilities for a two-day virtual \"refresher\" hearing, as requested by the Tribunal. The Parties requested the Tribunal to direct that the post-hearing briefs and \"refresher\" hearing are not opportunities for either party to file new evidence or present new theories of the case. The Parties advised the Tribunal that they had been unable to reach an agreement on whether they could refer to any evolution in governing law or new arbitral awards that have been rendered since November 2017. In this connection, the Parties proposed to make separate submissions to the Tribunal on this point by a deadline, subject to any parameters set by the Tribunal.\n\n118.\n\nOn 26 October 2020, the Tribunal (i) confirmed that the date for the filing of the Parties\u2019 simultaneous post-hearing briefs shall be 22 January 2021, (ii) proposed to hold the two-day \"refresher\" hearing on 25 and 26 February 2021 by video conference, (iii) indicated that it may pose questions to the Parties before the \"refresher\" hearing, and would do so no later than one week before the \"refresher\" hearing, (iv) confirmed that it did not envision the post-hearing briefs and refresher hearing as an opportunity for the Parties to file new evidence and/or present new legal arguments and (v) invited the Parties to simultaneously submit, within two weeks, i.e., by 9 November 2020, their observations on the issue of the filing of new legal authorities or arbitral awards rendered since November 2017.\n\n119.\n\nOn 9 November 2020, each Party submitted its observations on the issue of the filing of new legal authorities or arbitral awards rendered since November 2017.\n\n120.\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Tribunal directed the Parties to submit (i) within two weeks, a list of the new legal authorities they wish to introduce into the record; (ii) within two weeks of the submission of the aforementioned lists, a list of rebuttal authorities as well as objections to the proposed list of authorities, if any. The Tribunal further indicated that (i) should there be no objection to the admission of these new authorities, the Parties may proceed to submit them into the record; and (ii) should objections be raised by a Party, the Tribunal shall decide on the objections after giving the other Party an opportunity to respond.\n\n121.\n\nOn 30 November 2020, the Parties submitted their respective lists of new legal authorities.\n\n122.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, the Parties submitted their objections and observations on the other Party's list of new legal authorities. Respondent indicated that it did not have objections to Claimant's new legal authorities.\n\n123.\n\nOn 17 December 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit, by 23 December 2020, their responses, if any, to each other's objections of 14 December 2020.\n\n124.\n\nOn 23 December 2020, the Parties submitted their respective observations to each other's objections to their list of new legal authorities. Considering the absence of any objections by Respondent to Claimant's proposed new legal authorities, Claimant submitted said legal authorities, numbered Exhibits CLA-113 to CLA-116.\n\n125.\n\nOn 30 December 2020, the Tribunal permitted Respondent to introduce certain of its proposed new legal authorities into the record, which were submitted by Respondent as Exhibits RLA-119 to RLA-128.16\n\nAll new legal authorities submitted by the Parties have been uploaded to the case's folder on Box.\n\n126.\n\nOn 22 January 2021, the Parties filed their respective post-hearing briefs summarizing the dispute and evidence heard at the October 2017 Merits Hearing. Claimant's post-hearing brief is referred to as the **\"C-PHB\"** and Respondent's post-hearing brief is referred to as the **\"R-PHB\"**.\n\n127.\n\nOn 9 February 2021, the Tribunal circulated to the Parties the English version of draft Procedural Order No. 8.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Shale Gas Exploration and Development**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nSet out below is a brief description of concepts and terms that are relevant to the law and practice of shale gas exploration and development in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n**(1) St. Lawrence Lowlands and the St. Lawrence River**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands is a region of Qu\u00e9bec which begins at Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s southern border and extends northwards. The St. Lawrence Lowlands include a 400-kilometer section of the freshwater St. Lawrence River.17 The St. Lawrence Lowlands and a part of the St. Lawrence River contains Utica Shale.18\n\nMemorial, Glossary.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 137.\n\n144.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 disputes in this arbitration relate to the Government of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s revocation of nine exploration permits held under the St. Lawrence River.19\n\nThe St. Lawrence River begins at the outflow of the Great Lakes, near the Qu\u00e9bec-USA border. Around 550 kilometers downstream from the border, the St. Lawrence River widens and becomes the maritime St. Lawrence Estuary, which opens into the northwestern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (see Memorial, Glossary). Respondent describes the St. Lawrence River as an exceptional environment known for its history, biodiversity, and seaway to the Great Lakes. It states that the St. Lawrence River serves as drinking water supply for more than half of Qu\u00e9bec's population and supports a range of key socio-economic sectors for Qu\u00e9bec and Canada (see Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 4).\n\n**(2) Utica Shale**\n-------------------\n\n145.\n\nUtica Shale is a carbonate rich shale20 sequence that is located in southeastern Qu\u00e9bec and northeastern USA.21 The Utica Shale geological formation is made up of a low porosity and low permeability sedimentary clay rock containing natural gas in varying proportions.22\n\nShale is a sedimentary deposit that generally combines clay, silica (e.g., quartz), carbonate (e.g., calcite or dolmite) and organic material. Shale contains tiny pores in which natural gas or oil is trapped. See Memorial, \u00b6 30, **Exh. C-074**, National Energy Board, \"A Primer for Understanding Canadian Shale Gas\", November 2009, p. 2.\n\nMemorial, Glossary. See also FTI First Report, \u00b6 5.8.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 38.\n\n**(3) Shale Gas**\n-----------------\n\n146.\n\nShale gas is natural gas that is trapped in the pores of shale rock.\n\n**(4) Hydraulic Fracturing and Horizontal Drilling**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nHydraulic fracturing is a stimulation technique for extracting natural gas from shale formations, primarily from shallow vertical wells that rely on natural fracturing to produce low rates over a long time. The process involves a combination of water, sand, and chemicals being pumped into a wellbore with sufficient pressure to widen naturally occurring fissures in the rock, enabling the backflow of gas, oil, salt water and the fracking fluid into the well for extraction.23\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; citing **Exh. C-074**, National Energy Board, \"A Primer for Understanding Canadian Shale Gas\", November 2009, p. 3.\n\n148.\n\nAccording to Claimant, since the mid-2000s, the process of hydraulic fracturing has been used in combination with horizontal drilling as a standard way to extract natural gas from so-called \"unconventional\" resources.24 The combined process of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling entails the drilling of a vertical well to a predetermined depth above a shale gas or oil reservoir, which is then drilled at an increasing angle until it meets the reservoir depth. Once it reaches that depth, a wellbore is drilled horizontally, sometimes up to 2,500 meters. Thereafter, the shale rock surrounding the wellbore is fractured, either to intersect and open existing natural fractures in the shale, or to create new fractures, thereby creating pathways by which the natural gas and oil can flow into the wellbore for extraction.25 Horizontal drilling ensures that the surface footprint of the drilling operation can be small, and the productivity of the well can be increased by enabling a greater contact area within the shale deposit.26\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; citing **Exh. C-081**, \"Use of Horizontal Drilling and Hydraulic Fracturing, Western Canada, 2006 to 2013.\" This document was created by the Enterprise, based on public Government data from geoScout, a software for oil and gas industry professionals.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 34.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; citing **Exh. C-081**, \"Use of Horizontal Drilling and Hydraulic Fracturing, Western Canada, 2006 to 2013.\" This document was created by the Enterprise, based on public Government data from geoScout, a software for oil and gas industry professionals.\n\n149.\n\nRespondent submits that the combined technique of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract shale gas is a relatively new one and its effects on the environment and human health are not entirely clear and are being examined in several jurisdictions, including in Qu\u00e9bec. Respondent submits that France has banned the use of this technique.27\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 17.\n\n**(5) Conventional and Non-Conventional Resources**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nConventional and non-conventional resources for gas extraction are distinguished on the basis of their resource base. Shale gas and oil are classified as unconventional resources because the shale layer does not permit gas and oil to flow through it easily. Juxtaposed with this, conventional oil and gas are produced from pools in which they gather.28\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 33.\n\n**(6) Relevant Laws and Regulations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nLegislative jurisdiction in Canada is divided among the federal and provincial governments, including the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly.29 Section 109 of the Canadian Constitution Act, 1867 (the **\"Constitution\"**) provides that the provinces own the natural resources within their boundaries. Section 92 of the Constitution vests the provinces with exclusive legislative authority over, *inter alia,* property and civil rights. Section 92A of the Constitution further grants the provinces the exclusive jurisdiction to legislate with respect to exploration, development and conservation of non-renewable natural resources.30\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 42; citing **Exh. R-094**, Henri Brun & Guy Tremblay, Droit Constitutionnel, 5e \u00e9d., Cowansville, Les \u00c9ditions Yvon Blais, 2008, 1548, p. 141.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 43; citing **Exh. R-133**, Loi constitutionnelle de 1867 (R-U), 30 & 31 Vict, c 3. See also Memorial, \u00b6 61.\n\n152.\n\nThe oil and gas industry in Canada is subject to the general mining regime.31 In Qu\u00e9bec, shale gas exploration and development is regulated by the provincial Mining Act, RSQ c. M-13.1 (the **\"Mining Act\"**).32 The Qu\u00e9bec mining regime operates on a first come, first served basis, also known as free mining or universal access to the resource.33\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 41, 62-63.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 58; citing **Exh.

See also Memorial, \u00b6 65.\n\n153.\n\nAlso relevant to oil and gas exploration and development activities in Qu\u00e9bec, is the Regulation Respecting Petroleum, Natural Gas and Underground Reservoirs (the **\"Regulation\"**).34 According to Respondent, the licenses or permits required for undertaking most oil and gas exploration and development activities are issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife (**\"QMNR\"**) under the Mining Act and the Regulation. The objective of such licenses or permits is to ensure oversight of exploration and development activities to promote the orderly and safe development of Qu\u00e9bec's oil and gas resources.35\n\n**Exh.

C-1991.\n\nSee Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 61-66.\n\n**(7) Relevant Regulatory Bodies**\n----------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe oversight of oil and gas exploration and development in Qu\u00e9bec falls mainly to the QMNR and the Ministry of Environment.42 The QMNR grants mining rights, including oil and natural gas exploration licenses and production leases. It is responsible for regulating oil and gas exploration and development activities, and for governing this sector. Between 23 June 2009 and 6 September 2011, the position of Minister of Natural Resources was held by Ms. Nathalie Normandeau.43\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 45.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 48; citing Normandeau First Statement, \u00b6 5.\n\n157.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment is tasked to ensure the protection of environment in Qu\u00e9bec and to promote sustainable development within the public administration.44 Between 11 August 2010 and 19 September 2012, the position of Minister of Environment was held by Mr. Pierre Arcand.45\n\nSee Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 52-53.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 54.\n\n158.\n\nFor the purposes of developing policy initiatives and legislation, these Ministries routinely order the conduct of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (**\"SEA\"**), which is elaborated upon below.\n\n**(8) SEA**\n-----------\n\n159.\n\nThe term SEA refers to a Strategic Environmental Assessment ordered to be conducted by the Government of Qu\u00e9bec.

The holder of an exploration license or permit obtains the exclusive right to explore for mineral substances on the parcel of land subject to the license. An exploration license or permit is initially valid for a term of five years, after which it is eligible for a renewal of five years, thus permitting a total of ten years of exploration activity.56\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; quoting **Exh.

Junex agrees to drill the Junex/Becancour #8 Well on, or about July 15, 2006 and shall agree to core said well using the specifications set out in the proposal attached hereto as Exhibit \"B\". Forest shall reimburse Junex for 100% of the costs incurred in coring and analysis by an accredited laboratory selected by Forest and Junex shall pay for 100% of the rig expense during the period of time in which all cores are acquired. Additionally, upon written request Forest shall be given representative samples of all cutting taken through intervals of their choice in the Junex/Becancour # 8 Well and a copy of all logs acquired by Junex in said well. Both Forest and Junex shall have access to, and copies of, all the information taken and provided in this operation.\n\n3. Upon receipt of the information in Paragraph 2 from Junex, Forest shall have a period of six (6) months from the day Forest receives the final core analysis to elect to exercise their option to drill and earn interest in the Contract Area. Forest shall notify Junex in writing of their intentions to either relinquish their rights to earn an interest in the Contract Area or exercise the option to earn the interest under the terms stated herein.\n\n4. In the event that Forest elects to exercise said option they shall have a period of 18 months (Commitment Period) to spend, cause to be spent or commit to spend a total sum of [REDACTED] in drilling, completions, re- completions, construction of facilities, pipelines, and gathering lines or on geological and geophysical expenses in order to earn 100% of the Contract Area.\n\n...\n\n7.

In the event that Forest spends less that the committed amounts of [REDACTED] during the Commitment Period then at their election they shall pay Junex either (1.) the difference between the amount of capital spent and [REDACTED] or (2.) they shall be entitled to an assignment of a portion of the Contract Area in the Exploration Permits equal to the proportionate amount of capital spent. (By example, if Forest spends, or causes to be spent, a total of [REDACTED] during the Commitment Period, then they shall be entitled to receive an assignment from Junex of 50% of the Contract Area.) If less than all the interest is earned then Forest would advise Junex of the geographical areas it desires to surrender prior to the conveyance of interest by Junex. The provisions of this paragraph 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the failure of Forest to comply with any of the terms of this letter agreement.\n\n...\n\n13.

On 17 March 2009, Junex was granted an exploration permit bearing Permit #2009PG490 over a surface area of 13,541 hectares in the St. Lawrence River (**\"River Permit\"** or **\"Permit PG490\"**).100 The area covered by the River Permit is referred to as the **\"River Permit Area\"**. The Parties disagree about the reasons for which Junex applied for a fresh exploration permit in relation to the area under the St. Lawrence River instead of seeking an expansion of Permit #2006RS184, as was envisaged under the River Permit Agreement (see \u00b6 191(ii) above). According to Claimant, the issuance of a new permit was necessary as Permit #2006RS184 already covered the maximum surface area permissible under the Mining Act. Respondent disputes that an expansion of Permit #2006RS184 would cross the permissible limit under the Mining Act.101\n\n**Exh.

No mining right provided for under Divisions IX to XIII of Chapter III of the Mining Act (R.S.Q., chapter M-13.1) may be issued for the part of the St. Lawrence River west of longitude 64\u00b051'22\" in the NAD83 geodetic reference system or for the islands situated in that part of the river.\n\n2. Any mining right referred to in section 1 and issued for the zone described in that section is revoked.\n\n...\n\n3. The holder of license to explore for petroleum, natural gas and underground reservoirs is exempted from performing the work required under the Mining Act until the beginning of third year of the term of the license following *(insert the date of coming into force of this* Act). In that case, the term of the license is deemed to be suspended in accordance with section 169.2 of that Act.\n\n4. The application of this Act entails no compensation from the State.144\n\n**Exh.

See also Memorial, \u00b6 147.\n\n226.\n\nOn 19 May 2011, Bill 18 was debated in the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly. During these legislative debates, Minister Normandeau introduced the Bill explaining that:\n\n[t]his Bill, Mr. President, now fulfills a commitment we announced last September 27th. It is what I did in Rimouski. So, this commitment will be followed through with the fact that we are going to completely forbid all oil and gas exploration and exploitation in the St. Lawrence River and its estuary. This decision follows from the analysis of the results of the first strategic environmental evaluation that we ordered in July, 2011 [sic], with the result obtained, Mr. President, in 2010. And it is precisely after the conclusions made by the environmental evaluation that we made this decision therefore to forbid all exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in the St. Lawrence River and its estuary. Why a bill, Mr. President? To give a legal basis for this will to forbid this type of business in our river and its estuary.\n\n... our government has always maintained that the business of exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons under the sea should be carried out with a view to sustainable development and that this development should not be done while ignoring the cost ... a sacred principle that guides all action taken by our government in the sector of exploration, exploitation of oil and gas, but also in all the entire sector of activities concerning natural resources.\n\n... In the framework of this strategic environmental evaluation, the experts were mandated to evaluate, first, number one, in an overall and integrated manner, the environmental and socio-economic effects that exploration and exploitation work would cause. Secondly, the experts were told that their goal was that of formulating recommendations for conditions under which exploration and exploitation work should be carried out. And thirdly, it was a matter of reconciling exploration and exploitation work with, among others, already existing activities, especially in the commercial fishing sector, maritime transport, tourist observation activity and the protection of marine mammals.\n\n... the report that was submitted to us was prepared by independent ... experts ... [who] have given proof that the basin of the maritime estuary and the north-west of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is a complex and very fragile environment. And, for this reason, our government has come to the conclusion that this environment would not be favorable for exploration and exploitation work.145\n\n**Exh.

C-142**, Email from J. Drolet (BSMA-Energle) to A. Lefebvre re: \"Commission PL18 - Presence de M. Bouchard demain\", 31 May 2011.\n\n228.\n\nOn 31 May 2011, committee hearings on Bill 18 were conducted by the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources of the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly, which were also attended by the QOGA representatives. In response to questions regarding the no-compensation provision in the Bill (see \u00b6 225 above), Minister Normandeau stated, *inter alia,* that:\n\n... to the aspect related to compensation in the bill. There are two schools... Well, I will not say two schools of thought, but Mr. Bouchard, the arguments that you are making from a legal perspective are quite justified. From our side, we are making more political, rather than legal arguments. And the bill in its current form, I think, shows a nice balance that one must have in recognizing the contribution of the oil and gas industry to Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s economic activities. On the one hand, there is a provision in Article 3 which provides an exemption. Moreover there is a precedent that was created in 1998 by the Quebecois Party in the Gulf, when the moratorium was decreed. So we passed a provision to suspend ... [ellipsis in the original] to avoid, in fact, the suspension of permits. So we are relying precisely on this precedent to justify the presence of Article 3 in the bill.\n\nIn terms of compensation, Mr. Bouchard, in the current context, let\u2019s say it frankly. I do not think that the citizens would have appreciated us compensating gas companies in the extremely highly emotional context that has occupied us in recent months, in recent weeks. That said, Mr. Chairman, I recognize the validity of your arguments from a legal perspective. But from a political perspective, the government has communicated a very different message.\n\nIn this case, we will seek to share with what are the impacts, but to our knowledge, there is no work that has been done in the marine environment by the companies. And perhaps if there is a casethat [sic] could be documented further, it is perhapsthe [sic] case of Junex. If Mr. Dorrins from Junex wishes to speak on the subject to know the impact of this decision on his business, we would be delighted to hear him.\n\nBut what I would like to bring to your attention, Mr. Bouchard, is that we do indeed hear the appeal that you are making to us this morning. On the other hand, as Minister of Natural Resources, I have to say this. We cannot compare, for example, the industry or the provisions contained in the bill for the river and the estuary, which are exceptions, with the mining dynamic, for example, prevailing in the territory of Quebec.\n\nYou are basically saying: What message are we sending to foreign investors? The message, for example, communicated by the Northern Plan is an extremely positive message, and I think that investors are able to make sense of things. And the things they are trying to do is to recognize that indeed in the marine environment there is a specificity as regards ecosystems, biodiversity, which is unique to this type of activity, which has nothing to do with what we do on land, in the mining sector.\n\nSo, the message, the message that we are communicating, basically, is to say to investors: In Quebec, we want to develop our natural resources, and you are right to insist on our ability to develop all this potential, but to do it according to the principles of sustainable development. So that's the message we want to communicate. But I think the industry can make sense of things and recognize that indeed there is a very exceptional fragile environment. And in this sense, Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude my remarks by saying to Mr. Bouchard that we have noted his request, we will look at it very, very closely, but politically, this message and this decision that was made, Mr. Chairman, is one that also allows us to take into account the state of mind our citizens are in at the point of emergence of the oil and gas sector.147\n\n**Exh.

Is it as there stated?\n\n...\n\nMR. LITTLE: ... In response to the Tribunal\u2019s question number 20 ... The answer to the question is no, does that paragraph fully reflect what we are asking for.\n\nI would make two points, perhaps three. The first one is that to the extent that the Tribunal is asking us whether we would be supporting a number other than the expressly mentioned number on the quantum of compensation; we certainly are not wedded to that number, although we think it is fully supportable.\n\n...\n\nThe second point relates to the conduct of this arbitration and perhaps this is something that given the other question asked by the Tribunal is more responsive to the spirit.\n\nIn one of the Tribunal's questions, there is a question about a possible breach of the duty to arbitrate in good faith. To the extent that the Tribunal does conclude that has been breached by Canada in this arbitration ... we would ask for an order of compensation.\n\nThat relates to, I think, three classes of breaches, perhaps four. No. 1 is the breach of your order of February 24, 2011, the expressed refusal to produce documents that were ordered by you to be produced to us... .\n\nThe second area is the failure to produce documents for the period of February to April 2011 which Mr. Ryan described this morning.\n\nThe third is the failure to produce documents mentioned by witnesses at the hearing ...\n\nThen lastly the fourth category would be the failure to call appropriate witnesses that might have illuminated the Tribunal on issues ...\n\nThat would be in addition to the adverse inferences that we ask you to draw and they are set out in our reply...162\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 94:11-98:15.\n\n**B.

Day 2 (English version), 122:22-123:7.\n\n250.\n\nRespondent further contests Claimant\u2019s request for adverse inferences on the grounds that: (i) this is not an appropriate case for adverse inferences as the inference is not determinative to the Tribunal\u2019s decisions;178 (ii) Claimant has failed to identify the specific adverse inferences that it requests the Tribunal to draw and, therefore, the request is not sufficiently specific;179 (iii) Claimant has failed to establish that it has a *prima facie* case in support of the inferences sought;180 (iv) Claimant\u2019s request for adverse inferences requires the Tribunal to disregard the evidence on record, which demonstrates that the main purpose of the impugned Act was to protect the St. Lawrence River;181 and (v) there is no connection between the likely nature of the non-disclosed documents and the adverse inferences sought.182 Respondent emphasizes in this regard that the Tribunal\u2019s power to draw adverse inferences is discretionary in nature and the circumstances referred hereinabove militate against the exercise of this discretion.183\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 137, 145-146.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 153-154.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 155-157.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 158-161.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163.\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr.

The disputing parties agree that, except as otherwise specified by the terms of this Procedural Order and the Confidentiality Order, provisions of the *International Bar Association's Rules on the Taking of Evidence (\"IBA Rules \")* shall be consulted as guidelines on:\n\n(a) The exchange of documents (Article 3 of the *IBA Rules**);*\n\n(b) The presentation of evidence by fact and expert witnesses (Articles 4 and 5 of the *IBA Rules**);*\n\n(c) On-site inspection (Article 7 of the *IBA Rules**);*\n\n(d) The conduct of the evidentiary hearing (Article 8 of the *IBA Rules**);* and\n\n(e) The admissibility and assessment of evidence (Article 9 of the *IBA* Rules).185\n\nPO 1, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nPO 1, \u00b6 68.\n\n252.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules on evidentiary matters are extracted below:\n\n**Article 27 - Evidence**\n\n1. Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence.\n\n...\n\n3. At any time during the arbitral proceedings, the arbitral tribunal may require the parties to produce documents, exhibits or other evidence within such period of time as the arbitral tribunal shall determine.\n\n4. The arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.\n\n**Article 30 - Default**\n\n**...**\n\n3. If a party, duly invited by the arbitral tribunal to produce documents, exhibits or other evidence, fails to do so within the established period of time, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may make the award on the evidence before it.\n\n253.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the IBA Rules are extracted below:\n\n**Article 3 Documents**\n\n...\n\n7. Either Party may, within the time ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal, request the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on the objection. The Arbitral Tribunal shall then, in consultation with the Parties and in timely fashion, consider the Request to Produce and the objection. The Arbitral Tribunal may order the Party to whom such Request is addressed to produce any requested Document in its possession, custody or control as to which the Arbitral Tribunal determines that *(i)* the issues that the requesting Party wishes to prove are relevant to the case and material to its outcome; *(ii)* none of the reasons for objection set forth in Article 9.2 applies; and *(iii)* the requirements of Article 3.3 have been satisfied. Any such Document shall be produced to the other Parties and, if the Arbitral Tribunal so orders, to it.\n\n**Article 9 Admissibility and Assessment of Evidence**\n\n...\n\n5. If a Party fails without satisfactory explanation to produce any Document requested in a Request to Produce to which it has not objected in due time or fails to produce any Document ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal may infer that such document would be adverse to the interests of that Party.\n\n...\n\n7. If the Arbitral Tribunal determines that a Party has failed to conduct itself in good faith in the taking of evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal, may, in addition to any other measures available under these Rules, take such failure into account in its assignment of the costs of the arbitration, including costs arising out of or in connection with the taking of evidence.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider Claimant\u2019s request for adverse inference on account of Respondent\u2019s non-production of documents, referred to in \u00b6\u00b6 244(i) - 244(iii) above (**a**), followed by a consideration of Claimant\u2019s request on account of non-production of appropriate witnesses by Respondent, referred to in \u00b6 244(iv) above (**b**).\n\n***a. Non-Production of Documents by Respondent***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nClaimant\u2019s assertions that adverse inferences must be drawn against Respondent\u2019s case for non-production of documents are grouped into three categories:\n\n(i) Documents that Respondent refused to produce contrary to the Tribunal's Orders on Withheld and Redacted Documents and on Claimant's Applications of 31 March and 27 April 2017: Claimant submits that Respondent withheld in entirety the first seven documents and partially redacted the last three documents enumerated below:\n\na) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 19 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;186\n\nb) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 12 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;187\n\nc) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 12 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;188\n\nd) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 19 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;189\n\ne) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 6 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;190\n\nf) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 2 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;191\n\ng)[REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 2 of Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests ;192\n\nh) [REDACTED]193 allegedly responsive to request number 2 of Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests;\n\ni) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 2 of Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests;194\n\nj) [REDACTED] allegedly responsive to request number 2 of Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests.195\n\n(ii) Documents that were discussed during the October 2017 Merits Hearing but were not produced by Respondent: Claimant contends that the following documents, which were mentioned by Respondent\u2019s witnesses during cross-examination, ought to have been produced by Respondent in response to Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests:\n\na) Notes prepared in the fall of 2010 and winter of 2011, referred to by Respondent\u2019s witness Jacques Dupont, allegedly responsive to request number 6 of Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests;196\n\nb) Analysis of the BAPE 273 Report by the Ministry of Environment, referred to by Respondent's witness Jacques Dupont, allegedly responsive to request number 16 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;197\n\nc) Analysis of the BAPE 273 Report by the Ministry of Environment, in particular its analysis of hydraulic fracturing, referred to by Respondent's witness Jacques Dupont, allegedly responsive to request number 16 of Claimant's Document Production Requests;198\n\nd) Notes to Minister Normandeau on the development of Bill 18, referred to by Respondent's witness Minister Normandeau, allegedly responsive to request number 18 of Claimant's Document Production Requests.199\n\n(iii) Non-production of any documents between the period of 28 February to 29 April 2011: Claimant contends that there is an \"evidentiary gap\" as Respondent failed to produce any documents during this two-month period that might explain or substantiate the public policy basis for QMNR's shift in position regarding horizontal drilling.200\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 37.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 37.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 37.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 38.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 38.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 38.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 38.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 39.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 39.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 39.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 40.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 40.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 41.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 40.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 32.\n\n256.\n\nWith respect to the first category of documents identified by Claimant (see \u00b6 255(i) above), Respondent justifies the non or partial production of these documents, citing reasons of political and institutional sensitivity. Respondent further contends that Claimant has available considerable information and documentation on the development of the Act and the reasons behind it and, therefore, there is no reason to draw adverse inferences on account of the non-production of these documents. Respondent argues that the seven withheld documents and the redactions in the other documents, contain no analysis of the reasons for the Act or other information essential to the dispute.201\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 148.\n\n257.\n\nWith respect to the second category of documents identified by Claimant (see \u00b6 255(ii) above), Respondent argues that the documents identified by Claimant were not covered by Claimant\u2019s Document Production Requests.202\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 132-148.\n\n258.\n\nWith respect to the third category of documents (see \u00b6 255(iii) above), Respondent appears to suggest that no relevant documents pertain to the said period.203\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 124: 15-125:13.\n\n259.\n\nPursuant to Article 9(5) of the IBA Rules (see \u00b6 253 above), the Tribunal has the discretion to draw adverse inferences vis-\u00e0-vis Respondent\u2019s case, on account of any non-production of documents by Respondent in contravention of the Tribunal\u2019s directions to produce the documents. The Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power in this regard is not in dispute between the Parties.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the remedy of drawing adverse inferences for non-production of documents by a party, contrary to an arbitral tribunal\u2019s order, is not one to be resorted to lightly. Neither is it the appropriate remedy in each and every case of non-production of documents. Further, drawing an adverse inference against another party\u2019s case, in and of itself, will not completely absolve a party from satisfying its evidentiary burden on the basis of primary evidence.\n\n261.\n\nThe connection of the undisclosed documents identified by Claimant in the first category (see \u00b6 255(i) above) to the issues raised in this arbitration, is not in dispute between the Parties. Indeed, the documents largely relate to memoranda and information notes presented to the Qu\u00e9bec Executive Council in connection with the adoption of Bill 18 or drafts thereof, communication plans discussing strategy for unveiling the impugned Act to the public, game plans relating to the BAPE 273 Report and the SEA-SG, excerpts of the Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Executive Council Deliberations, which all relate to the basis and process for adoption of Bill 18.\n\n262.\n\nRespondent had objected to the production of these documents, suggesting political and institutional sensitivity as the documents pertained to the drafting and passing of the Act in Canada. This objection was previously rejected by the Tribunal.\n\n263.\n\nClaimant requests the Tribunal to infer that the undisclosed and redacted documents contain evidence in support of Claimant's position that Bill 18 was adopted by the Qu\u00e9bec Government for political reasons and contrary to Respondent's position that it was adopted for a valid public policy objective of environmental protection (see \u00b6 246 above). The larger issue before the Tribunal is whether the adoption of Bill 18 by the Qu\u00e9bec Government constitutes a treaty breach of expropriation and violation of the minimum standard of treatment for fair and equitable treatment under NAFTA Articles 1110 and 1105 respectively.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the documents could have been of potential relevance when considering whether the adoption of Bill 18 by the Qu\u00e9bec Government was a valid exercise of the police powers doctrine and consistent with the precautionary principle. However, it is not the case that Claimant was unable to present or prepare a case for the alleged treaty violations by Respondent due to the missing documents. The Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine the issue of whether adverse inferences need to be drawn from the missing and redacted documents, as necessary, when considering Parties' other evidence on record in support of their respective positions regarding Claimant's allegations of breaches of NAFTA Article 1110 and 1105 below.\n\n265.\n\nWith respect to the second category of undisclosed documents (see \u00b6 255(ii) above), Respondent's position is that these documents are not responsive to Claimant's Document Production Request.204 On a review of Mr. Dupont's and Ms. Normandeau's witness testimony relied on by Claimant and the concerned Document Production Requests, which Claimant alleges have been violated by Respondent, it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal that the said documents are responsive to Claimant's Document Production Requests and have been deliberately withheld by Respondent. As such, the Tribunal is not persuaded that drawing adverse inferences is the appropriate remedy in connection with this second category of undisclosed documents.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 132-148.\n\n266.\n\nWith respect to the third category of undisclosed documents (see \u00b6 255(iii) above), Respondent appears to suggest that no relevant documents were existing in this period:\n\nMy colleague says that that gap with respect to the process of that bill is inexplicable. I will rise to the challenge and try to provide an explanation. I think that that so-called gap can be easily explained.\n\nIn March, there was a BAPE 273. We said it was an important moment; that coincidence is not fortuitous. And that report contains over hundreds of statements on the implementation of a strategic study on shale gas. It is a study in March that is wide ranging. It cost several million dollars. It is quite possible that the limited number of civil servants was doing something else with its time, and there was a problem with the consensus with the elected members of the government and all that. Nobody questions that. I would like to ask the Court not to draw any conclusion based on the so-called gaping hole.205\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 124:21-125:13.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal notes with concern this two-month evidentiary gap from 28 February to 29 April 2011, in a crucial period immediately preceding the adoption of Bill 18. The Tribunal is not fully persuaded by Respondent\u2019s suggestion that no documents exist during this two-month period. Moreover, the Tribunal finds troubling that Respondent\u2019s suggestion appears to be only a hypothesis by Respondent\u2019s counsel and not an affirmation that no relevant documents exist during this period. The Tribunal considers it appropriate to examine the issue of whether adverse inferences need to be drawn from this two-month \"evidentiary gap\", as necessary, when considering Parties\u2019 other evidence on record in support of their respective positions regarding Claimant\u2019s allegations of breaches of NAFTA Article 1110 and 1105 below.\n\n***b. Non-production of appropriate witnesses by Respondent at the Hearing***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent ought to have called to the Hearing the following representatives from the *Bureau des hydrocarbures,* who in Claimant\u2019s view may have provided relevant information to remedy the non-production of documents by Respondent: (i) Alain Lefebvre, General Manager and author of Exhibits C-126 and R-042; (ii) Louise L\u00e9vesque, Registrar; (iii) Jean-Yves Lalibert\u00e9, Coordinator of oil and gas exploration; (iv) Carol Cantin, Research Agent, author of information notes in Exhibits R-043 and R-044; and (v) Pascal Perron and Brigitte Houle, representatives in indeterminate roles, as appears from Exhibit C-123.206 On this basis, Claimant requests the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against Respondent' case.\n\nClaimant's Reply Slides, 26 February 2021, slide 33.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent contends that it produced \"all witnesses who were able to throw some light on the process that came to that [Bill 18]\".207 It submits that if it would be impractical for it to produce as a witness, each person who had participated in the process of adoption of Bill 18.208\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 123:6-7.\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 122:16-123:7.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to draw adverse inferences in this case. As a matter of principle, unless ordered by the Tribunal, there is no duty on a party to bring forward witnesses, either at its own motion or on the request of the opposing party. Claimant did not make any such request to the Tribunal and no such order was passed by the Tribunal.\n\n271.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal recalls that during the November 2017 Merits Hearing, Claimant had advised the Tribunal that it was adding to its final request for relief, a request for a declaration that Respondent's non-production of documents and failure to call appropriate witnesses at the Hearing constitutes a breach of its duty to arbitrate in good faith. Claimant also requested compensation from Respondent for breach of its duty to arbitrate in good faith (see \u00b6 241 above). During the Refresher Hearing, the Parties advised the Tribunal of their agreement that Claimant only maintains its request for adverse inferences on account of the document production and witnesses-related issues:\n\nMS. BANDALI: ...\n\nAnd so the parties have agreed that if the - to propose to the Tribunal that each side bears its own costs of legal representation, and that Tribunal costs will be split evenly between the parties, and that the Claimant will withdraw its motion for costs associated with the document-production issues, although our outstanding motion for adverse inferences related to the non-production of documents still stands.\n\n...\n\nMR. H\u00c9BERT: Yes, what Ms. Bandali said is correct. It reflects the agreement between the parties on the question of costs.209\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 3:3-4:2.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Parties have agreed that in connection with the document-production and witnesses-related issues raised by Claimant, which are summarised in this Section, Claimant only retains its request for adverse inferences and that it withdraws its request for a declaration that Respondent has breached its duty to arbitrate in good faith and its corresponding claim for compensation from Respondent. Accordingly, no decision is required from the Tribunal on this issue.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Request to Strike Out from the Arbitration Record Certain Slides From Claimant\u2019s Closing Presentation at the November 2017 Merits Hearing**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n273.\n\nAs noted in \u00b6 100 above, Respondent requests the Tribunal to strike out from the arbitration record, slides 246-250, 277-280 and 285-290, which formed part of Claimant's closing presentation at the November 2017 Merits Hearing.210\n\nRespondent's email dated 26 February 2021. See also Respondent's letter dated 21 December 2017; R-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\n274.\n\nRespondent contends that slides 246-250 contain new methods for quantifying damages, based on the use of multiples, which methods were presented by Claimant for the first time during the November 2017 Merits Hearing. Respondent contends that it did not have the opportunity to rebut Claimant's evidence on the new methods for quantification of damages set forth in these slides, and, therefore, requests that these slides are struck off from the arbitration record.211\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\n275.\n\nWith respect to slides 277-280 and 285-290, Respondent contends that these slides contain calculations that appear to have been prepared after the October 2017 Merits Hearing. According to Respondent, these calculations are not based on the expert testimony of GLJ and FTI and are in the nature of new evidence, which is in contravention of the Tribunal's directions at the end of the October 2017 Merits Hearing. For these reasons, Respondent requests that these slides must be struck off from the arbitration record.212\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 125:14-127:4.\n\n276.\n\nWith respect to slides 246-250, Claimant maintains that the slides do not contain new arguments on quantification of damages. Claimant argues that the slides contain submissions reflecting the structure and content of the evidence given by its expert, Mr. Rosen, at the October 2017 Merits Hearing, with a view to demonstrate how the existing factual and expert evidence \"could be approached to quantify damages in the way proposed by Mr. Veeder\u2019s question [to Mr. Rosen at the October 2017 Merits Hearing], that is, on the basis that Claimant proved up the resource and should receive its investment to do so, plus a return on investment\". Claimant further submits that Respondent had the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Rosen on these issues, but chose not to do so, including after Mr. Veeder\u2019s question. Claimant adds that Respondent also chose not to address these issues during the November 2017 Merits Hearing, despite having plenty of time between the two Hearings to consider its position and prepare submissions. Lastly, Claimant contends that Respondent could have responded to Claimant\u2019s oral submissions in its reply after the lunch break during the November 2017 Merits Hearing, but it chose not to do so. For Claimant, \"it is especially unfortunate that Canada has decided now to complain about submissions which they either did not anticipate or to which did not respond, despite opportunity to do so\".213\n\nClaimant's letter dated 12 January 2018. See also Refresher Hearing, Tr Day 2, 43:2-43:15 ; 121:16-122:7.\n\n277.\n\nWith respect to slides 277-279 and 286-290, Claimant contends that the tables in these slides, which Respondent seeks to exclude from the arbitration record, are \"just math\" and that \"anyone with a calculator can arrive at the numbers in these tables\" which \"were presented for the assistance of the Tribunal in the event that its assessment of the expert reports and the evidence lead to findings that affect the damages calculations.\"214\n\nClaimant's letter dated 12 January 2018. See also Refresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 121:16-122:7.\n\n278.\n\nWith respect to slide 280, Claimant submits that the numbers contained in that slide \"are the result of the FTI model using Deloitte's approach to the premium, at different percentages\" which, it believes \"may be of assistance to the Tribunal in considering the two parties' positions\".215\n\nClaimant's letter dated 12 January 2018.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed Claimant\u2019s slides under challenge and finds that slides 246-250 of Claimant\u2019s closing presentation during the November 2017 Merits Hearing contain arguments and evidence regarding a new valuation methodology that had not been presented, addressed or discussed by Claimant\u2019s counsel or its experts during the October 2017 Merits Hearing. The Tribunal does not consider that the question posed by Mr. Veeder on October 12, 2017, to Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Rosen, authorized Claimant to include such new evidence in its closing presentation at the November 2017 Merits Hearing. As Respondent did not have the opportunity to refute the new methodology through the submission of rebuttal expert evidence and cross-examination of Claimant\u2019s experts, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to strike out slides 246-250 from the arbitration record.\n\n280.\n\nAs for slides 277 to 280 and 285 to 290 of Claimant\u2019s closing presentation, the Tribunal finds that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertions, these slides do not offer \"new methods of quantifying damages\". The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that these slides, and in particular the tables they contain, reflect figures and percentages that have been calculated from existing figures and percentages already on the record (in particular in the experts\u2019 reports). Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s request to strike these slides from the record of the arbitration.\n\n**VIII. APPLICABLE LAW**\n------------------------\n\n281.\n\nArticle 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows in connection with applicable law:\n\n*Article 35*\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law which is determines to be appropriate.\n\n282.\n\nNAFTA Article 1131 sets out the governing law for disputes raised in this arbitration and provides as follows:\n\n*Article 1131: Governing Law*\n\n1. A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\n\n2. An interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.\n\n283.\n\nThus, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1131(1) read with Article 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the applicable law governing the merits of the disputes raised in this arbitration is NAFTA and the applicable rules of international law.\n\n284.\n\nWith respect to the Tribunal's obligation under NAFTA Article 1131(1) to decide disputes in accordance with NAFTA, NAFTA Articles 102, 103(2) and 1112(1) are relevant. NAFTA Article 102(2) provides that \"[t]he Parties shall interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with applicable rules of international law\".216 NAFTA Article 103(2) sets forth the rule in the event of an inconsistency between NAFTA and other agreements entered into by NAFTA Parties,217 and NAFTA Article 1112(1) sets forth the rule in the event of an inconsistency between NAFTA Chapter Eleven and other chapters of NAFTA.218\n\nParagraph 1 of NAFTA Article 102 lists the objectives of NAFTA as follows: \"1. The objective of this Agreement, as elaborated more specifically through its principles and rules, including national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment and transparency, are to: a) eliminate barriers to trade in, and facilitate the cross-border movement of, goods and services between the territories of the Parties; b) promote conditions of fair competition in the free trade area; c) increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties; d) provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in each Party's territory; e) create effective procedures for the implementation and application of this Agreement, for its joint administration and for the resolution of disputes; and f) establish a framework for further trilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation to expand and enhance the benefits of this Agreement.\"\n\nNAFTA Article 103(2) states: In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and such other agreements [i.e., General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other agreements to which NAFTA Parties are a party], this Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.\n\nNAFTA Article 1112(1) states: In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n285.\n\nWith respect to the Tribunal's obligation under NAFTA Article 1131(1) to decide disputes in accordance with the applicable rules of international law, it is for each tribunal to determine, in the circumstances of the dispute before it, which are the relevant rules of international law that would be applicable in that case.\n\n286.\n\nFor interpretation of NAFTA provisions, the Tribunal shall rely on Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (**\"VCLT\"**), which codify customary international law. Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT state as follows:\n\n*Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n*Article 32*\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n287.\n\nFurther, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1131(2), the Tribunal is bound by any interpretation provided by NAFTA Free Trade Commission (**\"FTC\"**) of NAFTA provisions. Specifically relevant to the disputes in this arbitration is the FTC's Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions dated 31 July 2001 (**\"2001 FTC Note\"**).\n\n288.\n\nThe Parties further disagree on whether the Protocol Replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States and Canada (**\"Protocol\"**) and the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States and Canada, which entered into force on 1 July 2020 (**\"USMCA\"**), constitutes an \"applicable rule of international law\" under NAFTA 1131(1).\n\n289.\n\nRelying on Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, Respondent argues in the affirmative. Respondent contends that the USMCA, being an agreement between NAFTA Parties, which contains substantially the same obligations as under NAFTA elucidates the intent of NAFTA Parties and confirms their practice and agreement as to the interpretation of NAFTA provisions. Thus, for Respondent, the USMCA constitutes a relevant rule of international law for interpreting NAFTA.219\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Tribunal dated 23 December 2020.\n\n290.\n\nClaimant disputes that the USMCA constitutes a relevant rule of international law for interpreting NAFTA. It points out that, notwithstanding the promulgation of the USMCA (i) the law governing the Parties\u2019 disputes in this arbitration continues to be Chapter Eleven of NAFTA; (ii) NAFTA Parties agreed to a transition period of three years during which NAFTA investor-state dispute settlement rules will continue to apply for investments made prior to 1 July 2020; (iii) neither does the USMCA interpret NAFTA, nor is it an agreement concerning the application of NAFTA; rather it supersedes NAFTA. Thus, Claimant argues that the USMCA cannot have a bearing on the disputes in this arbitration. Claimant argues that, in any event, questions of applicability and relevance of the USMCA for the interpretation of NAFTA are beyond the remit of this arbitration as this was a new issue that arose following the conclusion of the final Hearing in the matter.220\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal dated 9 November 2020, \u00b6 45.\n\n291.\n\nFor the purposes of this arbitration, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for the Tribunal to decide this matter. As noted in \u00b6 120 above, the Tribunal had granted the Parties permission to submit new legal authorities into the arbitration record, which arose after the conclusion of the November 2017 Merits Hearing, subject to no new arguments or submissions being raised by the Parties in connection with their new authorities. The Tribunal\u2019s directions were issued with the concurrence of the Parties, taking into account that the final Merits Hearing had already been concluded in the arbitration in November 2017 and that the Refresher Hearing was fixed only with a view for the Parties to recapitulate their arguments and evidence for the benefit of the newly constituted Tribunal. The PHBs were also requested by the Tribunal with this same objective (see \u00b6\u00b6 111 and 120 above). Respondent seeks to rely on the USMCA to interpret certain provisions of NAFTA, the relevance of which is disputed by Claimant. As the Refresher Hearing and the PHBs were intended to only enable the Parties to recapitulate their evidence and submissions raised during the 2017 Hearing, no new arguments or submissions were made by the Parties in connection with their new legal authorities. Thus, the Parties have not had the opportunity to address in detail questions of relevance of the USMCA for the interpretation of NAFTA. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary for this Award to decide the Parties\u2019 disputes on this matter.\n\n**IX. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n292.\n\nClaimant seeks relief in this arbitration in relation to Respondent\u2019s revocation of the Enterprise\u2019s 100% working interest in a specific geographical interval of the River Permit Area (the **\"River Permit Rights\"**) through the passage of Bill 18, on the grounds that the revocation constitutes a violation of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110. Claimant submits that the River Permit Rights are an intangible property right, as well as an interest that arose from the investment of capital, and, therefore, meet the definition of \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139(g) and (h) respectively.221 Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Claimant\u2019s claims, contending that the claims do not satisfy the \"gateway\" provisions of NAFTA Articles 1101 and 1139. Specifically, Respondent (i) disputes that Claimant had an \"investment\" in Canada within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(g) and (h); and (ii) submits that there is no \"legally significant connection\" between the impugned Act and Claimant\u2019s alleged investment, as is required under NAFTA Article 1101.222 The Tribunal will address each of Respondent's objections in turn in Sub-Sections (B) and (C) below.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 191-212; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 255-283; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 14-39.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 269-273.\n\n**B. Objection to the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Relevant Treaty Provisions**\n----------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nA claim by an \"Investor\" on behalf of an \"Enterprise\" is governed by NAFTA Article 1117, which provides as follows:\n\nArticle 1117: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise\n\n1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n\n(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A,\n\nand that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n2. An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in paragraph 1 if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.\n\n3. Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the investor or a non-controlling investor in the enterprise makes a claim under Article 1116 arising out of the same events that gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of the claims are submitted to arbitration under Article 1120, the claims should be heard together by a Tribunal established under Article 1126, unless the Tribunal finds that the interests of a disputing party would be prejudiced thereby.\n\n4. An investment may not make a claim under this Section.\n\n294.\n\nNAFTA Article 1139 defines \"investment\" in relevant part as follows:\n\n**investment** means:\n\n(a) an enterprise;\n\n...\n\n(g) real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes; and\n\n(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under\n\n(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or\n\n(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenues or profits of an enterprise;\n\nbut investment does not mean,\n\n(i) claims to money that arise solely from\n\n(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of another Party, or\n\n(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing, other than a loan covered by subparagraph (d); or\n\n(j) any other claims to money,\n\nthat do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) through (h);\n\n295.\n\nNAFTA Article 201.1 defines the terms \"enterprise\", \"enterprise of a Party\" and \"measure\" as follows:\n\n**enterprise** means any entity constituted or organized under applicable law, whether or not for profit, and whether privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture or other association;\n\n**enterprise of a Party** means an enterprise constituted or organized under the law of a Party;\n\n**...**\n\n**measure** includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice;\n\n**(2) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n***a. Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims, contending that Claimant\u2019s allegations do not concern an \"investment\" within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139.223 Respondent submits that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s assertion, the River Permit Rights do not constitute an \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139(g) or (h).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 164; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 271-275.\n\n297.\n\nRespondent further contends that whilst Claimant's ownership and control over the Enterprise satisfies the requirements for the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* under NAFTA Articles 1101 and 1117, Claimant has raised no claims with respect to the treatment of the Enterprise. Thus, for Respondent, \"it matters little whether LPRC [Enterprise] may be characterized as an investment\".224\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 274.\n\n(i) Claimant's alleged \"investment\" is not covered within the definition of NAFTA Article 1139(g)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nRespondent contends that the River Permit Rights do not constitute \"real estate or other property, tangible or intangible ... used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\", as required under NAFTA Article 1139(g).225\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 271.\n\n299.\n\nRespondent's main objection in this regard is that the Enterprise did not own the mining rights under the River Permit. More specifically, Respondent contends that (i) \"the Farmout Agreement between Forest Oil and Junex and the Assignment Agreements between LPRC and Junex d[id] not give LPRC a mining right or other immovable real right. Nor d[id] they confer a right in the potential resources in the River License area\"; and (ii) \"the claimant ... made no expenditures to obtain interests in the River License, other than those made to acquire interests in the four Land Licenses in the Champlain/B\u00e9cancour Block, [and therefore] the interests that it owns in this license do not arise from the commitment of capital or other such resources in the territory within the meaning of Article 1139(h)\".226\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 277-278.\n\n300.\n\nRespondent contends that for Claimant to establish that it holds a real right in the resources of Junex's River Permit, it must demonstrate its entitlement to such right under Qu\u00e9bec law, which applies as a question of fact. Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to discharge this burden.227 For the following reasons, Respondent contends that Claimant does not hold property rights or even real rights in the River Permit but only has personal rights with respect to Junex.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 281-282.\n\n301.\n\n*First,* Respondent contends that Claimant incorrectly asserts that the Farmout Agreement and the River Permit Agreement between Forest Oil and Junex granted it a dismemberment of Junex\u2019s exploration permits and, therefore, a real right in the natural gas resources situated within the perimeter of those permits.228\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 279-280.\n\n302.\n\nRespondent relies on the opinion of its expert, Mr. Gagn\u00e9, to contend that Junex did not assign to the Enterprise its real rights under the River Permit, but had only assigned an \"economic interest in receiving proceeds from the development of a well-defined stratigraphic area\".229\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 284-285; citing Gagn\u00e9 First Report, \u00b6\u00b6 86-108, 114, 136.\n\n303.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s position that a \"working interest\" is perceived in the mining industry as a property right. Respondent relies on Mr. Gagn\u00e9\u2019s opinion that \"[t]he only way that Junex could assign to CFOL [Enterprise] 'the full enjoyment of a real right and of the prerogatives it confers\u2019 was to assign to it an undivided interest in the River License, which is usual procedure in Qu\u00e9bec\".230\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 174; citing Gagn\u00e9 First Report, \u00b6 52. See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 175.\n\n304.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant\u2019s expert, Professor Tremblay, has \"made several errors in his description of the applicable legal framework and in his analysis of the Agreements\" and has relied on concepts and agreements that are not common to the mining industry or compatible with Qu\u00e9bec law.231\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 170-172; citing Gagn\u00e9 First Report, \u00b6\u00b6 21m 48-49m 60 and 71.\n\n305.\n\n*Second,* Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it was the intention of the parties to the River Permit Agreement and the River Permit Assignment Agreement for Junex to transfer real rights in the River Permit to the Enterprise. Respondent finds the testimony of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, Mr. Lavoie and Mr. Dorrins, regarding Junex\u2019s intention to transfer real rights to Enterprise, unpersuasive.232 Respondent submits further that these witness statements were produced for the purposes of this arbitration and do not constitute contemporary evidence of Junex\u2019s intention at the time when the said Agreements were concluded.233 Notwithstanding this, Respondent submits that the alleged intention of Junex, Forest Oil and the Enterprise cannot change the nature of the rights conferred by the clear terms of the River Permit Agreement and the River Permit Assignment Agreement. The said Agreements only record the transfer of a future working interest, which does not meet the requirements set out by NAFTA Article 1139(g), being in the nature of a personal right.234\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 176-177; citing Lavoie Second Statement, \u00b6 10; Dorrins Second Statement, \u00b6 24(a).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 177-178; citing Gagn\u00e9 Reply Report, \u00b6 68.\n\n306.\n\nRespondent further contends that the factual context described below further does not support the statements of Mr. Lavoie and Mr. Dorrins:\n\n(i) In an email dated 9 May 2012, an employee of Claimant stated in relation to the contractual arrangement between Junex and the Enterprise that \"Junex/Gastem are on title and we are at our 100% or 60% WI underneath the title because Qu\u00e9bec does not have a land titles systems that allows for the transfer of permit ownership\".235 Respondent submits that this indicates that the parties were aware that Qu\u00e9bec law did not allow the transfer of ownership of a license for a specific geological interval (see \u00b6 303 above), which was the reason behind Junex deciding to grant the Enterprise mere working interests in the River Permit;236\n\n(ii) The limits imposed by Qu\u00e9bec law on the possibility of transferring rights in exploration licenses had been highlighted by the QOGA, including in meetings where a representative of Claimant was present;237\n\n(iii) In an internal Forest Oil email exchange between 14-15 December 2010, the Enterprise is referred to as a \"contract operator\" and as a \"100% WI owner\", and not as a holder of real rights;238\n\n(iv) The forms concerning the River Permit are unequivocal that Junex was the holder of 100% of the real rights in the River Permit;239\n\n(v) Junex had remained as a necessary intermediary between the Enterprise and the River Permit as it was (i) the entity responsible for paying fees and performing statutory work on the Permit; and (ii) the entity which could obtain drilling permits on the territory of the River Permit and could eventually obtain an operating permit. Respondent contends that had Junex abandoned the River Permit, for instance, by not paying the annual fees payable to the Minister of Natural Resources, the Enterprise would have lost its working interest in the River Permit.240\n\nExh.

For Respondent, the registration of the Enterprise\u2019s contractual interests in the Mining Register is not sufficient to effectuate a transfer to the Enterprise of a real right in the River Permit.241 Respondent contends that to transfer real rights in Qu\u00e9bec, mining businesses use indivision agreements, which are recorded in the resource register.242 Relying on the opinion of Mr. Gagn\u00e9, Respondent contends that \"the mining register is constituted purely for administrative purposes and recording the River Permit Assignment Agreement in it was unnecessary. Rather, a record in the resource register (a different register that Junex and LPRC have never used) is the way to ensure opposability of rights against third parties\".243\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 285.

See also \u00b6\u00b6 286-292.\n\n309.\n\nRespondent contends that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s assertion, the River Permit Agreement imposed no requirement on Claimant to perform any work or incur any expenditure in the River Permit Area to obtain the alleged interests in the River Permit.245 Respondent submits that any work that was undertaken by Claimant was performed on land and the vast majority of such work was even performed before the River Permit Agreement had been executed.246\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 288.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 289; citing **Exh.

Respondent submits that, as opposed to this, in the *Mondev* case, the claimant's invested capital naturally led to the investment in that case as it related to two phases of the same project and the claimant in that case drew its rights from a single assignment agreement entered into directly with the City of Boston and one of its agencies.248\n\n**Exh.

Respondent contends further that Claimant has not provided any evidence demonstrating that the work done under the Farmout Agreement applied to the River Permit.250\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 192-193.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 192-193.\n\n312.\n\nRespondent contends that any general expenses incurred by Claimant in relation to the River Permit will not satisfy the requirements of NAFTA Article 1139(h).251 In this regard, Respondent emphasizes that, in any event, it was Junex who was required to pay annual fees and uphold various statutory obligations to maintain its interests in the River Permit, and not Claimant.252\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 186.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\n313.\n\nAlbeit in the context of its defense to Claimant\u2019s claim of expropriation, Respondent submits that, objectively considered, Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec comprises its interests both in the Original Permits and the River Permit.253 Respondent argues that only if Claimant\u2019s investment is regarded as comprising the Enterprise\u2019s interests in both the River Permit and in the Original Permits, can the River Permit Rights be regarded as constituting an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h). Respondent submits that, in such case, it concedes that Claimant has an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h).254\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 79.\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 118:11-23.\n\n***b.

In this connection, Claimant contends that Junex had dismembered real rights related to a specific geological interval which it transferred entirely to the Enterprise by virtue of the Assignment Agreements.255 In Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent (i) agrees that the rights conferred by an exploration permit are intangible property; and (ii) disputes that the River Permit Agreement and River Permit Assignment Agreement had the effect of transferring such intangible property to Claimant.256\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 24.\n\n315.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent\u2019s contention that the Farmout and River Permit Agreements granted Claimant only a contractual right to uncertain future economic benefits, and not real property rights within the River Permit Area.257\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 24.\n\n316.\n\nClaimant submits that the Parties agree that the ownership of the River Permit Rights is to be determined in accordance with Qu\u00e9bec law. Claimant contends that, under Qu\u00e9bec law, an \"exploration license gives its holder an immovable real right\", which can also \"be the object of an innominate dismemberment\".258 In Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent wrongly concludes that the Farmout and River Permit Agreements did not meet the necessary conditions to dismember Junex's rights and grant said rights to the Enterprise.259\n\nReply, \u00b6 262; C-PHB, \u00b6 23.\n\nReply, \u00b6 263; C-PHB, \u00b6 24.\n\n317.\n\nClaimant submits that \"Junex granted the Enterprise an option to earn a '100% working interest' in certain resources situated in the River Permit and the Land Permits [Original Permits], subject to certain [REDACTED] reserved to Junex\".260 Claimant contends that, as explained by its expert, Professor Tremblay, the concept of \"working interest\" is crucial to understanding the legal effect of the transfer. Claimant argues that \"working interest\" is \"a term of art in the oil and gas industry that is understood as a basic unit of ownership, with the result that the 100% 'working interest' contemplated under the Agreements transferred the fullest extent of the rights *(i.e.,* the same bundle of prerogatives and the same innominate real rights) that Junex had in the geological intervals that were the objects of the Agreements\".261 Accordingly for Claimant, ownership over a specific geological interval is permitted under the Qu\u00e9bec Civil Code, which allows for \"superficies ownership\".262\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 26.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 26-28, 33, 42; citing October 2017 Merits Hearing, Tr.

In Claimant's view, \"Junex remained the titular permit holder and did not change the name on the permit because it continued to hold rights in other geological intervals that fell outside the deal with Forest Oil. Once the Enterprise earned its working interest, however, Junex had no ability to direct or veto their activities and had no input or control of any kind over what the Enterprise chose to do ... As the titular permit holder, Junex retained the administrative responsibilities, such as filing annual reports and applying for certain permits, but the Enterprise was the beneficial owner of the real rights in the permit\".268\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 30.\n\n(ii) Claimant's alleged investment is covered within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(h)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nClaimant submits that the River Permit Rights also meet the definition of \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139(h), as they constitute Claimant's ownership interests arising from the commitment of capital.269 Claimant contends that the Enterprise's ownership interests in the River Permit was contingent upon it spending a certain amount of money, and that the Enterprise has \"committed capital and other resources through its expenditures on\" the development of the River Permit.270\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 273-274; C-PHB, \u00b6 36.\n\nReply, \u00b6 274.\n\n322.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's position, that Claimant was not required to commit capital and did not perform any work in the River Permit Area, is not borne out from the facts of the case.271 Claimant argues that the context in which the River Permit Agreement was negotiated in relation to the Farmout Agreement, demonstrates that the expenditures demanded under the Farmout Agreement were also applicable to the River Permit.272 According to Claimant, the onshore expenditures should be treated as expenditures toward the River Permit, because the nature of the Enterprise\u2019s development plan for the River Permit did not relate to offshore activities.273\n\nReply, \u00b6 276; C-PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\nReply, \u00b6 276.\n\nReply, \u00b6 277.\n\n323.\n\nClaimant submits further that the acquisition of the River Permit was part of a broader effort to acquire permit areas in the Utica Shale throughout Qu\u00e9bec.274 This required the Enterprise to expend resources in acquiring core samples of other areas to acquire other related permits necessary for its project; this directly relates to the Enterprise acquiring the River Permit.275 These related expenses should be considered for the purposes of capital commitment under NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\nReply, \u00b6 278.\n\nReply, \u00b6 278.\n\n324.\n\nClaimant further argues that the Enterprise was required to pay annual fees to Qu\u00e9bec to maintain its River Permit.276\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 278-279.\n\n325.\n\nClaimant disagrees with Respondent\u2019s application of the *Mondev* case (see \u00b6 310 above), to the present case. According to Claimant, Respondent is mistaken in its position that Claimant was not the valid holder of a \"real right\" in the River Permit. Claimant further rejects Respondent\u2019s contention that the expenditures were not sufficiently related to the River Permit as the expenditures lay directly under the Original Permits.277\n\nReply, \u00b6 282.\n\n326.\n\nClaimant contends that it was the holder of real rights under Qu\u00e9bec law and that the commitment of capital toward the Original Permits was (i) necessary to Claimant\u2019s plan for developing the River Permit; and (ii) made with the intention of realizing the River Permit Rights.278 Claimant, thus, concludes that the River Permit Rights fall within the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h).279\n\nReply, \u00b6 283; C-PHB, \u00b6 39.\n\nReply, \u00b6 283.\n\n327.\n\nClaimant submits that the River Permit Rights are a distinct investment from the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the Original Permits. As such, Claimant objects to said interests being considered cumulatively for the purposes of establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1139(h).280\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 15; November 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 58:17-23.\n\n**(3) Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***a.

The Parties also disagree on the precise scope of Claimant's investment in Canada.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address in (**a**) below, the Parties' disputes regarding the scope of Claimant's investment in Canada. Thereafter in (**b**) below, the Tribunal will assess whether Claimant has a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139.\n\n***a. Scope of Claimant\u2019s Alleged \"Investment\" in Canada***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nClaimant identifies the alleged investment in Canada as comprising the River Permit Rights held by the Enterprise. The River Permit Rights refer to the Enterprise's 100% working interest over a specific geologic interval extending from slightly below the surface until a depth of 743 meters within the River Permit Area.287 Although the Parties disagree on what the term \"working interest\" entails, the Tribunal understands that there is no disagreement regarding the definition of the River Permit Rights as put forth by Claimant.288\n\nSee Refresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 129:16-130:12; Tremblay Expert Report, \u00b6 63 read with \u00b6\u00b6 59.3 and 60.\n\nSee Refresher Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 129:16-130:19.\n\n336.\n\nThe issue regarding the scope of Claimant's alleged \"investment\" in Canada was initially raised by Respondent in the context of its defense to Claimant's contention that Respondent has expropriated Claimant's investment in Qu\u00e9bec.289 Respondent contends that Claimant is artificially limiting the scope of its full investment in Qu\u00e9bec in order to satisfy the \"substantial deprivation\" test necessary for establishing its expropriation claim under NAFTA Article 1110. According to Respondent, Claimant's investment in Qu\u00e9bec is not limited to the River Permit Rights as derived from the River Permit, but also includes Claimant\u2019s interests in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block as derived from the Original Permits.290\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 448; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 286-287.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 451-456.\n\n337.\n\nSubsequently, this issue was also discussed in the context of ascertaining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under NAFTA Article 1139.\n\n338.\n\nIn its Questions to the Parties, referred to in \u00b6 92 above, the Tribunal invited the Parties\u2019 comments on, *inter alia,* the following two questions relating to the scope of Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec in the context of ascertaining its jurisdiction:\n\n1. Generally, what is the Claimant\u2019s \"investment\", as an objective fact: (i) the River Permit 490 only or (ii) the River and Land Permits as a whole? As regards the factual evidence, it will be recalled that the Claimant\u2019s witnesses (particularly Mr. Axani) testified that the permits were seen as a whole, not individually.\n\n2. For this purpose, is the test under NAFTA Article 1139 an objective or a subjective test? In other words, as to the latter, can a claimant for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction subjectively carve out a particular \"investment\", as a stand-alone \"investment\", from a larger \"investment\" assessed objectively as regards both jurisdiction and the merits?\n\n339.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s aforementioned questions, Claimant emphasized that the \"first principle is that the claimant identifies the investment\".291 Claimant further affirmed that \"the investment is the River Permit rights\",292 which are a distinct investment from Claimant\u2019s interests in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block derived through the Original Permits.293 With respect to the test under NAFTA Article 1139, Claimant submitted that:\n\nWhat the Tribunal must do for this issue is to evaluate the subjective definition of the investment for the purposes of the dispute in light of the objective criteria that are set out in NAFTA Article 1139.294\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 56:7-9.\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 58:14-15.\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 58:17-24; 59:10-11; 60: 8-21.\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 57:17-21.\n\n340.\n\nWhilst Respondent does not dispute that Claimant must define its investment for the purposes of ascertaining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, Respondent contends that Claimant may not artificially slice its investment for establishing a treaty breach. Albeit in the context of its defense to Claimant\u2019s claim of expropriation, Respondent submits that, objectively considered, Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec comprises its interests both in the Original Permits and the River Permit.295 During the Refresher Hearing, Respondent submitted as follows:\n\nBefore going any further, I would like to answer the second question that the Tribunal asked in 2017. The Tribunal asked us whether the definition of investment should be seen objectively or subjectively. The Claimant is, of course, free to define its investment as it sees it, because after all, it is they who are writing the claim in this arbitration. If the investment such has satisfied the definition of investment according to article [1139], well, then the Tribunal would have jurisdiction. However, this does not mean that an investor can be -- can decide what is a violation or not of this article. As I will explain a little bit later in my pleading, the definition of investing must be appreciated in an objective fashion.296\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 79.\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 133:1-16.\n\n341.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties, and the Tribunal also concurs, that it is up to a party how it wishes to formulate its claims or counterclaims in an arbitration. In an investment arbitration, it is up to the claimant to identify its alleged investment and the impugned measure by the State, which it alleges has adversely impacted its investment. The Tribunal also accepts that an investment may comprise of different parts, each of which may separately qualify as distinct investments for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n342.\n\nThus, the Tribunal accepts Claimant's contention that, for the purposes of ascertaining its jurisdiction over Claimant's claims in this arbitration, the Tribunal must assess whether the alleged investment, as identified by Claimant, satisfies the objective criteria under NAFTA Article 1139.\n\n343.\n\nIn this case, as Claimant seeks to premise its claims on the River Permit Rights, the jurisdictional issue to be considered by the Tribunal is whether the River Permit Rights fall within the definition of \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139.\n\n344.\n\nHaving said that, the aforesaid position, referred to in \u00b6\u00b6 342 and 343, does not mean that the scope of Claimant's whole investment in Qu\u00e9bec has no relevance to the Parties' disputes in the arbitration. Respondent rightly notes that the scope of Claimant's whole investment in Qu\u00e9bec has a bearing on the Tribunal's analysis of the alleged treaty breaches by Respondent. This issue will be addressed by the Tribunal further in Section X below when analyzing Claimant's allegations of treaty breaches by Respondent.\n\n***b. Whether the River Permit Rights are a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nClaimant asserts that the River Permit Rights are in the nature of (i) intangible property rights, which are covered within the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139(g); and (ii) interests arising from the commitment of capital, that are covered within the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h). The Tribunal will first address the Parties\u2019 submissions in connection with NAFTA Article 1139(h) in (**i**) below and, thereafter, it will address their submissions in connection with NAFTA Article 1139(g) in (**ii**) below.\n\n(i) NAFTA Article 1139(h)\n-------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h) (see \u00b6 294 above):\n\n**investment** means:\n\n...\n\n(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under\n\n(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor\u2019s property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or\n\n(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production, revenue or profits of an enterprise.\n\n347.\n\nTo qualify as a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), the alleged investment must be (i) an interest; (ii) arising out of the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a NAFTA party; (iii) which capital, must have been committed towards economic activity in the territory of a NAFTA party; and (iv) must be pursuant to a contractual arrangement. Sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of NAFTA Article 1139(h) provide illustrative examples of types of contracts relevant for NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\n348.\n\nRespondent submits that the River Permit Rights do not qualify as a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h) as, pursuant to the River Permit Agreement, Claimant was \"deemed\" to have acquired rights in the River Permit Area, without any requirement to commit any capital or to perform work in the River Permit Area.297 Respondent alleges that:\n\n(i) no capital had been specifically committed by Claimant for acquiring the River Permit Rights;\n\n(ii) no work was performed by Claimant in the River Permit Area for the purposes of acquiring the River Permit Rights.298\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 288; citing **Exh. C-022C**, Letter Agreement between Forest Oil and Junex re: amendments to River Permit Agreement, 14 December 2006, \u00b6 3; Gagn\u00e9 First Report, \u00b6 92. See also R-PHB, \u00b6 42.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 288-289; Rejoinder, \u00b6 22.\n\n349.\n\nFor these reasons, Respondent submits that the River Permit Rights do not constitute \"interests arising from the commitment of capital\" for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\n350.\n\nRespondent contends that the River Permit Rights may constitute an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), only if they are regarded as forming part of Claimant's larger investment in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block. Thus, for Respondent, if the River Permit Rights are considered as an independent investment by Claimant, distinct from its other investments in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block derived through the Original Permits, they fail to satisfy the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h).299\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 43.\n\n351.\n\nClaimant maintains that the River Permit Rights are interests arising from the commitment of capital. As proof of commitment of capital, Claimant relies on (i) the expenditure undertaken by the Enterprise pursuant to the Farmout Agreement, which it submits was expended for procuring a 100 % working interest in the Contract Area under the Original Permits as well as in the River Permit Area;300 and (ii) the annual fees that the Enterprise was allegedly obliged to pay to maintain the River Permit.301\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\nReply, \u00b6 279.\n\n352.\n\nClaimant further disputes that the Enterprise did not perform any work in the River Permit Area. Claimant submits that the Enterprise's activities and the capital expenditure incurred in the area covered by the Original Permits was towards the development of the River Permits.302\n\nReply, \u00b6 277.\n\n353.\n\nAs noted in \u00b6 335 above, the River Permit Rights refer to the Enterprise's 100% working interest in a specific geographical interval of the River Permit Area. Claimant submits, but Respondent disputes, that \"working interest\" is a basic unit of ownership in the oil and gas industry and is equivalent to a property.303 According to Claimant, the Enterprise's interests comprise the \"real\" mining rights acquired by the Enterprise in a specific geographical interval of the River Permit Area, following Junex's dismemberment of the River Permit. Claimant submits that these dismembered \"real\" mining rights qualify as intangible property rights under Qu\u00e9bec law.304 This is disputed by Respondent, contending that the Enterprise's interests are in the nature of \"personal\" rights vis-\u00e0-vis Junex and are not property rights or real rights under Qu\u00e9bec law.305\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 61:7-9; 112:2-17; Refresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 94:13-95-1; Tr. Day 2, 83:20-84:1; 113:17-114:3. See also October 2017 Merits Hearing, Tr. Day 3, 583:13-22; 679:11-22; 477:21-278:4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 200.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 167-168.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, whilst Respondent disagrees about the nature and extent of the rights conferred on the Enterprise through the assignment of the \"100% working interest\" in the specific geographical interval of the River Permit Area, Respondent does not appear to dispute that the River Permit Rights constitute \"interests\" for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\n355.\n\nThe term \"interests\" is not defined under NAFTA Article 1139(h). Therefore, the term \"interests\" under NAFTA Article 1139(h) must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty\" *(see* Article 31(1) VCLT extracted in \u00b6 286 above). The Tribunal considers that the term must be interpretated broadly as covering a broad range of interests, provided that (i) the interests arise out of the commitment of capital in the territory of a NAFTA party towards economic activity in that territory, pursuant to a contract; and (ii) are not covered by the exclusionary language under NAFTA Article 1139(i) and (j) (see \u00b6 294 above).\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to decide for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(h) whether Claimant\u2019s interests are in the nature of real property rights or personal rights under Qu\u00e9bec law. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the term \"interests\" under NAFTA Article 1139(h) is broad enough to cover both types of interests, provided the other conditions, referred to in the preceding paragraph, are satisfied.\n\n357.\n\nMoreover, Claimant rightly notes that Respondent concedes that the River Permit Rights will qualify as a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), if Claimant\u2019s interests in the River Permit Area are taken together with its interests in the overall B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block.306 Indeed, Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection in connection with NAFTA Article 1139(h) is only that no capital can be regarded as having been committed by the Enterprise towards the procurement of the River Permit Rights, if the River Permit Rights are regarded as an individual investment. Respondent accepts that if the River Permit Rights are taken together with the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the Original Permits, they satisfy the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h). Thus, Respondent does not dispute that the River Permit Rights qualify as \"interests\" for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 95:21-96-9.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider whether Claimant\u2019s River Permit Rights arose from the commitment of capital, which is Respondent\u2019s main objection in connection with NAFTA Article 1139(h).\n\n359.\n\nIn view of its determinations in \u00b6\u00b6 342 and 343 above, the question before the Tribunal is whether the River Permit Rights, considered as a standalone investment, satisfy the requirement of \"interests arising from the commitment of capital\" under NAFTA Article 1139(h). For the following reasons, the Tribunal decides this in the affirmative.\n\n360.\n\nIt is a matter of record, which is also undisputed between the Parties, that Forest Oil acquired the River Permit Rights from Junex pursuant to the terms of the River Permit Agreement and the Farmout Agreement.\n\n361.\n\nThe Farmout Agreement was the first Agreement entered into between Junex and Forest Oil on 5 June 2006, which related only to Forest Oil\u2019s acquisition of interests in the Original Permits. Paragraphs 3, 4 and 7 of the Farmout Agreement concern Forest Oil\u2019s exercise of its rights to earn an interest in the Contract Area of the Original Permits and its commitment of capital obligations:\n\n3. Upon receipt of the information in Paragraph 2 from Junex, Forest shall have a period of six (6) months from the day Forest received the final core analysis to elect to exercise their option to drill and earn interest in the Contract Area. Forest shall notify Junex in writing of their intentions to either relinquish their rights to earn an interest in the Contract Area or exercise the option to earn interest under the terms stated herein.\n\n4. In the event that Forest elects to exercise said option they shall have a period of 18 months (Commitment Period) to spend, cause to be spent or commit to spend a total sum of [REDACTED]in drilling, completions, re- completions, construction of facilities, pipelines, and gathering lines or on geological and geophysical expenses in order to earn 100% of the Contract Area.\n\n...\n\n7. Upon the satisfaction of Forest\u2019s obligations during the Commitment Period in Paragraph 4 Junex shall assign to Forest 100% interest in the Contract Area and retain [REDACTED]....307\n\n**Exh. C-017** Letter Agreement between Forest Oil and Junex, 5 June 2006, p. 2.\n\n362.\n\nThrough the 29 November 2006 Letter Agreement, which forms part of the River Permit Agreement (see \u00b6 190 above), Junex and Forest Oil agreed that (i) Forest Oil would withdraw its pending application for an exploration license under the St. Lawrence River (in the area now specified as the River Permit Area); and (ii) Junex would seek an extension of one of its Original Permits, #2006RS 184, to cover the River Permit Area.\n\n363.\n\nThereafter, through the 14 December 2006 Letter Agreement, which also forms part of the River Permit Agreement (see \u00b6 185 above), Junex and Forest Oil agreed to extend the terms of the Farmout Agreement to the potentially enlarged area of Original Permit #2006RS 184, for which Junex was yet to procure the exploration license. Paragraph 3 of the 14 December 2006 Letter Agreement, provides that:\n\n3. By its contribution of Permit #2006PG906 containing 11,570 hectares to the enlargement of Junex Permit #2006RS184 Forest [Oil] would be deemed to have earned all rights in, and to the Utica Shale and Lorraine Section in this 11,570 hectares extension of Permit #2006PG906 (the \"Extension\"). The terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement dated June 5 2006 would apply to the Extension except that Forest [Oil] would be deemed to have earned such rights within the Extension.308\n\n**Exh. C-022C**, Letter Agreement between Forest Oil and Junex regarding amendments to the River Permit Agreement, 14 December 2006.\n\n364.\n\nThe 14 December 2006 Letter Agreement records further in connection with the Parties' agreement under paragraph 3 thereof, that:\n\n... in exchange for Forest's contribution of Permit #2006PG906, the Junex Permit #2006RS184 would be enlarged and Forest would earn all rights in the Utica and Lorraine only in the enlarged portion of the Permit #2006RS184, subject to Junex's [REDACTED] convertible after payout to [REDACTED] as per the Letter Agreement dated June 5, 2006\".309\n\n**Exh. C-022C**, Letter Agreement between Forest Oil and Junex regarding amendments to the River Permit Agreement, 14 December 2006.\n\n365.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is clear from the above that following the execution of the River Permit Agreement, the amount of [REDACTED] which was initially to be expended by Forest Oil under the Farmout Agreement, was regarded by Junex and Forest Oil as covering Forest Oil's acquisition of interests both in the Original Permits and in the River Permit.\n\n366.\n\nRespondent argues that the fact that the QMNR had issued the River Permit as a separate exploration license to Junex, *i.e.,* instead of granting Junex's request for enlargement of its existing Original Permit #2006RS184, makes it clear that the Enterprise's contribution under the Farmout Agreement cannot be regarded as covering the River Permit as well. Respondent also attributes heavy significance to the term \"deemed\" in the 14 December 2006 Letter Agreement, in support of its position that Forest Oil did not commit any capital towards the acquisition of its interests in the River Permit Area. The Tribunal does not find these arguments persuasive.\n\n367.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fact that the QMNR issued the River Permit as a separate exploration license to Junex does not detract from Forest Oil's and Junex's agreement under the River Permit Agreement to extend the terms of the Farmout Agreement to the River Permit. A combined reading of the Farmout Agreement and the River Permit Agreement makes it clear that, whilst initially Junex and Forest Oil had agreed that Forest Oil's capital commitment of [REDACTED] would be towards the acquisition of its interests in the Original Permits, thereafter, they agreed that this capital expenditure would also cover the acquisition of interests in the River Permit Area. That the River Permit Agreement was executed subsequently to the Farmout Agreement does not undermine Forest Oil's and Junex's agreement in this regard.\n\n368.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the relevant question is whether Junex and Forest Oil have agreed that Forest Oil's commitment of [REDACTED] was only towards acquisition of interests in the Original Permit or if it was towards acquisition of interests in both the Original Permits and the River Permit. The terms of the Farmout Agreement read together with the River Permit Agreement make clear that [REDACTED] expenditure was towards acquisition of interests in both the Original Permits and the River Permit. This position does not change depending on whether River Permit Rights are regarded as a standalone investment or are taken together with the Enterprise's investment in the Original Permits or by the fact that the River Permit was issued as a separate permit.\n\n369.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that the amount of [REDACTED] referred to in paragraph 4 of the Farmout Agreement (see \u00b6 361 above) was expended by Forest Oil after May 2007, *i.e.,* after the execution of the River Permit Agreement. The River Permit Agreement was executed by Junex and Forest Oil in November-December 2006. On 10 May 2007, Forest Oil elected to exercise its option to earn the interests referred under the Farmout Agreement, triggering the beginning of the \"Commitment Period\" under the Farmout Agreement. Claimant submits, which is not disputed by Respondent, that within the 18-month period thereafter, Forest Oil expended more than the [REDACTED] amount required by the Farmout Agreement.310 Considering that at the time that Forest Oil had elected to exercise its option to earn the interests referred under the Farmout Agreement, the River Permit Agreement had already been executed between Junex and Forest Oil, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to consider that the option was exercised by Forest Oil towards earning interests in both the Original Permits and the River Permit.\n\n**Exh. C-024**, Letter from the Enterprise to Junex re: exercise of Utica Shale Farmout Agreement, 10 May 2007; Lavoie First Statement, \u00b6 22. Reply, pp. 7-10, Claimant's timeline of key events; Refresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 100:25-106:4.\n\n370.\n\nMoreover, Claimant rightly notes, there is \"consistent evidence from both sides of the deal (Forest Oil and Junex) that the [REDACTED] spend was required for Forest Oil to earn its interests in both the Land Permits and the River Permit\".311\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 38; citing October 2017 Merits Hearing, Tr. Day 3, 613:9-15; Tr. Day 2, 335:21-337:7.\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal is also persuaded that the drilling and exploration work undertaken by Forest Oil on the Contract Area under the Original Permits must be taken as being expended by Forest Oil towards its acquisition of interests in both the River Permit and Original Permits. This is consistent with the testimony of Claimant\u2019s witnesses in the arbitration that Forest Oil\u2019s plan for oil and gas exploration within the B\u00e9cancour/ Champlain Block, including the River Permit Area, contemplated onshore drilling rather than off-shore drilling.312\n\nWiggin First Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; Lavoie First Statement, \u00b6 17; Lavoie Second Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n372.\n\nRespondent contends that the work undertaken and expenses incurred in connection with Original Permits cannot be regarded as applying to the acquisition of interests in the River Permit as the majority of the work and expenses incurred on the Contract Area under the Original Permits took place prior to the issuance of the River Permit and at a time \"when the processing of the licence application [for the River Permit] had been suspended, with no indication as to when the ministry would consider it\".313 The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 133.\n\n373.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that majority of the work on the Contract Area under the Original Permits had been performed by Forest Oil prior to Junex\u2019s acquisition of the River Permit does not undermine Junex\u2019s and Forest Oil\u2019s agreement under the River Permit Agreement that the terms of the Farmout Agreement must be regarded as applying equally to the River Permit Agreement.\n\n374.\n\nThe determinative question in the Tribunal\u2019s view is whether Forest Oil would be eligible to acquire the interests in the River Permit Area had it not spent [REDACTED] and undertaken the work contemplated under the Farmout Agreement. The Tribunal concurs with Claimant that it is clear from the evidence on record that, had Forest Oil spent no money and undertaken no work in the Contract Area of the Original Permits, the Enterprise would not have obtained the River Permit Rights.314\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 39.\n\n375.\n\nContrary to Respondent's assertion, the Tribunal considers that the present case bears similarity to the situation in the *Mondev* case. Respondent distinguishes the *Mondev* case from the present one on the basis that, in that case, the contractual arrangement was such that the claimant had invested in a two-phase project through a singular agreement. The agreement contemplated that the claimant would have to invest capital to obtain the assignment and complete the first phase of the project, following which, the claimant had the option to elect whether it wished to undertake work on the second phase of the project. Respondent emphasizes that the claimant in the *Mondev* case derived its interests in both phases of the project from a singular agreement, which was entered into with the city of Boston. The Tribunal is not persuaded by the distinction sought to be drawn by Respondent between the *Mondev* case and the present case. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, it is apparent from a combined reading of the Farmout Agreement and the River Permit Agreement that Claimant could acquire interests in the River Permit Area only once it expended capital and undertook the work contemplated under the Farmout Agreement. There is no requirement under NAFTA Article 1139(h) that the contractual arrangement pursuant to which interests are acquired by the investor must have been entered into by the investor with host State.\n\n376.\n\nLastly, it is apparent that the [REDACTED] amount expended by Forest Oil towards the acquisition of the River Permit Rights was pursuant to the Farmout Agreement read together with the River Permit Agreement. The stipulation under NAFTA Article 1139(h) regarding contractual arrangements, therefore, stands satisfied.\n\n377.\n\nThus, the Tribunal determines that Claimant's River Permit Rights constitute an \"investment\" within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(h). As such, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Claimant's claims in this arbitration.\n\n(ii) NAFTA Article 1139(g)\n--------------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe Parties have made extensive submissions and have filed expert reports in support of their respective positions on whether the River Permit Rights qualify as an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(g). The Parties disagree on whether the River Permit Rights are in the nature of real property rights under Qu\u00e9bec law, or if they are personal contractual rights.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in \u00b6 377 above that the River Permit Rights qualify as a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), thereby establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration.\n\n380.\n\nIn view of this finding, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to further examine whether the River Permit Rights also qualify as a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(g) for the purposes of establishing its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration. Should it be necessary for the Tribunal to consider the nature of the River Permit Rights for addressing the Parties\u2019 other disputes in this arbitration, it will address this question as required in the appropriate place in the Award.\n\n**C.

Claimant\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------\n\n388.\n\nClaimant maintains that its claims raised in this arbitration satisfy the jurisdictional requirements under NAFTA Article 1101(1), as (i) the impugned Act was a legislative Act of the National Assembly of Qu\u00e9bec and is, therefore, attributable to Respondent; (ii) the River Permit Rights are an \"investment\" within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(g) and (h); and (iii) Bill 18, by revoking \"[a]ny mining right\" that had been issued \"for the part of the St. Lawrence River west of longitude 64\u00b051'22\" in the NAD83 geodetic reference system or for the islands situated in that part of the river\", caused the revocation of the River Permit and consequently a termination of Claimant\u2019s River Permit Rights.

Legal Standard***\n-----------------------\n\n400.\n\nAs noted in \u00b6 381 above, NAFTA Article 1101(1) provides in relevant part that NAFTA Chapter Eleven \"applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to (a) investors of another Party; (b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; .... Thus, to fulfil the threshold jurisdictional requirements under NAFTA Article 1101(1), there must be: (i) an investor of a NAFTA Party; (ii) an investment of such an investor in the territory of another NAFTA Party; and (iii) a measure by the other NAFTA Party relating to the investor or the investment.\n\n401.\n\nWhilst the Parties have made detailed submissions as to the meaning of \"relating to\" under NAFTA Article 1101(1), the Tribunal notes that the legal standard under NAFTA Article 1101(1) is not in dispute between the Parties, and that there is also consensus amongst the non-disputing NAFTA Parties on this matter.\n\n402.\n\nSpecifically, it is well-settled in NAFTA arbitral jurisprudence that to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of NAFTA Article 1101(1), it must be demonstrated that a \"legally significant connection\" exists between the impugned measure by the host State and the investor or the investment. Such \"legally significant connection\" requires \"something more than the mere effect of a measure on an investor or an investment\".348\n\n**Exh. CLA-046**, Methanex Corporation v.

NAFTA Article 1101(1) in this Case***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nClaimant is a USA company. Claimant has initiated this arbitration pursuant to NAFTA Article 1117, on behalf of the Enterprise, a Canadian entity, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Claimant (see \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, 7 and 8 above). The Enterprise qualifies as an \"enterprise\" under NAFTA Article 201(1) and as an \"investor of a Party\" under NAFTA Article 1139.\n\n406.\n\nRespondent accepts that \"[t]he fact of owning or controlling LPRC [the Enterprise] would therefore enable it [Claimant] to satisfy the criteria of Articles 1101 and 1117 for *in personam* jurisdiction\".353 However, it contends that \"it matters little whether LPRC [Enterprise] may be characterized as an investment\", as Claimant \"is not alleging that the Act has had the effect of expropriating LPRC or treating it in a manner contrary to the minimum standard of treatment prescribed by NAFTA Article 1105\".354\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 274.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 274.\n\n407.\n\nAs noted in \u00b6 343 above, Claimant's investment, which is the subject-matter of its claims in this arbitration, is the Enterprise's River Permit Rights. Claimant clarifies that it \"refers to the Enterprise [] in the jurisdictional analysis to assert that Lone Pine has standing as a NAFTA-qualified investor. The investment that is the object of Canada\u2019s NAFTA breaches is the River Permit Rights . . \".355\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 181, fn 268.\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in \u00b6 377 above that the River Permit Rights constitute an \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139(h). The River Permit Rights are the Enterprise\u2019s investments in Canada and, therefore, also satisfy the requirement of \"investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party\" under NAFTA Article 1101(1).\n\n409.\n\nThe impugned measure challenged by Claimant in this arbitration is the *Act to limit oil and gas activities* passed by the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly. The impugned Act, being a law passed by Qu\u00e9bec, meets the definition of \"measure\" under NAFTA Article 201.1 and, therefore, constitutes a \"measure adopted or maintained by a Party [Canada]\", as is required under NAFTA Article 1101(1).\n\n410.\n\nThus, to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements under NAFTA Article 1101(1), the issue to be considered by the Tribunal is whether the impugned Act bears a \"legally significant connection\" with the Enterprise or the River Permit Rights.\n\n411.\n\nRespondent argues that there is no \"legally significant connection\" between the impugned Act and the Enterprise or the River Permit Rights as:\n\n(i) the Enterprise did not own the mining rights that were revoked through the impugned Act; and\n\n(ii) that \"[a]t best, it [the Enterprise] holds future economic interests in the development of mineral substances, and those interests constitute a personal right vis-\u00e0-vis one of the holders of those mining rights, namely, Junex\".356 On this basis, Respondent contends that the economic impact of the Act on the Enterprise and its investment, if any, is, therefore, indirect and solely derived from the damage that Junex may have suffered. That the impugned Act might have had an immediate effect on the Enterprise is insufficient to establish a \"legally significant connection\", in Respondent's view.357 According to Respondent, the Enterprise's remedy for any losses lies against its co-contracting party, *i.e.,* Junex, and not Respondent;358\n\n(iii) there was no direct legal relationship between the Enterprise and the impugned Act, as Junex was the only holder of the River Permit until the entry into force of the impugned Act and the Enterprise has never been the holder or co-holder of the River Permit;359\n\n(iv) the Enterprise belonged to an indeterminate class of investors as it was not one of the listed companies directly holding the revoked exploration permits. According to Respondent, only the nine companies that held the 29 exploration permits, which had been partially or fully revoked through the impugned Act, constitute the specific group of investors to which the impugned Act relates to. Respondent contends that, as the Enterprise only had a contractual relationship with Junex for a specific geological interval in the River Permit Area, it does not fall within the class of affected investors.360 Respondent further contends that (i) Junex could have potentially granted contractual interests in the River Permit's other geological intervals to other entities; and (ii) that it would not be practically possible for Respondent to know the identities of all entities who held a contractual interest in exploration permits because there was no requirement to register such an interest in the Mining Register;361 and\n\n(v) there is no evidence to show that the Qu\u00e9bec Government intended to harm the Enterprise or its alleged investment and that Claimant, too, accepts that there was no targeted malice against it by the Qu\u00e9bec Government through the adoption of the impugned Act.362\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 202.

Claimant contends that an \"indeterminate class\" of investors would have to be one of the many suppliers and service providers which provided equipment to entities developing the resource and would not be holding any property rights itself, which the Enterprise was not;363\n\n(iii) Claimant contends that in the *Methanex* case, unlike the case before this Tribunal, the impact of the impugned measure was ancillary to the claimant\u2019s investment, i.e., the investment was not the target of the impugned measure. For this reason, the *Methanex* tribunal determined that there was no \"legally significant connection\" between the impugned measure and the claimant\u2019s investment in that case, as the claimant belonged to an indeterminate class of investors.364 Whereas in the present case, Claimant contends that the Enterprise was the entity exercising the River Permit Rights until it was directly revoked by Bill 18.365 Claimant asserts that the present situation is similar to that in the *Apotex* and *Cargill* cases because Claimant was part of a determinate group of investors whose investment had been targeted by the act of the Government Act;366\n\n(iv) Claimant argues that the findings of the *Bilcon* tribunal support its position that there was a legally significant connection between Bill 18 and the River Permit.367 The tribunal in *Bilcon* rejected the respondent\u2019s position in that case and stated that questions about the existence and ownership of rights under municipal law could not obviate an otherwise clear existence of a legally significant connection.368 Claimant contends that the present situation, in which Claimant has acquired a 100% working interest in the River Permit Rights, demonstrates an even greater legally significant connection than in the *Bilcon* case, where Bilcon shared rights with Nova Stone.369 To further support its position, Claimant argues that the later assignment of rights evidences that Junex and Forest Oil intended to provide the Enterprise with full and exclusive rights and control over the River Permit area.370\n\n(v) Claimant argues that \"the immediate effect\" of Bill 18 prevented Claimant from exercising its rights, which further evidences a \"legally significant connection\";371\n\n(vi) Claimant contends that, contrary to Respondent's assertions,372 there is no requirement to demonstrate a State's intention to penalize the investor in order to meet the \"legally significant connection\" requirement under NAFTA Article 1101.373\n\nReply, \u00b6 238.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 234-235; citing **Exh.

Specifically, the Enterprise holds a 100% working interest in a specific geographical interval of the River Permit Area. Although Respondent disputes whether the 100% working interest vests an intangible property right in the Enterprise, it is clear from the evidence on record that pursuant to the acquisition of the River Permit Rights, the Enterprise had exploration rights in a specific geographical interval of the River Permit Area.\n\n415.\n\nThe passage of the impugned Act revoked all mining rights under the St. Lawrence River, which included the Enterprise's exploration rights in the River Permit Area. Thus, the Enterprise\u2019s exploration rights in the River Permit Area were directly affected by the impugned Act.\n\n416.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion, the connection between the Enterprise\u2019s investment and the impugned Act is not comparable to the situation in the *Methanex* case. Unlike the *Methanex* case, where Methanex was not the target of the impugned measure (being the producer of methanol and not methyl tertiary-butyl ether, which was the product banned by the host State), the Tribunal finds that the River Permit Rights were the target of the impugned Act. The Tribunal does not consider it crucial for the Enterprise to be a permit holder, or have property rights under the St. Lawrence River, for it to fall within the determinate class of investors, whose rights in the St. Lawrence River were affected by the passage of Bill 18 or to be directly impacted by the impugned Act.\n\n417.\n\nRespondent contends that the significant legal connection test is not satisfied in this case, as there is no direct legal relationship between the Enterprise and the host State, since the Enterprise was not the actual permit holder of the River Permit. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. The Tribunal does not consider that, only where there is a direct legal relationship between the investor and the host State, will a \"legally significant connection\" be established between the impugned measure of the State and the investor or the investment. Instead, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, what needs to be considered is whether the impugned measure has a direct impact on the investor and the investment. In this case, the Tribunal finds that the impugned Act had an immediate and direct impact on the Enterprise\u2019s River Permit Rights as the said rights were extinguished following the impugned Act. Thus, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a \"legally significant connection\" between the impugned Act and the River Permit Rights.\n\n418.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s objections under this head and determines that Claimant has met the threshold jurisdictional requirements under NAFTA Article 1101.\n\n419.\n\nTo conclude the jurisdictional analysis, the Tribunal further notes that it is not disputed between the Parties, and the Tribunal is also satisfied, that Claimant has satisfied the other temporal and formal requirements under NAFTA Articles 1117 to 1121.374\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 274.\n\n420.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over Claimant's claims in this arbitration.\n\n**X. LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n**A. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**(1) Relevant Treaty Provisions**\n----------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nNAFTA Article 1110 provides as follows regarding expropriation:\n\n**Article 1110: Expropriation and Compensation**\n\n1. No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an investment (\"expropriation\"), except:\n\n(a) for a public purpose;\n\n(b) on a non-discriminatory basis;\n\n(c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and\n\n(d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 6.\n\n2. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (\"date of expropriation\"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.\n\n3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and be fully realizable.\n\n4. If payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until the date of actual payment.\n\n5. If a Party elects to pay in a currency other than a G7 currency, the amount paid on the date of payment, if converted into a G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, shall be no less than if the amount of compensation owed on the date of expropriation had been converted into that G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, and interest had accrued at a commercially reasonable rate for that G7 currency from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n6. On payment, compensation shall be freely transferable as provided in Article 1109.\n\n7. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with Chapter Seventeen (Intellectual Property).\n\n8. For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, a non-discriminatory measure of general application shall not be considered a measure tantamount to an expropriation of a debt security or loan covered by this Chapter solely on the ground that the measure imposes costs on the debtor that cause it to default on the debt.\n\n**(2) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n***a. Claimant\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------\n\n422.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent has breached its obligations under NAFTA Article 1110 through Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s passage of Bill 18, which expropriated Claimant\u2019s investment in Canada, without providing any compensation to Claimant.375 Claimant contends that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertions, Bill 18 was not passed for a public purpose, and neither was it a valid exercise of Respondent\u2019s police powers.376\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 217-219; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 284-285; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\n(i) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n423.\n\nClaimant submits that NAFTA Article 1110 covers explicit nationalizations or expropriations as well as measures tantamount thereto. According to Claimant, the phrase \"tantamount to expropriation\" in NAFTA Article 1110(1) must be interpreted as \"equivalent\" to expropriation and the test is the same for both \"expropriation\" and \"measure tantamount to\" expropriation.377\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 222-225.\n\n424.\n\nClaimant submits that to determine whether an expropriation has occurred \"the essence of the matter is the deprivation by state organs of a right of property either as such, or by permanent transfer of the power of management and control\".378 The test is based on the \"effects of the impugned measure\",379 which in turn requires a consideration of whether (i) \"[t]he object of the alleged expropriation falls within the scope of treaty-protected property rights (i.e. is capable of being the object of a taking)\";380 and (ii) \"[t]he measure-either directly or indirectly-resulted in a taking or substantial deprivation of the protected property rights.\"381\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 223; citing **CLA-011**, Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 508-509.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 226.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 226.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 226(a)-(b).

Therefore, once an investment qualifies as a NAFTA-protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139, such investment is capable of being expropriated under NAFTA Article 1110.386\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 230.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 304-309.\n\n427.\n\nOn a combined reading of NAFTA Article 1110(1) with NAFTA Article 1139, Claimant contends that, to establish that it has suffered expropriation, it need not demonstrate that its entire \"enterprise\" was taken or that it had no other business activities left.387 Rather, Claimant is only required to show that the object of the alleged expropriation satisfies one of the definitions of \"investment\" in NAFTA Article 1139.388\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 230.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 230.\n\n428.\n\nClaimant disagrees with Respondent's characterization of Claimant's investment as comprising all five related permits that make up the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block, i.e., the Original Permits and the River Permit together. It also rejects Respondent's assertion that the Original Permits are relevant for the expropriation analysis.389 Claimant contends that, notwithstanding that it had other ongoing operations, the River Permit was the \"sweet spot\" of its investment in Respondent's territory, and constitutes an investment in its own right, independent of the Original Permits.390 In this regard, Claimant relies on the arbitral tribunals' findings in cases of *Ampal-American Israel Corp391* and *GAMI.392* Claimant submits that, in these cases, the arbitral tribunals had found that taking of part of a property or revocation of a license in the context of a larger project, which was not destroyed because of taking of the license, can be tantamount to expropriation.393 Claimant contends that the cases of *Burlington Resources, Electrabel, Vanessa Ventures, Merril &amp; Ring, Marvin Feldman,* and *Telenor,* which are relied on by Respondent, are factually distinguishable from the dispute before this Tribunal and are, therefore, not relevant.394\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 336-339; referring to Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 451-452.\n\nReply, \u00b6 341.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 344-345; citing **Exh.

It argues that \"Bill 18 patently constituted a direct taking.

Relying on the Tremblay Expert Report, Claimant contends that it had a vested right in the River Permit.401\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 317-319; citing Gagn\u00e9 First Report, \u00b6 72.\n\n434.\n\nIn opposition to Respondent\u2019s claim that the rights in the River Permit could never have been realized, Claimant explains that Respondent\u2019s argument that \"horizontal drilling across permit boundaries was not permitted\" is anomalous.402 Claimant argues that the prohibitions in Section 22 of the Mining Act apply exclusively to the surface of the land, and do not prohibit nor preclude drilling underneath the surface of the land,403 when the same party owns both contiguous permits.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 320-326; citing Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 440.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 321-322.\n\n435.\n\nClaimant contends that international law supports the position that rights under the River Permit are capable of being expropriated.404 Claimant cites various cases to show that (i) property rights, enjoyment of rights under a license, and contractual rights are generally capable of being expropriated; and (ii) the transfer of rights from one entity to another also grants the recipient a right capable of expropriation.405 On the present facts, Claimant argues that the River Permit Rights are a discrete asset, capable of being the object of independent commercial transactions. Claimant supports this claim by pointing to the conduct of Forest Oil, Junex, the Enterprise, and Lone Pine, all of which were engaged in negotiations and agreements which recognized these rights as a separate and distinct asset.406\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 235.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 235(a)-(c); citing **Exh.

Furthermore, Bill 18 was passed by the Government before the SEA-SG and SEA-2 assessments had concluded.416\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 254; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 65.\n\nReply, \u00b6 373.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 256; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 54-57.\n\n440.\n\nWith regard to the scope of police powers, Claimant submits that Respondent\u2019s arguments have greatly elevated the scope of police powers without any supporting authority.417 According to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s position that a measure can only be excluded from the scope of a State\u2019s police powers if it is \"manifestly incoherent or constitutes a disguised form of protectionism\", is without basis and does not find any support in the legal authorities relied on by Respondent.418 Claimant submits that the proper test to determine whether a State\u2019s reliance on police powers is justified entails the following two questions: (i) whether the State\u2019s interest is *bone fide* or genuine; and (ii) whether the action is non-discriminatory.419\n\nReply, \u00b6 374.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 374-377.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 376-377; **Exh.

Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n(i) The Legal Standard\n----------------------\n\n445.\n\nRespondent concurs with Claimant that NAFTA Article 1110 covers both direct and indirect expropriations.

Respondent asserts that Claimant\u2019s contention regarding the \"sweet spot\" of its investment was a concept developed in its Reply submission because, in its Memorial, Claimant had referred to \"the Champlain/B\u00e9cancour Block - 37 times - as an indivisible whole all of which it wished to explore and which included the River License\".435\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 301. See also \u00b6\u00b6 299-300.\n\n450.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant is employing a variable definition of investment, as \"for jurisdictional purposes and the calculation of damages, it does not hesitate to include the work performed on the Land Licenses, while for the expropriation analysis, it now alleges - with the sole purpose of restricting the definition of investment as much as possible - that only LPRC's rights in the River License are relevant\".436\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 302.\n\n(iii) The Alleged Expropriation\n-------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nRespondent contends that it has not violated NAFTA Article 1110 because even if Claimant had an investment within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139, which Respondent disputes, Claimant had no rights that were capable of being expropriated.437\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 261.\n\n452.\n\nRespondent contends that the concept of expropriation under customary international law and NAFTA Article 1110 is limited to property that is capable of being expropriated.438 In Respondent's view, the issue of whether there exists an \"investment capable of being expropriated\" is distinct from whether there exists an investment that is covered within the scope of the treaty under consideration. For Respondent, the latter is a question of whether the investment satisfies the jurisdictional conditions under a treaty, which would not necessarily make it capable of being expropriated.439\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 400-403; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266; citing **Exh.

Czech Republic UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Liability, 8 July 2009; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 403-404.\n\n453.\n\nWith respect to NAFTA, Respondent does not dispute that the definition of investment under NAFTA Article 1139 also applies to NAFTA Article 1110. Its position, however, is that it is not sufficient for an asset to qualify as an investment under NAFTA Article 1139 in order to be afforded protection against expropriation pursuant to NAFTA Article 1110. In this regard, Respondent relies on the findings of the *Cargill* tribunal that \"the scope of what may be the subject of a claim is delimited in part by the definition of investment in Article 1139, but also by the confines of the legal basis of the particular claim\".440\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266; citing **Exh. CLA-027**, Cargill, Inc. v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009.\n\n454.\n\nRespondent contends that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s assertion, its position in this arbitration does not contradict its position in the *Windstream* case. Respondent submits that in both cases, its position has been that an investment must give rise to a vested right before it can be expropriated under NAFTA Article 1110.441 Respondent submits that both USA and Mexico had supported its interpretation regarding NAFTA Article 1110 in the *Windstream* case. Respondent contends further that the awards rendered in *Chemtura, Merril & Ring* and *European Media Ventures* do not support Claimant\u2019s position that only the definition of investment in NAFTA Article 1139 must be considered when determining whether the said investment is capable of being expropriated. According to Respondent, these cases simply suggest that an interest must, at minimum, constitute an investment under NAFTA Article 1139 to be protected by NAFTA Article 1110.442\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 270; citing **Exh.

According to Respondent, the Enterprise ought to have acquired the right of development prior to the date of expropriation for it to be capable of being expropriated;445\n\n(iii) *Third,* Bill 18 did not have the effect of substantially depriving the Enterprise of its investment since only the River Permit was revoked and the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the Original Permits remained intact.446 According to Respondent, the substantial deprivation test must be established for both direct and indirect expropriation;447\n\n(iv) *Fourth,* LPRC\u2019s contractual rights were not expropriated because the State did not interfere with the contractual relationship between the Enterprise and Junex, which remained intact.448\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 415.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 267-269, 273-276.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 296-304.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 262, 278-287; quoting **Exh.CLA-038**, Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

Respondent relies on the deference standard applied by the *Glamis Gold* tribunal, wherein the tribunal observed that a tribunal\u2019s only task is to decide whether a claimant has proven that the State\u2019s actions \"exhibit a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons\".450 Respondent contends that a claimant should not be allowed to bind the review of State actions in a manner that is not compatible with the regulatory power of States.451\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 312; quoting **Exh.

Respondent explains that the Act was adopted unanimously by Qu\u00e9bec's National Assembly and had the approval of various officials that Minister Normandeau had consulted.455 Respondent accordingly concludes that Claimant has not discharged its burden of proof that there was an absence of good faith in the passage of the Act.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 318-319.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 319-320.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 321-322.\n\n461.\n\nRespondent submits that the theory of police powers does not provide that scientific evidence is necessary when a State wants to legislate for the public's welfare (as evidenced in the cases of *Chemtura, Glamis Gold,* and *Methanex).456* Respondent maintains that Qu\u00e9bec had a legitimate objective of environmental protection, which had a reasonable and rational basis in the form of the SEA-1 Preliminary Report and the BAPE Report 273.457 In reaching the decision to adopt Bill 18, the Qu\u00e9bec Government had duly considered the society's risk tolerance or the social acceptability of the project and the lack of work undertaken till that date in the area of the exploration licenses granted in the St. Lawrence River, which was within its remit to do.458 Respondent argues that the valid exercise of police powers is not subject to a State obligation to use the least trade restrictive approach.459\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 328-331; quoting **Exh.

If so, whether such expropriation was wrongful on account of Qu\u00e9bec's failure to comply with the conditions stipulated under NAFTA Article 1110(1).\n\n491.\n\nClaimant contends, but Respondent disputes, that Qu\u00e9bec's conduct violates NAFTA Article 1110 as (i) the impugned Act was not passed for a public purpose; and (ii) no compensation was paid to the Enterprise upon revocation of its River Permit Rights.\n\n492.\n\nRespondent further disputes that it is a case of expropriation, amongst others, on the grounds that the River Permit Rights were not capable of being expropriated and that, even if they were, it is not a case of expropriation as the impugned Act affected only a part of Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n***a.

The Parties to this case and the NAFTA non-disputing parties, comprising USA and Mexico, agree that \"expropriation\" under NAFTA Article 1110 is to be interpreted in accordance with the customary international law meaning of the term,515 which is also the consistent position that has been taken by other NAFTA tribunals.516\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 228-229; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 397-399; USA NDP Submission, \u00b6 9; Mexico NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\nSee **Exh.

Thus, the threshold for indirect expropriation is also a very high one. There should be a substantially complete deprivation of the economic use and enjoyment of the rights to the investment, such that the investment is seen to have been taken, albeit without a formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\n**Exh.

Canada, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, \u00b6 283.\n\n498.\n\nIn the present case, Claimant alleges that Qu\u00e9bec has engaged in both direct and indirect expropriation or measures tantamount thereto. Claimant contends that where the River Permit Rights are regarded as intangible property rights, constituting a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(g), Qu\u00e9bec's conduct amounts to a direct expropriation or measures tantamount thereto. Where the River Permit Rights are regarded as interests arising from commitment of capital, constituting a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), Qu\u00e9bec's conduct amounts to an indirect expropriation or measures tantamount thereto.523\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 221; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 286-295.\n\n499.\n\nClaimant further contends that to the extent that it is alleging direct expropriation by Qu\u00e9bec of its intangible property rights, \"[t]here is no need to prove substantial deprivation as the Enterprise's investment was taken, full stop\".524 The Tribunal has difficulty in accepting Claimant's position as a matter of general application. The Tribunal can see, particularly in cases where the investment, allegedly expropriated, forms part of a larger investment, that questions of substantial deprivation of the whole investment vis-\u00e0-vis the taking in full of a part of the investment may have to be considered for the expropriation analysis. As noted in \u00b6 492 above, this is also one of the disputed issues in this case. Whilst the Tribunal will address this issue further in the following Sub-Section, at this juncture, the Tribunal considers it sufficient to note that it concurs with the *Electrabel* tribunal\u2019s observations that, for both claims of direct and indirect expropriation, the investor must establish the \"substantial, radical, severe, devastating or fundamental deprivation of its rights or the virtual annihilation, effective neutralization or factual destruction of its investment, its value or enjoyment\".525\n\nReply, \u00b6 289.\n\n**Exh.

Canada, Award, 2 August 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 242, 257.\n\n502.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s position that an investment which qualifies as a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139 is capable of being expropriated for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1110(1). Claimant contends that \"[i]t is plain that the text of Article 1110(1) that prohibits expropriation of 'an investment\u2019 must be interpreted to prohibit the expropriation of an investment as defined by the treaty itself, meaning in accordance with the definitions set out in Article 1139.\"528 Respondent disagrees with Claimant that an investment as defined under NAFTA Article 1139 is *ipso facto* capable of being expropriated, contending that \"[t]he concept of 'expropriation\u2019, which is limited in customary international law to property capable of being expropriated, is not broadened by the definition of the term 'investment' included in NAFTA Article 1139.\"529\n\nReply, \u00b6 309. See also \u00b6\u00b6 304-308.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 403.\n\n503.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent is correct. An inquiry into an alleged treaty breach of expropriation commences with an examination of whether there exists a protected investment under the treaty, which must be followed by an examination of whether the said protected investment is capable of being expropriated. As noted by the *Cargill* tribunal, \"the scope of what may be the subject of a claim [for expropriation under NAFTA] is delimited in part by the definition of investment in Article 1139, but also by the confines of the legal basis of the particular claim\".530 The Tribunal notes that this approach was also followed by the arbitral tribunal in *European Media Ventures v. The Czech Republic,* which decision has been relied on by Claimant.531 In *European Media Ventures,* the tribunal, whilst noting that the treaty under consideration in that case \"is permeated by a single concept of investment\", clarified that it \"consider[ed] the questions (a) whether the contractual rights on which Claimant relies constitute an investment within Article 1 of the Treaty; (b) whether those rights are capable of expropriation under Article 3; and (c) whether they were in fact expropriated, to be three entirely separate questions\".532 Contrary to Claimant's contention, the Tribunal does not consider that this is tantamount to different meanings being attributed to the term \"investment\" under NAFTA Article 1139 and under NAFTA Article 1110. The Tribunal further concurs with Respondent that neither the decisions in *Chemtura v. Canada* and *Merrill & Ring v. Canada,* nor Canada's submissions in *Windstream Energy LLC v. Canada,* which are all relied on by Claimant in support of its position, contradict this approach.533\n\n**Exh. CLA-027**, Cargill, Inc. v.

Alleged Expropriation in this Case***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nClaimant contends that where the River Permit Rights are regarded as intangible property rights, constituting a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(g), the revocation of the River Permit Rights through the impugned Act amounts to a direct expropriation or measures tantamount thereto. According to Claimant, where the River Permit Rights are regarded as interests arising from commitment of capital, constituting a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(h), the revocation of the River Permit Rights, through the impugned Act, amounts to an indirect expropriation or measures tantamount thereto.534\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 221.\n\n505.\n\nRespondent contests Claimant\u2019s allegations of expropriation, *inter alia*, on the grounds that: (i) the River Permit Rights do not constitute a protected investment under NAFTA Article 1139(g) and (h); (ii) Claimant\u2019s alleged investment under NAFTA Article 1139 was not capable of being expropriated as Claimant\u2019s interests in the River Permit Area had not yet vested; (iii) it is not a case of direct expropriation as the River Permit Rights were not acquired or appropriated from the investor to the host State; (iv) the impugned Act did not have the effect of substantially depriving Claimant of its investment in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n506.\n\nAs a first step, an analysis of the scope of Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec is in order. As noted in the Parties\u2019 respective positions under this Section (see \u00b6\u00b6 426-428 and 447-450 above), and also in the context of Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional analysis in \u00b6\u00b6 335-340 above, the Parties have debated extensively regarding the scope of Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec and its relevance for addressing Claimant\u2019s allegations of treaty breaches by Respondent.\n\n507.\n\nThe Tribunal determined in \u00b6 342 above, that for the purposes of ascertaining its jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims, the Tribunal must assess whether the alleged investment, as identified by Claimant, satisfies the objective criteria under NAFTA Article 1139. However, the fact that Claimant chose to limit its claims of alleged treaty breaches to the treatment of its River Permit Rights, does not preclude the Tribunal from considering Claimant\u2019s investment as a whole, where such assessment is necessary for the purposes of addressing its claims of alleged treaty breaches (see \u00b6 344 above). This is particularly the case where the alleged treaty breach is expropriation.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that even if different parts of an investment may qualify as separate investments for jurisdictional purposes, the test for expropriation must be applied to the relevant investment as a whole. A contrary approach, as the *Electrabel* tribunal noted, would \"mean, absurdly, that an investor could always meet the test for indirect expropriation by slicing its investment as finely as the particular circumstances required, without that investment as a whole ever meeting that same test\".535\n\n**Exh. RLA-050**, Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, Part VI, \u00b6 6.57.\n\n509.\n\nIn the facts of this case, the Tribunal finds that Claimant's whole investment in Qu\u00e9bec necessarily comprises its interests in the Original Permits and the River Permit taken together. For the reasons elaborated below, the Tribunal finds that the Enterprise's River Permit Rights, which Claimant alleges were expropriated by Respondent, were acquired as part of Forest Oil's investment activity in the Original Permits and in furtherance of its plan to explore shale gas in the Utica Shale basin in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. As such, the River Permit Rights are intrinsically linked to the Enterprise's interests in the Original Permits. Thus, whilst the River Permit Rights constitute a separate investment for jurisdictional purposes, the Tribunal considers that they cannot be separated from the Enterprise's interests in the Original Permits for the purposes of the expropriation analysis.\n\n510.\n\n*First,* the documents on record make clear that the Original Permits and the River Permit were closely connected in Claimant's plan to explore and develop shale gas in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block. Specifically, Claimant's interests in all five Permits originate either from the Farmout Agreement individually considered or from the Farmout Agreement and the River Permit Agreement taken together. Specifically, the Tribunal notes that Claimant's interests in the Original Permits were acquired pursuant to the Farmout Agreement and its interests in the River Permit, *i.e.,* the River Permit Rights, were acquired pursuant to the River Permit Agreement read together with the Farmout Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 177 and 191 above, respectively.\n\n511.\n\n*Second,* it is apparent from the terms of the River Permit Agreement that although the River Permit Agreement was executed later in point of time by Junex and Forest Oil, it is closely tied to the Farmout Agreement. Paragraph 3 of the 14 December 2006 Letter Agreement, which forms part of the River Permit Agreement (see \u00b6 190 above), specifically provides that \"[t]he terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement dated June 5 2006 [i.e., Farmout Agreement] would apply to the Extension [i.e., River Permit Area] . . (see \u00b6 191(v) above).\n\n512.\n\n*Third,* the Original Permits and the River Permit form part of the same investment activity by Forest Oil in Qu\u00e9bec. The Tribunal notes that Forest Oil, Claimant\u2019s former parent company, had entered into the Farmout Agreement with Junex in June 2006, with a view to explore the shale gas potential of the St. Lawrence Lowlands.536 As noted in \u00b6 143 above, (i) the St. Lawrence Lowlands include a section of the freshwater St. Lawrence River; and (ii) both the St. Lawrence Lowlands and a part of the St. Lawrence River contain Utica Shale.\n\nWiggins First Statement, \u00b6 8; Memorial, \u00b6 3; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 141, 145; Claimant's Presentation, 25 February 2021, slide 8.\n\n513.\n\nAt the time of Forest Oil\u2019s entry into the Farmout Agreement, Junex was the holder of four exploration permits, i.e., the Original Permits, in the northern and southern boundaries of the St. Lawrence River, referred to as the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block. Accordingly, the Farmout Agreement pertained only to the Original Permits. Thereafter, in July 2006, Forest Oil applied for an exploration permit under the St. Lawrence River, which it subsequently withdrew following its agreement with Junex, that Junex would apply for an exploration permit under the St. Lawrence River and would allow Forest Oil to partner with it to develop the shale gas resources under the St. Lawrence River. The exploration permit acquired by Junex under the St. Lawrence River refers to the River Permit. A map depicting the Original Permits and the River Permit held by Junex, and in which Forest Oil acquired the 100% working interest for a specific geographical interval, is extracted below. The four Original or Land Permits are depicted in orange colour and the River Permit is depicted in green colour:537\n\nClaimant's Presentation, 25 February 2021, slide 5.\n\n514.\n\n*Fourth,* it is Claimant's own position, which has been upheld by the Tribunal in \u00b6\u00b6 365-370 above, that the amount of over [REDACTED] spent by Claimant, pursuant to the Farmout Agreement, was towards the acquisition of interests in both the Original Permits and the River Permit. Claimant does not contend, and neither does the record show, any demarcation of the [REDACTED] amount between the Original Permits and the River Permit.\n\n515.\n\n*Fifth,* it is also Claimant's position that the work undertaken by Forest Oil in the Original Permits was also towards the River Permit. Claimant argues that since offshore drilling was not permitted in Qu\u00e9bec, the exploration of gas resources under the St. Lawrence River had to be undertaken through horizontal drilling methods undertaken on the Original Permits. The Tribunal has determined in \u00b6\u00b6 371-375 above that the activity undertaken by Claimant on the Contract Area under the Original Permits was towards both Original Permits and the River Permit.\n\n516.\n\nIn support of its position that the River Permit Rights are a separate investment from the Enterprise's interests in the Original Permits, Claimant mainly relies on the fact that the River Permit was issued as a separate permit by the QMNR instead of an extension of Junex's existing Original Permits. Claimant contends that this is a determinative factor for holding that the River Permit, and by extension, Claimant's River Permit Rights, are a separate investment from the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the Original Permits.538 The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. The question is whether the Enterprise\u2019s interests on the Original Permits and the River Permit formed part of one integrated investment activity by Claimant. Further, Claimant\u2019s witness, Mr. Lavoie, testified during cross-examination, that it was the common intention of Junex and Forest Oil to extend the territorial scope of the Farmout Agreement to also cover the River Permit Area, which indicates that the River Permit and the Original Permits were regarded as one integrated investment activity:\n\nQ. So essentially, you enlarged the territorial scope of the contract [Farmout Agreement]?\n\nA. That was the spirit of that [River Permit] agreement, just to enlarge that, so we came [to] exactly the same term, so they have to spend the [REDACTED] and that includes that potential enlargement on one of the permits.539\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 15; November 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 58:17-23.\n\nOctober 2017 Merits Hearing, Tr. Day 3, 592:5-11.\n\n517.\n\nAll these factors lead the Tribunal to conclude that the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the River Permit and the Original Permits form part of one integrated investment. As such, Claimant\u2019s claim for expropriation needs to be assessed keeping in mind its whole investment in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question of whether the extinguishment of the Enterprise\u2019s River Permit Rights constitutes an expropriation, or a measure tantamount to expropriation, of Claimant\u2019s whole investment comprising the River Permit Rights and the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the Original Permits together.\n\n519.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant initially maintained that the River Permit Rights were the \"sweet spot\" or the \"engine\" of Claimant\u2019s investment in B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block and, therefore, their extinguishment pursuant to the impugned Act was tantamount to an expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec. However, during the November 2017 Merits Hearing, Claimant conceded that if the Tribunal were to determine that its investment comprises the River Permit Rights and the interests in the Original Permits together, Claimant does not meet the test for expropriation.\n\n520.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in its Questions to the Parties, referred to in \u00b6 92 above, the Tribunal invited Claimant's comments on the following question relating to its claim for the treaty breach of expropriation:\n\n14. On the assumption (here assumed for the sake of argument only) that the Claimant's \"investment\" comprised the River and Land Permits as a whole (and not merely the River Permit), the Claimant should clarify its pleaded case on the alleged expropriation of such investment as a whole under NAFTA Article 1110, given that (as the Tribunal understands), in contrast to the River Permit, the Land Permits are not alleged to have been similarly expropriated by the Respondent.\n\n521.\n\nDuring the November 2017 Merits Hearing, Claimant confirmed that, should the Tribunal consider its investment to comprise the Enterprise's interests in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block as a whole, it concedes its expropriation claim in this arbitration:\n\nIf you decide to consider the B\u00e9cancour-Champlain block to be the investment, Canada told us this morning they concede it would qualify as an investment under article 1139(H). In that light, we would also like to respond and ensure you have a clear response to the question No. 14 that you posed prior to the closing of arguments which was to ask what the effect on our pleadings with respect to article 1110 would be if you were to find that the B\u00e9cancour-Champlain block was the investment.\n\nIf you so find, the claimant maintains its 1105 claim but has a concession to make in turn that we would not argue that there would be an expropriation under 1110 if you find that the B\u00e9cancour-Champlain block as a whole is the investment.540\n\nNovember 2017 Merits Hearing Tr., 229:12-230:3.\n\n522.\n\nAs the Tribunal has determined above that Claimant's investment comprises the River Permit Rights and the interests in the Original Permits taken together, Claimant's claim for expropriation can be directly rejected on the basis of its aforementioned concession.\n\n523.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is also not persuaded from the documents on record that the River Permit Rights were the \"sweet spot\" of Claimant's investment in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block, such that the extinguishment of the River Permit led to a substantially complete deprivation of Claimant's investment in the B\u00e9cancour/Champlain Block.\n\n524.\n\n*First,* the Tribunal notes that the Farmout Agreement does not contain any provisions for exploring shale gas under the St. Lawrence River. If the area under the St. Lawrence River was the \"sweet spot\" as Claimant alleges, the Tribunal considers that it would have been reflected in the Farmout Agreement. Rather, the documentary record makes clear that at the time that Forest Oil commenced its investment in Qu\u00e9bec, the possibility of obtaining the River Permit was not clearcut. Notwithstanding this, Forest Oil invested in the Original Permits. Thus, the Tribunal is not persuaded that at the time of Forest Oil\u2019s entry into the Qu\u00e9bec market, it had determined that the area under the St. Lawrence River was the \"sweet spot\" of its investment in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n525.\n\n*Second,* the testimonies by Claimant\u2019s witnesses and experts do not support the position that the River Permit Rights were considered by Claimant to be the primary focus of its investment to the exclusion of the Enterprise\u2019s interests in the Original Permits.541\n\nAxani First Statement, \u00b6 26; October 2017 Merits Hearing, Tr. Day 2, 279:20-281:10; Tr. Day 8, 2093:13-22.\n\n526.\n\n*Third,* it is undisputed by Claimant that it can continue to undertake exploration activities on the Contract Area of the Original Permits and, therefore, its entire investment in Qu\u00e9bec has not been extinguished through the impugned Act.\n\n527.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant\u2019s investment in Qu\u00e9bec has not been expropriated through the impugned Act. In view of this determination, the Tribunal does not need to address the Parties\u2019 arguments on the satisfaction of the conditions of legal expropriation under NAFTA Article 1110 or on Claimant\u2019s request for adverse inferences for non-production of documents.\n\n528.\n\nThe Tribunal, accordingly, rejects Claimant\u2019s claim for breach of NAFTA Article 1110.\n\n**B. Minimum Standard of Treatment**\n------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Relevant Treaty Provisions**\n----------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nNAFTA Article 1105 provides as follows regarding the minimum standard of treatment:\n\n**Article 1105: Minimum Standard of Treatment**\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 and notwithstanding Article 1108(7)(b), each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, and to investments of investors of another Party, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife.\n\n3. Paragraph 2 does not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or grants that would be inconsistent with Article 1102 but for Article 1108(7)(b).\n\n530.\n\nThe 2001 FTC Note provides the following clarification regarding the interpretation of the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105:\n\nB. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law\n\n1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).\n\n**(2) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Claimant\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------\n\n(i) The Legal Standard\n----------------------\n\n531.\n\nClaimant submits that the Parties agree that NAFTA Article 1105 must be interpreted consistently with the 2001 FTC Note, referred to in \u00b6 530 above, which provides that the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105 is akin to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.542\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 448-449; C-PHB, \u00b6 68.\n\n532.\n\nClaimant relies on the *Waste Management* tribunal's articulation of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment of FET, to contend that customary international law has evolved over time and includes conduct that is \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or involving a lack of due process\".543 Claimant submits that subsequent arbitral tribunals under NAFTA, and other treaties, have acknowledged the *Waste Management* award as articulating the standard of customary international law.544\n\nReply, \u00b6 453; citing **Exh.

Claimant argues that Bill 18 was enacted in the absence of any evidence supporting the Act.558 Claimant clarifies that it is not challenging a demanding domestic regulatory framework, rather it is challenging Qu\u00e9bec's attempt to justify Bill 18 with environmental and scientific bases that did not exist.559\n\nReply, \u00b6 490.\n\nReply, \u00b6 491.\n\n540.\n\nClaimant concludes that Bill 18 departed from both NAFTA Article 1105 standard, and the decision-making standard which Qu\u00e9bec had set for itself. By deviating from these standards, Claimant asserts that Qu\u00e9bec acted in a manner that was arbitrary, grossly unfair and unjust, and idiosyncratic, which in Claimant's view, violated NAFTA Article 1105.560\n\nReply, \u00b6 493.\n\n*b) Bill 18 was arbitrary*\n--------------------------\n\n541.\n\nClaimant argues that Qu\u00e9bec's immediate and permanent revocation of exploration permits was arbitrary because it lacked any factual, scientific or logical basis, and even contradicted the Government's own internal position that horizontal drilling under the river could be done safely.561\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 495, 499-500; Memorial, \u00b6 294.\n\n542.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the St. Lawrence River was never part of Qu\u00e9bec's ongoing environmental study process, which formed the basis for reforms to the hydrocarbon exploration framework.562 Thus, there was \"no rational connection between the stated purpose of Bill 18 and its effect\".563\n\nReply, \u00b6 496; C-PHB, \u00b6 69.\n\nReply, \u00b6 497.\n\n543.\n\nClaimant relies on the following to contend that Bill 18 was arbitrary in revoking the exploration permits in the St. Lawrence River, including the River Permit:564\n\n(i) Qu\u00e9bec did not take any steps to study the St. Lawrence River area affected before enacting Bill 18, despite its commitment to study areas before taking regulatory action.565\n\n(ii) Respondent's evidence and the internal Qu\u00e9bec Government's documents in 2010-2011 allegedly included no scientific or factual support for a revocation of permits. According to Claimant, the documentary record demonstrates that environmental groups had only asked Minister Normandeau to suspend St. Lawrence River activities for a study of the river in November 2010 and had not asked for permits to be revoked.566 Furthermore, the proposed moratorium was only intended to affect marine surface activities and not sub-surface exploration or exploitation.567\n\n(iii) Contrary to Respondent\u2019s arguments that Bill 18 was enacted based on the findings of the SEA-1 Report and the BAPE 273 report, Claimant alleges that the studies and conclusions in these Reports pertained to areas that were not the subject matter of Bill 18. Accordingly, for Claimant, neither the SEA-1 Report nor the BAPE-273 Report supports the implementation of Bill 18.568\n\n(iv) Respondent\u2019s justification for Bill 18, namely, that it is \"logical\" to extend the moratorium from the areas covered by the SEA-1 Report to the St. Lawrence River, is illogical,569 and contravenes the Qu\u00e9bec Government\u2019s commitment to basing its decisions on scientific facts.570\n\n(v) Qu\u00e9bec summarily reversed its earlier position that horizontal drilling was safe, without any evidence.571\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 502-503.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 507-509.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 510-519.\n\nReply, \u00b6 516.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 520-535; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.\n\nReply, \u00b6 501(d).\n\nReply, \u00b6 538.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 542-548.\n\n544.\n\nClaimant further argues that it had a legitimate expectation that it would be afforded the opportunity to explore for shale gas and to pursue its commercial development plans, as before Forest Oil had applied for the original River Permit, it had specific discussions with the QMNR officials about its plans and it was encouraged to proceed with its investment.572 Claimant contends that the permit revocation effected by Bill 18 was neither within the normal regulation of the industry, nor was it provided for by the Mining Act.573\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 295.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 320.\n\n545.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the real reason for revoking the permits was political, which it alleges has also been admitted by Minister Normandeau.574\n\nReply, \u00b6 504; C-PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\n*c) Bill 18's revocation of permits was grossly unfair and unjust*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nClaimant argues that Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s decision to immediately and permanently revoke the permits without paying any compensation through Bill 18 was grossly unfair and unjust as:\n\n(i) Bill 18 was not devised and implemented in a context of thorough study aimed at regulatory reform founded upon scientific fact. Claimant contends that the permanent revocation of permits through Bill 18, before the completion of scientific studies on either the area affected by the Act or the industry generating concern, was grossly unjust and unreasonable. For Claimant, the fact that the measure was implemented in an industry that was \"still in a very early stage of its development\", where the Government was conducting an evidence-based approach to studying its development, further heightened the unjustness of the measure;575\n\n(ii) the immediate and permanent revocation of permits took place while Qu\u00e9bec continued to rely on existing provisions in the EQA to ensure that hydrocarbon exploration activities conformed to the province's environmental safety standards.576 Claimant argues that the existence of environmental protection and supervisory mechanisms at the disposal of Qu\u00e9bec's regulators evidence that the revocation of permits through Bill 18 was a political objective lacking scientific or evidentiary basis.577\n\n(iii) Minister Normandeau held horizontal drilling to an impossible standard that no regulated activity could be expected to meet;578\n\n(iv) Qu\u00e9bec took the decision to not pay monetary compensation to the permit holders on the basis that it would be politically unpopular to compensate.579\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 549-559.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 560-566.\n\nReply, \u00b6 567.\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 87.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 323, 326-328.\n\n547.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's reliance on the precautionary principle, contending that a permanent destruction of rights, like the revocation of the River Permit, cannot be justified using the precautionary principle.580\n\nC-PHB, \u00b6 91.\n\n*d) The boundaries of the permit revocations are idiosyncratic*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n548.\n\nClaimant argues that the geographic boundaries of Bill 18 cannot be supported (i) in light of the Government's alleged admissions that the decision was not based on environmental considerations; and (ii) considering that for other instances of studying and regulating hydrocarbon development, the Government had maintained a commitment to area-specific studies.581 Claimant contends that the Government\u2019s admissions concerning the importance of obtaining geography-specific evidence undermines any argument that the territorial scope of Bill 18 can be justified, as studies have not been conducted in the St. Lawrence river area.582\n\nReply, \u00b6 568; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\nReply, \u00b6 572.\n\n549.\n\nClaimant argues that the eastern boundaries of the permit revocation lack coherence and are idiosyncratic,583 which is demonstrated by Minister Normandeau\u2019s declaration \"that we cut it where we cut it\".584 Claimant contends that a measure that is intended to protect the environment requires an ecological and environmental basis for application on a specific area and not a longitudinal one as was the case with Bill 18.585 According to Claimant, Bill 18\u2019s eastern boundary was adjusted to comply with an inter-governmental agreement between Qu\u00e9bec and Respondent, and not on account of environmental facts and needs.586\n\nReply, \u00b6 569; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 569-570; quoting **Exh.

Further, according to Respondent, the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105 is an objective standard based on the existence of specific rules regarding the protection of aliens and is not a subjective standard allowing a tribunal to assess the impugned measure against its own idea of what constitutes FET.592\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 343; citing **Exh.

It submits that several NAFTA tribunals have recognized that \"legitimate expectations\" is not part of customary international law on the minimum standard of treatment, and such tribunals have refused to apply it in the context of an analysis of a breach of NAFTA Article 1105.600 Respondent contends that Claimant, too, is no longer pursuing its contention that its expectations are protected by the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105.601\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 351-354.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 229.\n\n(ii) FET Breach in this Case\n----------------------------\n\n*a) The Tribunal's power to examine the challenged measure pursuant to NAFTA Article 1105*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nRespondent submits that when examining whether there is a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105, arbitral tribunals must be deferential to the regulatory power of States and must not substitute themselves for the States and rule on whether it was appropriate to adopt one measure as opposed to another. According to Respondent, arbitral tribunals may not question the public policy choices of the responsible authorities of a State.\n\n561.\n\nRespondent submits that, the aforementioned approach equally applies to measures adopted by a State\u2019s legislative bodies.602\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 344, 350; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 223-228.\n\n*b) The passage of the impugned Act is not a violation of NAFTA Article 1105*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nAccording to Respondent, irrespective of whether the Tribunal adopts Canada\u2019s or Claimant\u2019s position on the legal standard of the protections offered under NAFTA Article 1105, the impugned Act, when considered in its context, is not violative of either standard put forth by the Parties.603\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 222.\n\n563.\n\nRespondent submits that the impugned Act was passed in light of the unfavorable findings and concerns towards shale gas exploration and exploitation activities identified in the SEA-1 Preliminary Report and BAPE Report 273, and the serious lack of social acceptability of shale gas development in Qu\u00e9bec. Thus, Respondent submits that the revocation of exploration permits in the St. Lawrence River through the impugned Act was based on a legitimate policy objective, which was to ensure the protection of the St. Lawrence River.604\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 231-232; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 365.\n\n564.\n\nRespondent objects to Claimant's contention that the adoption of the impugned Act by the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly was not supported by scientific basis and was thus arbitrary, unjust, and inequitable. Respondent argues that this is a misinterpretation of the SEA-1 Report, BAPE Report 273, and Minister Normandeau's statements.605\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 231-236.\n\n565.\n\nRespondent submits that the findings in the SEA-1 Preliminary Report mentioned the vulnerability of St. Lawrence and noted that the area studied was not suitable for oil and gas development. The BAPE Report 273 sheds further light on major gaps in relation to scientific knowledge relating to shale gas exploration and development activities as well as their risks. Based on the findings of these two reports, as a cautious measure, the Qu\u00e9bec Government considered it appropriate to prohibit oil and gas exploration in the St. Lawrence River.606\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 361-365.\n\n566.\n\nRespondent denies that the findings in the SEA-1 Preliminary Report and BAPE Report 273 contradict the grounds relied upon by the Qu\u00e9bec Government while passing the impugned Act.607 BAPE Report 273 noted that parts of the Qu\u00e9bec territory may not be compatible with shale gas development activities, which as the Assistant Deputy Minister, Water Expertise, Analysis and Environmental Assessment indicated \"it was obvious that one of those territories was the St. Lawrence\".608 This observation was made in a context where SEA-1 had concluded that the relevant sectors of the St. Lawrence were not an appropriate environment for such activities even though more scientific knowledge was required and relevant to discover the exact extent of the risk.609\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 241.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 241; citing Dupont First Statement, \u00b6 83; **Exh.

In Respondent's view, the Government had identified the characteristics of this territory that justified the transposition of the findings.610\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 243; citing Dupont First Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 63-69; Gosselin First Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52; Sauv\u00e9 First Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; **Exh.

The applicability of the findings in the SEA-1 report to the fluvial section of the St. Lawrence River was noted by a number of environmental groups in a press release.\n\n568.\n\nThus, Respondent maintains that the Qu\u00e9bec Government's decision to revoke mining rights in the St. Lawrence River was based on available information and studies and was not arbitrary. Respondent submits that the decision was also consistent with the principles set out in Section 6 of the SDA.611\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 242; citing **R-005A**, Sustainable Development Act, CQLR, chapter D-8.1.1, s.6.\n\n569.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the St. Lawrence River is distinguishable from other water bodies in Qu\u00e9bec as it is an exceptional environment known for its history, biodiversity, and seaway to the Great Lakes. It also serves as a drinking water supply for more than half of Qu\u00e9bec's population and supports a range of key socio-economic sectors for Qu\u00e9bec and Canada.612 Thus, the Qu\u00e9bec Government's decision not to extend the application of the Act to all of Qu\u00e9bec's watercourses cannot be regarded as arbitrary.

Respondent also submits that it is within a legislator's function to consider, *inter alia*, the social acceptability of an economic activity, even in a limited fashion as in the present situation.624\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 235.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 236.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 236.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 237.\n\n574.\n\nRespondent contends that the regulation of a new industry such as the exploitation of hydrocarbons is different from regulating an existing well-established industry such as marine transportations; it cannot be inferred that the St. Lawrence River is conducive to any new type of activity simply because it has already been used for regulated commercial and industrial uses.625 It is also because this environment was in high demand that extreme caution had to be taken before new activities would be authorized.626 This argument was made in response to Claimant's allegations that the Qu\u00e9bec Government cannot credibly claim that it was seeking to protect the St. Lawrence River environment when the environment was already being used for commercial and industrial purposes.627\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 239.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 239.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 239.\n\n575.\n\nRespondent submits that Minister Normandeau's decision to propose that the Act be adopted was consistent with the opinions of other QMNR officials.

Further, according to Respondent, the document simply states that the Government believes that it is not necessary to consider a complete moratorium on all Qu\u00e9bec territory.630 According to Respondent, Claimant has misunderstood the scope of an information note from an official at the QMNR dated 27 January 2011, which deals with the consequences of a moratorium on shale gas development on all of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s territory and does not relate to a moratorium specifically on the territory covered by Bill 18.631 According to Respondent, Claimant was also wrong in interpreting the said document as opposition by officials toward Minister Normandeau\u2019s stance. Moreover, the Deputy Minister at the QMNR has confirmed that \"the officials with whom he interacted at the *Minist\u00e8re des Ressources naturelles* [i.e., the QMNR] unanimously believed that Bill 18 was a reasonable, justified public interest measure . . \".632\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 251-256.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 250.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 251; citing Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 251; quoting Suav\u00e9 First Statement, \u00b6 48; Sauv\u00e9 Second Statement, \u00b6 3.\n\n577.\n\nRespondent contends further that Claimant had misinterpreted various documents as demonstrating that the Qu\u00e9bec Government considered that it was sufficient to apply Section 22 of the EQA to regulate gas drilling.633 Respondent concedes that the application of the EQA to gas drilling was meant to tighten the regulations for the industry; however, it argues that there was no suggestion that the Qu\u00e9bec Government had planned to limit itself to that measure.634\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 252-254.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 252.\n\n578.\n\nFurther, neither Minister Normandeau, nor the Qu\u00e9bec Government, indicated that the prohibition announced in the fall of 2010 was aimed only at surface activities and that exploration and development beneath the St. Lawrence River would be permitted.635 No announcement was made to this effect, and Claimant is relying on an internal document of its Enterprise to support its position. Respondent argues that even if the document were to be given weight by the Tribunal, the contents of the document do not support Claimant\u2019s position.636\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 255.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 255; citing **Exh.

Respondent submits that this issue was considered, however no position was taken.637\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 256.\n\n580.\n\nIn view of the above, Respondent invites the Tribunal to exercise extreme caution before accepting Claimant's version of the facts as true, without first referring to the relevant documents themselves.638\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 257.\n\n581.\n\nThus, Respondent maintains that the Act does not violate NAFTA Article 1105 because it was adopted (i) following the SEA-1 Preliminary Report and BAPE Report 273, which expressed environmental concerns regarding shale gas exploration activities; and (ii) in a context where shale gas development faced a lack of social acceptability. Further, the affected companies had not conducted any exploration work and suffered no injustice or unfairness, because the Act has no discriminatory provisions, and applies to all holders of the affected area equally, and because the adoption of Bill 18 followed a proper decision-making and statutory development process. Respondent submits that several other jurisdictions have also questioned the environmental and social impacts of shale gas development or prohibiting it.639\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 258.\n\n**(3) Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***a.

The Legal Standard***\n---------------------------\n\n586.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s case, which Respondent disputes, that the revocation of Bill 18 by Qu\u00e9bec constitutes a breach of the FET standard of treatment guaranteed under NAFTA Article 1105(1). Before examining the merits of Claimant\u2019s allegations of breach of NAFTA Article 1105(1), the Tribunal must address the legal standard of FET under NAFTA Article 1105(1), which is also in dispute between the Parties.\n\n587.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal affirms the Parties\u2019 positions that NAFTA Article 1105(1) is to be interpreted in accordance with the 2001 FTC Note. As noted in \u00b6 287 above, the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1105(1) under the 2001 FTC Note is binding on the Tribunal, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1131(2).\n\n588.\n\nThus, in accordance with the 2001 FTC Note, the standard of treatment afforded to foreign investors under NAFTA Article 1105(1) is \"that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens\" (see \u00b6 530 above).\n\n589.\n\nThe divergence between the Parties relates to (i) the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET; (ii) whether, and to which extent, it has evolved since the seminal *Neer* case; and (iii) the appropriate means for ascertaining the content of such custom. The Parties further disagree about which Party bears the burden for establishing the content of custom.\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Parties\u2019 dispute regarding burden of proof, which will be followed by the appropriate means for ascertaining content of custom, including with respect to evidence of evolution of custom, and thereafter the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET under NAFTA Article 1105.\n\n(i) Sources to ascertain the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n591.\n\nThe existence of a customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET is not in dispute. Indeed, this is also clear from NAFTA Article 1105(1) read with the 2001 FTC Note. The Parties also agree that the burden to establish the content of customary international law, lies first and foremost on Claimant.649 However, as noted in \u00b6 589 above, the Parties mainly disagree on the content of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET and the means for ascertaining such content. In this Sub-Section, the Tribunal will address the Parties' disagreement on the means for ascertaining the content of custom.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 341-342; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 448-450; Rejoinder, \u00b6 219.\n\n592.\n\nRespondent submits that to establish the content of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET, Claimant must demonstrate the existence of a general practice of States and *opinio juris* indicating that this practice was adopted because it constitutes a rule of law.650 Respondent argues that awards rendered by international arbitral tribunals do not constitute State practice and, thus, cannot create or prove the existence of customary international law.651\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 342; Rejoinder, \u00b6 219.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 346.\n\n593.\n\nClaimant does not dispute that proof of existence of State practice and *opinio juris* are necessary pre-requisites for establishing the content of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET. Claimant also agrees with Respondent that arbitral decisions do not create a rule of customary international law. However, it contends that arbitral decisions constitute \"important indicators of the existence of a rule under customary international law\",652 and are \"an appropriate source for descriptions of customary international law\".653 Thus, Claimant submits that arbitral decisions should not be discounted when ascertaining the content of a customary international law rule.654 Claimant further contends that proving State practice in the manner contended by Respondent is a \"challenge\" as it \"would require the Claimant to prove a negative, by demonstrating ways that states do not behave as a means of proving they agree to an obligation or standard of conduct under customary international law\".655\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 461-462.\n\nReply, \u00b6 447(a).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 461-465, citing **Exh.

This position is not disputed by Claimant and is also accepted by the non-disputing NAFTA parties.\n\n596.\n\nClaimant contends that it is difficult to precisely ascertain the content of custom, amongst others, because \"(a) State practice is non-existent because the question under examination is too new; (b) State practice is conflicting or too disparate and thus inconclusive; (c) The *opinio juris* of states cannot be established; or (d) There is a discrepancy between state practice and *opinio juris*\".656\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 479-480, citing **Exh.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the practice of international arbitral tribunals as well as of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") has been to apply a flexible approach in ascertaining custom. International arbitral tribunals routinely refer to prior arbitral decisions as illustrations of custom.658\n\n**Exh. CLA-027**, Cargill, Inc. v.

United Mexican States, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 January 2006.\n\n598.\n\nThe *Cargill* tribunal, noting the difficulties in procuring evidence of consistent State practice to establish the content of custom, stated as follows regarding other evidence of custom:\n\n274... . The Tribunal acknowledges, however, that surveys of State practice are difficult to undertake and particularly difficult in the case of norms such as \"fair and equitable treatment\" where developed examples of State practice may not be many or readily accessible. Claimant has not provided the Tribunal with such a survey of recent State practice nor is the Tribunal aware of such a survey.\n\n275. In such instances, recourse may be made to other evidence of custom. The statements of States can\u2014with care\u2014serve as evidence of the content of custom. In the case of the NAFTA State Parties, they have made statements in the context of their position as respondents or as non-disputing State Parties in Chapter 11 arbitrations. Thus, Mexico has not only presented its view on the content of customary international law standard in this proceeding, but also as a non-disputing State Party in an Article 1128 Submission... The Tribunal acknowledges that the weight of these statements needs to be assessed in light of their position as respondents at the time of the statement ...\n\n276. It also is widely accepted that extensive adoption of identical treaty language by many States may in and of itself serve\u2014again with care\u2014as evidence of customary international law...\n\n277. Finally, the writings of scholars and the decisions of tribunals may serve as evidence of custom. It is important to emphasize, however, as Mexico does in this instance, that the awards of international tribunals do not create customary international law but rather, at most, reflect customary international law. Moreover, in both the case of scholarly writings and arbitral decisions, the evidentiary weight to be afforded such sources is greater if the conclusions therein are supported by evidence and analysis of custom.\n\n599.\n\nThe *Glamis Gold* tribunal noted in this regard that:\n\n602. The Tribunal acknowledges that it is difficult to establish a change in customary international law. As Respondent explains, establishment of a rule of customary international law requires: (1) \"a concordant practice of a number of States acquiesced in by others,\" and (2) \"a conception that the practice is required by or consistent with the prevailing law *(opinio juris)\"*\n\n603. The evidence of such \"concordant practice\" undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation is exhibited in very few authoritative sources: treaty ratification language, statements of governments, treaty practice (e.g., Model BITs), and sometimes pleadings. Although one can readily identify the practice of States, it is usually very difficult to determine the intent behind those actions. Looking to a claimant to ascertain custom requires it to ascertain such intent, a complicated and particularly difficult task. In the context of arbitration, however, it is necessarily Claimant's place to establish a change in custom.\n\n604. The Tribunal notes that, although an examination of custom is indeed necessary to determine the scope and bounds of current customary international law, this requirement\u2014repeatedly argued by various State Parties\u2014because of the difficulty in proving a change in custom, effectively freezes the protections provided for in this provision at the 1926 conception of egregiousness.\n\n600.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the aforementioned observations of the *Cargill* and *Glamis Gold* tribunals instructive. For avoidance of any doubt, the Tribunal clarifies that arbitral awards rendered by international arbitral tribunals do not constitute State practice or *opinio juris* and, as such, do not create customary international law. Having said that, arbitral awards may serve as illustrations of custom, particularly those awards containing an examination of customary international law. Furthermore, whether an arbitral tribunal's articulation of the standard of customary international law has been consistently followed by later arbitral tribunals and is also relied on by States in other proceedings is a relevant guiding consideration in the analysis of the current standard of customary international law.\n\n601.\n\nOn the relevance of prior arbitral awards, the Parties also disagree on whether awards based on BITs containing autonomous treaty language for FET are relevant for ascertaining the content of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET under NAFTA Article 1105. Claimant contends, which is disputed by Respondent, that BIT awards may be relied on by the Tribunal as there is a growing convergence between the customary and autonomous standards of BIT. In the Tribunal's view, Claimant has failed to establish that the customary international law rule on minimum standard of treatment for FET has evolved to such an extent that the protection offered thereunder is akin to the protection offered under autonomous treaty standards of FET. Furthermore, awards addressing the autonomous treaty standard of FET do not typically undertake an analysis of the existence of custom. Therefore, the Tribunal is not persuaded that awards which examine an autonomous standard of FET are relevant for the purposes of examining the content of custom.659\n\n**Exh.

The Tribunal understands there to be no serious dispute between the Parties regarding this position.660 The Parties also appear to agree that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment has evolved since the *Neer* case, although it remains a high standard. At its end, Claimant places heavy reliance on the *Waste Management* tribunal\u2019s articulation of the current customary international law minimum standard of treatment and the subsequent arbitral awards that have upheld this articulation.661 Respondent relies on the customary international law minimum standard of treatment articulated by the *Glamis Gold*, *Cargill* and *Thunderbird* arbitral tribunals.662\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 62.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 297, quoting **Exh.

Specifically, the *Waste Management* tribunal, referring to previous arbitral decisions, noted that \"[b]oth the *Mondev* and *ADF* tribunals rejected any suggestion that the standard of treatment of a foreign investment set by NAFTA is confined to the kind of outrageous treatment referred to in the *Neer* case\".663 The *Cargill* tribunal held that \"the current customary international law standard of 'fair and equitable treatment\u2019 at least reflects the adaptation of the agreed *Neer* standard to current conditions . . \".664 The *Glamis Gold* tribunal noted that whilst \"[t]he fundamentals of the *Neer* standard ... still apply today ... . it is entirely possible, however that, as an international community, we may be shocked by State actions now that did not offend us previously\".665 The *Thunderbird* tribunal held that \"[n]otwithstanding the evolution of customary law since decisions such as *Neer Claim* in 1926, the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains high, as illustrated by recent international jurisprudence\".666\n\n**Exh.

United Mexican States, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 January 2006, \u00b6 194.\n\n604.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the content of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET.\n\n605.\n\nThe *Waste Management* award, on which Claimant relies, identifies the content of the minimum standard of treatment for FET as follows:\n\n... the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.667\n\nExh. CLA-064, Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, \u00b6 98.\n\n606.\n\nRespondent contends that the *Waste Management* award cannot be relied on by Claimant to satisfy its evidentiary burden to establish the content of custom, as the passage of the *Waste Management* award cited by the claimant relies not on State practice but rather on other arbitral awards.668 As to the content of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment for FET, Respondent emphasizes the use of adverbs to describe conduct that may fall afoul of the minimum standard of treatment for FET. It contends that the NAFTA Article 1105 sets a very high threshold, which is reflected in the use of terms such as \"gross denial of justice ... manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards\".669 Respondent submits that adverbs such as \"gross\" and \"manifest\" are important because they reflect the high threshold of severity required by customary international law.670 During the Refresher Hearing, Respondent further explained its position as follows:\n\nFor its part, Canada recognizes that the content of the minimal standard of treatment protects foreign investment, especially if the conduct is egregious that it would shock.\n\nIt would be really unfair or a treatment that is manifestly arbitrary. In other words, it states that is so far below the international norms that any reasonable person would be shocked. Also, no step that contravenes\u2014it is not that can only be arbitrary and also be qualified as manifestly arbitrary. Here, the adverb is important because it enhances the threshold of gravity that is required by customary international law. This threshold was recognized by arbitr[al] Tribunals that buttress the large measure or the large latitude that was given to governments to arbitrate.671\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 346-347.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 348, citing **RLA-060**, International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

During the Refresher Hearing, in response to a question from the President of the Tribunal, Respondent confirmed that it agrees with the *Waste Management* tribunal\u2019s articulation of the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET.672\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 166:20-25.\n\n608.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the *Waste Management* tribunal\u2019s articulation of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET has been considered by almost every arbitral tribunal coming thereafter and has also been followed by many arbitral tribunals as describing the current customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET.673\n\n**Exh.

Further, Claimant rightly notes that in another previous NAFTA arbitration, *Windstream Energy LLC v. Government of Canada,* Respondent has cited with approval the *Waste Management* tribunal\u2019s articulation of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET.674 The *Cargill* award, which is an authority relied on by Respondent in support of a high threshold for a breach of NAFTA Article 1105, also cites with approval several elements of the content of the minimum standard of treatment for FET described by the *Waste Management* tribunal:\n\n296. In summation, the Tribunal finds that the obligations in Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA are to be understood by reference to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens... To determine whether an action fails to meet the requirement of fair and equitable treatment, a tribunal must carefully examine whether the complained of measures were grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic; arbitrary beyond a merely inconsistent or questionable application of administrative or legal policy or procedure so as to constitute an unexpected and shocking repudiation of a policy's very purpose and goals, or to otherwise grossly subvert a domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive; or involve an utter lack of due process so as to offend judicial propriety.675\n\nReply, \u00b6 455, quoting **Exh.

United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, \u00b6 296.\n\n610.\n\nWith respect to the standard of arbitrariness that meets the minimum standard of treatment for FET, i.e., whether it is arbitrary conduct or \"manifestly\" or \"demonstrably\" arbitrary conduct, both Parties cite with approval the standard of arbitrariness propounded by the ICJ in the *ELSI* case, namely that \"[a]rbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law\".676 On arbitrariness, Claimant also adds that \"[t]he key is this idea of the rational connection; there has to be some rational relationship between the alleged harm and the proposed remedy ...\".677\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 300, citing **Exh. CLA-036**, Elettronica Sicula S.p.A (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy), Judgment, 20 July 1989, \u00b6 128; R-PHB, \u00b6 63.\n\nRefresher Hearing, Tr. Day 1, 119:16-19.\n\n611.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal concludes that, notwithstanding an evolution from the *Neer* standard, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for FET continues to bear a high threshold. This position has been consistently recognized by international arbitral tribunals. The Tribunal does not consider the *Waste Management* award as departing from this high threshold.\n\n612.\n\nFor the purposes of this case, the Tribunal considers that acts or omissions that are manifestly or demonstrably arbitrary, grossly unfair, inherently unjust, or idiosyncratic, fall below the acceptable minimum standard of treatment for FET. Although Claimant has not put forth any direct evidence of State practice or *opinio juris,* considering the position taken by Respondent in previous arbitrations and NAFTA authorities relied on by both Parties, the Tribunal considers that conduct which is manifestly or demonstrably arbitrary, grossly unfair, inherently unjust, or idiosyncratic, will fall afoul the acceptable minimum standard of treatment for FET protected under NAFTA Article 1105.\n\n613.\n\nAs noted in the preceding Sub-Section, Claimant has not cited any persuasive evidence to demonstrate that the customary international law standard for FET is akin to the autonomous treaty standard of FET.\n\n614.\n\nWith respect to the relevance of the legitimate expectations of the investor for purposes of analyzing a potential breach of the minimum standard of treatment for FET under NAFTA Article 1105, several investment law tribunals have considered that a failure to respect an investor\u2019s legitimate expectation is an element to take into account when assessing whether other components of the standard are breached.678 Respondent disputes that NAFTA Article 1105 protects an investor\u2019s expectation. It submits that to the limited extent that prior NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitral tribunals have considered an investor\u2019s expectation, they have only done so where specific assurances were made to the investor by the host State to the effect that the proposed investment could move forward.679 It is not necessary for the Tribunal to resolve the debate as to whether legitimate expectations are protected under NAFTA Article 1105 as, for the reasons elaborated in \u00b6 632 below, the Tribunal does not find that any representations made by Respondent\u2019s officials to Forest Oil at the time of its investment in Qu\u00e9bec or the prevalent legal regime under the Mining Act, generated a legitimate expectation in Forest Oil leading to its investment in the River Permit, as alleged by Claimant. Hence, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s revocation of the Enterprise\u2019s River Permit Rights cannot be regarded as a breach of the Enterprise\u2019s legitimate expectation.\n\n**Exh.

FET Breach in this Case***\n--------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nClaimant contends that Qu\u00e9bec's \"immediate and permanent\" revocation of the exploration permits in the St. Lawrence River without payment of any compensation under the impugned Act, violates the minimum standard of treatment for FET afforded under NAFTA Article 1105 as:680\n\n(i) the revocation of the exploration permits and the decision to deny compensation to the affected permit holders was neither rationally connected nor necessary to serve the stated purposes of environmental protection and preservation of the St. Lawrence River. For this reason, Claimant contends that the revocation of the exploration permits was \"arbitrary, grossly unfair and unjust and idiosyncratic\";681\n\n(ii) Qu\u00e9bec's justification for Bill 18 was premised on preliminary studies which were inapplicable in the present case. Claimant contends that the studies relied on by Qu\u00e9bec were done in a marine environment and concerned offshore drilling technology, whereas the River Permit that was revoked belonged to the fluvial St. Lawrence Lowlands, and Claimant would only access the resource below the river from onshore locations and at significant depth.682 Claimant disputes that the SEA-1 Report and the BAPE Report 273 had any relevance to the issue of whether the drilling of horizontal wells under the St. Lawrence River should be authorized to produce shale gas that might be found there;683\n\n(iii) the permanent revocation of the River Permit and other permits in the St. Lawrence River was \"an unnecessary deprivation of rights\" as there were other effective mechanisms prescribed under the Mining Act to protect rivers and watercourses in Qu\u00e9bec;684\n\n(iv) the territorial boundaries of the permit revocation through Bill 18 were idiosyncratic and irrational from an environmental point of view;685\n\n(v) the permit revocation was unfair as it did not await the results of the SEA-SG Report, which was \"directly relevant to the development of the River Permit Area, the specific technologies that would be used to extract resources located underneath the River, and the possible environmental effects and risks involved\";686\n\n(vi) the revocation of the exploration permits violated Claimant's legitimate expectations that it would be subject to regulation in the normal course in accordance with the framework for investment in the oil and gas sector in Qu\u00e9bec. Claimant contends that a revocation of the exploration permits as undertaken through Bill 18 is not provided for in the Mining Act and is not within the QMNR's normal regulatory activity. Claimant further contends that its \"investment in Qu\u00e9bec was specifically induced by the Qu\u00e9bec Government: In addition to an official policy of encouraging oil and gas activity communicated in statements about the Government's commitment to respect market and free enterprise rules (in addition to environmental rules), the QMNR had extensive and specific discussions with Forest Oil in 2006 concerning Forest Oil's proposed project and project site\";687 and\n\n(vii) the decision to deny compensation for revoking the exploration permits was a politically motivated one and was \"[s]hocking and [g]rossly [u]nfair\".688\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 281-284, 292-296.\n\nReply, \u00b6 494.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 303.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 520-535.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 304-306.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 307-311.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 313.

Claimant clarifies that it is not contesting Qu\u00e9bec's power to adopt Bill 18 or to take measures in pursuance of environmental concerns, and that it is only contesting the method by which the Qu\u00e9bec Government reached the decision to revoke the exploration permits under the St. Lawrence River.\n\n617.\n\nRespondent denies that it has breached the FET protection offered under NAFTA Article 1105, contending that Bill 18 was based on a legitimate policy objective, which was to ensure the protection of the St. Lawrence River. Respondent contends that Bill 18 was passed in light of the unfavorable findings and concerns identified in the SEA-1 Report and the BAPE Report 273, and the serious lack of social acceptability of shale gas development in Qu\u00e9bec, especially in the St. Lawrence Lowlands.689\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 231.\n\n618.\n\nRespondent submits that the adoption of the Act resulted from the normal and legitimate exercise of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s legislative power, taking into account competing public interests in a sensitive social context and that the Tribunal may not substitute itself for the Qu\u00e9bec Government through Article 1105 to determine whether it was the right decision.690\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 334.\n\n619.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Tribunal finds that Claimant has failed to establish a breach of the minimum standard of treatment for FET under NAFTA Article 1105, in accordance with the standard set forth in \u00b6 612 above.\n\n620.\n\n*First*, there is nothing in the record that might suggest that the impugned Act was adopted by the Qu\u00e9bec Government without following proper democratic procedures. As noted in \u00b6\u00b6 224 - 230 above, on 4 May 2011, Minister Normandeau had presented a draft of Bill 18 to the Cabinet, which was followed by several other drafts thereafter. On 19 May 2011, Bill 18 was duly debated in the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly and thereafter, until 7 June 2011, several committee meetings and public consultations were conducted to review Bill 18. Bill 18 was ultimately passed unanimously by the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly on 10 June 2011.\n\n621.\n\nClaimant\u2019s allegations regarding Minister Normandeau\u2019s political motivations behind the adoption of Bill 18, even if established to be correct, cannot detract from the aforementioned factual position.\n\n622.\n\n*Second,* Bill 18 was passed with the stated public policy objective of preservation of the fluvial environment under the St. Lawrence River. The Parties debate on the level of deference that must be afforded to legislative measures of the host State and whether this Tribunal is empowered to assess if the adoption of Bill 18 by the Qu\u00e9bec Government comports with the protection afforded under NAFTA Article 1105. Although initially the Parties appeared to be at opposing ends on this matter, the Tribunal finds that during the course of the arbitration, their positions on this issue were not very far apart.\n\n623.\n\nSpecifically, the Parties do not dispute that, to establish a breach of the customary international law rule on the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105, a high threshold must be met. In general, arbitral tribunals must grant significant deference to the host State\u2019s democratic process and public policy choices and may not substitute their own judgment for that of the host State whilst assessing whether NAFTA Article 1105 has been breached in a particular case. In other words, arbitral tribunals may not substitute their own judgment for that of State legislators.\n\n624.\n\nSeveral investment tribunals have confirmed - and this Tribunal, too, subscribes to this position - that a high measure of deference must be given to the right of the host State to make regulatory changes in light of the public interest. The Tribunal does not consider that a different standard of deference applies to legislative bodies within the host State as opposed to administrative bodies.\n\n625.\n\n*Third,* although Claimant clarifies that it is not challenging Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s democratic process, but is challenging \"Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s decision to revoke valid exploration permits without a valid basis\"691 (i.e., \"in the absence of any scientific or other evidence supporting that action\"692), the Tribunal considers that an examination of whether the passage of Bill 18 was justified in light of the evidence before the QMNR and the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly, necessarily requires an in-depth inquiry into the basis of the Qu\u00e9bec Government\u2019s decision. Specifically, the analysis requested of the Tribunal by Claimant, involves examining the various reports and studies before the QMNR, which led the QMNR to propose Bill 18. The purpose of this exercise would be to assess whether the QMNR was correct and justified in reaching its conclusion that a revocation of the permits under the St. Lawrence River was necessary for reasons of environmental preservation on the basis of the evidence before it. The Tribunal does not consider it within its remit to undertake an in-depth analysis of the SEA-1 Report and BAPE Report 273 to assess whether the conclusions referred therein support the adoption of Bill 18 and the revocation of the environmental permits. This would be tantamount to substituting its decision for that of the legislature.\n\nReply, \u00b6 487.\n\nReply, \u00b6 490.\n\n626.\n\n*Fourth,* based on the evidence on record, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Qu\u00e9bec Government's decision to revoke the permits under the St. Lawrence River was manifestly or demonstrably arbitrary, grossly unfair, inherently unjust, or idiosyncratic, which may establish a breach of NAFTA Article 1105. The Tribunal recalls that the standard to be met for a breach of NAFTA Article 1105 is a very high one. In the facts of this case, it would require Claimant to demonstrate that there was a complete disconnect between the impugned Act and the objective of protecting the fluvial environment under the St. Lawrence River.\n\n627.\n\nThe documentary record of this case shows that, since July 2009, the Government of Qu\u00e9bec had been undertaking several strategic environmental assessments to study the impact of shale gas exploration in various parts of Qu\u00e9bec (see \u00b6 159 above). Claimant rightly notes that neither the SEA-1 Report, nor the BAPE Report 273, specifically dealt with or analyzed the fluvial section of the St. Lawrence River, which was ultimately the subject of the revocation measures under the impugned Act. However, the Tribunal does not find it arbitrary or illogical that studies on the impact of shale gas exploration in other areas in Qu\u00e9bec were transposed by the Qu\u00e9bec Government to the fluvial section of St. Lawrence River.\n\n628.\n\nClaimant argues that the permanent revocation of the River Permit and other permits in the St. Lawrence River was \"an unnecessary deprivation of rights\" as there were other effective mechanisms prescribed under the Mining Act to protect rivers and watercourses in Qu\u00e9bec. That the Qu\u00e9bec Government chose one option over another option in pursuance of its objective to preserve fluvial environment under the St. Lawrence River cannot be regarded as manifestly arbitrary conduct, in the Tribunal's view.\n\n629.\n\nClaimant also contends that the timing of the impugned Act makes it clear that it was passed purely for political reasons. Claimant points out that, at the time that Bill 18 was introduced in the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly and the impugned Act was passed, there was a specific SEA (SEA-SG) ongoing, which was directly relevant to the River Permit Area. That the Qu\u00e9bec Government did not wait for the findings of the SEA-SG before passing the impugned Act, is unfair in Claimant\u2019s view. Claimant also challenges the territorial boundaries of the permits\u2019 revocation through the impugned Act as idiosyncratic. The Tribunal does not consider that these matters, even if correct, meet the high threshold of the minimum standard of treatment for FET. In any event, it is not for this Tribunal to assess what territorial boundaries were justifiable for the permits\u2019 revocation based on the evidence before the QMNR and the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly.\n\n630.\n\n*Fifth,* it is not clear to the Tribunal to what extent Claimant maintains its position that the non-payment of compensation to permit holders affected by the impugned Act constitutes a breach of NAFTA Article 1105. The Tribunal notes that Claimant had initially challenged the non-payment of compensation under the impugned Act as being violative of NAFTA Article 1105(1) on the grounds that it was grossly unjust. However, it does not appear to be seriously pursuing this argument in its subsequent submissions in the arbitration.693\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its Memorial, Claimant challenged both the revocation and no-compensation decision under the Act as constituting a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105 (see Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281, 283-284, 294 and 323-332). In its Reply and C-PHB, Claimant no longer emphasized the no-compensation aspect as constituting a breach of the minimum standard of treatment, arguing mainly that the permanent and immediate revocation of the River Permit is a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 1105 (see Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 483-572; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 69-93). During the Refresher Hearing, Claimant again mentioned that the denial of compensation was grossly unfair (see Claimant's Presentation, 25 February 2021, slide 103).\n\n631.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, taking into account the status of exploration activities under the St. Lawrence River, coupled with the public policy objective of the revocation, the majority of the Tribunal does not consider the non-payment of compensation to be \"grossly unfair\" or \"inherently unjust\", which is required to meet the high threshold for breach of NAFTA Article 1105. The majority of the Tribunal takes note that public perception against compensation was an important consideration in Minister Normandeau\u2019s proposal not to provide compensation to the permit holders affected by the passage of the impugned Act. However, other considerations such as, the absence of work undertaken in the permits affected by the passage of the impugned Act, the Qu\u00e9bec Government's intention to encourage the sustainable development of natural resources with a view to protect the environment of the St. Lawrence River, the refund by the Government of a portion of the annual fees paid by the affected permit holders, and the possibility to attribute the research expenditure incurred on the affected permits to other research permits of the affected permit holders, contributed to the Government's decision not to award compensation to the permit holders affected by the impugned Act.694 Furthermore, as noted in \u00b6 620 above, it cannot be ignored that the impugned Act was passed unanimously by the Qu\u00e9bec National Assembly following all democratic processes. In the view of the majority of the Tribunal, any political motivations of Minister Normandeau in her proposal to not provide compensation to the affected permit holders under the impugned Act cannot diminish this factual position.\n\nSee **Exh. C-66**, Translation of pages 11-12 and 16-17 of Qu\u00e9bec, National Assembly, Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources, Journal des d\u00e9bats, 2nd Session, 39th Leg, Vol. 42 No. 13, 31 May 2011; **Exh. R-38,** Lettre du Minist\u00e8re des Ressources naturelles \u00e0 Junex Inc., Qu\u00e9bec, 2 September 2011; R-PHB, \u00b6 72.\n\n632.\n\nLastly, based on the evidence on record, the Tribunal is also not persuaded that the discussions between the QMNR officials and Forest Oil in July 2006, regarding the possibility to procure an exploration permit under the St. Lawrence River and/or the legal regime under the Mining Act, can be regarded as creating reasonable and justifiable expectations on part of Forest Oil leading to its investment in the River Permit, a breach of which may be regarded as violating the Enterprise's legitimate expectations. As noted above, the Enterprise's investment in Qu\u00e9bec had commenced with the acquisition of the Original Permits, at which time, there was no mention of the River Permit. Moreover, the Tribunal does not consider Qu\u00e9bec's alleged conduct specific enough, which may lead to any legitimate expectations on part of the Enterprise.\n\n633.\n\nThus, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the revocation of the River Permit Rights through the impugned Act without payment of any compensation does not meet the high threshold of the minimum standard of treatment for FET under NAFTA. In view of this finding, the Tribunal does not need to consider any further the Parties' submissions on the precautionary principle, nor Claimant's request for adverse inferences for non-production of documents.\n\n**XI. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n634.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant claims compensatory damages in the amount of USD 103,600,000 on account of Respondent's alleged breaches of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1110. Respondent disputes Claimant's entitlement to compensation. Both Parties have made extensive submissions and have filed quantum and resources expert reports in support of their respective positions regarding the alleged financial impact of the challenged measures.\n\n635.\n\nConsidering that the Tribunal has rej ected all of Claimant's claims relating to Respondent's alleged breaches under NAFTA, the Tribunal finds that Respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to Claimant. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to detail here the Parties' respective submissions regarding the financial impact of the various measures at issue and the quantification of Claimant's alleged damages and resulting compensation.\n\n636.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant also requests the Tribunal to order any further relief that it may consider appropriate (see \u00b6 240 above). The Tribunal does not consider any such further relief to be necessary or appropriate in the circumstances of this case and, accordingly, rejects this request.\n\n**XII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n637.\n\nNAFTA Article 1135 provides in relevant part regarding the costs of the arbitration that:\n\nA tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n638.\n\nArticles 40 to 43 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which are applicable in these proceedings (see \u00b6 2 above), relate to costs of the arbitration.\n\n639.\n\nArticle 40 defines costs of the arbitration and is extracted in relevant part below:\n\n*Article 40*\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n*(a)* The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n*(b)* The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n*(c)* The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n*(d)* The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n*(e)* The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n*f)* Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n\u2026\n\n640.\n\nArticle 40(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules pertains to costs of legal representation and assistance, which are hereafter referred to as **\"Legal Costs\"**. Article 40(a)-(c), (d) and (f) pertains to the other costs of the arbitration. For the purposes of these proceedings, the costs referred in Article 40(a)-(c) are relevant and are hereafter referred to as **\"Arbitration Costs\"**.\n\n641.\n\nArticle 42 sets forth the principle governing the allocation of costs of the arbitration and provides as follows:\n\n***Allocation of costs***\n\n*Article 42*\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2.
