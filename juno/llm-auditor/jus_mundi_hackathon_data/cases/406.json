PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn May 13, 2011, St Marys VCNA, LLC (the **\"Claimant\")** submitted to the Government of Canada (the **\"Respondent\")** a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under Section B of Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement **(\"NAFTA\").**\n\n2.\n\nOn September 14, 2011, the Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration on the Respondent. The Claimant took the position that this service was in accordance with Articles 3 and 18 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (the **\"UNCITRAL Rules\",** and Articles 1116 and 1120 of the NAFTA (the **\"NOA\").** Canada objected to the NOA on the basis that it failed to respect the timing requirements of NAFTA Article 1120(1).\n\n3.\n\nIn the NOA, the Claimant sought compensation under NAFTA Chapter Eleven for damages it alleged arose out of a decision on the part of the Government of Ontario to adopt a Minister\u2019s Zoning Order and subsequent Declaration of Provincial Interest, in respect of a site owned by St. Marys Cement Inc. (Canada) **(\"SMC\")** in the vicinity of Hamilton, Ontario, along with related decisions by relevant provincial and local authorities (the **\"Claims\").**\n\n4.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, the Respondent notified the Claimant of its jurisdictional concerns arising under NAFTA Article 1113(2) (Denial of Benefits), requesting documents confirming Claimant\u2019s ownership structure, assets, holdings, and business activities in the United States. The Respondent also notified the United States Department of State that subject to delivery by the Claimant of satisfactory evidence of its US business activities, it would deny to the Claimant the benefits of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n5.\n\nFollowing subsequent exchanges between the Claimant and the Respondent, by a letter dated March 1, 2012, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant confirming that it was formally invoking NAFTA Article 1113(2) to deny Chapter Eleven benefits to the Claimant, and to its alleged investment SMC. That same day, the Respondent wrote to the United States Department of State setting out its reasons for denying NAFTA Chapter Eleven benefits to the Claimant and to its purported investment.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 12, 2012, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes confirmed the appointment of Professor Michael Pryles as President, completing the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Professor Richard Stewart had been appointed by the Claimant on December 14, 2012, and Professor Brigitte Stern by the Respondent, on December 22, 2012.\n\n7.\n\nOn August 27, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal submitted a draft Procedural Order No. 1 to be discussed at the preliminary meeting of the Disputing Parties to be held on September 10, 2012.\n\n8.\n\nOn August 31, 2012, at the request of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Respondent filed a Brief Outline of its Jurisdictional and Substantive Defences.\n\n9.\n\nAt the meeting of the Disputing Parties and the Tribunal of September 10, 2012, based upon the parties\u2019 respective submissions, the Tribunal ordered bifurcation of the arbitration, so that the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections could be addressed on a preliminary basis.\n\n10.\n\nBetween September and December 2012, the Claimant and the Respondent exchanged requests for production of documents relevant to jurisdictional issues only, further to the provisions of Procedural Order No. 1. On November 16, 2012, the Tribunal ruled on the Disputing Parties\u2019 respective objections to document production. A follow-up production occurred on December 14, 2012.\n\n11.\n\nIn the course of initial document production on October 19, 2012, the Claimant produced to the Respondent certain documents that it subsequently argued had been produced in error and should be returned on the basis of privilege. While protecting these documents under seal, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal establish a process through which a neutral third party would review these documents and determine whether they were privileged, or whether in any event the Claimant had waived such privilege.\n\n12.\n\nOn 27 November 2012, the Tribunal nominated Justice James Spigelman, AC, QC, to consider the privilege issues raised by the Respondent. By correspondence dated November 30 and December 3, 2012, the Disputing Parties exchanged views as to the appropriate procedure for Justice Spigelman\u2019s reference. Based upon the exchanges of the Disputing Parties, Justice Spigelman established a calendar for briefing of the relevant issues. In accordance with this calendar, the Respondent and the Claimant exchanged pleadings on December 7 and 11, 2012, and December 19 and 24, 2012.\n\n13.\n\nOn December 27, 2012, Justice Spigelman released his Report on Inadvertent Disclosure of Privileged Documents (the \"Report\"). The Report concluded that no privilege attached to 7 out of the 11 documents at issue, and that in any event any privilege attaching to such documents had been waived. On the same day, the Respondent requested an order from the Tribunal directing Justice Spigelman to release to it the documents referenced in the Report.\n\n14.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, further to a calendar established by the Tribunal, the Claimant made submissions opposing the release to Canada of the documents referenced in the Report and requesting that the Tribunal reject the conclusions of the Report. On January 10, 2013, the Respondent replied, opposing the Claimant\u2019s position.\n\n15.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, the Disputing Parties wrote to the Tribunal that in light of discussions between them, they were requesting a temporary suspension of the calendar in the proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nOn January 13, 2013, the Tribunal agreed to suspend the proceedings until February 1, 2013, pending any further notice from the Disputing Parties.\n\n17.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, the Disputing Parties jointly wrote to the Tribunal requesting a further extension of the suspension of proceedings, until March 1, 2013.\n\n18.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, the Disputing Parties wrote to the Tribunal confirming that they had signed a Settlement Agreement, and requested that the Tribunal adopt that agreement in a Consent Award.\n\n**II. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Disputing Parties provided the Arbitral Tribunal with an original copy of the executed Settlement Agreement, which was received on February 28, 2013.\n\n2.\n\nParagraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the Claimant \"hereby irrevocably and permanently withdraws its Notices of Intent in respect of the Claims and Notice of Arbitration in respect of the First Claim severed against the Government of Canada.\" Paragraph 8 further records the Disputing Parties\u2019 agreement to request the incorporation in full of the Settlement Agreement in the form of a Consent Award:\n\nThe Parties agree jointly to submit this Settlement Agreement to the Tribunal upon its signature and to request the incorporation in full of this Settlement Agreement in the form of a Consent Award, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1136 and Article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, to be issued by the Tribunal. The terms of this Settlement Agreement shall take effect as of the adoption of the Consent Award.\n\n3.\n\nThe terms of the Settlement Agreement include that Votorantim Group (including the Claimant and SMC), and its successors and assigns, releases and forever discharges the Government of Canada from the Claims and related claims as defined therein. The Votorantim Group further acknowledges that SMVCNA lacks and has always lacked standing to bring a claim under NAFTA Chapter Eleven in respect of the Claims, and that no payment has been made to it by the Government of Canada in respect of the Claims or the Settlement Agreement.\n\n4.\n\nIn return for the settlement and waiver of legal action by the Votorantim Group, the Government of Canada agrees not to pursue any claim against the Votorantim Group for its costs incurred to date in respect of the Claims.\n\n5.\n\nFurther, in accordance with NAFTA Annex 1137.4, the Parties agree to the publication of the Settlement Agreement and the Consent Award. The Votorantim Group also acknowledges Canada\u2019s right to make public Justice Spigelman\u2019s Report of December 27, 2012. Except for the documents referenced in the Settlement Agreement that are to be made public, the Confidentiality Order issued by the Tribunal shall continue to be in full force and effect.\n\n6.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement takes effect upon it being executed in three original copies in counterparts, one original for each Disputing Party and one original for the Tribunal, and following its incorporation into a Consent Award by the Arbitral Tribunal. An original copy of the Consent Award shall also be provided to the PCA.\n\n**III.
