PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A.** The Notice of Arbitration\n--------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn 6 February 2013, Achmea submitted to the Slovak Republic a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\"),4 and to Article 8 of the Treaty.5\n\nArbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, Resolution 31/98 adopted by the General Assembly on 15 December 1976 (\"1976 UNCITRAL Rules\"), Article 3.\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 8 **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n**B. THE FIRST PROCEDURAL HEARING AND PROCEDURAL ORDER**  **NO. 1**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties held an initial procedural hearing via teleconference, where they discussed a draft agenda circulated earlier, a draft Procedural Order No. 1 submitted jointly by the Parties and their proposals regarding the procedural schedule of the arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\"), which set out the procedural rules and the calendar for the arbitration. It also specified that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") would act as fund holder for the deposits made by the Parties by way of advance for the costs of arbitration.6\n\nPO1,\u00b618.1.\n\n**C.** The Written Phase\n------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 5 June 2013, the Claimant filed its Statement of Claim (\"SoC\"). The SoC was accompanied by Exhibits C-1 through C-63.\n\n17.\n\nOn 14 June 2013, the Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Objections\"), accompanied by Exhibit R-1, and by legal authorities RLA-1 through RLA-131.\n\n18.\n\nOn 21 July 2013, the Claimant filed its Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Response\"), accompanied by Exhibits C-64 through C-87.\n\n19.\n\nOn 2 August 2013, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction (\"Reply\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 3 August 2013, the Claimant filed a request for production of documents. After several exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimant\u2019s request on 17 August 2013 by issuing Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO2\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 30 August 2013, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"Rejoinder\"), accompanied by Exhibits C-88 through C-106.\n\n22.\n\nOn 5 September 2013, in accordance with paragraph 5.6 of PO2, the Claimant introduced Exhibits C-107 through C-112, which had been obtained as a result of document production; to which the Slovak Republic responded on 11 September 2013, in particular by submitting Exhibits R-2 through R-9.\n\n23.\n\nOn 13 September 2013, the Claimant filed a submission, accompanied by Exhibit C-113, on the European Commission\u2019s decision to initiate a formal investigation procedure against the Slovak Republic concerning the compatibility of Slovak State aid given to the State-owned health insurer.\n\n**D.** The Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, the Parties and the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility in Amsterdam.\n\n25.\n\nIn addition to the members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, the following persons attended the hearing:\n\nOn behalf of the Claimant\n\nMr. Ren\u00e9 Visser Mr. Frank ter Borg\n\nof *Achmea,* and\n\nMr. Marnix Leijten Mr. Albert Marsman Ms. Darina Mal\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 Ms. Ellen Gerretsen Mr. Constantijn van Aartsen\n\nof *De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek.*\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent\n\nDeputy Minister Mr. Vazil Hud\u00e1k Ms. Andrea Holikova Mr. Tom\u00e1s Jucha Ms. Miriam Kiselyova\n\nof the *Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic,*\n\nMr. George von Mehren Mr. David Alexander Mr. Rostislav Pekaf Ms. Maria Lokajova Mr. Stephen Anway\n\nof *Squire Sanders',* and\n\nMr. Mark Clodfelter Mr. Constantinos Salonidis\n\nof *Foley Hoag.*\n\n26.\n\nDuring the course of the hearing, the Parties presented oral opening arguments on their respective positions with respect to jurisdiction. Messrs. Marsman and Leijten addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant and Messrs. Hud\u00e1k, von Mehren, Alexander and Clodfelter on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n**E.** The Post-Hearing Phase\n-----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO3\"), whereby it confirmed the agreement reached at the end of the hearing that there would be no post-hearing briefs. It also fixed the time limits for the submission of any corrections to the transcript and of the Parties\u2019 statements on costs.\n\n28.\n\nOn 4 October 2013, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached an agreement for the extension of the time limit for the submission of their statements on costs until 11 October 2013. On that date, each Party submitted its statement.\n\n29.\n\nOn 18 October 2013, the Parties jointly submitted a corrected version of the transcript of the hearing.\n\n30.\n\nOn 29 January 2014, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal informing it of new factual allegations. The Respondent objected to that course of action in its communication of 31 January 2014, on the ground that its due process rights were seriously put in jeopardy, and requested the Tribunal (i) to disregard the materials presented by the Claimant, or, (ii) if the Tribunal were to consider such materials in assessing its jurisdiction, to allow the Respondent to respond and contest the Claimant\u2019s new allegations. On 3 February 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent\u2019s two proposed courses of action by 10 February 2014.\n\n31.\n\nOn 10 February 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to allowing the Respondent to comment on its new allegations, but objected to the Respondent\u2019s primary request. Accordingly, the Tribunal proposed on 11 February 2014 to the Respondent to comment by 20 February 2014 on the content of the Claimant\u2019s letters of 29 January and 10 February 2014.\n\n32.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the Respondent filed its comments to the Claimant\u2019s new allegations. On 25 February 2014, the Claimant again approached the Tribunal to request the Tribunal to \"take appropriate measures to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings and the robustness of any awards rendered pursuant to it\". In essence, the Claimant asked the Tribunal (i) to admonish the Respondent in connection with its alleged misrepresentations in connection with Exhibit R-2, (ii) to order the Respondent to bear all costs associated with these misrepresentations (including costs related to the preparation of the 29 January, 10 February and 25 February 2014 letters), and (iii) to draw appropriate inferences when assessing the other evidence submitted by the Respondent.\n\n33.\n\nIn light of this development, the Tribunal gave to the Respondent until 25 March 2014 to respond to the requests filed by the Claimant in its 25 February 2014 letter. On that date, the Respondent commented on the Claimant\u2019s new request.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe summary below is based on the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions and the documentary evidence they have introduced into the record. It is presented only to the extent it is useful to frame the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction. It is noted that the detailed nature of the summary that follows is explained by the fact that the Respondent has specifically objected on the ground that Achmea\u2019s claim manifestly lacks legal merit. Disputed facts are highlighted as appropriate.\n\n**A.** Achmea\u2019s Investment and the Health Insurance Market in the Slovak Republic\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Slovak Republic acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004. It liberalized its health care insurance market, setting up a system of regulated competition with the entry into force of Acts No. 580/2004 and 581/2004.7 Under the new framework, health insurance companies were required to be set up as joint stock companies and were allowed to make and distribute profits to their shareholders.8 With a view to ensuring a competitive market, clients were allowed to switch health insurance companies each year by 30 September.9 An independent regulatory authority, the Slovak Health Surveillance Authority (\"HSA\"), was set up to issue operation licenses and to supervise the insurance companies\u2019 compliance with applicable regulations.10\n\nSoC, \u00b6\u00b6 37 and 39. References in notes 7 to 23 are to the Statement of Claim (SoC) and to its factual content, which the Respondent does not appear to have disputed.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 38.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 38.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 38.\n\n36.\n\nAchmea applied for, and obtained, a license from the HSA on 13 February 2006, and on 9 March 2006, *Union zdravotn\u00e1 poist'ovna a.s.* (\"Union\") was incorporated.11 Achmea holds all the shares in Union.12 Achmea invested approximately \u20ac 72 million in the form of cash capital contributions.13\n\nSoC, \u00b642.\n\nSoC, \u00b6\u00b6 24 and 42.\n\nSoC, \u00b642.\n\n37.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, Union held a market share of 8.42% in the Slovak Republic.14 Union has two competitors in the Slovak market: (i) *Vseobecn\u00e1 zdravotn\u00e1 poist'ov\u00f1a, a.s.* (\"VsZP\"), which is the State-owned (and largest) health insurer with a market share of 64.09% as of 1 January 2013; and (ii) *D\u00f4vera zdravotn\u00e1 poist'ovna, a.s.* (\"D\u00f4vera\"), which is a privately-owned Dutch company holding a market share of 27.49% as of 1 January 2013.15\n\nSoC,\u00b625\n\nSoC,\u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n38.\n\nAchmea also holds close to 100% of the shares of *Union posit'ov\u00f1a a.s.* (\"Union Commercial\"), a Slovak joint stock company offering life and non-life insurance products to individual and corporate clients, including travel insurance.16\n\nSoC,\u00b636.\n\n**B.** The Ban on Profits, the Ban on Transfers and the First **BIT** Arbitration\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIn 2006, a change of Government occurred in the Slovak Republic, with Mr. Robert Fico of the *SMER-soci\u00e1lna demokracia* (\"SMER\") party assuming office as Prime Minister on 4 July of that year.17 The new Government announced that it would introduce measures with respect to health insurance companies,18 which it did by adopting Acts Nos. 530/2007 and 192/2009.19 The first regulation \"required profits from health insurance to be used for healthcare purposes only, rather than at the discretion of the company and its shareholders\" (\"ban on profits\").20 The second regulation provided for \"a prohibition on the transfer of a portfolio of insurance contracts against payment\" (\"ban on transfers\").21\n\nSoC, \u00b644.\n\nSoC,\u00b6\u00b6 45-51.\n\nSoC, \u00b6\u00b6 52 and 56.\n\nSoC, \u00b652.\n\nSoC, \u00b656.\n\n40.\n\nOther measures adopted at that time included \"a prohibition on the use by health insurance companies of insurance brokers, a requirement that health insurance companies contract with certain named state-owned hospitals, and an obligation for health insurers to submit their financial budgets to the Slovak government \u2018for discussion\u2019\".22 Through Act No. 12/2007, the Slovak Government could \"discharge at will the Head of the Health Care Regulator\".23\n\nSoC,\u00b654.\n\nSoC,\u00b655.\n\n41.\n\nOn 1 October 2008 Achmea (still known as Eureko) commenced arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic challenging, among others, the abovedescribed measures.24 The case was registered with the PCA with the reference number \"PCA Case No. 2008-13\" *(\"Achmea I\").* On 26 October 2010, the tribunal in *Achmea I* issued an Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension. In the relevant part of that decision, the Tribunal:\n\n\"(a) DISMISSE[D] the \u2018Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection\u2019 advanced by Respondent and decide[d] that it ha[d] jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(b) REJECT[ED] Respondent\u2019s request to suspend the proceedings until the European Commission and/or the ECJ ha[d] come to a decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement proceedings;\n\n(c) RESERVE[D] all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and expenses, including the Parties\u2019 costs of legal representation, for subsequent determination\".25\n\n*Eureko B.V. v.

The Slovak Republic filed an appeal before the *Bundesger\u00ecchtshof* in Karlsruhe,26 which had yet to be decided at the time of the issuance of the present Award.\n\nSoC,\u00b660.\n\n43.\n\nOn 7 December 2012, the tribunal in *Achmea I* issued its Final Award, in which it:\n\n\"(a) DISMISSE[D] each of theremaining jurisdictional objections advanced by Respondent and decide[d] that it ha[d] jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(b) DECLARE[D] Respondent to have breached Article 3 and Article 4 of the Treaty by adopting the ban on profits and the ban on transfers;\n\n(c) ORDER[ED] Respondent to pay to Claimant damages in the sum of \u20ac22.1 million, net of any taxes that might be due to be paid by Claimant to Respondent on that sum;\n\n(d) ORDER[ED] Respondent to pay to Claimant interest on the amount of \u20ac22.1 million, as from 1 August 2011 up to the date of payment, at the Eurozone official rate for \"main refinancing operations\" (as published on the website of the European Central Bankwww.ecb.ini) plus 2%, compounded quarterly;\n\n(e) ORDER[ED] Respondent to pay to Claimant the amount of \u20ac220,772.74 to reimburse Claimant for costs of [the] Merits Phase of the arbitration; and\n\n(f) ORDER[ED] Respondent to pay to Claimant the amount of \u20ac2,095,350.94 for its legal representation and assistance in the Merits Phase of [the] arbitration\".27\n\n*Achmea B.V.

In an interview with the Slovak journal SME on 12 March 2013, he indicated that re-introducing the ban on profits was one of the priorities of his party, SMER. He further stated that the main difficulty lay in implementing such change \"in compliance with [the] legislation of the European Union and with the constitution\" and that he understood from his legal advisors that this could be possible.34 On 13 April 2012, the same newspaper reported that the Prime Minister had asked the new Minister of Health, Ms. Zuzana Zvolensk\u00e1, \"to find a way to ban the profit and not violate the constitution at the same time\".35\n\nInterview given by Mr. Fico to SME Monday entitled \"I am the same Fico, I just took a lesson\", 12 March 2012, p. 1 **(Exh.

We are now trying to find money for salaries of doctors and nurses, but gentlemen in private health insurance companies each year take away tens of millions of Euro as a kind of profit from public funds. Both you and me send money to some health insurance company according to the law, a public fund which should return back to healthcare, private health insurance companies can keep only 3 - 4%, it is some administration fund, they take some profit from these public funds and use it for their private purposes. Airplanes and similar things, which are typical for these owners. Therefore we think that this is the way, we can try it and I am really not against and I think that this will cause a big discussion, there are many countries in Europe which operate on the principle of one health insurance company. But money are leaking, if there would not be leakage of money, and if they kept only 3-4%, if they only had the administration fund, let them live with it, but tens of millions [of] dollars are leaking from the profit, they do no have the right to create profit\".39\n\nTranscription of interview by Mr. Fico with Radio Slovensko for the program \"Saturday dialogues\", 30 June 2012, p. 1 **(Exh.

The office of the HSA Chairman, and performance of the HSA tasks, are now, in reality, becoming subordinated to the Health Minister, and the HSA ceases to be an independent authority. With this step, HSA as a control authority again misses out on a chance to objectively supervise Vseobecna zdravotna poistovna and healthcare providers that are subordinated to the Ministry of Health. This repeats the 2007 scenario in which I refuse to play a role. I think this is political hypocrisy since my stepping down has been decided a long time ago, and I will not simply stand here and watch as someone tries to come up with some artificial reasons for my resignation\".47\n\nPress release on the website of the Health Care Regulator announcing the resignation of the Health Care Regulator **(Exh.

C-12)** **.**\n\n55.\n\nThe Intention Statement analyzes certain assumptions for reforms to the health insurance system in the Slovak Republic, including the country\u2019s health indicators as they compare to other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"), and the make-up of the Slovak health insurance providers market. On the first issue, the Intention Statement notes that \"[w]hile total life expectancy keeps growing in the Czech Republic in line with the trends prevailing in OECD Member States, the gap between Slovakia and the rest of OECD countries keeps widening\".49 It further states that the \"below-average result and unfavourable developments are the result of a number [of] contributing factors\" both stemming from the lifestyle choices of patients and from the funding and administration of the healthcare system itself.50 On this point, the Intention Statement concludes that:\n\n\"[t]he growing pressure on public funds and, subsequently, on health spending is currently an important motivation to introduce a more efficient utilization of the limited resources. Having regard to the unsatisfactory results achieved by the Slovak health care system, this pressure calls for a change in organization of the health care sector\".51\n\n*Id.,* p. 1.\n\n*Id.,p.* 2.\n\n*Id., pp.* 2-3.\n\n56.\n\nIn exploring alternatives for health insurance provider systems, the Intention Statement goes on to analyze 29 European countries and finds that \"only three [...] have introduced legislation allowing for generation of profit on public health insurance\" and that the \"[u]nitary system has been introduced in 16 countries and [a] plural system not allowing for generation of profit in 10 countries\".52\n\n*Id.,*p.4.\n\n57.\n\nOn the health insurance providers, the Intention Statement finds that \"[t]oday, it can be stated that there are no important differences between individual health insurers in term of services offered to the insured, price policy or structure of the health care providers network\".53 It further finds that, even if there are several health insurance providers in the market, VsZP holds the most important position both in terms of market share (65.8% of the total number of insured) and in terms of the \"ability to create the extent of the network of existing health care providers, or performance of health care policy through its contract policies\".54 Under these circumstances, \"the importance of private health insurers to patients is much more less pronounced\".55\n\n*Id.,* p. 5.\n\n*Id.,* p. 6.\n\n*Id.,p.6.*\n\n58.\n\nFrom the above, the Statement concludes that \"[i]t has been estimated that elimination of plurality from health insurance sector would significantly reduce spending for administration and management of public health insurance due to elimination of duplicities in administrative costs, and that profit would be eliminated in full\".56\n\n*Id.,* pp. 6-7.\n\n59.\n\nThe Intention Statement identifies three possible \"Implementation Means\" for the creation of a single health insurance company in the Slovak Republic:\n\n(i) seeking an agreement with the shareholders of private health insurers to have the Slovak Republic take over the administration of their companies \"without involvement of their owners\", who would receive a certain financial compensation from the State; or\n\n(ii) seeking an agreement to have the shareholders of the privately-owned insurers agree to a voluntary sale of their shares or certain assets of their companies to the Slovak Republic (the \"voluntary sale process\"); or\n\n(iii) expropriation.57\n\n*Id.,*p.9.\n\n60.\n\nOn the first option, the Intention Statement notes that it \"has never been tested and can be therefore viewed as a risky legal hybrid\" and that \"there are reasonable doubts whether this would correspond with the objective for introduction of the unitary system, as the State would continue to compensate shareholders of private health insurance companies\".58\n\n*Id.,* p. 10.\n\n61.\n\nThe other two options are presented as part of a two-step process: the State would first offer to buy the shares or certain assets of the private insurers and, only \"after futile efforts for an agreement\", proceed to expropriation.59 In this scenario, a law could be passed either before or after the decision to expropriate, outlining the procedure for these two \"Implementation Means\".60\n\n*Id.,p.* 9.\n\n*Id.,p.* 9.\n\n62.\n\nIn case of expropriation, the Intention Statement takes into consideration the fact that it should be carried out in accordance with the Slovak Constitution, and specifically Article 20(4) thereof. This means that it must be performed based on a law, in the public interest, to the minimum required extent, and against adequate compensation.61 Specifically, the Statement notes that \"[i]n this particular case, the public interest may be deemed the need to create a functional and efficient public health insurance mechanism\".62 The Statement ends with some considerations as to how the two preferred \"Implementation Means\" *(i.e.,* purchase of shares, and/or expropriation) would fare under the law of the European Union (\"EU law\"), and international investment protection law.63\n\n*Id,* pp. 11-12.\n\n*Id,* p. 11.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 12-16.\n\n63.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, Achmea\u2019s CEO, Mr. Willem van Duin, sent a letter to Mr. Fico, in which he responded to the Government\u2019s public statements on the contemplated single health insurance company, including the Intention Statement, and expressed his concern as to how the announced measures would affect Union.64 He also outlined Achmea\u2019s disagreement with the Government\u2019s stated plans in the following terms:\n\n\"I regret that [...] your government is again considering measures intended to remove privately-owned health insurance companies such as UZP [Union] from the Slovak market. Such measures will again cause significant damages to Achmea. Moreover, there is no public interest that requires a removal of privately-owned health insurance companies from the Slovak market. Alleged differences in life expectancy between the Slovak Republic and certain other countries that existed well before the Slovak health insurance market was liberalized, and that apparently only improved since UZP entered the market, certainly do not compel the removal of privately-owned health insurance companies from the Slovak market. [...] Finally, an expropriation of privately-owned health insurance companies would appear discriminatory in that it would remove exclusively foreign-owned businesses from the Slovak market\".65\n\nLetter from Achmea to Mr. Fico, 23 July 2012 **(Exh.

Nonetheless, it has to be stated that such a treaty allows for dispossession of a foreign investor of its investment for reasons of public interest, in compliance with the law and in a non-discriminatory manner, provided that the Slovak Republic will be obliged to pay to the investor without undue delay a fair compensation\"71\n\nLetter by Mr. Fico to Achmea, 31 July 2012 **(Exh.

C-18)** **.**\n\n**F.** The Project Plan\n-----------------------\n\n70.\n\nOn 25 September 2012, in furtherance of the instructions contained in Government Resolution No. 383, the Slovak Ministry of Health published a proposal to implement the Intention Statement entitled \"Project of implementation of a unitary system of public health insurance in the Slovak Republic\" (the \"Project Plan\").74\n\nProject of Implementation of Unitary Public Health Insurance System in the Slovak Republic **(Exh. C-19)** **.**\n\n71.\n\nThe Project Plan is divided into three sections, an introduction on constitutional law provisions applicable to the provision of health care in the Slovak Republic and on studies on the effectiveness of healthcare systems,75 an overview of the desired features of a single health insurance provider under the new system, including a section on the role of the HSA,76 and a third section, touching on the introduction of the unitary public health insurance system. It analyzes the \"pros and cons\" associated with the two preferred Implementation Means identified in the Intention Statement *(i.e.,* buy-out of the private insurers and expropriation) and the \"vulnerabilities\", and it ends with a schedule of implementation.77\n\n*Id., pp.* 3-7.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 8-19.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 20-53.\n\n72.\n\nThe Project Plan states the Government\u2019s desire to undo the liberalization of the health insurance market that had allowed the introduction of private companies. It notes, for example, that \"the joint-stock companies present since 2005 have provided no significant argument which would - by a different quality and attitude of their services - justify the necessity to keep their existence as a tool to provide the health needs of population in more efficient way\".78 It goes on to recall that:\n\n\"[t]he Intention [Statement] has evaluated the facts why the new public health insurance system being administered by several health insurance companies as well as by private entities has not proved to be good\",79 and finds that \"[t]he interest in ensuring the efficiency in spending such a big volume of resources through health insurance companies - where they belong to public finances - leads to the strengthening of reasons from the side of the state to terminate the existence of the plural system and to return to an economical, less-administrative and cost-effective model of financing the health care through a single public institution\".80\n\n*Id.,p.* 8.\n\n*Id.,p.* 8.\n\n*Id.,p.* 8.\n\n73.\n\nThe Project Plan, to be implemented through the so-called \"Transformation Act\", further describes the introduction of a unitary health insurance system as a three-step process:\n\n(i) first, an attempt to agree with the privately owned health insurers a \"voluntary sale\" of the shares;\n\n(ii) second, if no agreement is reached, the expropriation of the shares; and\n\n(iii) third, the merger of the formerly privately-owned health insurers with the state-owned insurer into a single health insurer.81\n\n*Id.,* pp. 20-42.\n\n74.\n\nDuring this process, the State is to be represented either by VsZP or by a new company called *Spolo\u010dnost\u2019 pre zavedenie unit\u00e1rneho system verejn\u00e9ho poistenia, a.s.* (the \"Unitization Company\"), defined as a \"legal entity (joint-stock company) with 100% capital participation of the State in its registered capital, established by the State only for implementing the unitarisation project\".82 Either VsZP or the new company is to conduct legal and financial due diligence, offer the non-State insurers the opportunity to enter into purchase agreements, or, if no such purchase agreement is concluded, seek expropriation and act as the expropriator.83\n\n*Id.,* pp. 32-33.\n\n*Id.,p.* 35.\n\n75.\n\nThroughout the unitarisation process, the existing number of insured persons is to be stabilized, because \"if non-State insurers attract too many of those insured by VsZP, the State will incur damage as a result, as it would have to pay a higher compensation (purchase price) due to such \u2018unnatural\u2019 jump in the numbers of the insured\".84 Furthermore, should the privately-owned insurers not allow the Unitization Company to perform legal and financial due diligence, it would be free to value the insurers\u2019 shares by using governmental information.85\n\n*Id.,* pp. 31-32.\n\n*Id.,p.* 37.\n\n76.\n\nAs to the expropriation scenario, expropriation is to be requested after three unsuccessful offers during the \"voluntary sale\" process; two from the Unitization Company and, in between, one counter-offer from the insurer.86 The Project Plan defines expropriation as the \"compulsory passage of the title to shares in a non-State insurer to the Expropriator\".87 It also specifies that the expropriator *(i.e.,* the entity requesting the expropriation) would be the Unitization Company, and that HSA would act as the expropriating authority.88\n\n*Id.,* pp. 37-38.\n\n*Id.,p.* 38.\n\n*Id.,* p. 39.\n\n77.\n\nAs to the public interest underlying the eventual expropriation, the Project Plan states that:\n\n\"The expropriation objective will be to achieve, in the public interest, the acquisition of the title to the Expropriated Assets for implementing the objective of introducing unitary model into health insurance\".89\n\n*Id.,* p. 39.\n\n78.\n\nAnd on the issue of compensation, it provides that:\n\n\"The compensation for expropriation (i.e. compulsory passage of title, including a potential compulsory passage of a receivable from the non-State insurer) must be given in a way that is conformant with the Constitution, i.e. also including with international obligations binding on the Slovak Republic, in a non-discriminatory and equal manner, i.e. monies\"90\n\n*Id.,p.* 39.\n\n79.\n\nThe expropriation procedure is to be governed by the rules of administrative procedures, and may include an expert appraisal - whose costs shall be borne by the expropriator -, oral hearings, and deposits of the amount of compensation. The expropriation decision, which is taken by the Health Care Regulator upon application of the Unitization Company, transfers title to the shares, and must mention the amount of compensation owed. While the Project Plan indicates that that decision is not subject to appeal, is also states that \"a remedy could be filed [...] with a court\" with suspensive effect and that \"not even the Transformation Act will eliminate the risk that the decision to expropriate might be quashed by a court of another instance\".91\n\n*Id.,* p. 40.\n\n80.\n\nThe final step of the process is then the immediate merger of the Unitization company with VsZP, the state-owned insurer, since this course of action would minimize the risk of constitutional and anti-trust scrutiny:\n\n\"The fast completion of mergers of these health insurers can be an efficient tool for lowering the risk of questioning the Unitarisation Process (or constitutional questioning of the Transformation Act) with the Constitutional Court. In the opinion of the court, the Constitutional Court does not rule on restitution of a condition caused by a law which has been already executed\".92\n\n\"[i]t is desirable for the Transformation Act to also lay down that [...] prior approval of the [...] Antimonopoly Office of the Slovak Republic will not apply to the acquisition of non-State insurer\u2019s assets by the Unitarisation Company\".93\n\n*Id.,p.* 51.\n\n*Id.,p.* 38.\n\n81.\n\nIn sum, the Project Plan outlines the following \"anticipated deadlines\":\n\n(i) 17 October 2012: Approval of project to introduce a unitary public health insurance system in the Slovak Republic by the Slovak Government;\n\n(ii) By 30 November 2012: Establishment of the Unitarisation Company;\n\n(iii) By 30 November 2012: Opening of public procurement for legal and financial consulting services related to the introduction of a unitary public health insurance system;\n\n(iv) By 30 April 2013: Closing of public procurement to select advisor (with a duration of public procurement of 4 to 5 months);\n\n(v) 1 May 2013: Anticipated effective date of the Transformation Act;\n\n(vi) By 31 May 2013: Conclusion of agreements to conduct legal and financial due diligence and confidentiality along with definition of the negotiation spread for negotiations about the voluntary buyout;\n\n(vii) By 31 October 2013: Negotiations with shareholders of non-State insurers and conclusion of share purchase agreements;\n\n(viii) By 31 December 2013: Transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Unitarisation Company;\n\n(ix) 1 January 2014: Introduction of the unitary system;\n\nIf negotiations on voluntary buyout fail:\n\n(x) By 30 April 2014: Valid and executable decision to expropriate;\n\n(xi) By 30 June 2014: Process of unifying health insurers;\n\n(xii) By 1 July 2014: Introduction of the unitary system.94\n\n*Id.,p.* 53.\n\n82.\n\nThe Project Plan was subject to a \"legislative commenting procedure\", which lasted until 8 October 2012.

These characteristics include age, sex and economic activity, and - from July 2012 - additionally also a classification into one of the Pharmacy Cost Groups, the objective of which is to identify insured with expensive treatments. This mechanism serves to reallocate premiums to those insurers that bear the largest burden in terms of health care cost\". *See* SoC, \u00b6153, n. 28\n\nEconomic analysis of the Financial Policy Institute of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, *Less health for more money.

ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n100.\n\nPursuant to PO1, the present proceedings have been bifurcated in a phase dealing with all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, and a merits phase.126 The present ruling addresses the Slovak Republic\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Achmea\u2019s various claims.\n\nPO1, \u00b6\u00b67.1 and 8.7.\n\n**A.** Introductory Matters\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Applicable procedural law**\n--------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.127 On the applicable procedural rules, Article 8(5) of that BIT provides that \"[t]he arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law\".128\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n***Id.,*** **Article 8(5)**  **(Exh. C-1)**\n\n102.\n\nIn PO1, the Tribunal confirmed that the UNCITRAL Rules govern the present proceedings, \"[s]ave as otherwise agreed by the Parties and subject to the provisions of [PO1] and any subsequent Procedural Order by the Tribunal\".129 It further stated that:\n\n\"[f]or issues not dealt with in the Rules, the Tribunal shall apply such rules as may be agreed upon by the Parties. In the absence of any such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply such rules as it deems appropriate\".130\n\nPO1,\u00b62.1.\n\nPO1,\u00b62.2.\n\n**2. Applicable substantive law**\n---------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nArticle 33 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall apply the law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute\".131\n\n1976 UNCITRAL Rules, Article 33.\n\n104.\n\nFor its part, Article 8(6) of the BIT provides as follows on the issue of the substantive law applicable to the dispute:\n\n\"The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n- the general principles of international law\".132\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 8(6) **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal decided, in PO1, that the place of arbitration shall be Geneva, and it further clarified that \"[t]his choice of the place of arbitration in no way affects the law applicable to the merits of the dispute\" and that \"Article 187 of the Swiss Code on Private International Law merely serves as guidance and is not a mandatory provision in these proceedings\".133\n\nPO1, \u00b6 3.2. Article 187 of the Swiss Code on Private International Law reads as follows: \"1. The arbitral tribunal shall rule according to the law chosen by the parties or, in the absence of such choice, according to the law with which the action is most closely connected. 2. The parties may authorize the arbitral tribunal to rule according to equity\".\n\n**3. Interpretative approach**\n------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nUnder the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"Vienna Convention\" or the \"VCLT\"),134 which codify customary international law, the Tribunal shall interpret the provisions of the BIT in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.135\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Done at Vienna on 23 May 1969, entered into force on 27 January 1980, 1155 *U.N.T.S.* 331 **(Exh. RLA-32)** **.** Both State Parties to the BIT are also parties to the Vienna Convention. The Netherlands acceded to the VCLT on 9 April 1985. Czechoslovakia acceded to the VCLT on 29 July 1987, and the Slovak Republic succeeded Czechoslovakia as a State Party on 28 May 1993.\n\nArticles 31-32 VCLT.\n\n**4. Jurisdictional requirements under the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the BIT, Article 8 of which reads in relevant part:\n\n\"1. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement\".136\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 8(1) and (2) **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n108.\n\nAccordingly, Article 8 articulates four jurisdictional requirements. There must be (i) a dispute, (ii) between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, (iii) concerning an investment, and (iv) which has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement. The Parties disagree on whether a further condition exists requiring the Claimant to show that it has a *prima facie* case on the merits. This latter point will be discussed further below under Section C.\n\n109.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties, that the Claimant is a Dutch national and thus a qualifying investor pursuant to Article 1 (b)(ii) of the Treaty.137 Save for one issue, it is equally undisputed that the Claimant made an investment in accordance with the Article 1(a) of the Treaty.138 Indeed, Achmea\u2019s investment comprises the totality of Union\u2019s shares. The Respondent has not objected that such investment is not protected under the BIT. However, the Respondent objects that Achmea\u2019s indirect shareholdings in Union Commercial or other Slovak companies would not qualify as protected investments under Article 1(a) of the Treaty.139\n\nArticle 1 (b)(ii) of the BIT provides that, for the purposes of the treaty, the term \"investors\" comprises \"natural persons having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its law\" **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\nArticle 1(a) of the BIT, for the purposes of the treaty, provides that the term \"investments\" shall comprise \"every kind of asset invested either directly or through an investor of a third State and more particularly, though not exclusively: (i) movable and immovable property and all related property rights; (ii) shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures, as well as rights derived therefrom; (iii) title to money and other assets and to any performance having an economic value; (iv) rights in the field of intellectual property, also including technical processes, goodwill and know-how; (v) concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources\" **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\nObjections, \u00b6\u00b6 119-121; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 151-152.\n\n110.\n\nMore generally, the Respondent objects to the existence of a dispute under Article 8 of the BIT,140 and argues as indicated above that the Claimant has failed to state a *prima facie* case.141 The Respondent further submits that the six-month waiting period provided for in Article 8 (2) of the Treaty has not been respected.142 Finally, it contends that Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with EU law, thus rendering its expression of consent contained therein inoperative.143\n\nObjections, \u00b6\u00b6 45-57; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 38-76.\n\nObjections, \u00b6\u00b6 73-92; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 90-112.\n\nObjections, \u00b6\u00b6 93-113; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 113-143.\n\nObjections, \u00b6\u00b6 122-195; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 153-216.\n\n**5. Jurisdiction vs. admissibility**\n-------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nBefore considering the objections raised by the Slovak Republic, the Tribunal addresses, for the sake of clarity, the question of their characterization as either to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or to the admissibility of the claims, over which there appears to be a certain disagreement between the Parties.\n\n112.\n\nIn essence, the Claimant submits that the Respondent waived the possibility to raise any admissibility objections to Achmea\u2019s claims because it failed to do so in its brief on its preliminary objections, as indicated in the Tribunal\u2019s letter accompanying PO1.144 For its part, the Respondent retorts that Achmea\u2019s argumentation is irrelevant since, besides being wrong, it \"elevates form over substance\".145 The UNCITRAL Rules do not entertain a distinction between objections to jurisdiction and objections to admissibility, and, in any event, the Tribunal has all latitude to qualify the objections as it deems fit, notwithstanding the fact that the Respondent has opted to label them as objections targeted at the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.146\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, referring to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 31 May 2013.\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 31-35. As to the substance, the Respondent submits that (i) the existence of a dispute under Article 8(1), and (ii) the six-month period under Article 8(2) are indeed jurisdictional requirements. In this, regard, it relies on *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002),* \u00b6 88 **(Exh. RLA-75)** **.** and *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters,* \u00b6 48 **(Exh. RLA-24)** **.**\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that the Respondent insisted on having the first phase cover both objections on grounds of jurisdiction and admissibility. It is in this light that the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to file all its objections in its first brief, failing which the Tribunal would consider that it waived its right to do so further along the proceedings. It did so in the following terms:\n\n\"the Respondent shall file a statement containing *all and any* of its objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and to the admissibility of Claimant\u2019s claims to be submitted on or before 14 June 2013, failing which the Respondent will have waived the possibility to raise any further objections thereafter\".147\n\nTribunal\u2019s letter to the Parties dated 31 May 2013.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that \"admissibility\" and \"jurisdiction\" are two distinct legal concepts under international law, which governs the judicial function of international courts and tribunals.148 This distinction, which finds its origin in domestic legal systems,149 has not been strictly enforced at the international level,150 and has received varying treatment or even been disregarded in the investment treaty context.151 Some investment tribunals have, in particular, pointed out that the term and concept of \"admissibility\" is absent from the instruments that govern their jurisdiction, such as the relevant investment treaty and the ICSID Convention.152\n\nJ.

The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/8, Decision on Preliminary Objections, 27 July 2006, \u00b6 54*, where the relevant tribunals decided to forego a differentiated analysis on jurisdiction and admissibility, although the distinction may have been raised by one of the Parties.\n\n*See, e.g., L.E.S.I. S.p.A, and ASTALDI S.p.A, v. R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rienne D\u00e9mocratique et Populaire,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3, Decision, 12 July 2006, \u00b6 58.\n\n115.\n\nThe jurisdiction of a tribunal goes to the power to decide a specific dispute, whereas admissibility relates to the ability to exercise that power and speaks to the characteristics of a particular claim and whether it is fit to be heard by a tribunal. As Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice said:\n\n\"there is a clear jurisprudential distinction between an objection to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and an objection to the substantive admissibility of the claim. The latter is a plea that the tribunal should rule the claim inadmissible on some ground other than its ultimate merits: the former is a plea that the tribunal itself is incompetent to give any ruling at all whether as to the merits or as to the admissibility of the claim. A successful challenge to the jurisdiction stops all further proceedings in the case, or at any rate ensures that there is no finding on the merits. But an unsuccessful jurisdictional plea leaves open the possibility that a finding on the ultimate merits may still be excluded through a decision given against the substantive admissibility of the claim\".153\n\nG. Fitzmaurice, *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice* (CUP, 1986), pp. 438439 (footnotes omitted). *See also,* J. Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of Public International Law* (OUP, 2012), p. 694.\n\n116.\n\nThe key element to determine the jurisdictional character of an objection is assessing whether it addresses the Parties\u2019 consent to the relevant dispute settlement mechanism, and the scope of such consent. As the ICJ considered in *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters* that:\n\n\"in determining the scope of the consent expressed by one of the parties, the Court pronounces on its jurisdiction and not on the admissibility of the application\".154\n\n*Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, \u00b6 48 **(Exh. RLA-24)** **.**\n\n117.\n\nIn that case, the Court was confirming its finding in *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo,* that \"its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted by them\",155 and that \"any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon\".156 The Court concluded that \"the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application\".157\n\n*Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda),* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2006, \u00b6 88 **(Exh. RLA-75)** **.**\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n118.\n\nThese considerations are equally applicable in the investment treaty context. For example, the tribunal in *Micula* found that:\n\n\"[W]hen an objection relates to a requirement contained in the text on which consent is based, it remains a jurisdictional objection. If such a requirement is not satisfied, the Tribunal may not examine the case at all for lack of jurisdiction. By contrast, an objection relating to admissibility will not necessarily bar the Tribunal from examining the case if the reasons for the inadmissibility of the claim are capable of being removed and are indeed removed at a subsequent stage. In other words, consent is a prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\".158\n\n*loan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. v.

C-78)** **.**\n\n119.\n\nHence, any and all objections grounded on the BIT provision that contains the State\u2019s consent to international arbitration for the solution of an investment dispute address the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. This rule was expressed with particular clarity in *Daimler.*\n\n\"[a]ll BIT-based dispute resolution provisions [...] are by their very nature jurisdictional. The mere fact of their inclusion in a bilateral treaty indicates that they are reflections of the sovereign agreement of two States - not the mere administrative creation of arbitrators. They set forth the conditions under which an investor-State tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the contracting state parties\u2019 consent, much in the same way in which legislative acts confer jurisdiction upon domestic courts\".159\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012, \u00b6 193 **(Exh. C-83)** **.**\n\n120.\n\nWhile the Tribunal must, if necessary, examine issues of jurisdiction of its own volition, questions of admissibility may only be examined if they are raised by the Parties.160 In light of the fact that the Respondent has only raised objections relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Tribunal will accordingly not engage in its own admissibility analysis, but rather consider whether one or more of the objections already raised by the Respondent need to be re-qualified as issues of admissibility. It recalls that under paragraphs 7.1 and 8.7 of PO1,161 the Tribunal is expressly called to decide at this stage on *both* its jurisdiction *and* the admissibility of the claims submitted.\n\n*Micula v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, \u00b6 65 **(Exh. C-78)** **.**\n\nParagraph 7.1 of PO1 provides: \"The Parties agreed in principle that the present proceedings shall be bifurcated. Accordingly, a one-day evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility [...] will be held\"; and paragraph 8.7 provides: \"The Tribunal will determine the further procedure in consultation with the Parties as necessary, following any Ruling made in respect of the objections to jurisdiction and admissibility raised by the Respondent\".\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address each objection in turn. In the making of its ruling the Tribunal has observed Article 8(7) of the BIT, as well as Articles 31 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal notes that, in its analysis, it addresses the dispositive and outcome-determinative arguments raised by the Parties; it does not include a consideration of each and every specific argument raised by the Respondent in support of its objections, or by the Claimant in response to such objections. Even if not explicitly addressed in its ruling, the Tribunal wishes to stress that it carefully considered all of the Parties\u2019 oral and written submissions.\n\n**B.** First Objection: There Is No Legal Dispute\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Achmea\u2019s expropriation claim is premature and hypothetical since there is no dispute under the Treaty. In addition, the Tribunal\u2019s decision on such a claim would not have practical and concrete consequences, and would ultimately be an impermissible advisory opinion falling outside the ambit of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. In essence, Achmea\u2019s attempt to create a \"stand-by tribunal\", so the Respondent argues, is an abuse of rights.\n\n123.\n\nThe Slovak Republic submits that Achmea\u2019s expropriation claim fails to qualify as a \"dispute\" under Article 8 of the BIT.162 A dispute requires a \"conflict of claims and rights\",163 and the existence of a dispute is a \"jurisdictional threshold [that] must be met at the time of commencement of proceedings\".164\n\nObjections, \u00b6 45.\n\n*Black's Law Dictionary,* 6th Edition (West Publishing, 1996), p. 472 **(Exh.

The Claimant has not pointed, and cannot point, to any similar elements in the instant proceedings.170\n\n*AES Corporation v.

And yet it is precisely those modalities that will determine whether the criteria for a lawful expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty are satisfied\".175 This is so because the Respondent can lawfully expropriate Achmea\u2019s investment under the Treaty, so long as it does so in accordance with the terms of Article 5.176 As counsel for the Respondent presented the issue at the hearing:\n\n\"some expropriations are lawful and some expropriations are not and therefore in order for a tribunal to judge an expropriation under article 5 you must know the facts.

The legal consequences were that it placed a restriction on the property owner\u2019s right to alienate the property inter vivos\".190 Finally, the Respondent notes that the treaty providing for the jurisdiction of the Court, the Geneva Convention, expressly provided for a mandate to issue advisory opinions, which is absent from the BIT.191\n\n*Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6, Preliminary Objections, 25 August 1925 **(Exh.

Furthermore, it is in Achmea\u2019s interest to remain in the Slovak market and it is in the Respondent\u2019s interest to expropriate Achmea\u2019s investment.223\n\nResponse, \u00b6 80.\n\n153.\n\nThe requirement of concreteness as referred to by the Respondent is based on an erroneous interpretation of the cases it cites; in fact, there is no such requirement implying that an expropriation dispute can only be concrete enough for a tribunal to have jurisdiction if the expropriation in question is completed.224\n\nResponse, \u00b6 83.\n\n154.\n\nAchmea submits that the \"requirement of concreteness\", referred to by the Tribunal in *AES,* \"merely means that an arbitral tribunal in the context of the ICSID [Convention is not meant to be constituted only to decide a purely academic question in absence of a dispute\".225 Furthermore, quoting Schreuer, the Claimant contends that \"[a]ctual or concrete damage is not required before such a party may bring legal action\".226\n\nResponse, \u00b6 83, referring to *AES Corporation v.

It further argues that \"[a]part from the fact that Achmea is requesting several types of relief that the Slovak Republic does not dispute can be granted (such as declaratory and monetary relief), Achmea is entitled within the boundaries of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules to \u2018amend or supplement\u2019 its claims \u2018during the course of the arbitral proceedings\u2019\" which renders the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction not contingent on whether or not it can grant one of the several types of relief requested in the Statement of Claim.230\n\nResponse, \u00b6 19.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant furthermore submits that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions, it is not seeking a legal opinion from the Tribunal.231 It also rejects the Slovak Republic\u2019s submission that Achmea is attempting to create a \"stand-by\" tribunal.232\n\nResponse, \u00b6 132.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 133.\n\n160.\n\nIn fact, there is no applicable rule that prohibits the Tribunal from ordering the relief sought by Achmea233 The Claimant submits that \"[p]ermitting arbitral penalties is part of the contemporary tendency to reinforce the effectiveness of the arbitral process\".234 It also quotes from Schreuer, who has said that \"[t]he ability to order specific performance is a power that is inherent in a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\"235 and that \"[t]here is no doubt that an obligation imposed by an award that is expressed not in monetary terms but in terms of an obligation to perform a particular act or to refrain from a certain course of action is equally binding and gives rise to the effect of *res judicata\"236*\n\nResponse, \u00b6 135.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 136.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 135, citing C.

Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Slovak Republic\u2019s first objection relates to the purported absence of a legal dispute. The existence of a dispute is a specific requirement for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction under the Treaty.\n\n163.\n\nArticle 8 (1) and (2) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n\"1. All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n2. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement\".238\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 8(1) and (2) **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n164.\n\nWhile the Claimant argues that the expression \"all disputes\" is broad and that, under either definition advanced by the Parties in this instance, Achmea\u2019s disagreement with the Slovak Republic qualifies as a dispute under the BIT, the Respondent retorts that a dispute within the meaning of Article 8 \"requires an allegation that a breach of the Treaty *has occurred\".239* Furthermore, the Slovak Republic also argues that Achmea\u2019s claims have no plausible chance to succeed on the merits.\n\nReply, \u00b6 39.\n\n165.\n\nThe Treaty does not define the term \"dispute\". Article 8(1) provides that \"all disputes\" concerning an investment shall if possible be settled amicably. Article 8(2) provides in relevant part that any dispute that could not be settled amicably, can be submitted to an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Article 8(3) and (4).\n\n166.\n\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \"dispute\" as \"[a] conflict or controversy; a conflict of claims of rights; an assertion of a right, claim, or demand on one side, met by contrary claims or allegations on the other\".240\n\n*Black's Law Dictionary,* 6th Edition (West Publishing, 1996), p. 472 **(Exh. RLA-7)** **.**\n\n167.\n\nThe notion of dispute was discussed at length by the Permanent Court of International Justice (the \"PCIJ\") and its successor, the International Court of Justice (the \"ICJ\"). In *Mavrommatis,* the PCIJ defined a dispute as \"[a] disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons\".241 The ICJ clarified that the assessment of whether a dispute exists must be subject to an objective determination.242 It is not sufficient that the Claimant alleges the existence of a dispute,243 nor is it sufficient for the Respondent to deny the existence of a dispute.244 In the *South West Africa* cases, the ICJ further indicated that a mere conflict of interests is not sufficient, but that \"[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other\".245 Finally, the ICJ also held that \"[t]he existence of a dispute does not depend on the objective validity of the claims\".246 For instance, in the *East Timor* case, the Court held that by virtue of Australia\u2019s denial of the complaints formulated, rightly or wrongly, by Portugal, there was a legal dispute.247\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Court, 30 August 1924, p. 11 **(Exh.

A disagreement on a point of law may relate to the existence, interpretation or application of a legal provision. It appears from the case law of the ICJ and its predecessor that the existence of a dispute is readily acknowledged where a claimant submits specific and argued claims, which are denied by a respondent.248 Hence, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, it suffices if it is established that there is a conflict of legal views between the Parties, whether the Claimant will seek from the Respondent a relief arising from the existence of legal rights rather than only factual interests which would not be legally protected. In turn, this will beg a second question, namely whether the dispute concerns an investment and is thus not of a political or commercial nature. In the present instance, the issue goes to whether Achmea formulated claims of a \"legal nature\" which were denied or rejected by the Respondent prior to the institution of these proceedings.\n\n*Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador/Honduras: Nicaragua intervening),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, \u00b6 326.\n\n169.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Parties have stated opposing views on the Respondent\u2019s conduct and its impact on the Claimant\u2019s rights under the Article 5 of the BIT. According to the Claimant, the Slovak Republic has engaged in conduct, through the adoption of the Intention Statement, the Project Plan and the draft Transformation Act, including government resolutions approving such documents and public statements related thereto, which it believes warrants redress under the BIT.249\n\nSoC, \u00b6\u00b6 213-217; Response, \u00b6 80.\n\n170.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, Achmea\u2019s chairman, Mr. Willem van Duin, signified his concern about announcements that the Slovak Republic was considering gaining control of Union \"through an expropriation, or measures similarly designed to force Achmea to abandon control over its investment\".250 He also indicated that \"[s]uch measures will again cause significant damage to Achmea\".251 He further specified that there was no public interest justifying the removal of privately-owned health insurance companies from the Slovak market and that such removal would appear discriminatory since it would only target foreign-owned businesses.252 The Slovak Government responded to this letter on 31 July 2012 by referring to its principled right under the BIT to expropriate foreign investors of their investment, and opining that the Government\u2019s statements or its approval of the Intention Statement are not capable of causing harm to Achmea:\n\n\"[l]t has to be stated that such a treaty [*i.e*., the BIT] allows for dispossession of a foreign investor of its investment for reasons of public interest, in compliance with the law and in a non-discriminatory manner, provided that the Slovak Republic will be obliged to pay to the investor without undue delay a fair compensation.\n\nThe Government of the Slovak Republic does not believe that its statements and approval of the intention to implement a unitary public health insurance system in the Slovak Republic might be capable of causing any damage to Achmea\".253\n\nLetter of Achmea to His Excellency Mr. Robert Fico, 23 July 2012, p. 1 **(Exh. C-13)** **.**\n\n*Id.,* p. 2.\n\n*Id.*\n\nLetter from the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, His Excellency Mr. Robert Fico, to Achmea, 31 July 2012, p. 2 **(Exh. C-16)** **.**\n\n171.\n\nIn the 17 December 2012 letter addressed to the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Achmea summarized its dispute with the Slovak Republic as follows:\n\n\"In essence, this dispute concerns your government\u2019s unjustified determination to remove Achmea\u2019s operations from the Slovak public health insurance market, despite the fact that Achmea - as Achmea has communicated on several occasions - wishes and is entitled to continue these operations. The removal of Achmea\u2019s investment by way of an expropriation as contemplated in the Project Plan clearly violates the BIT and other applicable law; and so do the negotiations contemplated in the Project Plan for a so-called \u2018voluntary buy-out\u2019 of Achmea\u2019s investment which - even if Achmea would want to enter into such negotiations (which it does not) - are manifestly unfair and not voluntary at all, since they would be conducted under the threat that Achmea\u2019s investment will be expropriated if no agreement is reached\".254\n\nLetter of Achmea to His Excellency Mr. Robert Fico, 17 December 2012, \u00b6 5 **(Exh. C-38)** **.**\n\n172.\n\nFurthermore, in its Notice of Arbitration, Achmea specified that:\n\n\"A dispute exists between Achmea and the Slovak Republic concerning Achmea\u2019s investment. The dispute in essence concerns the Slovak Republic\u2019s determination to remove Achmea\u2019s investment from the Slovak health insurance market [...], whereas Achmea wishes to retain and continue its investment in the Slovak health insurance market [...]\n\nThe dispute between Achmea and the Slovak Republic pertains to the BIT. The expropriation of Achmea\u2019s investment contemplated by the Slovak Republic should comply with Articles 5 and 3 of the BIT, which it does not\".255\n\nNotice, \u00b6\u00b6 150-151.\n\n173.\n\nAchmea\u2019s legal position was consistently denied by the Slovak Republic, arguing first and foremost that the Slovak Republic is entitled within the limits of Article 5 of the BIT to make use of its sovereign prerogative to expropriate foreign assets. That a dispute exists between the Parties on the proper interpretation of Article 5 became overwhelmingly apparent at the hearing, where both Parties adopted diametrically opposed interpretations of that provision. While the Slovak Republic insisted on its principled right to expropriate foreign assets in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 5 of the BIT, the Claimant argued that this provision enshrined a prohibition of expropriation, entailing a series of legal consequences in terms of available relief. For the Claimant, the Slovak Republic was:\n\n\"trying to prohibit effective enforcement of a BIT provision that prohibits expropriation. If you look at article 5 it says, \u2018neither contracting party shall expropriate unless\u2019, and that is a prohibition.\n\nAny effective enforcement of that prohibition requires that we have the right to submit to your tribunal any arguments that we have on that prohibition before that prohibition is breached\".256\n\nTr. 106:10-19.\n\n174.\n\nAnd the Claimant continued:\n\n\"the principal rule of article 5 is, and it starts that way if you read the article: neither party shall expropriate. Then there is an unless clause which says \u2018unless\u2019 and then follow three conditions that have to be complied with. Our submission is that is a clear prohibition, there is one exception, they are permitted to demonstrate that that exception applies, they can do that, but unless and until they have done so the principal rule, the starting point, the words that the article starts out with, apply in full force\".257\n\nTr. 107:25-108:12.\n\n175.\n\nArguing the contrary, the Respondent stated that:\n\n\"it is our submission, clearly, that nothing in the treaty should prevent the Slovak Republic from engaging in that discussion, from engaging in consideration of the issue, and in fact all other issues related to the possibility of a unitary system.\n\nNow, then I think I heard, well, they haven\u2019t explained what the public purpose is. There is no statement of public purpose in these documents that we have looked at. In the documents so far, what is the obligation to state the public purpose? There is no obligation at this point\".258\n\nTr. 180:4-16.\n\n176.\n\nThe foregoing clearly shows that the two Parties hold radically opposing views on the proper interpretation of Article 5 of the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that a dispute exists between the Parties.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s attempt to add requirements under the heading of the existence of a dispute. It is the Respondent\u2019s submission that for a dispute to exist (i) the Claimant must have alleged that a breach has already occurred; (ii) the Claimant bears the burden of showing that the actual controversy is concrete; and (iii) the relief sought must be permissible.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent argued that \"[a] *\u2018dispute\u2019* within the meaning of Article 8 requires an allegation that a breach of the Treaty *has occurred\u2019259* In particular, a disagreement on possible future conduct is not sufficient to constitute a dispute \"in the absence of an allegation of a past or ongoing breach of the Treaty\".260 The Respondent relied in this respect on *Malicorp v. Egypt,* where the tribunal held that the allegation of a treaty breach is a jurisdictional requirement,261 and on *SAUR v. Argentina,* where the tribunal held that \"si les lois \u00e0 caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et leur application concrete par les autorit\u00e9s argentines constituent une violation des droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 un investisseur \u00e9tranger par le Trait\u00e9 Bilateral, alors un diff\u00e9rend d\u2019ordre juridique prend effectivement naissance entre un investisseur et le pays d\u2019accueil\".262\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 43.\n\nReply, \u00b6 50.\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, \u00b6 102(f) **(Exh. RLA-77****).**\n\n*SAUR International SA v. Republic of Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 27 February 2006, \u00b6 74 **(Exh. RLA-78)** (\"if laws of a general nature and their concrete application by the Argentine authorities constitute a breach of rights conferred to a foreign investor by the Bilateral Treaty, then a dispute of a legal nature effectively comes into existence between the investor and the host State\", unofficial translation).\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent called attention to the fact that Achmea acknowledged that it was not yet expropriated of its investment. Achmea only claims that if the expropriation were carried out on the terms of the Project Plan or on materially similar terms, then it would breach Article 5 of the BIT. Hence, Achmea acknowledged that no breach of Article 5 had yet occurred.\n\n180.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the question of whether the Claimant alleged a breach of Article 5 of the BIT is of little relevance for the determination of whether a dispute on the interpretation and application of Article 5 exists. Indeed, the Respondent conflates the question of the existence of a legal dispute and the law of international responsibility.263 It does not follow from the fact that international responsibility can arise only after an internationally wrongful act has occurred, that an internationally wrongful act is required for a legal dispute to exist. In other words, the allegation of a breach is not a constitutive element of the notion of legal dispute but rather a requirement for liability to arise. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has alleged that the Slovak Republic was obliged under Article 5 of the Treaty to state a public interest in the Project Plan, and that a failure to do so warrants review by the present Tribunal. Whatever the outcome of that argument, at the present juncture, the Tribunal cannot but find that there is a legal dispute between the Parties on the correct interpretation of Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\n*See,* in particular, Reply, \u00b6 45.\n\n181.\n\nMoreover, the cases relied upon by the Respondent are of no help here. *Malicorp* is inapposite to the extent that the tribunal in that case enumerated various jurisdictional requirements, amongst which were the existence of a dispute, and, additionally, the allegation of a breach of the bilateral investment treaty.264 Hence, it is incorrect to conclude that the allegation of a breach is a constitutive element of a legal dispute. As regards *SAUR,* the Tribunal is also unconvinced of its relevance here. In that case, the tribunal held that it did not fall within the ambit of its jurisdiction to adjudicate measures of general application, such as legislative acts or instruments implementing them, unless such \"general laws and their specific implementation [...] violate the rights conferred on the foreign investor under the bilateral treaty\", at which time one could consider that a dispute of a legal nature arises.265 While the Tribunal agrees with the general conclusion reached by the tribunal in *SAUR,* it does not believe that this question has to be resolved at the stage of determining whether a legal dispute exists (which the *SAUR* tribunal in any case found to exist in that particular instance). Deciding on a \"general law\" is not the remedy sought in this arbitration, but would rather be a step in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning to adjudicate on the Claimant\u2019s requested relief. Hence, if at all, such issue would rather arise at the stage of the so-called *prima facie* test to which the Tribunal will revert below.\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, \u00b6 102(d) and (f) **(Exh.

RLA-78)** **.**\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent also relied on the *Northern Cameroons* case to argue that a dispute only exists if the Claimant can show that the actual controversy is \"concrete\". The Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent\u2019s reading of a concreteness requirement into the notion of dispute is unsupported by the authorities it relies on. In *Northern Cameroons,* the ICJ held that\n\n\"[t]he function of the Court is to state the law, but it may pronounce judgment only in connection with concrete cases where there exists at the time of the adjudication an actual controversy involving a conflict of legal interests between the parties. The Court\u2019s judgment must have some practical consequence in the sense that it can affect existing legal rights or obligations of the parties, thus removing uncertainty from their legal relations. No judgment on the merits in this case could satisfy these essentials of the judicial function\".266\n\n*Case Concerning the Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v. The United Kingdom),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 2 December 1963: I.C.J. Reports 1963, pp. 33-34 **(Exh. RLA-8)** **.** It is to be noted that Exh. RLA-8 only contains the Unofficial Communiqu\u00e9 No. 63/14 dated 2 December 1963, but not the Court\u2019s ruling.\n\n183.\n\nHowever, prior to that, the Court first held that a legal dispute existed between Cameroon and the United Kingdom when proceedings were instituted, in light of \"the opposing views of the Parties as to the interpretation and application of relevant articles of the Trusteeship Agreement\".267 It then indicated that some circumstances may warrant the Court to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction, notably in pursuance of its duty to safeguard its judicial function.268 Since the dispute had become moot in the course of the proceedings, the Court held that \"to adjudicate on the merits would be inconsistent with its judicial function\"269 Hence, this decision does not support the Respondent\u2019s reading of a specific concreteness requirement into the existence of a legal dispute.\n\n*Id.,* p. 27.\n\n*Id.,* p. 37 (\"Even if [...] the Court finds that it has jurisdiction, it is not obliged to exercise it in all cases\"). See, *id.,* p. 38.\n\n*Id.,* p. 37. See, *id.,* p. 38 (\"The Court must discharge the duty to which it has already called attention - the duty to safeguard the judicial function. Whether or not at the moment the Application was filed there was jurisdiction in the Court to adjudicate upon the dispute submitted to it, circumstances that have since arisen render any adjudication devoid of purpose. Under these conditions, for the Court to proceed further in the case would not, in its opinion, be a proper discharge of its duties\").\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s reliance on *AES v. Argentina* is equally unavailing. The Respondent argued that investment treaty tribunals have recognized that \"a claim must be sufficiently concrete for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim\".270 In particular, the *AES* tribunal held that:\n\n\"the true test of jurisdiction consists in determining\n\n(a) whether, in its claim, AES raises some *legal* issues in relation with a concrete situation, and\n\n(b) if the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the answer to be given to these issues would have some practical and concrete consequences\"271\n\nResponse, \u00b6 49.\n\n*AES Corporation v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, 26 April 2005, \u00b6 44 **(Exh. RLA-9)** **.**\n\n185.\n\nHere again, this ruling needs to be put in its proper context. It is true that the *AES* tribunal expressed the foregoing opinion in the context of its analysis on the existence of a dispute. That said, the tribunal held that in the specific context of the ICSID framework, two elements needed to be met for a dispute to be considered as having a legal nature: \"The first deals with the intrinsic definition of what is a legal dispute; the second deals with the inherent logic which presided over the creation of ICSID\".272 As regards the first element, i.e. the intrinsic definition of a dispute, the tribunal quotes the classic *Mavrommatis* definition. As regards the second element, i.e. the inherent logic underlining the creation of ICSID, the tribunal quotes Professor Schreuer\u2019s opinion that a dispute must have some practical relevance and cannot be purely theoretical.273 On that basis, the tribunal made the abovementioned determination on what it qualifies as the \"true test of jurisdiction\" by reading a two-pronged concreteness requirement into the notion of legal dispute, only to then reach the conclusion that \"AES\u2019 claim seems *prima facie* a substantial one\".274\n\nW.,\u00b643.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 43, citing C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (CUP, 2001), p. 102, \u00b6 36.\n\n*Id.,*\u00b645.\n\n186.\n\nWhatever the merits of the *AES* tribunal\u2019s analysis on this particular point, it does not support the Respondent\u2019s interpretation. Indeed, the tribunal referred to the \"intrinsic definition of a dispute\", and then added a supplementary consideration which it held to be specific to the ICSID framework. On this basis, the *AES* decision must be distinguished from the present case, where the Tribunal should not deviate from the definition developed in the jurisprudence of the ICJ and its predecessor referred to above. It also appears that the introduction of a concreteness requirement into the definition of a legal dispute conflates the question of the existence of a dispute with the *prima facie* test developed by various investment tribunals, a separate question to which the Tribunal will revert further below.\n\n187.\n\nFinally, elaborating on its argument that a dispute can only exist if the Claimant alleges that a breach has already occurred, the Respondent argued that the relief sought by the Claimant is impermissible. For the Respondent, remedies in international law are \"strictly reparatory\", and damages are the only remedy available to the Claimant under the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot order the Respondent to refrain from expropriating Achmea nor impose a penalty as requested by the Claimant. For its part, the Claimant answered that the question of available remedies is not a question for the jurisdictional stage, and even less so a constitutive element of the definition of a legal dispute. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant.\n\n188.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that there is a conflict of legal views opposing the Parties regarding the interpretation and application of Article 5 of the BIT. Hence, the Tribunal finds that a dispute in the sense of Article 8 of the BIT exists. The Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**C.** Second Objection: Achmea Failed To State **A** *Prima Facie* Case\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.

The Claimant\u2019s position**\n------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s submission that there is no jurisdictional requirement under the Treaty to state a *prima facie* case. In any event, should such a requirement exist, Achmea has sufficiently shown that it has a *prima facie* cause of action.\n\n\"Achmea has shown a *prima facie* case of breach of the Treaty.\n\nMore importantly, however, there is no jurisdictional requirement for Achmea to state a *prima facie* case at all under the Treaty\".312\n\nResponse, \u00b6 22.\n\n203.\n\nThe cases cited by the Slovak Republic supporting the existence of such a requirement \"involve arbitration clauses that qualify the types of disputes that may be submitted to arbitration\".313 For example, *Saipem* dealt with a clause that covered only disputes relating to compensation for expropriation or similar measures. In *Telenor,* a clause allowing for the arbitration of disputes as to the amount or payment of compensation for expropriation and other similar measures was at issue. In *Oil Platforms,* the arbitration clause extended to a \"dispute [...] as to the interpretation or application of the [relevant] Treaty\". And finally, in *Impregilo* there was a discussion as to who the parties to the dispute were.314 Achmea submits that, consequently, the determination of jurisdiction in those cases required an assessment of whether the dispute was of the type covered by the relevant arbitration clauses.315\n\nResponse, \u00b6 23.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 23.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 24.\n\n204.\n\nIn the instant case, by contrast, \"no particular limitation as to the type of dispute that may be submitted to arbitration applies\" because Article 8 of the BIT covers \"all disputes\" between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Party concerning an investment of the latter.316 Hence, there is no need for a *prima facie* test here.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 25.\n\n205.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s argument that Achmea failed to quantify its damages in the Statement of Claim, the Claimant retorts that neither Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Rules, nor PO1, require Achmea to quantify its damages in the Statement of Claim.317\n\nAchmea will quantify its damages when appropriate, that is in the merits phase. In any event, the quantification of the Claimant\u2019s damages is not relevant for the decision on jurisdiction and admissibility.318\n\nResponse, \u00b6 138.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 139.\n\n**3. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n**a)** ***The applicable standard***\n------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is limited to disputes concerning an investment, as required by Article 8 of the BIT. Since the Claimant does not raise any dispute regarding an investment approval or an investment agreement, but places itself exclusively under the umbrella of the BIT, an essential element of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is to determine whether the claims put forward by the Claimant are capable of coming within the reach of these provisions. The so-called *prima facie* test has been applied by numerous international courts and tribunals. In *Mavrommatis,* the PCIJ held that prior to engaging in the merits of the case it had to ascertain whether the claim was capable of coming within the reach of the provisions of the Mandate:\n\n\"The Court, before giving judgment on the merits of the case, will satisfy itself that the suit before it, in the form in which it has been submitted and on the basis of the facts hitherto established, falls to be decided by application of the clauses of the Mandate\".319\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Court, 30 August 1924, p. 16 **(Exh. C-64)** **.**\n\n207.\n\nIn *Ambatielos,* the ICJ indicated that:\n\n\"The Court must determine, however, whether the arguments advanced by the Hellenic Government in respect of the treaty provisions on which the Ambatielos claim is said to be based, are of a sufficiently plausible character to warrant a conclusion that the claim is based on the Treaty. It is not enough for the claimant Government to establish a remote connection between the facts of the claim and the Treaty of 1886\".320\n\n*Ambatielos case (merits: obligation to arbitrate),* Judgment, 19 May 1953, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 18.\n\n208.\n\nJudge Rosalyn Higgins further spelled out the so-called *prima facie* test in her separate opinion in *Oil Platforms:*\n\n\"The only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims of [the applicant] are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept pro tern the facts as alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret Articles I, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of [the claimant\u2019s] claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them\".321\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Report 1996, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, p. 226, \u00b6 32 **(Exh. RLA-17)** **.**\n\n209.\n\nNumerous investment tribunals have also sought to establish at the jurisdictional stage whether the facts as alleged by the Claimant, if established, \"are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked\".322 For instance, the tribunal in *UPS v. Canada* held that it:\n\n\"must conduct a prima facie analysis of the NAFTA obligations, which UPS seeks to invoke, and determine whether the facts alleged are capable of constituting a violation of these obligations\".323\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, \u00b6 254 **(Exh. RLA-16)** **.**\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 November 2002, \u00b6 33 **(Exh. RLA-18)** **.**\n\n210.\n\nIn *Telenor,* it was held that:\n\n\"The onus is on the Claimant to show what is alleged to constitute expropriation is at least capable of doing so. There must, in other words, be a *prima facie* case that the BIT applies\".324\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15, Award, 15 September 2006, \u00b6 68 **(Exh. RLA-19)** **.**\n\n211.\n\nIn that case, the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to claims of expropriation. Since the claimant failed to put forward a claim of expropriation in its written submissions, the tribunal found that the facts as asserted could not support a *prima facie* claim of expropriation.325\n\n*See also,* *Micula v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, \u00b6 67 **(Exh.

In doing so, the Tribunal will assess whether Saipem\u2019s case is reasonably arguable on its face. If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits\".326\n\n*Saipem S.p.A, v. The People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, \u00b6 91 **(Exh. RLA-20)** **.** *See further,* *Pan American Energy LLC, and BP Argentina Exploration Company v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13, Decision on Preliminary Objections, 27 July 2006, \u00b6 51 (\"the claims made in the present case must be taken as they are by the Tribunal at this stage of the proceedings, whose only task it is, in the present phase of the proceedings, to determine whether, as formulated, they fit into the jurisdictional parameters set out by the relevant treaty instrument or instruments\").\n\n213.\n\nFinally, in *Chevron v. Ecuador III,* the tribunal made the following instructive observations:\n\n\"The practical difficulty arises from the use of the Latin phrase \u2018prima facie\u2019. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it does not mean, at this early procedural stage, that the Claimants must satisfy the Tribunal that their case, as now pleaded, would necessarily prevail on the merits if this arbitration were to proceed beyond the jurisdictional stage.\n\nNor can it mean, in a heavily adversarial procedure with both sides here making very extensive submissions and submitting numerous exhibits, that the Tribunal should only investigate the apparent surface of the Claimants\u2019 case on the merits. In other words, the jurisdictional stage of this arbitration cannot take the form of a preliminary hearing on the merits; but, conversely, the Claimants must establish that their case is sufficiently serious to proceed to a full hearing on the merits.\n\nThe Tribunal specifically rejects as imposing too high a prima facie standard the Respondent's submission at the Jurisdiction Hearing that the Claimants must already have established their case with a 51% chance of success, i.e. on a balance of probabilities [...]; and the Tribunal prefers, to this extent, the Claimants\u2019 submissions that their case should be 'decently arguable\u2019 or that it has \u2018a reasonable possibility as pleaded\u2019\".327\n\n*Chevron Corp., Texaco Petroleum Co. v. The Republic of Ecuador,* PCA Case No. 2009-23, Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 27 February 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 4.7-4.8. The tribunal added that \"the Tribunal\u2019s general approach in deciding the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections under the prima facie standard here requires an assumption of the truth of the relevant facts alleged by the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration (subject to the qualifications described above), excluding however a disputed fact uniquely relevant to the existence or exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. As to such disputed fact, the Tribunal is required either [to] finally decide the factual issue here (if it can) or address it later pursuant to Article 21.4 (second sentence) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\", \u00b6 4.11.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s attempt to distinguish the cases mentioned above from the present case must be rejected. Since the Tribunal\u2019s ambit of jurisdiction is limited to rule on disputes involving the interpretation and application of the provisions of the BIT, and the Claimant invokes the application of various provisions of the BIT, it behooves the Tribunal to assess at this stage if the facts as alleged by the Claimant are susceptible of coming within the reach of the provisions of the BIT. In this regard, whether the scope of the BIT arbitration clause is large or restricted, will not cause a difference of approach even if, in practice, the Claimant may have to show more in order to prove *prima facie* compliance with a more restrictive arbitration clause. Using the Claimant\u2019s own words, \"a determination about jurisdiction will involve an assessment of whether the dispute is of the type referred to in the arbitration clause\".328 What will vary is not that requirement but rather its extent in view of the wider or narrower ambit of that clause, even if that clause covers all disputes, *i.e.* implicitly all disputes covered by the BIT.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 24.\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that at the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must not only establish that the jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty are met, which includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, but also that it has a *prima facie* cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are capable of falling under the relevant provisions of the BIT. This standard could itself be more or less strict and for instance be phrased as \"capable of falling within the reach of the provision\" or \"susceptible of constituting a breach of the provision\". It is, however, not necessary to decide on this issue and applying the more expansive approach outlined above results in a test that, in this arbitration, will strike a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage,329 and a less exacting standard which would confer excessive weight to the Claimant\u2019s own characterization of its claims.\n\nFor instance, the ICJ held that \"[i]n the present phase it concerns the competence of the Court to hear and pronounce upon this dispute. This issue being thus limited, the Court will avoid not only all expression of opinion on matters of substance, but also any pronouncement which might prejudge or appear to prejudge any eventual decision on the merits\". *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland),* Judgment, Jurisdiction of the Court, 2 February 1973, I.C.J. Report 1973, \u00b6 12. *See also:* *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

First, the facts alleged by the Claimant are in principle accepted to be true *pro tern,* without prejudice to any further examination of the same facts which may be relevant at a further stage of the proceedings.330 To paraphrase *Salini v. Jordan,* the Claimant is free to advance facts it relies upon and claims it advances in the way it thinks appropriate.331 That facts are assumed to be true for jurisdictional purposes derives from the circumstance that the Claimant filed one submission containing allegations of fact and law relevant for the merits, and the Respondent only filed submissions relating to its jurisdictional objections. Hence, the Parties have not had a proper opportunity to provide the Tribunal with their views on the pertinence of the facts alleged by the Claimant so far, and even less to supply evidence about such facts.\n\nIt is to be noted that the Respondent agreed that for jurisdictional purposes it was willing to accept that the Tribunal regard the facts as alleged by the Claimant to be true *pro tern,* thus defusing any controversy over facts for the present exercise. *See* Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 73, citing the separate opinion of Judge Higgins in: *Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Report 1996, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, p. 226, \u00b6 32 **(Exh. RLA-17)** **.**\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A, v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 9 November 2004, \u00b6 136.\n\n217.\n\nSecond, the onus is on the Claimant to show that the substantive BIT provision which is relied upon is susceptible of finding application to the alleged facts. In other words, the claim as formulated by the Claimant must be capable of coming within the reach of the relevant provision. As recalled in *Siemens,* the Tribunal is not called upon to enquire at this stage whether the claims made under the Treaty are well founded, as this issue is properly reserved for the merits.332\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, \u00b6 180.\n\n218.\n\nWhile the Tribunal thought it inappropriate to include a concreteness requirement into its analysis on the existence of legal dispute, it is of the view that greater weight should be given to such a criterion at this juncture. As stated by the tribunal in *AES v. Argentina,* the Claimant must raise in its claims \"some legal issues in relation with a concrete situation\" and the Tribunal\u2019s determination must have \"some practical and concrete consequences\".333 Indeed, it seems appropriate for the Claimant to show that the facts it alleges are connected in law to the provisions it relies on to obtain relief and that a pronouncement of this Tribunal would clarify the legal situation between the Parties.\n\n*AES Corporation v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, 26 April 2005, \u00b6 44 **(Exh. RLA-9)** **.**\n\n219.\n\nWhereas the Respondent only challenged the existence of a dispute regarding Achmea\u2019s expropriation claim, the Respondent objected to all of Achmea\u2019s claims on the ground that they manifestly lack legal merit. The Tribunal will therefore now engage in the analysis of each claim separately.\n\n220.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal wishes to refer to the Swiss Federal Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence on so-called \"facts having double relevance\", namely those facts that a tribunal may have to subsume both at the jurisdictional and the merits stages of a dispute resolution procedure. That doctrine allows courts and tribunals to uphold jurisdiction if the facts as presented by the claimant are reasonably probable. However, this doctrine will not apply in arbitration given that it would be \"excluded to force a party to be bound by what a tribunal should decide on its disputed rights and obligations if a binding arbitration agreement is not covering them\".334 The Parties have rightly not referred to this case law which might not apply to investment disputes, even when seated in Switzerland. Moreover, the issue here is not whether the arbitration agreement does indeed bind the Parties or whether it would extend to disputes about expropriation or the other alleged breaches but rather whether, *prima facie,* there are established facts which raise arguable issues under the BIT. In other words, the actual dispute goes to legal matters rather than factual differences.\n\n*See, e.g.,* FT 121 III 495.\n\n**b)** ***The expropriation claim (Article 5 of the BIT)***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nIn its Statement of Claim, the Claimant requested the Tribunal:\n\n\"to order the Slovak Republic to refrain from expropriating Achmea\u2019s investment in the Slovak Republic on the terms of the Project Plan or materially similar terms, subject to a financial penalty in an amount to be specified in the course of the arbitral proceedings\".335\n\nSoC, \u00b6 228(i).\n\n222.\n\nWhile Achmea argues that it is entitled to the relief it seeks, *i.e.* (i) an order enjoining the Slovak Republic to refrain from expropriating Achmea\u2019s investment \"on the terms of the Project Plan or materially similar terms\" and (ii) subject to a financial penalty, the Respondent objects first, that Achmea\u2019s claim is premature, because its investment was not expropriated and thus patently fails to survive the *prima facie* test, and secondly, that the relief sought is impermissible. For the Respondent, the facts as alleged are incapable of constituting a breach of Article 5.\n\n223.\n\nOn the one hand, Achmea claims that if the expropriation were to be carried out \"on the terms of the Project Plan or materially similar terms\" it *would* breach Article 5 of the Treaty. On the other hand, Achmea submits that Article 5 contains a general prohibition to expropriate Dutch assets, thus entitling Achmea to seek arbitral review of the expropriation process initiated by the Slovak Republic. More specifically, Achmea submits that the Slovak Republic can only expropriate its assets if the Slovak Republic states a valid public purpose; a failure to do so would warrant arbitral review.\n\n224.\n\nIn light of the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal is faced with the question of whether Achmea\u2019s expropriation claim is capable of falling within the provisions of the Treaty. Obviously, it cannot be said, and no one contends, that expropriation is *per se* extraneous to the Treaty; quite to the contrary, Article 5 of the Treaty specifically deals with the issue of expropriation, and sets a specific standard to be observed by the Contracting Parties.\n\n225.\n\nBut the way in which the Claimant has formulated its expropriation claim leads the Tribunal to engage in two lines of legal inquiry. First, the Tribunal must ascertain whether Article 5 can be interpreted as containing a general prohibition to expropriate, as argued by the Claimant, or whether it circumscribes the right to expropriate to specific conditions, as argued by the Respondent. In light of the response given to this preliminary question, the Tribunal will then be in a position to ascertain whether Achmea\u2019s claim is capable of coming within the reach of that provision.\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware that the interpretation of Article 5 is a matter which could be dealt with at the merits stage. On the one hand, the Tribunal recalls that it is empowered to join the present objection to the merits pursuant to Article 21(4) *in fine* of the UNCITRAL Rules. This would be the appropriate course if the objection did not possess an exclusively preliminary character or if rendering a decision on the jurisdictional objection would entail the risk of prejudging the merits.336 An apposite example here is *Tradex Hellas,* where the tribunal joined the jurisdictional objection relating to the expropriation claim to the merits. It stated that:\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that the question of whether the alleged conduct of Albania can be considered an expropriation is on one hand relevant under Art. 8 (2) for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and is on the other hand the decisive issue relevant under Articles 4 and 5 of the 1993 Law or Articles 9 and 10 of the 1992 Law to decide on the merits of Tradex\u2019s claim. At least it cannot be excluded that under certain circumstances it would be considered an expropriation if a state permits the deprivation of land use from a joint venture based on foreign investment or fails to grant protection against interference if a legal duty for protection can be found to exist. But the Tribunal feels a further examination of this matter in the context of establishing jurisdiction according to Art. 8 (2) would be so closely related to the further examination of the merits in this case that this jurisdictional examination should be joined to the merits\".337\n\n*Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway,* P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 75, Order of 30 June 1938, p. 56; *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

For instance, in the *ICAO Council* case, the ICJ indicated that:\n\n\"many cases before the Court have shown that although a decision on jurisdiction can never directly decide any question of merits, the issues involved may be by no means divorced from the merits. A jurisdictional decision may often have to touch upon the latter or at least involve some consideration of them. This illustrates the importance of the jurisdictional stage of a case, and the influence it may have on the eventual decision on the merits\".338\n\n*Appeal Relating to the Jurisdiction of the ICAO Council,* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1972, \u00b6 18(c).\n\n229.\n\nIn the *South West Africa* cases, the ICJ held that:\n\n\"It may occur that a judgment on a preliminary objection touches on a point of merits, but this it can do only in a provisional way, to the extent necessary for deciding the question raised by the preliminary objection\".339\n\n*South West Africa, Second Phase,* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1966, \u00b6 59.\n\n230.\n\nThe *Certain German interests in Polish Upper Silesia* case, on which both Parties relied in their submissions, is particularly apposite here. In that case, the PCIJ had to decide whether a notification of the intent to expropriate fell within the ambit of its jurisdiction. The Court found that the jurisdictional enquiry may indeed impinge on the merits, while at the same time stressing that it did not purport to make a definitive finding on the merits :\n\n\"The Court, therefore, for the purposes of the decision for which it is now asked, considers that it must proceed to the enquiry above referred to, even if this enquiry involves touching upon subjects belonging to the merits of the case; it is, however, to be clearly understood that nothing which the Court says in the present judgment can be regarded as restricting its entire freedom to estimate the value of any arguments advanced by either side on the same subjects during the proceedings on the merits\".340\n\n*Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6, Preliminary Objections, 25 August 1925, pp. 15-16 **(Exh. C-88)** **.**\n\n231.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal now engages in its analysis of the Parties\u2019 respective positions in order to determine whether the claim, as articulated by Claimant, is capable of falling under Article 5 of the BIT. This provision provides as follows:\n\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\na) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\nb) the measures are not discriminatory;\n\nc) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without any undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants\".341\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 5 **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 5 enshrines the right of each Contracting State to expropriate the investment of nationals of the other Contracting State, subject to the conditions specified therein. Since no expropriation has taken place, Article 5 cannot serve as a foundation of Achmea\u2019s claim, nor of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n233.\n\nIf the Respondent\u2019s interpretation were correct, there is no doubt that the Tribunal would not have the power at this time to entertain Achmea\u2019s expropriation claim and would have to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection on this point. A series of arbitral decisions confirm that tribunals have not been willing to uphold jurisdiction in cases where the expropriation claim was premature. In *Mariposa Development Company v. Panama,* the tribunal held, as a matter of \"practical common sense\", that an expropriation claim only becomes ripe and actionable once the expropriation had been enforced. It was not sufficient to attack an enacted piece of legislation seeking the expropriation of foreign-held assets.\n\n\"Practical common sense indicates that the mere passage of an act under which private property may later be expropriated without compensation by judicial or executive action should not at once create an international claim on behalf of every alien property holder in the country. There should be a locus penitentiae for diplomatic representation and executive forbearance, and claims should arise only when actual confiscation follows\".342\n\n*Mariposa Development Company (Panama/USA),* 6 R.I.A.A. 338, 27 June 1933, p. 341 **(Exh. RLA-10)** **.**\n\n234.\n\nWhile it is true that this decision is more than 80 years old, which is apparent from the central role accorded to diplomatic representations, the general principle underlying the decision, i.e. that an expropriation claim only becomes ripe once the taking has occurred, has been followed with approval by various other tribunals. In *Aminoil,* the tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s attempt to challenge a law nationalizing Aminoil\u2019s oil concession. It found that it could only entertain an expropriation claim after some concrete steps had been taken:\n\n\"[T]he possibility (prior to the issuing of Decree No. 124) of seizing an arbitral tribunal with the particular question over which the Parties had failed to come to an understanding [...] did not exist, because unless and until the Government took some concrete step - such as nationalization - in consequence of that failure, there would have been no definite complaint with which to seize any arbitral tribunal\".343\n\n*Aminoil v. Kuwait,* Final Award, 24 March 1982, 21 I.L.M. 976, p. 1026 **(Exh. RLA-11)** **.**\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Glamis Gold* also had no hesitation to hold that mere threats of an expropriation are not sufficient to warrant arbitral review under the Article 1110 NAFTA:\n\n\"In the determination of whether the Tribunal has subject matter jurisdiction to decide the Article 1110 claims before it, the Tribunal begins from the premise that a finding of expropriation requires that a governmental act has breached an obligation under Chapter 11 and such breach has resulted in loss or damage. NAFTA Article 1117(1) establishes standing for an investor of a State Party to bring a claim for harm done to its subsidiary in the territory of another State Party under the investment provisions of Chapter 11.\n\nThrough the language of Article 1117(1), the State Parties conceived of a ripeness requirement in that a claimant needs to have incurred loss or damage in order to bring a claim for compensation under Article 1120. Claims only arise under NAFTA Article 1110 when actual confiscation follows, and thus mere threats of expropriation or nationalization are not sufficient to make such a claim ripe; for an Article 1110 claim to be ripe, the governmental act must have directly or indirectly taken a property interest resulting in actual present harm to an investor\".344\n\n*Glamis Gold v. United States,* UNCITRAL, Award, 8 June 2009, \u00b6 328 **(Exh. RLA-12)** **.**\n\n236.\n\nThis line of cases is unanimous in holding that an expropriation claim is too hypothetical, and thus premature as long as no taking has occurred. The fact that the *Glamis* case was arbitrated under NAFTA rules, which specifically require an allegation of a breach of a NAFTA rule and also to have suffered a loss or damage in order to bring a claim for compensation, does not change the fundamental principle that an expropriation claim only becomes ripe if concrete steps have been taken which have the effect of a taking.\n\n237.\n\nIn the present case, the Slovak Republic has engaged in a process of unification of the Slovak health insurance sector. While the sector was liberalized in 2004, allowing foreign investors such as Achmea to enter the market, subsequent Governments have struggled with the question of how to regulate the health insurance sector efficiently. The present Government announced during its election campaign and when taking power in the Spring of 2012 that it would unitize the health insurance market. On that basis, it launched the political process through an Intention Statement in July 2012, setting out the general lines of the process. In October 2012, the Project Plan was adopted, which contemplates a voluntary sale process, and if that fails the expropriation of Union. In the Project Plan, the Slovak Government tasked the Ministry of Health to prepare a draft law setting out the regulatory framework of the unitization process. A draft Transformation Act was purportedly prepared in July 2013. The Tribunal is not apprised, at the time of issuing its ruling on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, of the exact stage at which the unitization process is, but it does not seem that this draft law has even been circulated for preliminary comments by the Ministry of Health to other involved ministries.\n\n238.\n\nAs the Slovak Republic has made abundantly clear in its submissions, the process is still in its infancy stages, since no draft bill has as of yet been submitted to the Slovak legislature.345 Hence, at this moment, it is still entirely speculative if, when, and under which conditions the purported expropriation of Achmea\u2019s investment is to take place. Under these conditions, if the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 5 is correct, i.e. a provision enshrining the principled right of the Slovak Republic to expropriate Dutch-held assets, subject to specific conditions, the fulfillment of which could be reviewed by an arbitral tribunal once an expropriation has occurred, then the Tribunal would have to find that it lacks jurisdiction over the present claim.\n\nThe Respondent indicated the following on the current status of the Project Plan: \"Project Plan is at the earliest stage of the legislative process. It *may or may not* approximate the terms of a future draft bill, which *may or may not* be enacted into a law by the Slovak Parliament through a standard democratic process. It is not known whether and, if so, how an administrative authority authorized by such a law would carry it out\". *See,* Objections, \u00b6 42; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1-8.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimant has, however, put forward an interpretation of Article 5, which would, if upheld, allow the Tribunal to review the conformity of the expropriation process as it advances, prior to the actual taking. To be clear, the Claimant has not put forward a claim of an actual taking. It remains in full control of its investment. It is the Claimant\u2019s primary contention that it wants to remain in possession and control of its investment, which explains why it seeks an injunction from the Tribunal ordering the Respondent to refrain from expropriating Achmea\u2019s investment, subject to a financial penalty in case of non-compliance.\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimant submits the following interpretation of Article 5 of the Treaty. The negative formulation of Article 5 suggests that this provision prohibits each Contracting State to expropriate the assets held by a national of the other Contracting State, unless specific conditions are all met.\n\n\"The Slovak Republic\u2019s interpretation of a rule prescribing 'X shall not do Y, unless [ ]\u2019 as in fact meaning \u2018X has the right to do Y\u2019 goes beyond the most creative interpretation techniques\".346\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 43.\n\n241.\n\nHad the Contracting States intended to recognize a right to expropriate, they could have used clear and affirmative language. Instead, they sought to devise a \"regime\" treating their respective investors more favorably than other aliens \"in line with the BIT\u2019S purpose which is the \u2018encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments\u2019\".347 In light thereof, the Claimant argues that the Project Plan fails to state any public interest which would warrant engaging in the process of expropriation. Failing to do so gives Achmea a cause of action under Article 5 to make sure that the expropriation process as contemplated in the Project Plan, or any other plan on materially similar terms, is halted by the present Tribunal.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 45.\n\n242.\n\nFor this interpretation of Article 5, based up to here on the wording of the provision and object and purpose of the BIT, the Claimant additionally relies on two external elements. First, the Claimant calls attention to *Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia,348* where the PCIJ \"found that a publication of the Polish Government\u2019s intent to expropriate was sufficient to render a claim to \u2018obtain an order suspending expropriation proceedings and a declaration that such proceedings are illegal\u2019 admissible\".349\n\n*Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6, Preliminary Objections, 25 August 1925 **(Exh. C-88)** **.** *See also`. Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 7, Merits, 25 May 1926 **(Exh. C-89)** **.**\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 38 (footnote omitted).\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant also pointed to the dispute settlement provision of the Austria-Slovak Republic BIT, which was under scrutiny in *Euram Bank,* and where it was held that this provision limits the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to disputes concerning the amount of payment of a compensation.350 Since Article 8 of the present BIT extends to \"all disputes\", and is not limited to the payment of compensation, the Claimant argues that the present Tribunal is empowered to review the expropriation process (as contemplated in the Project Plan) before the taking actually takes place, and, if need be, order the Respondent to refrain from expropriating Achmea\u2019s investment.\n\nTr. 106:14-107:5.\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find the Claimant\u2019s argumentation to be persuasive. General customary international law recognizes the sovereign prerogative of States to regulate the economic activities taking place in their territory. The international community of States recognized in General Assembly Resolution 1803(XVII) on \"Permanent Sovereignty Over Natural Resource\" of 14 December 1962 the sovereign right of States to expropriate foreign-held assets in their territory, if the expropriation is made in the public interest, according to due process of law, and against compensation. The resolution provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Nationalization, expropriation or requisitioning shall be based on grounds or reasons of public utility, security or the national interest which are recognized as overriding purely individual or private interests, both domestic and foreign. In such cases the owner shall be paid appropriate compensation, in accordance with the rules in force in the State taking such measures in the exercise of its sovereignty and in accordance with international law\".351\n\nGeneral Assembly Resolution 1803(XVII) on Permanent Sovereignty Over Natural Resources, 14 December 1962, \u00b6 4.\n\n245.\n\nThis right, which the Tribunal considers to be strongly established in customary international law, has been recalled in numerous international instruments, most notably milestone resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is true that the exact scope of the requirements which make an expropriation lawful have been hotly debated in the past decades, but the core principle under international customary law has remained untouched, i.e. that a State may expropriate foreign-held assets.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the prevalent view, the sovereign prerogative to expropriate foreign-held assets was confirmed and further specified in bilateral investment treaties adopted since the 1960s and other instruments dealing with the same subject matter. Bilateral investment treaties further specify for instance that expropriation may not be discriminatory and they clarify what standard of compensation is to be adopted. To the knowledge of the Tribunal, it has never been argued that the negative formulation employed in the expropriation clauses contained in most BITs, and indeed also in Article 5 of the present Treaty, entails an express reversal, as opposed to a specification, of the customary right of States to expropriate foreign-held assets located in their territory. The Tribunal does not believe it to be the case here either.\n\n247.\n\nA negative formulation of the right to expropriate is commonly adopted in a wide range of bilateral investment treaties, not to prohibit expropriation, but more appropriately strictly to circumscribe that right to the requirements set out in these provisions. In this regard, the *Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia* case must be distinguished.352 That case turned in part around the interpretation of Article 15 of the Germano-Polish Convention concerning Upper Silesia of 15 May 1922, which required the Polish Government to give notice of its intention to expropriate a \"large estate\", as defined under the Convention, prior to a specified date. Without going into the details, Germany argued that ten notices of the Polish Government had not been made in conformity with Articles 9(3)(2), 12(1), 13(2) and 17 of the Convention, *inter alia* arguing that several estates were not liable to expropriation, because they did not fulfill the requirements set out in these provisions.353 Besides holding that there was an \"undeniable difference of opinion\" on the proper interpretation of these provisions (and thus falling within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 23 of the Convention), the Court held Poland\u2019s objection to be ill-founded, since Article 20 and 16 of the Convention entailed that once a notice of expropriation was issued, the assets could no longer be freely alienated, thus placing a serious restriction on property rights. Having concrete legal effects, the notice came within the jurisdictional purview of the Court.\n\n\"The Polish objection is not sound, not only because the right of complaint granted by Poland to the owners is a matter of domestic concern which cannot be used in argument against Germany, but also because, according to Article 20, directly notice has been given, expropriation is possible under the Geneva Convention without any restriction as to time, and thus becomes for the owner a menace which may continue for two years; and finally because under the terms of the same Article 20 and of Article 16, once notice has been given, the owner cannot without the consent of the Polish Government, alienate *inter vivos* either the estate to be expropriated or its accessories, so that the giving of notice places serious restrictions on rights of ownership\".354\n\n*Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6, Preliminary Objections, 25 August 1925, p. 11 **(Exh. C-88)** **.** *See also: Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 7, Merits, 25 May 1926, p. 24 **(Exh. C-89)** **.**\n\n*Polish Upper Silesia,* P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 6, Preliminary Objections, 25 August 1925, p. 22 **(Exh. C-88)** **.**\n\n*Id.,* pp. 25-26.\n\n248.\n\nThere are thus three fundamental differences between that case and the present one. First, the Germano-Polish Convention expressly, and very specifically categorized various properties according to their destination, their size, and their ownership. Properties fulfilling certain characteristics could expressly be expropriated (subject to certain conditions), while others were a *contrario* excluded from the various regimes designed in that Convention. In the present case, there is no language allowing to discern a specific expropriation regime set out in the Treaty beyond the general requirements deriving from customary international law. Second, the Germano-Polish Convention mandates the notification of an intention of expropriation, an obligation the observance of which would normally fall under the power of review of the Court under Article 23 of the Convention. No such specific requirement is to be found in the Treaty presently under review. Finally, and most importantly, a notice of the intention to expropriate carries an important legal consequence with it under the GermanoPolish Convention, i.e. that the owner who has been put on notice can no longer alienate his property without the consent of the Polish Government. Here again, no such legal consequence is expressed or implied in the BIT. The Claimant indicated at the hearing that the announcement of the Intention Statement and the Project Plan, as well as the adoption of the latter, had the consequence of grossly hindering its ability to sell its investment to a willing buyer at a fair market value. Whatever the merits of that argument, the Tribunal can only observe first, that such a hindrance would not in general qualify as a taking, i.e. an expropriation, and second, that an alleged *de facto* impediment is not to be equaled with a *de jure* impediment, only the latter being susceptible of judicial or arbitral review. For these reasons, the Tribunal does not find the *Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia* case to support the Claimant\u2019s argument.\n\n249.\n\nAs regards the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the Austria-Slovak Republic BIT, it patently fails in all respects. It does not follow from the fact that in that BIT the jurisdiction of a tribunal is limited to the amount of compensation, thus excluding even a review of the lawfulness of the expropriation itself, that an expropriation provision as formulated in Article 5 of the Treaty automatically empowers the Tribunal, absent more specific language, to review the stated intention or the possible, yet hypothetical, process of expropriation in which the Slovak Republic seemingly engaged.\n\n250.\n\nFinally, the Claimant has also sought to convince the Tribunal of its position by stating that the Slovak Republic announced its intention to expropriate Achmea\u2019s investment, while at the same time failing to provide a public interest justifying such course of action. The Tribunal does not need to, and cannot, make any finding on the existence of a public interest supporting the Slovak Government\u2019s expressed will to unify its health insurance system, as indeed that would impinge on the merits. However, it must make an assessment of whether Article 5 mandates the Respondent to state a public interest at the outset of the political process eventually leading to the adoption of a piece of legislation contemplating the expropriation of Achmea\u2019s investment. On its face, Article 5 does not mandate such an obligation on the part of the Slovak Republic. The Tribunal reads Article 5 to mean on its face that if the expropriation is to be considered lawful, it must have been made in pursuance of a public interest and that analysis is an exercise to be undertaken once the expropriation has occurred. As rightly pointed out by the Respondent, the Slovak Republic acknowledges so much in its Project Plan, where it is stated that:\n\n\"A law will define the expropriation objective and conditions. The expropriation objective will be to achieve, in the public interest, the acquisition of title to the Expropriated Assets for implementing the objective of introducing unitary model into health insurance. The expropriation process will only take place provided that the expropriation objective could not be reached by agreement with a shareholder of the non-State insurer, *and the expropriation will be possible only to achieve the objective (set by law) and in the public interest, which would need to be proven in the expropriation proceedings in a manner prescribed by law\"* (emphasis added).355\n\nProject of Implementation of Unitary Public Health Insurance System in the Slovak Republic, p. 39 **(Exh. C-19)** **.**\n\n251.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has failed to state a *prima facie* case for its Article 5 claim. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s objection is upheld. This conclusion is all the more important, since, in its view, the Tribunal is not empowered to intervene in the democratic process of a sovereign State, and cannot do so absent very specific language to that effect. The design and implementation of its public healthcare policy is for the State alone to assess and the State must balance the different and sometimes competing interests, such as its duty to ensure appropriate healthcare to its population and its duty to honor its international investment protection commitments. The Tribunal is being invited to engage in a speculative exercise, looking into the future to examine a State conduct that has not yet materialized and whose features may not be determined with certainty at this stage. The Tribunal concludes that that is impermissible under the BIT and thus falls outside the ambit of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**c)** ***The non-expropriation claim (Article 3 of the BIT)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the Claimant filed various Article 3 claims, as argued by the Respondent, or whether it filed a single claim encompassing a succession of facts. Regarding its submissions under Article 3 of the BIT, the Claimant requested the Tribunal:\n\n\"(ii) to declare that the Slovak Republic has breached Article 3 of the BIT through conduct related to the impending expropriation of Achmea\u2019s investment; and\n\n(iii) to declare that the Slovak Republic has breached Article 3 of the BIT by continuously destabilizing the regulatory and investment environment in the Slovak health care sector\".356\n\nSoC, \u00b6 228(ii)-(iii).\n\n253.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent indicated that, in its view, Achmea asserted three Article 3 claims in its Statement of Claim:\n\n\"[First], Achmea claims that Slovakia *\u2018denied Achmea\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment, and has impaired it by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, by repeatedly communicating its desire to expropriate Union during the 2012 client acquisition campaign.\u2019*\n\n[Second], Achmea seems to claim that Slovakia violated Article 3 of the Treaty through the alleged recent conduct of the State-owned health insurance company *Vseobecn\u00e1 Zdravotn\u00e1 Poist'ovna* (\"VsZP\") vis-\u00e0-vis the Association of Slovak Hospitals (\"ASH\").\n\n[Third], Achmea claims that Slovakia denied Achmea fair and equitable treatment by failing to provide a stable and predictable regulatory framework because of statements that it wishes to reintroduce a unitary health insurance system\".357\n\nObjections, \u00b6 78.\n\n254.\n\nIt may not be indispensable to determine whether the Claimant filed several discrete Article 3 claims or whether these could be subsumed as a single claim. It remains certain that, in a single arbitration proceeding, the Claimant is praying for a unitary relief basing its unitary request on three (or four) allegedly discrete sets of facts. Whether such sets of facts are examined separately or as a possible general pattern of the Respondent\u2019s conduct is going more to the presentation of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis than to its substance, namely the merits of the claim(s): the Tribunal is of the view that Achmea lodged a single Article 3 claim comprising four separate limbs.\n\nFirst, Achmea claims that \"[i]f carried out, the process under which Achmea would be asked to \u2018voluntarily sell\u2019 its investment to the Slovak Republic violates Article 3(1) of the BIT\".358 Second, Achmea claims that the Slovak Republic \"denied Achmea\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment, and has impaired it by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, by repeatedly communicating its desire to expropriate Union during the 2012 client acquisition campaign\".359 Third, Achmea claims that \"the Slovak Republic\u2019s many statements since 2006 [and] intentions are incompatible with the requirement of fair and equitable treatment as expressed in Article 3 of the BIT\" to ensure a stable and predictable legal framework.360 Fourth, Achmea claims that the conduct of VsZP in relation to Union\u2019s contractual arrangements with the State-owned hospitals is attributable to the Slovak Republic and is in breach of Article 3 of the Treaty.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 190.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 195.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 201.\n\n255.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those investors\".361\n\nNetherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, Article 3(1) **(Exh. C-1)** **.**\n\n256.\n\nThe validity of these four limbs of Achmea\u2019s Article 3 claim, based on a *prima facie* assessment of the facts as exposed by the Claimant, may better and will be assessed separately. The first limb of the claim relates to the voluntary sale process contemplated in the Project Plan. In light of the Parties\u2019 pleadings, the Tribunal need not spend much time on this first limb. Indeed, the Claimant did not expand any further on this particular issue beyond its Statement of Claim. The Tribunal understands the Claimant\u2019s argument to be that the voluntary sale process as contemplated in the Project Plan *would* violate Article 3 of the Treaty, and not that a Treaty breach has already occurred.362 As such, this part of the claim fails to meet the *prima facie* test. The Tribunal further notes that the Claimant has not provided any evidence suggesting that the process has been set in motion so that this claim would fail in any circumstances.\n\nSoC, \u00b6 190. The Claimant entitled the section relating to this particular claim: \"Violations in respect of the contemplated \u2018voluntary sale\u2019 process\"; but then immediately argues that *if carried out,* the voluntary sale process \"violates Article 3(1) of the BIT\".\n\n257.\n\nThere remains, however, one argument to be addressed in this connection and thus at this juncture. The Claimant indicates that the Project Plan contemplates the commencement of the voluntary sale process after the 2013 acquisition campaign, but on the basis of a number of clients stabilized at the level of the 2012 acquisition campaign. This circumstance \"would clearly disadvantage Achmea\" since it traditionally gained market share during acquisition campaigns.363 Here again, this argument fails since Achmea has not alleged that such a measure has been put into effect. The mere fact that the Project Plan envisages such a scenario is insufficient to meet the *prima facie* test. Thus, the Claimant\u2019s proffered set of facts would be insufficient to constitute an actual breach of the Treaty standard. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that this part of the claim falls outside of its jurisdiction.\n\nSoC, \u00b6192.\n\n258.\n\nThe second and third limbs of Achmea\u2019s claim relate to announcements, as well as several measures, which the Slovak Republic came up with in connection with its intention to expropriate Achmea\u2019s investment. According to the Claimant, the Slovak Republic engaged in unreasonable and discriminatory measures which allegedly harmed Achmea\u2019s investment, notably \"by repeatedly communicating its desire to expropriate Union during the 2012 client acquisition campaign\",364 thus impacting Union\u2019s business, especially the number of clients it could have attracted had such announcements not been made. In this regard, the Claimant points to (i) the Intention Statement, (ii) the Project Plan, (iii) various statements of public officials, and (iv) two governmental resolutions approving respectively the Intention Statement and the Project Plan.365 The Claimant complains that the Intention Statement puts a certain level of blame on private health insurers for the low life expectancy in the Slovak Republic, thus setting in train the process of driving Achmea out of the health insurance market.366 The Claimant complains further that the Project Plan was published in the last week of the acquisition campaign, thus willfully harming Achmea\u2019s attempts to gain more market share. Finally, as regards the statements made in the Slovak press, the Claimant points to various statements of high-ranking officials who publicly affirmed that the political decision to create a unitary health insurance system had been taken and was irreversible. The Claimant also refers to a press interview given by the Prime Minister, Mr. Robert Fico, where he stated that \"in practice this means that private health insurers D\u00f4vera and Union should leave the Slovak market\".367\n\nSoC, \u00b6195.\n\nGovernment Resolution No. 383, 25 July 2012 **(Exh. C-14)** **;** and Governement Resolution No. 606, 31 October 2012 **(Exh. C-27)** **.**\n\nSoC, \u00b6 87.\n\nPress article by Sme entitled \"There will be only one health insurer! The government cabinet approved it\", 25 July 2012 **(Exh. C-15)** **.**\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent qualifies this claim to be \"ancillary\" to the expropriation claim, and therefore not to be entertained by the Tribunal.368 This is especially so because preparatory work of an internationally wrongful act, which the proposed expropriation by no means purports to be, is in any circumstances not unlawful under international law. In addition, the Respondent argues that mere intentions or political statements in the midst of a democratic process cannot be the basis of an Article 3 claim.\n\nThat said, the Respondent understands that the factual basis for the Article 5 and Article 3 claims are fundamentally different: \"I ask the tribunal to remember what Achmea has said about its claims. Their claim under article 3 of the treat[y], the fair and equitable claim, is based on events that have purportedly already occurred. In contrast, their article 5 claim, expropriation, is based on events that have not occurred\". Tr. 10:23-11:4.\n\n260.\n\nWhile no expropriation of Union has yet taken place, it is clear that the matters upon which the Claimant relies in support of the second and third limbs of its Article 3 claim, based on an alleged breach of the FET standard, have already occurred. Both the second and third limbs are based upon declarations and statements made by Slovak officials, as well as two resolutions, regarding the intention to create a unitary health insurance system, and which anticipate an eventual expropriation of Union. The Tribunal accepts that, in certain circumstances, conduct of a State in anticipation of an expropriation might amount to a breach of its obligation to respect the FET standard. For the reasons developed below and on the basis of a *prima facie* review of the evidence filed by the Claimant, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this is such a case.\n\n261.\n\nThe announcements made by, and on behalf of, the Slovak Republic did not amount to more than expressions of intent, which had yet to be made effectual. In particular, these announcements required to be translated into legislation and in any event, were premised on the basis that were an expropriation to result, it would be made with due respect to the compensation terms of the BIT. As regards the Intention Statement, it discusses the possibilities of introducing a unitary public health care system in the Slovak Republic, *inter alia* in light of EU law and the right to protection of investments.369 In this latter regard, the Intention Statement indicates that any potential expropriation of Union would have to comply with the conditions set out in the BIT, amongst which paying \"fair compensation without undue delay\".370 Similarly, the Project Plan sets out the general framework for the contemplated implementation of a unitary public health insurance system in the Slovak Republic.371 An eventual expropriation of non-State owned health insurers is contemplated as a measure of last resort to be adopted in conformity with the Slovak Constitution and international law.372\n\nProposal of intention to introduce a unitary system of public health insurance in Slovakia (\"Intention Statement\"), 19 July 2012 **(Exh.C-12)** **.**\n\n*Id.,* point 2.2.\n\nProject of implementation of a unitary system of public health insurance in the Slovak Republic (\"Project Plan\"), 25 September 2012 **(Exh. C-19)** **.**\n\n*Id.,* point 3.6.\n\n262.\n\nAs regards the two resolutions referred to by the Claimant, they do not show any *prima facie* evidence of any conduct falling below the FET standard. Government Resolution No. 383 of 25 July 2012 approves \"the intention to introduce unitary public health insurance system in the Slovak Republic\".373 It also instructs the Minister of Health to prepare a project along these lines by 30 September 2012, thus denying the Claimant\u2019s argument that the publication of the Project Plan in the last week of September 2012 was willfully intended to harm Union. For its part, Government Resolution No. 606 of 31 October 2012 approving the Project Plan indicates that the implementation of the unitary system to public health insurance is to be achieved preferably through a voluntary buyout of the shares in non-State owned health insurers, or, in the last resort, through expropriation.374\n\nGovernment Resolution No. 383, 25 July 2012 **(Exh. C-14)** **.**\n\nGovernement Resolution No. 606, 31 October 2012 **(Exh. C-27)** **.**\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant has not brought either any sufficient *prima facie* evidence that the actions of the Slovak Republic preparatory to any planned taking of Union are somehow beyond any norm, which might otherwise render those preparations susceptible to attack as a breach of the State\u2019s obligations to afford fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant. The Respondent argues that the announcement of the Project Plan was \u2018a basic requirement for a transparent democratic legislative process\u2019. On the face of it, it seems to the Tribunal that the Slovak Republic has observed the formalities, however uncompromising the terms of some of the public statements of senior officials. Neither has the Claimant demonstrated enough of a case to enable the Tribunal to say that the actions and public pronouncements of the Slovak Government have been such as to destabilize the investment and regulatory environment.\n\n264.\n\nThe third limb of the claim relates to the purported regulatory instability associated with the expropriation process, most notably through the various statements made in the Slovak press and the two resolutions to which the Tribunal has referred above. *Mutatis mutandis,* this element of Claimant\u2019s Article 3 claim, as it also deals with statements made by Slovak officials and the two resolutions, calls for the same observations on the part of the Tribunal. Furthermore, as the Respondent has noted, the Claimant has been unable to refer to a single instance of regulatory change prejudicial to Achmea.\n\n265.\n\nAs a consequence, for all the reasons indicated above, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not demonstrated a *prima facie* basis for the second and third limb of its Article 3 claim.\n\n266.\n\nFinally, the fourth limb of the claim relates to the conduct of VsZP, the Association of Slovak Hospitals (\"ASH\"), and the 17 State-owned hospitals. The Respondent raises two separate issues in this regard. First, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant failed to establish a link of attribution between the Slovak Government and these State-owned entities, in particular since they do not belong to the governmental apparatus and do not exercise elements of governmental authority. Mere State-ownership is insufficient to establish attribution, and thus the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to the conduct of these entities. Second, the Respondent criticizes that the Claimant did not specify in its Statement of Claim which conduct of the State-owned hospitals would breach the Treaty. Since the Tribunal must assess its jurisdiction at the time of the Statement of Claim, it should disregard any alleged facts subsequent to the Statement of Claim, in particular the meeting of 17 hospitals on 26 June 2013 and various statements of the Minister of Health brought to the attention of the Tribunal on 29 January 2014.\n\n267.\n\nIt is an accepted principle of international law that jurisdiction must exist on the day of the institution of proceedings. As stated by the ICJ:\n\n\"The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed\".375\n\n*Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium),* Judgment, 14 February 2002, I.C.J. Reports 2002, \u00b6 26 **(Exh. RLA-72****).** *See further.* *Nottebohm case,* Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 122 (\"Once the Court has been regularly seised, the Court must exercise its powers, as theses are defined in the Statute. After that, the expiry of the period fixed for one of the Declarations on which the Application was founded is an event which is unrelated to the exercise of the powers conferred on the Court by the Statute, which the Court must exercise whenever it has been regularly seised and whenever it has not been shown, on some other ground, that it lacks jurisdiction or that the claim is inadmissible\"); *Case concerning the right of passage over Indian Territory,* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 26 November 1957, I.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 142 (\"It is a rule of law generally accepted, as well as one acted upon in the past by the Court, that, once the Court has been validly seised of a dispute, unilateral action by the respondent State in terminating its Declaration, in whole or in part, cannot divest the Court of jurisdiction\"); *Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United Kingdom),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 27 February 1998, I.C.J. Reports 1998, \u00b6 38 (\"In accordance with its established jurisprudence, if the Court had jurisdiction on that date [filing of the Application], it continues to do so; the subsequent coming into existence of the above-mentioned resolutions cannot affect its jurisdiction once established\").\n\n268.\n\nIn the realm of investment arbitration, numerous arbitral tribunals have also indicated that jurisdiction must exist on the day of the institution of proceedings. For instance, in *Goetz v. Burundi,* the tribunal held that:\n\n\"Quant \u00e0 la competence du Tribunal et \u00e0 la recevabilit\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate, elles s\u2019appr\u00e9cient, selon le principe rappel\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment par la Cour internationale de Justice, \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate\".376\n\n*Antoine Goetz and Others v. Republic of Burundi,* ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3, Award, 10 February 1999, \u00b6 72 (\"As to the competence of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the request, they are analysed, according to the principle recently recalled by the International Court of Justice, at the date of the filing of the request\", unofficial translation). *See also'.* *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, \u00b6 178 (\"the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction which, according to the long-established jurisprudence of international tribunals of all kinds, is fixed as of the time the proceedings are commenced, and is not subject to ex *post facto* alteration\").\n\n269.\n\nAs appears from these decisions, an international tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must exist on the day of the institution of proceedings, that is, for present purposes and pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the date on which the Notice of Arbitration is received by the Respondent. It is undisputed that Achmea did not raise the conduct of VsZP or any State-owned hospitals in its Notice of Arbitration. The first time Achmea expressly mentioned VsZP and the State-owned hospitals in connection with an alleged prejudice suffered by Achmea, was in its Statement of Claim.377\n\nSoC, \u00b6\u00b6 199-200.\n\n270.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal has no difficulty in finding that the fourth limb of Achmea\u2019s Article 3 claim falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, since no specific conduct of VsZP or the State-owned hospitals is complained of in Achmea\u2019s Notice of Arbitration. Even if the Tribunal were minded to uphold jurisdiction over the fourth limb of the Article 3 claim as formulated for the first time in the Statement of Claim, that limb would nonetheless fail to satisfy the requirements of a valid claim. This derives from the fact that the Statement of Claim fails to point with sufficient specificity to any event or conduct of VsZP, or of the State-owned hospitals, having allegedly caused a prejudice to Achmea\u2019s investment.\n\n271.\n\nAs regards (i) the purported meeting held on 26 June 2013 between VsZP and several State-owned hospitals, and (ii) the rescission by several State-owned hospitals of their contracts with Union, these events postdate not only the Notice of Arbitration but also the Statement of Claim, and thus patently fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The Tribunal is further of the view that Achmea may in fact have called the Tribunal\u2019s attention in its Statement of Claim to the purported conduct of VsZP or of the State-owned hospitals in an attempt to prevent these organisms to interfere with Achmea\u2019s contractual relations with these State-owned hospitals. But this course of action is not one that this Tribunal can entertain, since it does not fall within its jurisdiction to entertain preventive actions. Indeed, the Tribunal accepts the Slovak Republic\u2019s argument that it did not consent to arbitrate disputes seeking preventive actions, but that its consent only extends to disputes dealing with alleged breaches of the BIT that have already occurred at the time of the institution of arbitral proceedings. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over the fourth limb of Achmea\u2019s claim.\n\n272.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent\u2019s objections to the claim raised by the Claimant under Article 3 of the Treaty.\n\n273.\n\nHaving found that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction on both the expropriation claim and the FET claim, it is unnecessary to address the Respondent\u2019s further objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**VI.

In addition, the Parties have advanced costs for court reporters at the jurisdictional hearing amounting to GBP 3,041.71 each, i.e. a total of GBP 6,083.42.\n\n280.\n\nThe arbitration costs advanced by the Parties thus amount to an aggregate of EUR 400,000 + GBP 6,083.42, each Party advancing half of these amounts.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal has incurred expenses in a total amount of EUR 12,809.62, including expenses for travel, lodging and bank charges.\n\n282.\n\nThe Members of the Tribunal have collectively spent a total of 474.25 hours as follows: Mr. John Beechey 105.75 hours; Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy 72 hours; and Dr. Laurent L\u00e9vy 296.5 hours. In addition, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 183.5 hours. It was agreed in paragraph 19.1 of PO1 that the Tribunal\u2019s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of CHF 700 (seven hundred Swiss francs), and that the Secretary\u2019s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of CHF 350 (three hundred and fifty Swiss francs). The total fees of the Arbitral Tribunal amount to CHF 396,200, amounting to EUR 324,549.66.\n\n283.\n\nThe PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 2,362.50 for the administration of the funds deposited by the Parties by way of advance.\n\n284.\n\nThe total costs of the proceedings are thus EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42, detailed as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Expenses for court reporters | GBP 6,083.42 |\n| Tribunal expenses | EUR 12,809.62 |\n| Tribunal fees | EUR 324,549.66 |\n| Administrative expenses | EUR 2,362.50 |\n| Total | EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42. |\n\n285.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal notes that there is a surplus of EUR 60,278.22 (i.e. EUR 400,000 + GBP 6,083.42 [total advances] less EUR 339,721.78 + GBP 6,083.42 [total arbitration costs].\n\n**C.** The Allocation of Costs\n------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nArticle 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules read as follows:\n\n\"Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\nWith respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable\".\n\n287.\n\nThe UNCITRAL Rules thus adopt the rule \"costs follow the event\" with respect to the costs of the arbitration and confer broad powers to the Tribunal in connection with the Parties\u2019 costs.\n\n288.\n\nWith respect to the costs of arbitration, the Claimant did not succeed in establishing the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal.
