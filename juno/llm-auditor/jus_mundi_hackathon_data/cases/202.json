(\"EuroGas\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the United States, and Belmont Resources Inc. (\"Belmont\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Canada (together, the \"Claimants\"). The Claimants are represented in this proceeding by Dr. Hamid Gharavi, Dr. Merced\u00e9h Azeredo da Silveira and Mr. Emmanuel Foy of the law firm Derains & Gharavi in Paris.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Slovak Republic (also referred to as the \"Respondent\"). The Respondent is represented in this proceeding by Mr. Stephen P. Anway of the law firm Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP in New York, Mr. George M. von Mehren and Mr. Alexis Martinez of Squire Patton Boggs (UK) LLP in London, Mr. Rostislav Peka\u0159 and Ms. Maria Lokajova of Squire Patton Boggs in Prague and JUDr. Ing. Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1 of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.\n\n4.\n\nThis Order sets out the Tribunal's analysis of and decision on the Claimants' application for provisional measures, submitted on 8 July 2014, and the Respondent's application for provisional measures, submitted on 10 September 2014.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 27 June 2014, the Claimants filed a request for arbitration dated 25 June 2014, together with 42 exhibits (the \"Request for Arbitration\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 8 July 2014, the Claimants submitted a letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID containing an Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Claimants' Application\"). In their letter, the Claimants requested, pursuant to Rule 39(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that the Secretary-General establish time limits for the parties to present their observations on the Claimants' Application, which could then be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, on 10 July 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and so notified the parties. At the same time, the Secretary-General provided the parties with a schedule for their written submissions on the Claimants' Application, noting that it would apply unless the parties agreed on an alternative schedule.\n\n8.\n\nFurther, in the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 July 2014, the Claimants sent a letter to the President of the European Commission, copied to the Respondent and ICSID, setting forth allegations concerning the actions of the Slovak Republic in response to the Request for Arbitration and informing the European Commission that the Claimants had filed an application for provisional measures with ICSID.\n\n10.\n\nBy an exchange of letters dated 22 and 24 July 2014, the parties agreed that the Tribunal would be composed of three members, with each party appointing one arbitrator by 29 August 2014, and the two party-appointed arbitrators jointly appointing the President of the Tribunal after consultations with the parties by 30 September 2014, failing which the appointment(s) would be made by the ICSID Secretary-General.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the briefing schedule established by the Secretary-General, on 11 August 2014, the Claimants submitted a Full Briefing on Provisional Measures, together with four exhibits and 27 legal authorities (the \"Claimants' Full Briefing\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 25 August 2014, Mr. Stephen P. Anway of Squire Patton Boggs informed ICSID that his firm had been retained to represent the Respondent in this proceeding, and provided the corresponding power of attorney.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the parties' agreed method of appointment, on 29 August 2014, each party appointed an arbitrator. The Claimants appointed Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, a national of France, and the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, also a national of France. Both arbitrators subsequently accepted their appointments.\n\n14.\n\nOn 10 September 2014, the Respondent submitted its Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, together with 62 exhibits and 13 legal authorities (the \"Respondent's Application and Answer\").\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 11 September 2014, ICSID acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's Application and Answer, and informed the parties that they were welcome to agree on a schedule for the parties to present their observations on the Respondent's Application, or alternatively, either party could request the Secretary-General of ICSID to establish such a schedule pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5).\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, the parties informed ICSID that they had agreed upon a briefing schedule for the exchange of written submissions on both parties' applications for provisional measures, and ICSID acknowledged the parties' agreement by letter of the same date. The parties informed ICSID on 30 September 2014 that they had agreed to an amended schedule for the parties' written submissions on provisional measures and for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with this agreed schedule, the parties filed the following submissions:\n\na. Claimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures dated 16 October 2014, including 11 exhibits and 73 legal authorities;\n\nb. Respondent's Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures dated 21 November 2014, including 17 exhibits and 10 legal authorities; and\n\nc. Claimants' Rejoinder on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures dated 22 December 2014, including 9 exhibits and 23 legal authorities.\n\n18.\n\nRegarding the constitution of the Tribunal, on 20 October 2014, ICSID informed the parties that the party-appointed arbitrators proposed to appoint Professor Pierre Mayer, a national of France, to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nOn 24 October 2014, the Respondent made a disclosure concerning its counsel's relationship with Professor Mayer in a separate case, and on this basis, the Claimants objected to his proposed appointment. In light of this objection, on 4 November 2014, Professor Mayer declined to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nAt this stage, as the parties' agreed deadline for the party-appointed arbitrators to appoint the President had elapsed, the parties agreed to an alternative appointment procedure by letters of 7 November 2014. Under this procedure, the ICSID Secretary-General would provide the parties with a list of candidates from which the parties would strike one candidate and rank those remaining. The Secretary-General would then appoint the candidate with the best ranking. On 1 December 2014, ICSID provided the parties with a list of candidates.\n\n21.\n\nThe appointment procedure was postponed by agreement of the parties on 2 and 24 December 2014 and 1 and 8 January 2015, and the list of candidates was amended on 19 and 23 December 2014. Before the procedure was completed, on 13 January 2015, the parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to appoint Professor Pierre Mayer as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n22.\n\nProfessor Mayer accepted his appointment on 20 January 2015. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nOn 23 January 2015, the Respondent sought leave to enter an additional legal authority into the record, and the Tribunal granted this request by letter of 27 January 2015, authorizing the Respondent to include the authority as RA-25.3 The Tribunal also offered the Claimants an opportunity to comment on this new authority. In response, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they may choose to address the authority at an oral hearing on provisional measures, should the Tribunal decide to hold such a hearing.\n\nBy separate letter of 23 January 2015, the Respondent requested that the \"Claimants specify the identity of their third-party funder for the purposes of determining whether there is any conflict of interests\".\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 27 January 2015, the Tribunal informed the parties that it was available to hold a first session and hearing on provisional measures in Paris on either 17 or 26 March 2015. The Respondent replied on 28 January 2015, stating that key members of its counsel team were unavailable on the proposed dates due to a hearing in another matter.\n\n25.\n\nOn 2 February 2015, the Claimants submitted a letter stating that it would be unacceptable for the Respondent's unavailability to delay an order on the Claimants' Application and requesting that the Tribunal:\n\nIssue forthwith an Order on Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures or, if it deems oral arguments on their Request to be absolutely necessary despite the Parties' multiple and thorough written exchanges, that the Tribunal issue a provisional order prohibiting Respondent and its Counsel from reading and gathering information from records and property seized in the context of the criminal proceedings launched in June 2014 in the Slovak Republic.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal responded on the same day, proposing to hold the first session and hearing on provisional measures on 22 April 2015, and inviting the Respondent to comment on the Claimants' letter. In response, by letter of 4 February 2015, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal propose a date to hold the first session within the timeframe set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1).4\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1) provides\"[t]he Tribunal shall hold its first session within 60 days after its constitution or such other period as the parties may agree\".\n\n27.\n\nOn 5 February 2015, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants' letter of 2 February 2015, noting in particular that the relevant criminal proceedings had been suspended and that neither counsel for the Respondent nor the Slovak Ministry of Finance had read or gathered any information from the materials seized in the investigation. The Respondent also undertook that they would not read or gather such information pending the Tribunal's decision on the Claimants' Application.\n\n28.\n\nOn 9 February 2015, the Tribunal informed the parties that, in light of the Respondent's undertaking, it considered that the Claimants' request of 2 February 2015 had been rendered moot. At the same time, the Tribunal proposed that the first session and hearing on provisional measures be held by teleconference or videoconference on the afternoon of 17 March 2015.\n\n29.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimants submitted a letter commenting on the Respondent's letter of 5 February 2015 and confirming their availability for a teleconference or videoconference on the dates proposed by the Tribunal. By letter of 12 February 2014, the Respondent commented on the Claimants' letter and also confirmed its availability on 17 March 2015.\n\n30.\n\nOn 20 February 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, in light of a settlement in another matter, its counsel would be available to attend an in-person hearing on 17 March 2015.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal then confirmed that the first session and the hearing on provisional measures would be held at the ICC in Paris, France, on 17 March 2015. Prior to the hearing, on 6 March 2015, the parties submitted a jointly proposed schedule for the first session and hearing, which the Tribunal adopted.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 15 March 2015, the Respondent sought to introduce three new exhibits into the record (R-81 to 83), to which the Claimants objected. In a decision communicated to the parties on 16 March 2015, the Tribunal determined that the new exhibits would not be entered into the record prior to the hearing, but that following the hearing, the exhibits would be admitted and the Claimants given an opportunity to comment. In accordance with this decision, the Respondent resubmitted the documents on 23 March 2015 and the Claimants provided their observations on 3 April 2015. The Respondent then submitted additional comments on this issue on 16 April 2015.\n\n33.\n\nThe first session and hearing on provisional measures was held on 17 March 2015 at the ICC in Paris. During the hearing, in accordance with the parties' agreed schedule, each Party was given the opportunity to present oral arguments on provisional measures as well as rebuttal oral arguments. As neither party had submitted witness statements with its written submissions, no witness testimony was given at the hearing. The audio recording of the first session and hearing was dispatched to the Tribunal and the parties on 30 March 2015.\n\n34.\n\nFollowing the first session and hearing, on 24 March 2015, the Tribunal's decision to hear the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute in a single phase of the proceeding was communicated to the parties. The Tribunal also confirmed the corresponding agreed schedule for the parties' written submissions.\n\n35.\n\nOn 1 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the procedural matters addressed during the first session. The issue of whether future hearings will be open to the public was reserved for later decision, and on 16 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, ordering *inter alia* : \"Hearings held shall be open to the public. To the extent necessary to ensure the protection of confidential information, the Tribunal may hold portions of hearings in camera\".\n\n36.\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the Claimants submitted their Memorial, together with the witness statements of Dr. Ondrej Rozloznik, Mr. Vojtech Agyagos, and Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, and an expert report prepared by Mr. Alex Hill from Wardell Armstrong International.\n\n**III. BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n----------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nTo the extent required for the Tribunal to address the parties' Applications for provisional measures, and for this limited purpose only, the Tribunal briefly summarizes the factual background to the dispute as pleaded in the Request for Arbitration with regard to the dispute, the claims and the relief sought. This summary does not constitute any finding by the Tribunal on any facts disputed by the parties.\n\n**A. THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe present dispute arises out of the Claimants' alleged ownership of Rozmin sro (\"Rozmin\"), a Slovak company that, until 2005, held the exclusive rights for mining activities at one of the world's largest talc deposits, located in the Slovak Republic.5\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 1.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Request for Arbitration, Rozmin was constituted in 1997, and shortly thereafter, it was issued a general mining authorization for an indefinite duration by the District Mining Office in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves (the \"DMO\"). Subsequently, on 11 June 1997, Rozmin entered into an agreement with a State-owned entity named Geological Survey, by which Rozmin allegedly obtained exclusive rights to mine the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma talc deposit.6\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 19; Agreement for the Transfer of the Gemerska Poloma Mining Area, Exhibit C-24.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants state that EuroGas first became an indirect shareholder of Rozmin in 1998, when EuroGas GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EuroGas incorporated in Austria, purchased an interest in one of Rozmin's three initial shareholders.7 Then, in 2002, as a result of subsequent stock purchase agreements, EuroGas GmbH became the direct owner of a 33% interest in Rozmin.8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 8.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 8.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in May 1998, the DMO approved Rozmin's plan for the opening, preparation, development, and exploitation of the deposit.9 Over the following years, Rozmin commissioned and financed works at the deposit with a view to preparing it for its commercial development by 13 November 2006, a deadline agreed with the Respondent.10\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 21; Exhibit C-25.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 25.\n\n42.\n\nWhile this process was ongoing, on 24 February 2000, Belmont allegedly acquired a 57% share in Rozmin.11\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 10; Exhibits C-16 and C-17.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants allege that problems began on December 30, 2004, when the Respondent announced, by way of a publication in a business journal (and without prior notification to Rozmin), that it was initiating a new tender procedure for the assignment of the mining rights to the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit.12 On January 3, 2005, Rozmin received a letter from the Director of the DMO stating that Rozmin's mining rights had been revoked and were to be awarded to a new company.13 The DMO subsequently assigned the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit to Economy Agency RV sro, a Slovak company that had little expertise in the mining sector.14\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 31.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 33; Exhibit C-30.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 44.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the tender process and the revocation of Rozmin's mining rights were unjustified and unlawful, motivated by the rise in the price of talc from 2000 to 2005.15 The Claimants reject the Respondent's purported justification for these actions, and point out that just weeks before the revocation, on 8 December 2004, the Director of the DMO had carried out an inspection of the deposit and concluded that Rozmin's activities were in compliance with all legal regulations in force.16\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 32.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 30; Exhibit C-28.\n\n45.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Rozmin challenged the revocation of its rights in the Slovak courts, and in a 28 February 2008 decision, the Supreme Court of Slovakia found that Rozmin's due process rights had been violated by the tender process.17 However, the DMO allegedly ignored this decision, and revoked Rozmin's general mining authorization in April 2008.18 Two further decisions of the Supreme Court found that the Respondent's revocation of Rozmin's rights in 2005 and in 2008 was unlawful.19 Nevertheless, the Respondent allegedly refused to reinstate Rozmin's rights.20\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 46-47; Exhibit C-33.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 48-50; Exhibit C-35.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 55-57; Exhibits C-36 and C-37.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 57.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMS AND RELIEF SOUGHT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Slovak Republic has breached *inter alia* the following obligations under the US-Slovak BIT and the Canada-Slovak BIT:\n\na. to provide fair and equitable treatment;21\n\nb. to provide full protection and security;22\n\nc. to provide national treatment;23\n\nd. to provide most\u2010favored\u2010nation treatment;24\n\ne. to provide treatment that is no less than that required by international law;25\n\nf. not to expropriate, except in cases in which such measures are taken in the public interest, observing due process of law, are not discriminatory, and are accompanied by adequate compensation effected without delay;26 and\n\ng. to observe specific commitments entered into with regard to investments.27\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the US-Slovak BIT; Article III(1)(a) of the Canada-Slovak BIT.\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the US-Slovak BIT; Article III(1)(a) of the Canada-Slovak BIT.\n\nArticle 11(1) of the US-Slovak BIT; Article III(4) of the Canada-Slovak BIT.\n\nArticle 11(1) of the US-Slovak BIT; Article III(2) and (3) of the Canada-Slovak BIT.\n\nRelying on Article II(2)(a) of the US-Slovak BIT and Article III(1)(a) of the Canada-Slovak BIT.\n\nArticle III of the US-Slovak BIT; Article VI(1) of the Canada-Slovak BIT.\n\nArticle II(2)(c) of the US-Slovak BIT.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants seek an award granting it a declaration that the Slovak Republic has violated the US-Slovak BIT and the Canada-Slovak BIT, monetary compensation, costs, interest and such other relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate.28\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 73.\n\n**C. RECENT EVENTS**\n--------------------\n\n48.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, on 26 May 2014, the National Unit of Finance Police of the Slovak Republic received a criminal complaint dated 5 May 2014, alleging that a crime of fraud was underway in respect of a potential arbitration against the Slovak Republic.29\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 49.\n\n49.\n\nOn 23 June 2014, Mr. Vasil \u0160pirko, a prosecutor affiliated with the Office of the Special Prosecution, issued an \"Order for Preservation and Handing over of Computer Data\" against Rozmin and Ms. Jana Czmorikov\u00e1, the external accountant of Rozmin.\n\n50.\n\nOn 25 June 2014, Mr. Roman P\u00fachovsk\u00fd, Judge on Preliminary Proceedings of the Special Criminal Court in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Slovak Republic, issued an \"Order for a House Search\"30 against Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1.\n\nExhibit C-49, Order for a House Search, 25 June 2014.\n\n51.\n\nOn 2 July 2014, a search was carried out at the home of Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1.\n\n52.\n\nMs. Czmorikov\u00e1 was requested to hand over all materials and documents referred to in the \"Order for a House Search\" of 25 June 2014 and to make available all electronic data, in accordance with the \"Order for Preservation and Handing over of Computer Data\" dated 23 June 2014.\n\n53.\n\nA list of materials and documents seized is included in the Minutes on Performance of House Search dated 2 July 2014.31\n\nExhibit C-51, Minutes on Performance of House Search, 2 July 2014.\n\n54.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 was summoned to appear to testify before the Police Corps in Roznava on 2 July 2014.32\n\nExhibit C-52, Witness Summons, 2 July, 2014.\n\n55.\n\nAs noted above, on 8 July 2014, the Claimants submitted their Application for Provisional Measures to the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n56.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, the prosecutor affiliated with the Office of the Special Prosecution ordered the return of seized hard-copies and electronic documents to Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1,33 and the National Unit of Finance Police issued the corresponding decision on 4 September 2014.34\n\nExhibit R-1, Resolution, 4 September 2014.\n\nExhibit R-1, Resolution, 4 September 2014.\n\n57.\n\nOn 5 September 2014, the prosecutor issued a resolution suspending the criminal proceedings pending the resolution of the instant ICSID arbitration.35\n\nExhibit R-2.

THE CLAIMANTS' APPLICATION FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n***1) Claimants***\n------------------\n\n59.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the \"Order for Preservation and Handing over of Computer Data\" of 23 June 2014 and the \"Order for a House Search\" of 25 June 2014 \"were taken by the Slovak Republic in reaction to the Claimants' legitimate exercise of their right to initiate ICSID arbitration proceedings against the Slovak Republic\"37.\n\nFull Briefing on Claimants'Application for Provisional Measures, 11 August 2014, para. 4\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants contend that these orders were intended and had the effect to:\n\n- place the Respondent in a privileged position with full access to all of the Claimants' files including legally privileged materials;\n\n- intimidate the Claimants and their potential witnesses;\n\n- aggravate the dispute between the Parties; and\n\n- jeopardize the integrity of the arbitration process, including the principle of equality of arms and the right to the protection of legally privileged materials and information.\n\n61.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Claimants submit that it is necessary and urgent that the Tribunal order provisional measures in order to protect their rights.\n\n62.\n\nIn their Application dated 8 July 2014, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal take the following measures:\n\n- Order the Slovak Republic to maintain the *status quo* as of the date of the filing of the Request of Arbitration and put the Parties in the position they should have been in as of the said date;\n\n- Order the Slovak Republic to return to Rozmin and Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 all originals of documents and all property seized on 2 July 2014;\n\n- Order the Slovak Republic to refrain from using, in the arbitration proceedings, any material or documents seized on 2 July 2014; and\n\n- Order the Slovak Republic to refrain from taking any further measure of intimidation against Rozmin, EuroGas, Belmont or any director, employee or personnel of any of these companies, and to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may aggravate the dispute and/or alter the *status quo* that existed prior to the initiation of the criminal investigation or any local proceedings related to the subject-matter of this arbitration, including any further steps which might undermine the Claimants' ability to substantiate their claims, threaten the procedural integrity of the arbitral process, or aggravate or exacerbate the dispute between the parties.\n\n63.\n\nIn their Full Briefing on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, dated 11 August 2014, the Claimants amended the above list of provisional measures.\n\n64.\n\nThey further amended it in their Reply on their Application for Provisional measures, dated 16 October 2014, requesting that the Tribunal take the following measures:38\n\na. Order the Slovak Republic to withdraw permanently the criminal proceedings launched on June 23, 2014;\n\nb. Order the Slovak Republic to maintain the status quo as of the date of the filing of the Request of Arbitration, namely as of June 25, 2014, and put the Parties in the position they should have remained in as of the said date;\n\nc. Order the Slovak Republic to return to Rozmin and Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 all copies made of documents and material seized pursuant to the Order for Preservation and Handing over of Computer Data dated June 23, 2014 and the Order for a House Search dated June 25, 2014, including records, documents, and software collected in the course of the search carried out on July 2, 2014;\n\nd. Order the Slovak Republic to undertake, in writing, that the documents and property returned on October 1, 2014 constitute the full set of documents and materials that were seized, and that no copies thereof are kept;\n\ne. Order the Slovak Republic to refrain from using, in the arbitration proceedings, any material or documents seized pursuant to the \"Order for Preservation and Handing over of Computer Data\" dated June 23, 2014 and the \"Order for a House Search\" dated June 25, 2014, including records, documents, hardware and software collected in the course of the search carried out on July 2, 2014, or any information gathered in the course of the criminal proceedings launched on June 23, 2014 in the Slovak Republic;\n\nf. Order the Slovak Republic to refrain from taking any further measure of intimidation against Rozmin, EuroGas, Belmont or any director, employee or personnel of any of these companies and to refrain from engaging in any conduct that may alter the status quo that existed prior to the initiation of the criminal investigation launched on June 23, 2014, including taking any further steps which might undermine Claimants' ability to substantiate their claims, threaten the procedural integrity of the arbitral process, or aggravate or exacerbate the dispute between the Parties.\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 238.\n\n***2) Respondent***\n-------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the originals of the seized documents have been returned, the criminal proceedings have been suspended until the resolution of the instant ICSID arbitration and that it has committed not to read and not to use the copies of the documents during the arbitration proceedings. According to the Respondent, the Claimants' Application is therefore moot.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, in any event, the Tribunal cannot order the requested provisional measures since it has no *prima facie* jurisdiction in respect of either EuroGas II or Belmont.\n\n- The Respondent alleges that the Tribunal has no *prima facie* jurisdiction over EuroGas II since it is a different legal entity from EuroGas I. According to the Respondent, EuroGas II is \"a company registered for the first time on 15 November 2005, under the same name as EuroGas I\".39 As a consequence, EuroGas II cannot claim \"to have been affected by measures that occurred before it came into existence\".40 Moreover, the Respondent maintains that it has validly exercised its right to deny the advantage of the US-Slovak BIT to EuroGas II on the basis that EuroGas II has no substantial business activities in the United States and is controlled by nationals of a third country.41\n\n- The Respondent also contends that the Tribunal has no *prima facie* jurisdiction over Belmont since the dispute arose in 2005, more than three years before the entry into force of the 2010 Canada-Slovak Republic BIT. In addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have not provided evidence to show that Belmont is a shareholder in Rozmin. The Respondent notes that, as the Claimants confirm, Belmont sold its 57% shareholding to EuroGas I in 2001. According to the Respondent, there is no evidence that the 2001 agreement is, as the Claimants allege, ineffective because its conditions were not met.\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 62.\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 62.\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, paras. 62-64; Respondent's Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 21 November 2014, paras. 16-60.\n\n67.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, the Claimants are not entitled to seek provisional measures that would impact the criminal proceedings in the Slovak Republic.\n\n68.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the Claimants' Application is, in any event, baseless since the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the provisional measures they seek are necessary and urgent.\n\n**B. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent challenges the Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of EuroGas II and Belmont. However, as acknowledged by the Respondent, for the time being, the Tribunal needs only to be *prima facie* satisfied that it has jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n70.\n\nAs set out by the tribunal in the Decision on the Application for Provisional Measures in Millicom v. Senegal:\n\n[T]he arbitral Tribunal cannot and must not examine in depth the claims and arguments submitted on the merits of the case; it must confine itself to an initial analysis, i.e. \"at first sight\". For this, it is necessary and sufficient that the facts alleged by the applicant establish this jurisdiction without it being necessary or possible at this stage to verify them and analyze them in depth.42\n\nExhibit CL-24, *Millicom International Operations B.V. and Sentel GSM SA v. The Republic of Senegal,* Decision on the Application for Provisional Measures, 24 August 2009, para. 42.\n\n71.\n\nIn the instant case, the facts alleged by the Claimants establish \"at first sight\" the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is not necessary, at this stage, to verify them in depth. The objections raised by the Respondent against the Tribunal's jurisdiction will be fully addressed at a later stage of the proceedings. For the time being, the Tribunal is of the view that the lack of jurisdiction alleged by the Respondent is not blatant.\n\n72.\n\nWith regard to EuroGas, the Claimants contend that EuroGas II \"stepped into the shoes\" of EuroGas I. Indeed, according to the Claimants, the corporate documents of EuroGas II were amended to mirror those of EuroGas I, which allowed the two companies to perform a \"type-F reorganization\" whereby EuroGas II assumed all of the EuroGas I's assets, liabilities and issued stock certificates. The Claimants submit that thereafter, EuroGas II was, as a matter of Utah State law, \"a mere continuation\" of EuroGas I: \"it had the same corporate structure, the same shareholder base, the same assets and the same liabilities\" as EuroGas I. Hence, according to the Claimants, EuroGas II is, for purposes of the present proceedings, \"the same entity\" as EuroGas I.43\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, paras. 137-139.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the Respondent's assertion that EuroGas does not maintain any substantial business activities in the United States is contradicted by the Respondent's own reliance on the dispute between EuroGas and Tombstone Exploration Corporation. According to the Claimants, the subject-matter of this dispute stems from a number of mining claims in the United States, in which EuroGas wishes to acquire an interest. The Claimants therefore submit that \"this alone demonstrates that EuroGas' activities in the United States are neither fictional nor motivated by any treaty-shopping purposes\".44\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures,16 October 2014, para. 147.\n\n74.\n\nWith regard to Belmont, the Claimants submit that the dispute did not arise in 2005, as the Respondent contends, since \"the dispute argued by Rozmin before local courts (\u2026) is not the same as the international law dispute brought by Belmont against the State in the present arbitration proceedings\"45. According to the Claimants, the international law dispute brought by Belmont against the Slovak Republic did not arise before 1 August 2012, which is \"well after the critical date\".46 In addition, the Claimants deny that Belmont effectively transferred its shares in Rozmin to EuroGas in 2001. They contend that the 2001 agreement was not effective since its conditions were not met.47\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 22 December 2014, para. 73.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 22 December 2014, para. 90.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 22 December 2014, paras. 92-98.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal takes due notice of the Respondent's disagreement on all points; however, it is not in a position, at this stage, to address these issues. Without prejudice to a different assessment at a later stage, the Tribunal is *prima facie* satisfied that it has jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n76.\n\nUnder Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, provisional measures may be granted to protect certain rights of the applicant, if such measures are necessary and urgent. As noted in Procedural Order No. 14 in *Churchill Mining*48: \"the applicant must establish the requirements with sufficient likelihood, without however having to actually prove the facts underlying them\".\n\nExhibit RA-25, *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, para. 64.\n\n77.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls that the right and duty to conduct criminal prosecutions is a prerogative of any sovereign State and that only exceptional circumstances may therefore justify that an arbitral tribunal order provisional measures which interfere with criminal proceedings.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal shall assess whether each of the requested provisional measures is necessary and urgent to protect the Claimants' rights.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal points out that such assessment is necessarily made on the basis of the record as it presently stands and is without prejudice to a different assessment at a later stage.\n\n***1) The Claimants' request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to permanently withdraw the criminal proceedings***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the return of the property and documents seized and the suspension of the criminal proceedings constitute \"a mere strategic move\" to allow the Respondent to argue that the Claimants' Application is now moot.49 According to the Claimants, since the criminal proceedings have only been suspended and not permanently withdrawn, it is necessary and urgent that the requested provisional measure be ordered so that the integrity of the arbitration process be preserved. The Claimants acknowledge, referring to *Abaclat v. Argentina*50, that, in principle, an arbitral tribunal cannot prohibit a party from conducting criminal court proceedings before competent state authorities.51 However, the Claimants maintain that exceptional circumstances may lead an arbitral tribunal to depart from this general rule, notably if the criminal proceedings interfere with the arbitration process52, and they submit that this requirement is satisfied in the instant case.\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 4.\n\nExhibit CL-26, *Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5 (formerly *Giovanna a Beccara and Others v. The Argentine Republic*), Procedural Order No. 13, 27 September 2012.\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 44.\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 45.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest that exceptional circumstances may justify that an arbitral tribunal interfere with criminal proceedings,53 but it denies that this requirement is fulfilled in the present circumstances. According to the Respondent, such exceptional circumstances are not met. It further contends that, since the criminal proceedings have been suspended and the originals of documents have been returned, the requested provisional measure is, in any event, moot.\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 84.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal stresses that \"a particularly high threshold\" must be reached before an ICSID tribunal can order provisional measures which interfere with criminal proceedings, as the right and the responsibility to conduct such proceedings is a prerogative of any sovereign State.54 As acknowledged by both parties, an arbitral tribunal will not recommend such measures unless exceptional circumstances threaten the integrity of the arbitration proceedings and the principle of due process.\n\nExhibit RA-9, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID case No ARB/08/12, Decision regarding Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures, 31 July 2009, para. 137; Exhibit RA-25, *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, para. 72.\n\n83.\n\nAs the tribunal held in Procedural Order No. 14 in *Churchill Mining*55: \"An allegation that the status quo has been altered or that the dispute has been aggravated needs to be buttressed by concrete instances of intimidation or harassment\".\n\nExhibit RA-25, *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, para. 72.\n\n84.\n\nYet, in the instant case:\n\n- The criminal court proceedings have been suspended;\n\n- The originals of the seized documents have been returned;\n\n- The Respondent undertook not to read the copies of the seized documents and not to use them in the arbitration proceedings;\n\n- As it will be explained (*infra*, para. 105-109), there is no evidence showing that the Claimants or potential witnesses have been the targets of abusive behavior, or that they have been intimidated or harassed during the criminal proceedings and investigations.\n\n85.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal is of the view that the requested provisional measure is neither necessary nor urgent and that the Claimants have not met the burden of establishing that exceptional circumstances justify an interference with the sovereign right of the Slovak Republic to conduct criminal prosecutions.\n\n86.\n\nThe requested provisional measure is therefore denied.\n\n***2) The Claimants' request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to maintain the status quo***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"provisional measures may be ordered to preserve either substantive rights or procedural rights, including the general right to the preservation of the *status quo* and to the non-aggravation of the dispute\".56 The Claimants point out that the Respondent \"provided no assurance that it would refrain from taking measures during the arbitration proceedings that could further jeopardize the integrity of these proceedings or aggravate the dispute between the parties, in particular, further measures of intimidation of Claimants' potential witnesses\".57 The Claimants therefore request that the Tribunal \"order the Slovak Republic to maintain the *status quo* as of the date of the filing of the Request of Arbitration and put the parties in the position they should have been in as of the said date\". Referring to *Biwater*,58 the Claimants contend that no actual harm needs to be shown to justify the issuance of an order that a party refrain from taking any step that might harm or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings or aggravate the dispute.59\n\nFull Briefing on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 11 August 2014, para. 36.

Pakistan*,63 a recommendation for the preservation of *status quo* should only be granted if the claimant provides sufficient evidence of an actual threat of aggravation of the dispute. Moreover, the Tribunal recalls that, as held in *Lao Holdings* : \"[A] criminal proceeding does not *per se* (\u2026) aggravate the dispute\".64 Something more has to be at stake in order to allow an arbitral tribunal to conclude that there is a threat of aggravation of the dispute.\n\nExhibit RA-9, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v.

However, in the instant case, the criminal proceedings have been suspended, originals of the seized documents have been returned, the Respondent has undertaken not to read the copies of the seized documents and not to use them during the arbitration proceedings and no witness intimidation has occurred. In view of these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that while an aggravation of the dispute is always possible, there is no element in the record evidencing an actual threat.\n\nExhibit CL-31, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 3, September 29, 2006, para. 145.\n\n91.\n\nThe requested provisional measure is therefore denied.\n\n***3) The Claimants' requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to return all copies made of the seized documents and to refrain from using in the arbitration proceedings any material or documents seized or any information gathered during the criminal proceedings***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is necessary and urgent, in order to preserve the integrity of the arbitration proceedings, that the Tribunal order the Respondent to return all copies of the seized documents and to refrain from using in this arbitration any information gathered in the course of the criminal proceedings. According to the Claimants, the retention of copies of the seized documents by the Respondent is \"in blatant violation of Claimants' right to the protection of privileged and confidential information and of the most basic procedural rules and principles, including the principles of equality of arms, fairness and due process\".66\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 8.\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Tribunal should reject the requested provisional measures since:\n\n- The original of the seized documents and materials were returned;\n\n- The Claimants have failed to evidence how the retention of copies would prejudice their procedural rights;\n\n- The return of copies would turn the suspension of the criminal proceedings into an effective termination, exposing the prosecution and court to a risk that the evidence might disappear;\n\n- The Respondent has already declared in writing that the Slovak Ministry of Finance has not read the documents;\n\n- The Respondent has committed to the Tribunal not to read them \"unless the Claimants make the seizure for the criminal investigation part of this proceeding, by alleging it is a violation of the BIT\".67\n\nFirst Session and Hearing on Provisional Measures, 17 March 2015, Transcript, p. 115.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants' argument that the Respondent might obtain an unfair advantage in the instant ICSID arbitration by using, in the course of these proceedings, the copies of the documents seized or the information gathered during the search carried out at Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1's home.\n\n95.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal stresses that the copies of the seized documents are part of the criminal proceedings, in relation to which the Tribunal has not made any order.\n\n96.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal takes due notice of the facts that:\n\n- The originals of the seized documents have been returned;\n\n- The Respondent has represented to the Tribunal, both in writing68 and during the Hearing on Provisional Measures,69 that the Slovak Ministry of Finance has not read the seized documents;\n\n- The Respondent has undertaken that it will not read or produce the copies of the seized documents in the arbitration proceedings.70\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Arbitral Tribunal, 5 February 2015.\n\nFirst Session and Hearing on Provisional Measures, 17 March 2015, Transcript, p. 115.\n\n*Ibidem* ; The Slovak Republic's Presentation of the Parties' Applications for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2015, p. 71.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's undertaking will not apply in case \"the Claimants make the seizure for the criminal investigation part of this proceeding, by alleging it is a violation of the BIT\".71 The Tribunal understands this restriction to mean that, in such circumstances, the Respondent might need to read or produce the seized documents in order to organize its defense. However, even in such situation, the Respondent committed to the Tribunal to seek its leave to produce any of the copies of the seized documents.72 The Tribunal underlines that this would allow the Claimants to express any objection they may have with respect to the evidence at issue. The Tribunal further notes that if it decided to admit the production of a copy of a seized document, it would assess its evidentiary value taking into account, among other factors, its source.\n\n*Ibidem*.\n\n*Ibidem*.\n\n98.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that it is neither necessary nor urgent to order the Respondent to return all copies of the seized documents or to refrain from using them in arbitration proceedings.\n\n99.\n\nThe requested provisional measures are therefore denied.\n\n***4) The Claimants' request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to undertake that the documents and property returned constitute the full set of documents and materials that were seized and that no copies thereof are kept***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the minutes prepared on 1 October 2014, when the seized documents were being released, indicate that certain pages of some documents were missing.73 The Claimants therefore submit that it is necessary and urgent for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to undertake that the documents and property returned constitute the full set of documents and materials that were seized.\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 7.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this request is neither necessary nor urgent since it is improbable that Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 was in possession of the only original copies of the documents necessary to Claimants. According to the Respondent: \"Rozmin is unlikely to have provided originals of documents of which it did not keep copies to an independent contractor\".74\n\nRespondent's Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 21 November 2014, para. 136.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants' right to substantiate their claim in the instant ICSID arbitration. However, the Tribunal is reluctant to order the Respondent to repeat, in a more solemn way, what it has already clearly stated during the Hearing on Provisional Measures.75 This would imply that the Tribunal has doubt as to whether the Respondent's statements during the hearing reflected the truth, without any evidence justifying such doubts. Indeed, no element has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal showing that the Claimants have been deprived of relevant evidence.\n\nFirst Session and Hearing on Provisional Measures, 17 March 2015, Transcript, p. 114; The Slovak Republic's Presentation of the Parties' Applications for Provisional Measures, 17 March 2015, p. 69.\n\n103.\n\nFurthermore, in light of the Respondent's recent behavior and commitments, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no reason to believe that the Respondent did not return the full set of documents and materials that were seized.\n\n104.\n\nThe requested provisional measure is thus denied.\n\n***5) The Claimants' request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to refrain from taking any measure of intimidation against Rozmin, EuroGas, Belmont or any director, employee or personnel of any of these companies***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, during her examination, Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 was asked questions \"exclusively related to the issues in dispute and which will be raised in the arbitration\",76 as well as questions directly related to her knowledge of the arbitration proceedings. They allege that Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 is now concerned that the Slovak authorities may cause her trouble given her position as an employee of Rozmin. According to the Claimants, \"everyone fears that at any time, she may be the object of an unannounced search and/or interrogation, at her own private home, by Slovak officials or police force members, and that herself or her whole family may even be targeted\".77 According to the Claimants, Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 has \"become reluctant to being involved in any way in the arbitration proceedings\".78 They further maintain that \"other individuals (including Dr Rozlozkin, who was a director and general manager of Rozmin between 1997 and 2011) have expressed similar concerns and reluctance with respect to having to cooperate with Claimants in relation to the arbitration proceedings\".79 Referring to *Quiborax v. Bolivia*,80 the Claimants submit that provisional measures are justified to preserve the applicant's right to access evidence through potential witnesses.81 They therefore contend that it is necessary and urgent that the Tribunal order the Respondent to refrain from taking any further measure of intimidation against the Claimants or potential witnesses.\n\nFull Briefing on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 11 August 2014, paras. 30-31.\n\n*Ibidem*.\n\n*Ibidem*.\n\nFull Briefing on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 11 August 2014, para. 32.\n\nExhibit CL-8, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

Moreover, the Respondent contends that, in any event, the Claimants failed to demonstrate that a potential witness was ever intimidated. The Respondent points out, referring to *Occidental v. Ecuador*,82 that provisional measures are not meant to protect against potential or hypothetical harm. Rather, they are meant to protect against imminent harm.\n\nExhibit CL-2, *Occidental v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants' right to present their case and to access evidence through potential witnesses. However, the Tribunal notes that the criminal proceedings have been suspended and that there is no indication that either Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1, any of the Claimants, or any potential witness, had been intimidated or harassed before the suspension of the investigation.\n\n108.\n\nEven though Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1's uneasiness, deriving from the search carried out at her home, is understandable, it does not imply, in itself, that the search was irregular. As noted in Procedural Order No. 14 in *Churchill Mining*, it is \"common practice, in criminal law systems to conduct on-site searches and to seize relevant evidence, for the purpose of a criminal investigation\".83 The Tribunal is of the view that there is no concrete element on record showing that Ms. Czmorikov\u00e1 has been the object of undue pressure, intimidation, abuse, mistreatment, harassment or threats.\n\nExhibit RA-25, *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v.

THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n***1) Respondent***\n-------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, the Tribunal has the power to order the security for costs which the Respondent requests.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimants \"have a history of engaging in fraud and reneging on payment obligations\"84 and that they do not have the means to pay for the costs of the arbitration proceedings, which are entirely funded by third parties.85 The Respondent therefore submits that the Claimants are not capable of satisfying a future costs award.\n\nRespondent's Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 21 November 2014, para. 74.\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 3.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that it has a plausible defense and that a future claim for cost reimbursement is \"not evidently excluded\".86\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 75; Respondent's Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 21 November 2014, para. 83.\n\n113.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is therefore both necessary and urgent that the Claimants be ordered to provide a security for costs in order to prevent the Respondent from suffering an irreparable harm if it cannot recover the costs to which it is entitled.\n\n114.\n\nAs a consequence, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\nOrder Claimants to obtain within 30 days an irrevocable bank guarantee from a reputable international bank in the U.S., Canada, or the European Union in the amount of EUR 1,000,000, callable on in whole or in part by the Respondent upon presentation of the Tribunal's Final Award or any Decision on Costs, with the amount to be updated if necessary in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction to ensure that the Slovak Republic's costs are secured until the end of the arbitration.87\n\nRespondent's Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, para. 147.\n\n***2) Claimants***\n------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimants deny the Tribunal's authority to order security for costs and contend that, to date, virtually all ICSID tribunals have declined to recommend that an investor provide security for the host State's costs in the arbitration proceedings.88\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 22 December 2014, para. 101.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants point out that there is no reason to presume that the Respondent will succeed on the merits and that the Tribunal will shift the parties' costs onto the Claimants, especially as the trend in investment arbitration is not to automatically shift costs to an unsuccessful claimant. According to the Claimants, since the Respondent's right to the reimbursement of its costs is highly hypothetical, it cannot constitute a \"right to be preserved\" under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.89\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 206.\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's request goes against the very purpose of the ICSID framework, which aims at providing investors with direct access to a neutral forum for the resolution of their dispute with a State. According to the Claimants, \"given that the power struggle in investor-State disputes is generally in favor of the State, any additional financial burden imposed on Claimants is very likely to unduly restrict their ability to bring forward meritorious claims\".90\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 221.\n\n118.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit that the requested provisional measure is, in any event, neither necessary nor urgent. The Claimants acknowledge that they are encountering financial difficulties. However, according to them, such difficulties are \"in large part attributable to acts and omissions of Respondent\".91 They further assert, citing *Burimi v. Albania*,92 that mere financial difficulties are not sufficient to justify granting the Respondent security for its costs.93 Referring *inter alia* to *Commerce Group & San Sebastian Gold Mines v. El Salvador*,94 they maintain that an arbitral tribunal should only exercise its power to order security for costs \"in extreme circumstances\" which are not met in the instant case.95\n\nClaimants' Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 16 October 2014, para. 229.\n\nExhibit CL-65, *Burimi S.R.L and Eagle Games SH.A v.

Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Decision on El Salvador's Application for Security for Costs, 20 September 2012, para. 45.\n\n122.\n\nIt is true that in *RSM v. Saint Lucia,* an ICSID tribunal ordered security for costs. However, the underlying facts in that arbitration were rather exceptional since the claimant was not only impecunious and funded by a third party, but also had a proven history of not complying with cost orders. As underlined by the arbitral tribunal, these circumstances were considered cumulatively.100\n\nExhibit RA-4, *RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, para. 86.\n\n123.\n\nYet, no such exceptional circumstances have been evidenced in the instant case. The Claimants have not defaulted on their payment obligations in the present proceedings or in other arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal is of the view that financial difficulties and third party-funding \u2013 which has become a common practice \u2013 do not necessarily constitute *per se* exceptional circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted an order of security for costs.\n\n124.\n\nThe requested provisional measure is therefore denied.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n125.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the Tribunal issues the following decision:\n\n(1) Denies the Claimants' Application, as amended, for provisional measures;\n\n(2) Denies the Respondent's Application for provisional measures;\n\n(3) Takes due note of the Respondent's commitments, set out in paragraphs 96-97 above;\n\n(4) Reminds the parties of their general duty arising from the principle of good faith not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration."}, {"Title": "Award of the Tribunal", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-08-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion by Arbitrator Emmanuel Gaillard", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion by Arbitrator Emmanuel Gaillard\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIt is with regret that I feel compelled to dissent in part from the Award. Despite the great respect and esteem I have for my colleagues, the members of the Arbitral Tribunal (the \"Tribunal\"), I disagree with their conclusion that Belmont Resources Inc.'s (\"Belmont\") claims fall outside the ambit of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.1 I concur, nevertheless, with the other findings that are presented in the Award and that are not discussed herein.\n\nAward, paragraph 461.\n\n2.\n\nAs I will explain below, I disagree with the majority of the Tribunal (the \"Majority\") with respect to the operation of the *ratione temporis* provision found at Article XV(6) of the 2010 Canada-Slovakia BIT (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\") (**I**). Accordingly, I find the Majority's assessment of what constitutes the dispute before the Tribunal to be wrong (**II**): I cannot agree that the dispute between Belmont and the Slovak Republic (the \"Respondent\"), which has been brought before the Tribunal and concerns certain critical facts that took place after the critical date of March 14, 2009, can be said to have arisen before that date. In my view, the dispute arose after the critical date of March 14, 2009 and, as a result, falls squarely within the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\n**I. Interpretation of Article XV(6) of the 2010 Canada-Slovakia BIT,the Concept of \"Dispute\" and the Process of Defining the Dispute BEFoRE THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe *ratione temporis* scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Belmont's claims is found in Article XV(6) of the BIT, which provides, *inter alia,* that\n\n\"... this Agreement shall apply to any dispute which has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into force.\"2\n\nAgreement between Canada and the Slovak Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, July 20, 2010 (**Exhibits c-2** and **R-6**), Article XV(6) (emphasis added).\n\n4.\n\nIt is undisputed between the parties that the Treaty's date of entry into force is March 14, 2012 and that, therefore, the critical date for defining the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is March 14, 2009.\n\n5.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, it is important to emphasize that the limitation *ratione temporis* provided by the Treaty concerns only the date on which the dispute arose and not the date on which facts or situations leading up to the dispute occurred.3 Indeed, Article XV(6) of the Treaty calls only for the determination of the date on which the dispute itself arose; it does not call for an assessment of the date on which facts or situations relating to the dispute occurred, *i.e.,* the date of the alleged \"real causes\" of the dispute as referred to by the Majority. The cornerstone of the Tribunal's assessment of its jurisdiction is therefore the concept of \"dispute\".\n\nCompare, for example, with France's 1931 declaration accepting the Permanent Court of International Justice's (\"PCIJ\") compulsory jurisdiction, which contained a limitation *ratione temporis* to the Court's jurisdiction not only with respect to the date of the dispute, but also with respect to the date of *\"situations and facts with regard to which the dispute arose.\" (**Phosphates in Morocco (Italy v. France),* PCIJ Reports, Ser. A/B No. 74, 1938, p. 22: \"... *jurisdiction of the Court* [...] *in any disputes which may arise after the ratification of the present declaration with regard to situations or facts subsequent to such ratification...*\"). It was this particularity of France's declaration that prompted the PCIJ, when deciding on its own jurisdiction, to search for the situations and facts that would be \"the real causes\" of the dispute and their date, instead of satisfying itself with determining the date on which the dispute arose (*see Phosphates in Morocco,* pp. 22-24).\n\n6.\n\nA \"dispute\" is traditionally defined as \"*a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons'\",* following the seminal decision rendered by the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCIJ\") in the *Mavrommatis* case.4 It follows that a dispute arises at the moment a disagreement is formed between the parties over points of law or fact. In turn, a disagreement is formed once the claims or positions of one of the parties over those points of law or fact are contested or ultimately ignored by the other. A dispute, therefore, presupposes the existence of the factual and legal framework on which the disagreement is based and cannot arise until the entirety of such constituent elements has come into existence.\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Court, 30 August 1924, p. 11.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has two tasks when ruling on its jurisdiction *ratione temporis: (1)* determining the subject and scope of the disagreement submitted to it by the parties, and *(2)* determining when this disagreement arose.\n\n8.\n\nIn the context of determining the subject and scope of the dispute, the *Mavrommatis* definition calls for an assessment that encompasses *all* relevant facts and elements constituting the parties' disagreement, as conveyed in their submissions.5 It is therefore not sufficient to carry out an analysis that is limited to searching for the *\"real causes\"* of the dispute, particularly when this results in overlooking key and distinctive features of the dispute.\n\nShabtai Rosenne, *Rosenne's Law and Practice of the International Court: 1920-2015* (Malcolm Shaw, ed., 5th ed., Brill Nijhoff 2016), vol II Jurisdiction, p. 532. The case law of the International Court of Justice is consistent in this regard and provides authoritative guidance on how the process of defining the dispute should be conducted: for a case-by-case application of this process, *see* *Interhandel Case,* Judgment of March 21st, 1959: I.C.J. Reports 1959, p. 6, pp. 20-22; and *Case concerning Right of Passage over Indian Territory (Merits)*, Judgment of 12 April 1960: I.C.J. Reports 1960, p. 6, pp. 33-34. For cases in which the ICJ defined the dispute but was not faced with the question of the critical date, *see* : *Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1914, p. 451, paras. 24-31; and *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada),* Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 432, paras. 29-35.\n\n9.\n\nFor this reason, I find the Majority's approach to the definition of the dispute before the Tribunal to be too reductive and inconsistent with the well-established *Mavrommatis* definition. When stating that \"[w]*hat matters is the real cause of the dispute,\"6* basing its conclusion on the award rendered in *Lucchetti v. Peru7* and the PCIJ decision in *Phosphates in Morocco,8* the Majority disregards key features of the dispute, focusing on early events instead of considering the dispute as a whole, as submitted by the parties.\n\nAward, para. 453.\n\nAward, paras. 440-451, referring to *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A. (formerly Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A.) v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Award, 1 February 2005, para. 50.\n\nAward, para. 453, referring to *Phosphates in Morocco (Italy v. France),* PCIJ Reports, Ser. A/B No. 74, 1938. As discussed above, in footnote 3, in *Phosphates in Morocco,* the PCIJ only proceeded to determine the \"real causes\" of the dispute and to distinguish them from *\"subsequent factors which either presume the existence or are merely the confirmation or development or earlier situations or facts\u2019\"* because the limitation *ratione temporis* to its jurisdiction emanating from France's declaration concerned both the date of the dispute and the date on which situations relating to the dispute occurred. That limitation *ratione temporis* is different from the provision in the BIT in the case at hand. I therefore believe the application of *Phosphates in Morocco* reasoning to be misplaced in the present case.\n\n10.\n\nIn its search for the *\"real causes\"* of the dispute, the Majority ends up reducing the dispute to its most abstract element, described as \"*the reassignment of Rozmin's rights\",* and overlooks aspects of the dispute that concern the concrete circumstances in which the legal acts that allegedly brought about this reassignment occurred.9 In particular, I consider that the Majority neglected the specific circumstances and effects of the Slovak authorities' acts carried out after the critical date of March 14, 2009, despite the fact that they constitute a significant aspect of the parties' disagreement in the present proceedings. What is more, by reducing the dispute to *\"the reassignment of Rozmin's rights\u2019\",* the Majority reached the conclusion that this is the same dispute as the one submitted to the Slovak courts in 2005, despite the distinctiveness of the factual and legal circumstances leading up to each of the two disputes, which I will discuss further in Section II below.\n\nAward, para. 448. The Majority also describes this common element as \"*the taking of Belmont's investment*\" (Award, para. 457) and as Belmont's losing of its rights on the Mining Area (Award, para. 455).\n\n11.\n\nIn other words, by limiting the dispute to its alleged *\"real causes\u2019\"* instead of analyzing all the relevant factual and legal circumstances leading to the disagreement brought before the Tribunal, the Majority departed from the *Mavrommatis* definition of \"dispute\" it purports to apply.\n\n12.\n\nI further strongly disagree with the Majority's interpretation of the intention of the State Parties to the BIT as set out in Article XV(6) of the Treaty. According to the Majority:\n\n\"[t]he State Parties to the Canada-Slovakia BIT cannot have intended that Article 15(6) be read and applied in a way that exposes them to claims from investors that could date from more than three years before the entry into force of the treaty, just because a certain dispute was not settled and/or might give rise to a follow-up action.\"10\n\nAward, para. 459.\n\n13.\n\nFirst of all, as discussed above, nothing in the Treaty conveys an intention of the State Parties to define jurisdiction by reference to \"facts\" as opposed to a \"dispute\". Certain other treaties have chosen to exclude from their scope of temporal jurisdiction \"facts\" having occurred before a certain date (generally the date of entry into force of the relevant treaty); that the Treaty does not contain such language simply means that such an intention did not exist and cannot be inferred.\n\n14.\n\nMoreover, if *\"follow-up action[s]\"* - in effect, new actions relating to past facts - produce new legal effects and transform the subject and scope of the initial disagreement of the parties (independently or combined with previous legal acts), I do not see how this intervening action cannot give rise to a new dispute in light of the *Mavrommatis* definition. A new disagreement between the parties in relation to which they seek adjudication by the Tribunal is, by definition, a new dispute.\n\n15.\n\nThis is not to say that any new fact or act that follows a dispute that has already arisen will necessarily result in a new dispute between the parties. One still needs to assess the relevance of these new elements in light of all of the circumstances in order to determine the seriousness of the parties' new positions.\n\n16.\n\nThis consideration leads me to my second point of disagreement with the Majority, which pertains to the legal effects of the events taking place after March 14, 2009, and their relevance to the dispute between the parties.\n\n**II. The Dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal and the PostMarch 14, 2009 Facts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nAs discussed above, when deciding on its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* based on Article XV(6) of the BIT, the Tribunal has two tasks: to determine the subject and scope of the dispute (**A**), and to determine when this dispute arose (**B**).\n\n**A. The Dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nBy way of summary, based on the parties' submissions throughout the arbitral proceedings, it appears that the dispute before the Tribunal concerns the conduct of the Slovak authorities vis-\u00e0-vis Rozmin's mining rights over the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma reserve, which, as alleged by Belmont and contested by the Respondent, amounted to an illegal expropriation and constituted a number of other breaches of the Slovak Republic's international obligations under the Treaty.\n\n19.\n\nThe conduct of the Slovak authorities at the heart of the dispute between the parties began in 2005, before the critical date, but extended well beyond the critical date, until 2012. It encompasses the alleged *de facto* revocation of Rozmin's mining rights in 2005, the conduct of the Slovak authorities following the Slovak Supreme Court decisions of 2008 and 2011, and the final legal act taken by the District Mining Office (\"DMO\") which definitively reassigned the mining rights to VSK Mining in 2012. The dispute before the Tribunal is thus distinct from the dispute that was submitted by Rozmin to the Slovak courts in 2005, which only concerned facts that took place before and in 2005.\n\n20.\n\nWhen setting out its position before the Tribunal, Belmont presented a claim on expropriation and other treaty breaches based on the alleged *de facto* revocation of the mining rights in 2005 by the DMO's decision to hold a new tender.11\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para 88: \"... *the abrupt revocation of Rozmin's mining rights, justified post facto by the 2002 Amendment, amounted to a prohibited expropriation under both BITs*.\" *See also,* Request for Arbitration, para. 90.\n\n21.\n\nHowever, Belmont also took issue with actions carried out by the Slovak authorities following the Slovak Supreme Court decisions, which took place from 2008 until 2012, through and beyond the critical date of March 14, 2009. These actions are presented by Belmont as an illegal expropriation:\n\n\"Furthermore, irrespective of the revocation, *per se,* of Rozmin's mining rights, Slovakia's subsequent disregard of the decisions of its own Supreme Court (dated February 27, 2008 and May 18, 2011), by way of the DMO's assignment of these mining rights, first in July 2008 and then again in March 2012, to VSK Mining, in itself also constituted an expropriation of Claimant's rights under international law.\"12\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 89. *See also,* Claimants' Memorial, paras. 283-284; Claimants' Reply, para. 546.\n\n22.\n\nThese actions are also presented as breaches of other international obligations undertaken by the Respondent under the Treaty:\n\n\"Slovakia's disregard of the decisions of its Supreme Court dated February 27, 2008 and May 18, 2011, by way of the assignment of mining rights over the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma talc deposit to VSK Mining, first in July 2008 and then again in March 2012, also constituted a breach of Claimants' above-mentioned rights, including the right to fair and equitable treatment, to full protection and security, and to protection against discriminatory and arbitrary measures.\"13\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 93. *See also,* Claimants' Memorial, paras. 293, 330-331, 363, 371; Claimants' Reply, paras. 598-617.\n\n23.\n\nThese formulations of Belmont's position in the arbitral proceedings show that the dispute comprises claims based on the 2005 *de facto* revocation as well as claims that are substantially based on a spectrum of conduct which extends from 2008 through 2012. Belmont's position is that that spectrum of conduct produces its own legal effects, which are independent from the acts of 2005.\n\n24.\n\nThe opposing positions presented by the Respondent in its submissions are a mirror image of Belmont's and confirm that the scope of the present dispute goes beyond the DMO's conduct in 2005 and encompasses the conduct of the Slovak authorities between 2008 and 2012. Indeed, the Respondent's submissions are also devoted to a discussion of the alleged legality and justifiability of the DMO's and other Slovak authorities' conduct after the Supreme Court decisions of 2008 and 2012.14\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, Sections VI and VII; Respondent's Rejoinder, Sections V and VI.\n\n25.\n\nThe dispute before the Tribunal therefore concerns the legality, under international law, of the 2005 *de facto* revocation of the mining rights as well as the Slovak authorities' conduct from 2008 and 2012 with respect to Rozmin's mining rights and leading to the definitive reassignment of the mining rights to VSK Mining in 2012. It is not disputed that the latter conduct from 2008 through 2012 was not - and could not have been - raised in the case brought before the Slovak courts in 2005.\n\n**B. The Time at which the Dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal Arose**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs stated above, a dispute cannot arise until all of its constituent elements have fully come into existence. In this case, the DMO's 2012 act of reassignment of the mining rights is the final and essential constituent element of the dispute, as it is the act that created the legal situation of the mining rights contested before the Tribunal. Without this final act, the dispute before the Tribunal would not exist. As a result, the dispute before the Tribunal necessarily arose after this act.\n\n27.\n\nIn this light, I feel compelled to examine closely the Majority's conclusion that, after the critical date of March 14, 2009, there was no new act by the Slovak authorities capable of giving rise to a new dispute between the parties because the acts that took place then only maintained the effects of previous, pre-critical date acts.15 I strongly disagree with both the Majority's conclusion and its justification.\n\nAward, paras. 454-460.\n\n28.\n\nIndeed, I find the Majority's conclusion that the post-March 14, 2009 acts merely maintained Belmont's previous factual and legal situation to be incorrect in light of the effects of the Slovak Supreme Court decisions upon the acts of reassignment of Rozmin's mining rights.\n\n29.\n\nTo summarize, the events leading up to the final act of reassignment of the mining rights may be divided in three phases. The first phase is comprised of the following events:\n\n(i) On 30 December 2004, the Slovak Business Journal announced that the DMO was initiating a new tender procedure for the assignment of the mining area.16\n\n(ii) On January 3, 2005, Rozmin was notified by the DMO that it was initiating a new tender procedure for the reassignment of the mining rights;17\n\n(iii) On April 21, 2005, the DMO held a tender procedure which resulted in the assignment of the mining area to Economy Agency, the outcome of which was informed to Rozmin on May 3, 2005;18\n\n(iv) On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court quashed the DMO's decision to assign the mining area to Economy Agency.19\n\nAward, para. 42. Initiation of the Selection Procedure for the Determination and Assignment of the Extraction Area, Business Journal No. 253/2004, dated December 30, 2004, p. 99 (**Exhibit C-29**).\n\nAward, para. 43. Letter from the District Mining Office to Rozmin sro, dated January 3, 2005 (**Exhibit C-30**).\n\nAward, para. 44. Report on the Course and Results of the Selection Procedure for the Designation of the MA GP to Another Organization Performed on April 21, 2005 (**Exhibit c-31**); Letter from the District Mining Office to Rozmin sro, dated May 3, 2005 (**Exhibit c-32**).\n\nAward, para. 49; Decision of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, dated February 27, 2008 (**Exhibits c-33** and **R-60**).\n\n30.\n\nI find it important to insist on the specific wording of the Supreme Court's order in its decision, as translated into English by both the Claimants and the Respondent: it *\"quashed\"* the act of reassignment.20 This means that the decision rendered the reassignment act void, depriving it of any legal effect. As a result, based on the record of the present arbitral proceedings, as of the Supreme Court's decision there no longer was a valid legal act providing for the reassignment of the mining area.\n\nDecision of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, dated February 27, 2008, p. 1 (**Exhibits c-33** and **R-60**).\n\n31.\n\nThe events constituting the second phase can be described as follows:\n\n(v) On July 2, 2008, the DMO, through a new legal act, awarded the Mining Area to VSK Mining;21\n\n(vi) On May 18, 2011, the Supreme Court cancelled the DMO's decision.22\n\nAward, para. 50; Decision of the District Mining Office on the Assignment of the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma Mining Area to VSK Mining sro, dated July 2, 2008 (**Exhibit c-34**).\n\nAward, para. 53; Decision of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, dated May 18, 2011 (**Exhibits c-36** and **R-61**).\n\n32.\n\nAgain, the result of this second phase was the cancellation of the second act of reassignment, therefore depriving it of legal effect. Accordingly, as of this point, there was, once again, no valid legal act in the record providing for the reassignment of the mining area.\n\n33.\n\nThe events constituting the final phase took place entirely after the critical date of March 14, 2009:\n\n(vii) On March 30, 2012, the DMO issued a new act assigning the mining area to VSK Mining;23\n\n(viii) On August 1st, 2012, the Main Mining Office (the \"MMO\") confirmed the DMO's reassignment decision.24\n\nAward, para. 55; Decision of the District Mining Office, dated March 30, 2012 (**Exhibits C-37** and **R-58**).\n\nAward, para. 57. Decision of the Main Mining Office, dated August 1, 2012 (**Exhibit C-273**).\n\n34.\n\nIt is only at the end of this final phase, as the MMO's decision was not challenged, that the reassignment of the mining area became final.\n\n35.\n\nIn considering these three phases, the only tenable conclusion is that, in the end, there was only one legally valid act, issued in 2012, which had the legal effect of reassigning Rozmin's mining rights to another company and which Belmont could complain of, both prior measures having been annulled. This is a key consideration, as it demonstrates the difference between, on the one hand, certain measures which merely confirm a legal situation that came about in 2005 - as argued by the Majority - and, on the other, certain annulled acts that were followed by another act that started producing effects as of 2012.\n\n36.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the DMO's act of March 30, 2012 did not confirm a previous situation, but rather was the sole act that created the legal situation complained of by Belmont before the Tribunal. In fact, after the second Supreme Court decision, had the DMO taken a different course of conduct, either reinstating the mining rights to Rozmin or simply doing nothing, the legal situation in question would not have existed. A dispute would, accordingly, not have existed before the Tribunal.\n\n37.\n\nIn light of these considerations, I find it difficult to agree with the Majority's conclusion that the acts between 2008 and 2012 did not change Belmont's legal and factual situation as existing in 2005,25 and that there was *\"one (alleged) transgression whose effects have been maintained throughout domestic court**proceedings and repeated decisions by the mining authorities\"26* Given the critical nature of the DMO's reassignment act of 2012 to the dispute before the Tribunal, I believe the dispute to be inextricably linked to this act, such that the dispute can only be considered to have arisen after its implementation. As stated above, since the constituent elements of the dispute only fully came into existence in 2012, the dispute could not have arisen before then.\n\nAward, para. 455.\n\nAward, para. 460.\n\n38.\n\nIn other words, until the final act of 2012, the Respondent could - and did, through its courts - remedy a situation that could potentially have constituted treaty breaches. By changing its course of conduct and deciding to reassign the mining rights to VSK Mining in 2012, notwithstanding the Slovak Supreme Court's previous decisions, the Slovak authorities' conduct created a dispute at that point in time concerning the legality, under the Treaty, of the reassignment of mining rights.\n\n39.\n\nThe exchange of communications between the parties with respect to the dispute confirms that an actual disagreement between them only took form on the eve of the present proceedings. The so-called \"Final Notice of Dispute\" of December 23, 2013 was the first time that Belmont presented its position on the issues of the dispute to the Respondent, particularly on how the DMO's alleged stonewalling of Rozmin's attempts of judicial redress by its repeated disregard for the Supreme Court decisions and the final reassignment of the mining rights in 2012 amounted to violations of Respondent's international obligations.27\n\nLetter from EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. to the Government of the Slovak Republic, dated December 23, 2013 (**Exhibit c-42**), paras. 29-30.\n\n40.\n\nThe notification was answered by the Respondent on January 28, 2014, whereby the Respondent stated that the *\"letter of 23 December* [was] *the first information that the Slovak Republic received regarding a dispute from Belmont Resources Inc.\"28* It was in that letter that the Respondent opposed Belmont's positions, alleging that it had *\"acted in full compliance with the Agreement at all times and dispute[d] the allegations to the contrary in your* [Belmont's] *letter.\"* This meeting of opposing views in 2014, *i.e.* after the critical date, therefore marks the birth of the dispute brought before the Tribunal.\n\nLetter from Mr. Peter Kazimr, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic to Dr. Hamid Gharavi, dated January 28, 2014 (**Exhibit c-59**).\n\n41.\n\nIn conclusion, and strongly dissenting from the Majority, my opinion is that the dispute brought before the Tribunal by Belmont with respect to the Slovak authorities\u2019 actions vis-\u00e0-vis Rozmin\u2019s mining rights falls under the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and is not barred by the *ratione temporis* scope of Article XV(6) of the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider all facts relevant to that dispute, including facts that took place before March 14, 2009, consistent with Article XV(6) of the BIT."}], "Content": "Award of the Tribunal\n---------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF DEFINED TERMS AND SELECTED ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| 1985 Company | The term used by the Claimants to refer to EuroGas Inc., a Utah corporation incorporated in 1985 |\n| 1995 Kilik Report | J\u00e1n Kilik, et al., \"Final Report and the Supply Calculation, Talc - VP,\" 31 March 1995.

According to the Claimants, EuroGas is a continuation of another company named EuroGas Inc. that was incorporated in 1985 and administratively dissolved in 2001.3 The Director of EuroGas is Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, a national of Germany.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the Claimant EuroGas as \"EuroGas II\" and the previous company as \"EuroGas I,\" whereas the Claimants refer to the Claimant EuroGas as \"EuroGas\" and the previous company as the \"1985 Company.\" As noted below, the Tribunal uses the terms \"EuroGas I\" and \"EuroGas II\" in parts of this Award. The use of this terminology in this Award is without prejudice to, and in no way reflects, the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of any issue disputed by the Parties.\n\n5.\n\nBelmont was constituted on 18 January 1978. Its corporate head office is located at 625 Howe Street, Suite 600, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 2T6.\n\n6.\n\nThe respondent is the Slovak Republic (also referred to as the **\"Respondent\"),** which became an independent State on 1 January 1993. The Respondent has been an ICSID Contracting State since 26 June 1994.\n\n**B.

It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal. Further factual material will be addressed in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the issues in dispute below.\n\n**(1) The Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma Talc Deposit**\n----------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma talc deposit, located in the Kosice region of the Slovak Republic, is among the largest talc deposits in the world.4 The existence of talc in the area was first discovered in 1988 by the Czechoslovakian State-owned entity Geologick\u00ff prieskum s.p., Spissk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves **(\"GPS\")** while performing exploration works in search of tin.5 The quality of the talc deposit was confirmed by additional exploration boreholes drilled between 1988 and 1992.6\n\nMemorial \u00b657; Counter-Memorial \u00b6202; Reply \u00b6242; *The Slovak Spectator,* \"Austrian firm to open talc mine in Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma in Kosice region,\" 4 October 2011 (C-116).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6202; J\u00e1n Kilik, Geological Characteristics of the Talc Deposit in Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma - Dlh\u00e1 dolina, Acta Montanistica Slovaca Year Vol. 2 (1997), 1, 71-80, p. 71 (C-117).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6205; Reply \u00b6242.\n\n9.\n\nIn order to carry out additional exploration, GPS formally applied to the Slovak Ministry of Environment for the assignment of the exploration area, and its application was granted on 16 April 1993.7\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6205.\n\n10.\n\nOn 21 May 1993, the Ministry of the Environment issued a \"Certificate of Exclusive Mineral Deposit\" on the basis of a notice filed by GPS.8 This Certificate designated the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit as an \"exclusive deposit\" based on an exploration report showing that \"[e]merging from the mineral deposit is a vein of the highest quality talc.\"9\n\nCertificate of Exclusive Mineral Deposit issued by the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic, 21 May 1993 (Ref. 6.3/638-792/93) (C-118).\n\nCertificate of Exclusive Mineral Deposit issued by the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic, 21 May 1993 (Ref. 6.3/638-792/93) (C-118).\n\n11.\n\nBy that time, the Slovak Government had begun to seek private capital from foreign investors to develop the deposit.10 In 1992, the Government entered into discussions with Gebr\u00fcder Dorfner GmbH & Co. Kaolin-und Kristallquarzsand-Werke KG **(\"Dorfner\"),** a large German mining company.11 On 18 June 1993, GPS and Dorfner executed a letter of intent to establish an association for the funding and execution of a geological survey of the deposit.12\n\nMemorial \u00b665; Counter-Memorial \u00b6206.\n\nMemorial \u00b665; Counter-Memorial \u00b6206.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6207; Information for the Head of the Office of the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic prepared by Mr. T\u00f4zs\u00e9r, 8 November 1996 (R-121), point 1.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 February 1994, GPS, Dorfner, and two Slovak companies (HELL, spot s.r.o., and MR Trading, a.s.) entered into a Contract of Association.13 The parties agreed to assess the deposit, to prepare a feasibility study for its future commercial exploitation and, if this study yielded positive results, to incorporate a Slovak mining company to exploit the deposit.14\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6207-208; Reply \u00b6247; Information for the Head of the Office of the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic prepared by Mr. T\u00f6zs\u00e9r, 8 November 1996 (R-121), point 2.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6208; Reply \u00b6247; Corej WS \u00b69; Mr. Stephan Dorfner WS \u00b67; Information for the Head of the Office of the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic prepared by Mr. T\u00f6zs\u00e9r, 8 November 1996 (R-121), point 2.\n\n13.\n\nDorfner subcontracted the German group Thyssen Schachtbau GmbH **(\"Thyssen\")** and its Austrian subsidiary \u00d6STU Industriemineral Consult GmbH **(\"\u00d6STU\")** to perform a technical evaluation of the deposit for the feasibility study.15\n\nMemorial \u00b669; Counter-Memorial \u00b6209; Reply \u00b6248.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, although GPS remained involved, Dorfner was the \"driving force behind the project.\"16 The Claimants submit that the Respondent chose not to engage in talc exploration and financed the drilling of only one borehole after 1993.17 The Respondent asserts that its work on the deposit continued, and the results of that work were set out in a final report on 31 March 1995 (the **\"1995 Kilik Report\").18** By then, according to the Respondent, it had fully financed 15 boreholes.19\n\nReply \u00b6247\n\nMemorial \u00b664; Rozlozn\u00edk WS \u00b610; Reply \u00b6245.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6210; J\u00e1n Kilik, et al., \"Final Report and the Supply Calculation, Talc - VP,\" 31 March 1995, pp. 73-74, (C-117/R-120).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6210.\n\n15.\n\nUnder Article 24(1) of the Act No. 44/1988 on Protection and Utilization of Mineral Resources (the **\"Mining Act\"),** an organization\u2019s right to excavate an exclusive deposit arises when the District Mining Office assigns the excavation area to it.20 On 25 July 1996, the District Mining Office in Spissk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves (the **\"DMO\")** assigned a 4,965 square km mining area of the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit (the **\"Mining Area\")21** to GPS\u2019s successor entity,22 Geologick\u00e1 sluzba SR **(\"Geological Survey\").23**\n\nSection 24(1) of the Act No. 44/1988 Coll, on the Protection and Utilization of Mineral Resources, as amended (R-166).\n\nRespondent uses the term \"Excavation Area.\"\n\nDue to reorganization of the state administration, on 1 January 1996, GPS ceased to exist and Geological Survey became its legal successor.

It identified an area of high expected talc concentration where the deposit was planned to be opened.25 The results were positive, but the conceptual nature of the Feasibility Study meant that these findings would need to be confirmed and further assessment and mapping performed.26\n\nFeasibility Study Outline, TALC - GEMERSKA POLOMA, E.

The DMO issued this authorization on 14 May 1997 (the **\"General Mining Authorization\").29** It was valid for an indefinite period and allowed Rozmin to carry out mining activities on exclusive deposits in the Slovak Republic subject to its compliance with other statutory and regulatory requirements.30\n\nMining Authorization issued by the District Mining Office, 14 May 1997 (C-22); Memorial \u00b679; Counter-Memorial \u00b6218.\n\nMining Authorization issued by the District Mining Office, 14 May 1997 (C-22); Memorial \u00b679; Counter-Memorial \u00b6218.\n\n19.\n\nOn 5 June 1997, the DMO approved the transfer of the Mining Area from Geological Survey to Rozmin. Geological Survey and Rozmin then entered into an \"Agreement for the Transfer of the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma Mining Area\" dated June 11, 1997 (the **\"Transfer Agreement\").31** The transfer was certified by the DMO on 24 June 1997.32\n\nAgreement on the Transfer of the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma Mining Area, dated June 11, 1997 (C-23).\n\nCertificate on acquisition of rights to the mining area issued by the District Mining Office, 24 June 1997 (Ref. 1520-465-V/97).

The Supreme Court found that the DMO had failed to give Rozmin proper notice of the revocation of its mining rights and had \"committed a whole series of severe procedural misconducts.\"78 The Supreme Court concluded that the assignment of the Mining Area to Economy Agency should be cancelled and ordered the DMO to carry out additional proceedings.\n\nMemorial \u00b6186; Decision of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, 27 February 2008 (Ref. 6Sz0/61/2007-121) (C-33).\n\nDecision of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, 27 February 2008 (Ref. 6Sz0/61/2007-121) (C-33).\n\n50.\n\nOn 2 July 2008, the DMO awarded the Mining Area to VSK Mining.79 According to the Respondent, the process by which this was done fully complied with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision; formal proceedings were held, including Rozmin as a party.80 The Claimants disagree, arguing that the assignment was effected through a \"corporate sleight of hand,\" without any new tender proceedings.81\n\nDecision of the District Mining Office on the Assignment of the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma Mining Area to VSK Mining s.r.o., 2 July 2 2008 (Ref. 329-1506/2008) (C-34).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6321.\n\nMemorial \u00b6192.

In its decision of 18 May 2011, the Supreme Court held, *inter alia,* that the 2002 Amendment did not have retroactive effect and, therefore, the three-year period could not commence until 1 January 2002.85 The Supreme Court also found that the decision to revoke Rozmin\u2019s mining rights and to award them to another company was \"premature, unclear and insufficiently reasoned.\"86 It declared the DMO\u2019s 2 July 2008 assignment to VSK Mining unlawful and remanded the case to the DMO for further proceedings.87\n\nDecision of the Regional Court in Kosice, 3 February 2010 (Ref. 7S/25/2009-207) (C-272).\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, Case No.2Szo/132/, 18 May 2011 (C-36/R-61).\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, Case No.2Szo/132/, 18 May 2011, p. 25 (C-36/R-61).\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, Case No.2Szo/132/, 18 May 2011 (C-36/R-61).\n\n54.\n\nFollowing issuance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, on 31 October 2011, EuroGas sent a \"Notification of Claim Against the Slovak Republic\" to the Respondent, referring to an investment dispute under the US-Slovakia BIT.88\n\nReply \u00b6189, *citing* Letter from EuroGas Inc. to the Government of the Slovak Republic, dated 31 October 2011 (C- 39).\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent failed to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision when, on 30 March 2012, the DMO reassigned exclusive rights over the Mining Area to VSK Mining.89\n\nMemorial \u00b6205; Decision of the District Mining Office, 30 March 2012 (Ref. 157-920/2012) (C-37/R-58).\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this decision was based on a thorough investigation and analysis that comported with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Ultimately, according to the Respondent, the DMO determined that between 1 January 2002 and 1 January 2005, Rozmin did not excavate at the Mining Area and failed to perform any of activities that were necessary to lead to excavation, resulting in the application of Section 27(12) of the 2002 Amendment.90 The DMO also concluded that Rozmin\u2019s activities were speculative, aimed not at excavating the site but at finding a company to buy Rozmin out of the project.91\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6329-332; Decision of the District Mining Office, 30 March 2012 (Ref. 157-920/2012) (C-37/R-58).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6330; Decision of the District Mining Office, 30 March 2012, p. 210 (Ref. 157-920/2012) (C-37/R-58).\n\n57.\n\nThe MMO subsequently confirmed the DMO\u2019s 30 March 2012 decision, and Rozmin did not challenge it in the courts.92\n\nDecision of the Main Mining Office, 1 August 2012 (Ref. 808- 1482/2012) (C-273).\n\n58.\n\nOn 2 May 2012, Mr. Peter Kazimir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic, responded to EuroGas\u2019 Notice of 31 October 2011, stating that it would be premature to engage in settlement negotiations because local proceedings were pending.93\n\nLetter from the Slovak Republic, dated 2 May 2012 (C-40) (\"the administrative procedure before the Slovak mining offices is still pending, therefore any discussions regarding the alleged claims of EuroGas Inc. seems to me to be premature prior relevant decisions of local authorities are rendered.\").\n\n59.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, Mr. Kazimir again wrote to EuroGas in reference to the 31 October 2011 Notice.94 The letter stated that the Respondent was exercising its right under Article VI of the US-Slovakia BIT to \"deny EuroGas, Inc. the benefits of the Treaty, including the right to arbitration.\"95\n\nLetter from the Slovak Republic to EuroGas Inc., 21 December 2012 (C-41/R-5).\n\nLetter from the Slovak Republic to EuroGas Inc., 21 December 2012 (C-41/R-5).\n\n60.\n\nSeparately, Rozmin had challenged the DMO\u2019s revocation of the General Mining Authorization in the Regional Court.

Ultimately, on 26 September 2013, the Regional Court confirmed the DMO\u2019s decision to revoke Rozmin\u2019s General Mining Authorization.96\n\nDecision of the Regional Court in Kosice, 19 January 2012 (Ref. 6S/28/2009-175) (C-175).\n\n61.\n\nOn 23 December 2013, EuroGas and Belmont together sent the Respondent a \"Final Notice of Dispute under US-Slovak Republic and Canada-Slovak Republic BITs.\"97 According to the Claimants, the Respondent replied by citing the six-month period of negotiation and consultation under Article X(2) of the Canada-Slovakia Republic BIT.98 The Parties had further exchanges and met on 16 April 2014, but no amicable settlement was reached.99\n\nLetter from EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. to the Government of the Slovak Republic, 23 December 2013, \u00b635 (C-42) (\"Failing a favorable response from the Republic of Slovakia by January 31, 2014, accepting to engage in good faith in settlement negotiations with EuroGas and Belmont towards an agreement on compensation, an ICSID arbitration will be commenced by EuroGas and Belmont.\").\n\nReply \u00b6193.\n\nReply \u00b6193.\n\n**(9) EuroGas and the U.S. Bankruptcy Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn the meantime, in 2001, EuroGas I had been administratively dissolved under Utah law.\n\n63.\n\nIn 2004, the creditors of EuroGas I filed an involuntary petition for bankruptcy against the company under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the **\"Bankruptcy Code\")** in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the District of Utah (the **\"Bankruptcy Court\").100** On 20 October 2004, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the liquidation of EuroGas I (the **\"Bankruptcy Proceedings\")** by a Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Joel T. Marker **(\"Trustee Marker\").** Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, Mr. Reinhard Rauball (Wolfgang\u2019s brother), and Mr. Hank Blankenstein (EuroGas I\u2019s CFO) were appointed to act for EuroGas I as the debtor.101 EuroGas I did not file any statements or schedules of assets during the Bankruptcy Proceedings.102 On 19 March 2007, the case was closed with Trustee Marker\u2019s final report, which does not include any reference to EuroGas GmbH or Rozmin.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b640; A Public U.S. Bankruptcy Filing from the EuroGas Bankruptcy Case, Case No. 04-28075, Docket No. 1 - EuroGas Bankruptcy Petition, 18 May 2004 (R-85).\n\nOrder Designating Individuals Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9001(5), 27 January 2005 (R-68).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b643; see Reply \u00b634.\n\n64.\n\nOn 18 September 2015, a U.S. bankruptcy trustee received a letter from a creditor of EuroGas I, Texas EuroGas Corp., stating that EuroGas I owned an interest in \"Rozmin and EuroGas GmbH talc mines in Slovakia\" that was omitted from its bankruptcy disclosures.103 The U.S. Trustee filed a motion to reopen the bankruptcy of EuroGas I, which was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on 21 December 2015.104\n\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s Motion to Reopen Under 11 U.S.C. \u00b6350, for an Order to Appoint Chapter 7 Trustee Under Fed.

Parties\u2019 Requests for Relief**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Requests for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute with respect to both EuroGas and Belmont, and they allege that the Respondent has breached several of its obligations under the US-Slovakia BIT and the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n68.\n\nIn the Memorial, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n*\u2022 Declare that Respondent has breached its obligations toward Claimants under the US-Slovak Republic BIT, the Canada-Slovak Republic BIT, and international law.*\n\n*\u2022 Order Respondent to pay Claimants damages in an amount to be quantified at a later stage of the proceedings, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions.108*\n\nMemorial \u00b6446.\n\n69.\n\nIn the Reply, the Claimants further request that the Tribunal:\n\n*\u2022 Declare that it has jurisdiction over Claimants under the BITs and the ICSID Convention.*\n\n*\u2022 Declare that Respondent has breached its obligations toward Claimants under the U.S.-Slovak Republic BIT, the Canada-Slovak Republic BIT, and international law, including the obligation not to expropriate Claimants\u2019 investment safe for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner, and upon payment of compensation; the obligation to afford Claimants fair and equitable treatment; the obligation to refrain from taking unreasonable and arbitrary measures; the obligation to afford Claimants full protection and security; and the obligation to comply with its specific undertakings.*\n\n*\u2022 Order Respondent to pay Claimants damages, costs, and compounded interest, in an amount to be quantified at a later stage of the proceedings, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions.109*\n\nReply \u00b6632.\n\n70.\n\nSubsequently, by letter of 25 December 2015, the Claimants stated that they were raising a new claim for breach of international law based on an allegation that the Respondent had illegally interfered with EuroGas\u2019 title over its claims in this arbitration by causing the reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Requests for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over both EuroGas and Belmont and that the case should be dismissed on this basis. On the merits, the Respondent denies each of the Claimants\u2019 allegations of breach of the US-Slovakia BIT and the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial and in the Rejoinder, the Respondent requests the following relief\n\n*(a) a declaration dismissing Claimants\u2019 claims;*\n\n*(b) an order that Claimants pay the costs of these arbitral proceedings, including the cost of the Arbitral Tribunal and the**legal and other costs incurred by the Slovak Republic, on a full indemnity basis; and*\n\n*(c) interest on any costs awarded to the Slovak Republic, in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal.110*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6407; Rejoinder \u00b6550.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nOn 27 June 2014, ICSID received from the Claimants a request for arbitration dated 25 June 2014, including exhibits C-l through C-42, against the Respondent (the **\"Request for Arbitration\"),** pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n74.\n\nThe Request was supplemented by the Claimants\u2019 letters of 8 and 9 July 2014 in response to questions posed by ICSID.\n\n75.\n\nOn 10 July 2014, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nBy an exchange of letters dated 22 and 24 July 2014, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be composed of three members, with each Party appointing one arbitrator by 29 August 2014, and the two Party-appointed arbitrators jointly appointing the President of the Tribunal after consultations with the Parties by 30 September 2014, failing which the appointment(s) would be made by the ICSID Secretary-General.\n\n77.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties\u2019 agreed method of appointment, on 29 August 2014, each Party appointed an arbitrator. The Claimants appointed Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, a national of France, and the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, also a national of France. Both arbitrators subsequently accepted their appointments.\n\n78.\n\nOn 30 September 2014, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to an amended schedule for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.\n\n79.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that the Party-appointed arbitrators proposed to appoint Professor Pierre Mayer, a national of France, to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n80.\n\nIn response to this proposal, on 24 October 2014, the Respondent made a disclosure concerning its counsel\u2019s relationship with Professor Mayer in a separate case, and on this basis, the Claimants objected to his proposed appointment. In light of this objection, on 4 November 2014, Professor Mayer declined to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n81.\n\nAt this stage, as the Parties\u2019 agreed deadline for the Party-appointed arbitrators to appoint the President had elapsed, the Parties agreed to an alternative appointment procedure by letters of 7 November 2014. Under this procedure, the ICSID Secretary-General would provide the Parties with a list of candidates from which the Parties would strike one candidate and rank those remaining. The Secretary-General would then appoint the candidate with the best ranking. On 1 December 2014, ICSID provided the Parties with a list of candidates.\n\n82.\n\nThe appointment procedure was postponed by agreement of the Parties on 2 and 24 December 2014 and 1 and 8 January 2015, and the list of candidates was amended on 19 and 23 December 2014. Before the procedure was completed, on 13 January 2015, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to appoint Professor Pierre Mayer as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n83.\n\nProfessor Mayer accepted his appointment on 20 January 2015. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Parties\u2019 Requests for Provisional Measures**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nOn 8 July 2014, the Claimants submitted a letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID containing an Application for Provisional Measures, which related to criminal proceedings launched by the Slovak Republic in June 2014.\n\n85.\n\nAs the Tribunal had not yet been constituted, the Claimants requested, pursuant to Rule 39(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that the Secretary-General establish time limits for the Parties to present their observations on the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, which could then be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n86.\n\nOn 10 July 2014, together with the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General provided the Parties with a schedule for their written submissions on the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, noting that it would apply unless the Parties agreed on an alternative schedule.\n\n87.\n\nOn 16 July 2014, the Claimants sent a letter to the President of the European Commission, copied to the Respondent and ICSID, setting forth allegations concerning the actions of the Slovak Republic in response to the Request for Arbitration and informing the European Commission that the Claimants had filed an application for provisional measures with ICSID.\n\n88.\n\nIn accordance with the briefing schedule established by the Secretary-General, on 11 August 2014, the Claimants submitted a Full Briefing on Provisional Measures.\n\n89.\n\nOn 10 September 2014, the Respondent submitted its Opposition to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, together with an Application for Provisional Measures in which it sought an order requiring the Claimants to post security for the Respondent\u2019s costs.\n\n90.\n\nBy letter of 11 September 2014, ICSID acknowledged receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, and informed the Parties that they were welcome to agree on a schedule for the Parties to present their observations on this Application, or alternatively, either Party could request the Secretary-General of ICSID to establish such a schedule pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5).\n\n91.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed upon a briefing schedule for the exchange of written submissions on both Parties\u2019 applications for provisional measures, and ICSID acknowledged the Parties\u2019 agreement by letter of the same date. The Parties informed ICSID on 30 September 2014 that they had agreed to an amended briefing schedule.\n\n92.\n\nIn accordance with this agreed schedule, the Parties filed the following submissions:\n\na. Claimants\u2019 Reply on their Application for Provisional Measures and Answer to Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated 16 October 2014;\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s Reply Application for Provisional Measures and Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures dated 21 November 2014; and\n\nc. Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated 22 December 2014.\n\n93.\n\nOn 23 January 2015, the Respondent sought to enter an additional legal authority into the record (RL-25), and the Tribunal granted this request by letter of 27 January 2015. The Tribunal also offered the Claimants an opportunity to comment on this new authority. In response, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they may choose to address the authority at an oral hearing on provisional measures, should the Tribunal decide to hold such a hearing.\n\n94.\n\nBy letter of 27 January 2015, the Tribunal proposed dates for a first session and hearing on provisional measures in Paris. The Respondent replied on 28 January 2015, stating that key members of its counsel team were unavailable on the proposed dates due to a hearing in another matter.\n\n95.\n\nBy letter of 2 February 2015, the Claimants argued that it would be unacceptable for the Respondent\u2019s unavailability to delay an order on the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures and requested that the Tribunal either proceed to issue an Order on that Application forthwith or, alternatively, issue a provisional order prohibiting Respondent and its counsel from reading and gathering information from records and property seized in the context of the relevant criminal proceedings.\n\n96.\n\nIn response to an invitation from the Tribunal, on 5 February 2015, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants\u2019 letter of 2 February 2015. The Respondent noted in particular that the relevant criminal proceedings had been suspended and that neither counsel for the Respondent nor the Slovak Ministry of Finance had read or gathered any information from the materials seized in the investigation. The Respondent also undertook that they would not read or gather such information pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n97.\n\nOn 9 February 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in light of the Respondent\u2019s undertaking, it considered that the Claimants\u2019 request of 2 February 2015 had been rendered moot.\n\n98.\n\nOn 20 February 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, in light of a settlement in another matter, its counsel would be available to attend an in-person hearing on 17 March 2015.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal then confirmed that the first session and the hearing on provisional measures would be held at the ICC in Paris, France on 17 March 2015. Prior to the hearing, on 6 March 2015, the Parties submitted a jointly proposed schedule for the first session and hearing, which the Tribunal adopted.\n\n100.\n\nBy letter of 15 March 2015, the Respondent sought to introduce three new exhibits into the record (R-81 to R-83), to which the Claimants objected. In a decision communicated to the Parties on 16 March 2015, the Tribunal determined that the new exhibits would not be entered into the record prior to the hearing, but that following the hearing, the exhibits would be admitted and the Claimants given an opportunity to comment. In accordance with this decision, the Respondent resubmitted the documents on 23 March 2015 and the Claimants provided their observations on 3 April 2015. The Respondent then submitted additional comments on this issue on 16 April 2015.\n\n101.\n\nThe first session and hearing on provisional measures was held on 17 March 2015 at the ICC in Paris. During the hearing, in accordance with the Parties\u2019 agreed schedule, each Party was given the opportunity to present oral arguments on provisional measures as well as rebuttal oral arguments. The audio recording of the first session and hearing was dispatched to the Tribunal and the Parties on 30 March 2015.\n\n102.\n\nOn 25 June 2015, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Provisional Measures (Procedural Order No. 3). In its Decision, the Tribunal (a) denied both Parties\u2019 applications for provisional measures; (b) noted certain undertakings made by the Respondent during the hearing on provisional measures; and (c) reminded the Parties of their duty not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration.\n\n**D. Initial Procedural Matters**\n---------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nOn 16 February 2015, in preparation for the first session, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a draft agenda for the session and a draft procedural order, which had been approved by the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to confer on procedural matters and to inform the Tribunal of any agreements they reached or, in the absence of agreement, of their respective positions.\n\n104.\n\nOn 1 March 2015, the President proposed the appointment of Ms. Marie Nioche to serve as Assistant to the Tribunal and set out the proposed terms of her appointment. The Parties subsequently agreed to the appointment of Ms. Nioche as assistant, and she provided a signed declaration of confidentiality and independence dated 13 March 2015.\n\n105.\n\nOn 6 March 2015, the Parties submitted a joint draft procedural order, and each Party submitted a separate letter setting out its position on the limited number of disputed matters. Among those matters were:\n\na. *Bifurcation:* In the Respondent\u2019s view, bifurcation of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections from the merits would be necessary to resolve the dispute in a time and cost efficient manner. The Claimants submitted that the contemplated jurisdictional objections would not warrant a bifurcation, and that the dispute could be promptly resolved in one phase.\n\nb. *Public Access to Hearings and Documents:* The Respondent requested that the proceeding comply with the transparency provisions of Annex B of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which provide for public access to hearings and case documents. The Claimants objected to this request on the basis that the Annex was not applicable to either Claimant.\n\nc. *Applicability of Confidentiality Rules to Third-Party Funders:* By letter of 23 January 2015, the Respondent had requested that \"Claimants specify the identity of their third-party funder for the purposes of determining whether there is any conflict of interests.\" The Respondent also sought to include a provision in the procedural order stating that any third-party funder would not be granted access to confidential information, and the Claimant considered this provision unjustified.\n\n106.\n\nOn 15 March 2015, the Respondent sought leave to introduce into the record three new exhibits. After receiving comments from the Claimants, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the new documents would be admitted to the record only after the hearing on provisional measures.\n\n107.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first session was held together with the hearing on provisional measures on 17 March 2015 at the ICC in Paris. The Tribunal and the Parties discussed procedural matters, including those noted above.\n\n108.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision that the Claimants should disclose the identity of the third-party funder, and that the third-party funder would have the normal obligations of confidentiality.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal also instructed the Claimants to produce the Share Purchase Agreement between EuroGas, Belmont and Rozmin, dated 27 March 2001 (the **\"SPA\");** another agreement between EuroGas, Belmont, Rozmin, and RimaMur\u00e1\u0148, dated 9 April 2001; as well as all other agreements related to the SPA.\n\n110.\n\nBy letter of 23 March 2015, as instructed, the Claimants disclosed the name of the funder and filed the SPA and other documents.\n\n111.\n\nAlso on 23 March 2015, the Respondent filed the three new documents mentioned in its 15 March 2015 letter as R-81 to R-83 and provided comments on their relevance.\n\n112.\n\nOn 24 March 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision not to bifurcate the proceedings between the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute, but rather to hear jurisdiction and merits in a single phase, followed if necessary by a separate phase on quantum. The Tribunal also confirmed the corresponding agreed schedule for the Parties\u2019 written submissions.\n\n113.\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the other procedural matters addressed during the first session. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France.\n\n114.\n\nOn 16 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 addressing the issue of public access to hearings and documents. The Tribunal ordered *inter alia,* that in accordance with Annex B of the Canada-Slovakia BIT:\n\n*2. Hearings held shall be open to the public. To the extent necessary to ensure the protection of confidential information, the Tribunal may hold portions of hearings in camera.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal shall establish procedures for the protection of confidential information and appropriate logistical arrangements for open hearings, in consultation with the parties.*\n\n*4. All documents submitted to, or issued by, the Tribunal shall be publicly available, unless the parties otherwise agree, subject to the redaction of confidential information.*\n\n*5.... any Tribunal award shall be publicly available, subject to the redaction of confidential information.*\n\n115.\n\nOn 14 May 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding the procedures for making documents open to the public and identifying confidential information. In response, on 11 June 2015, the Parties provided the Tribunal with a jointly proposed draft Confidentiality Order. On 18 June 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had no objection to their proposal and issued the Confidentiality Order signed by the President. The Parties then signed the Confidentiality Order and provided a copy to the Tribunal.\n\n**E. Written Phase**\n--------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar, the Claimants submitted their Memorial dated 31 March 2015, together with:\n\n\u2022 the witness statements of Dr. Ondrej Rozloznik, Mr. Vojtech Agyagos and Mr. Wolfgang Rauball;\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Mr. Alex Hill of Wardell Armstrong International;\n\n\u2022 exhibits C-75 to C-307; and\n\n\u2022 legal authorities CL-125 to CL-195.\n\n117.\n\nOn 30 June 2015, also in accordance with the procedural calendar, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial, together with:\n\n\u2022 the witness statements of Messrs. Peter Corej, Peter Kukelcik, Ernst Haidecker and Stephan Dorfner;\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Ms. Annette W. Jarvis of Dorsey & Whitney LLP;\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Mr. John Anderson of Stikeman Elliott LLP;\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Mr. Gregory Sparks of John T. Boyd Company;\n\n\u2022 exhibits R-84 to R-209; and\n\n\u2022 legal authorities RL-26 to RL-132.\n\n118.\n\nOn 29 July 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Respondent requesting that the Respondent\u2019s expert Ms. Annette W. Jarvis step down on the basis that she lacked independence. The Claimants stated that if Ms. Jarvis did not step down, they would formally apply to the Tribunal to seek her disqualification.\n\n119.\n\nOn 31 July 2015, in accordance with Article 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, each Party informed the Tribunal that it had served on the other Party a request for the production of documents, and they asked that the Tribunal establish a schedule for the document production phase of the proceeding. The Tribunal then invited the Parties to agree on the dates of the various steps of the procedure for production of documents. On 7 August 2015, the Parties provided the Tribunal with an agreed timetable, which was adopted by the Tribunal. In accordance with that timetable, on 17 August 2015, each Party submitted a Redfern schedule containing its requests for the production of documents, the other Party\u2019s objections to production, and the requesting Party\u2019s responses to those objections.\n\n120.\n\nOn 10 August 2015, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimants\u2019 objection to Ms. Annette W. Jarvis, together with a Statement from Ms. Jarvis, rejecting the Claimants\u2019 request for her to step down.\n\n121.\n\nOn 19 August 2015, the Claimants submitted a letter requesting \"as primary relief and while reserving their rights, that the Tribunal read the opinion of Ms. Jarvis not as an independent expert report, but as a Party submission.\" In response, on 24 August 2015, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to \"deny Claimants\u2019 request for an evidentiary ruling regarding Ms. Jarvis\u2019 expert report at this stage of the proceedings.\"\n\n122.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its view that, as the Claimants were not seeking the disqualification of Ms. Jarvis, no procedural ruling relating to her expert report was needed. In response to the Tribunal\u2019s decision, on 27 August 2015, the Claimants wrote to clarify their request. The Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 letter on the same day. On 28 August 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that Ms. Jarvis\u2019 report remained an expert report and that \"[t]he Tribunal will assess its probative value, taking in consideration all relevant circumstances, which may include those which the Parties have debated in their recent letters.\"\n\n123.\n\nIn the meantime, on 26 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, including Annexes A and B, containing its decisions on the Parties\u2019 document requests.\n\n124.\n\nOn 7 September 2015, the Claimants requested an extension of time, from 15 to 29 September 2015, to file their Reply Memorial. The Respondent informed the Tribunal by letter of 8 September 2015 that it opposed such an extension. Having considered the Parties\u2019 comments on the matter, on 16 September 2015, the Tribunal granted the request and also extended the deadline for the submission of the Rejoinder to 29 December 2015.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants then filed their Reply dated 29 September 2015, together with:\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Messrs. David E. Leta and Brad W. Merrill of Snell & Wilmer;\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Mr. John Ellison of KPMG with appendices;\n\n\u2022 the supplemental expert report of Mr. Alex Hill of Wardell Armstrong International;\n\n\u2022 exhibits C-308 to C-358; and\n\n\u2022 legal authorities CL-196 to CL-256.\n\n126.\n\nOn 28 October 2015, the President of the Tribunal provided the Parties with a supplementary disclosure statement regarding his appointment in another ICSID case.\n\n127.\n\nOn 29 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder, together with:\n\n\u2022 the rebuttal witness statement of Messrs. Peter Corej, Peter K\u00fakelc\u00edk and Stephan Dorfner;\n\n\u2022 the rebuttal expert report of Ms. Annette W. Jarvis and Mr. Samuel P. Gardiner from Dorsey & Whitney LLP;\n\n\u2022 the rebuttal expert report of Mr. John Anderson from Stikeman Elliott LLP;\n\n\u2022 the rebuttal expert report of Messrs. Gregory Sparks from John T. Boyd Company;\n\n\u2022 the expert report of Mr. Abdul Sirshar Qureshi from PricewaterhouseCoopers;\n\n\u2022 exhibits R-212 to R-290; and\n\n\u2022 legal authorities RL-133 to RL-194.\n\n128.\n\nOn 6 November 2015, in preparation for the hearing scheduled to take place from 18 to 22 January 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult regarding the logistical arrangements for the open hearing, including procedures for the protection of confidential information, and to revert to the Tribunal in this regard. On 16 November 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement that a video recording of the hearing would be made available on the ICSID website only after the conclusion of the hearing and the identification of any confidential information.\n\n129.\n\nOn 6 April 2016, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Ms. Nioche had left his firm and proposed Ms. C\u00e9line Lachmann to replace Ms. Nioche as Assistant to the Tribunal. Both Parties subsequently consented to the appointment of Ms. Lachmann, and she provided a signed declaration of confidentiality and independence dated 12 April 2016.\n\n**F. Developments in the Bankruptcy Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal in reference to a statement in the Claimants\u2019 Reply that there was an attempt to reopen the bankruptcy of EuroGas. The Respondent attached to its letter the Motion to Reopen, which concerned an interest in \"Rozmin and EuroGas GmbH talc mines in Slovakia.\"\n\n131.\n\nOn 5 October 2015, the Tribunal confirmed that it had taken note of the information in the Respondent\u2019s letter and that it expected to be informed by the Parties of any related developments.\n\n132.\n\nBy letter of 9 November 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it had learned that EuroGas had engaged counsel in Utah to oppose reopening the bankruptcy and that an oral hearing on the matter was scheduled for 10 December 2015. The Respondent stated that, in light of these facts, it would likely retain counsel to participate in the reopening proceeding.\n\n133.\n\nThe following day, on 10 November 2015, the Claimants pointed out what they considered to be a number of inaccuracies in the Respondent\u2019s letter. The Claimants confirmed that the hearing on the reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings would take place on 10 December 2015.\n\n134.\n\nBy letter of 22 December 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that on 21 December 2015, the Bankruptcy Court had issued its written decision granting the U.S. Trustee\u2019s Motion to Reopen the bankruptcy. A copy of the decision was attached as Exhibit A.\n\n135.\n\nOn 25 December 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to:\n\n*(i) provide the Tribunal with a more comprehensive and relevant account of the latest developments* [US Proceeding]; *(ii) raise a claim for breach of international law arising out of the Slovak Republic\u2019s illegal interference with EuroGas\u2019 title over the claims which it has put forward in this arbitration; and (in) to reserve their right to request a stay of proceedings upon completion of the assessment that they are undertaking.*\n\n136.\n\nThe following day, the Respondent submitted a brief response to the Claimants\u2019 letter, arguing *inter alia* that the Claimants\u2019 allegations and new claim were baseless.\n\n**G. Postponement of the Hearing**\n----------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nOn 29 December 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, requesting a postponement of the hearing scheduled for 18 to 22 January 2016 or, alternatively, a stay of the proceeding until the issuance of the Trustee Loveridge\u2019s final decision. The Claimants argued that the appointment of Trustee Loveridge \"undeniably has a material impact on the arbitration proceedings, irrespective of his/her ultimate decision.\" The Claimants also asked the Tribunal to set out a timetable for Respondent to make a written submission on quantum \"so as to mitigate the consequences of any delays.\"\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its response to the Claimants\u2019 letter on 30 December 2015, urging the Tribunal to maintain the scheduled hearing dates and objecting in particular to the Claimants\u2019 suggestion that, if the hearing were postponed, the Respondent should be ordered to submit a written pleading on quantum in the meantime. The Respondent argued that this would vacate the Tribunal\u2019s decision to bifurcate quantum.\n\n139.\n\nOn 2 January 2016, the Secretary informed the Parties of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to maintain the scheduled hearing dates. The Parties were reminded of the dates for witness notification and the prehearing conference.\n\n140.\n\nOn 5 January 2016, the Claimants\u2019 counsel provided the Tribunal with a letter they had received that day from their clients (Mr. Vojtech Agyagos, President of Belmont and Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, CEO of EuroGas). The letter stated that as a result of the reopened Bankruptcy Proceedings:\n\n*we feel that a conflict of interest has arisen between our two companies, and we are therefore no longer confident in your ability to jointly represent both of our companies' interests independently.**To put it as clearly as possible, given the circumstances, we can no longer allow you to jointly represent our interests in this arbitration.*\n\n141.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants explained that under the circumstances, they were not in a position to proceed with the hearing as scheduled.\n\n142.\n\nOn 7 January 2016, the Respondent identified which of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses it intended to cross-examine at the hearing.\n\n143.\n\nAlso on 7 January 2016, the Respondent objected to the postponement of the hearing, arguing that \"an unspecified conflict-of-interest, which existed since the beginning of the arbitration, cannot possibly be a basis for Claimants to not proceed with the Hearing.\" The Respondent also made the following request, pursuant to Rule 42 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n*Claimants are now a \"defaulting party\" within the meaning of Rule 42(1) of the Arbitration Rules, and the Slovak Republic respectfully urges the Tribunal to proceed with the case notwithstanding Claimants\u2019 default. Claimants have offered no valid reason for refusing to attend the long-scheduled Hearing, and the Slovak Republic therefore requests that the Tribunal inform the Claimants that they are still expected to appear at the Hearing. If Claimants do not withdraw their announced intention to default by noon CET on Friday, 8 January 2016, pursuant to Rule 42(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Slovak Republic requests that the \"the Tribunal... deal with the questions submitted to it and to render an award\" on the memorials and evidence that have been submitted.*\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent also stated that it was renewing its application for security for costs.\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimants responded the following day, challenging the Respondent\u2019s allegations and arguing that it would be a fundamental breach of the Claimants\u2019 due process rights if they were to be held in default as a result of their inability to participate in the hearing on account of a conflict of interest. The Claimants again urged the Tribunal to stay the proceeding or postpone the hearing until the Trustee Loveridge determined the ownership of the interest in Rozmin. Finally, the Claimants objected to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that it was renewing its request for security for costs.\n\n146.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent submitted observations on the Claimants\u2019 letter.\n\n147.\n\nOn 11 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which the Tribunal (a) cancelled the scheduled hearing; (b) determined that it was not obliged to proceed to render an award pursuant to Article 45 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 42 of the Arbitration Rules; (c) ordered the Claimants \"to decide **now** how they wish to be represented until the end of these proceeding, i.e. by one counsel or two\"; (d) decided that the Claimants\u2019 request to reschedule the hearing did not constitute a valid reason to reconsider the decision on Respondent\u2019s request for security for costs; and (e) reserved for later determination the issue of the allocation of the costs of the cancelled hearing.\n\n148.\n\nBy email of the same day, the Claimants\u2019 counsel informed the Tribunal that:\n\n*it is certain that Claimants will not be represented in this arbitration by way of joint representation, and will require separate counsel to represent them independently since the decision of the Tribunal is to proceed without first a ruling of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.*\n\n149.\n\nAlso on the same day, the Tribunal held a conference call with the Parties in order to reschedule the hearing. Following the call, on 14 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, holding that: (a) the rescheduled hearing will be held from 12-16 September 2016; (b) each Claimant shall make sure that its counsel is available for the rescheduled hearing; and (c) no additional written submissions shall be permitted unless there are further developments in the Bankruptcy Proceedings.\n\n**H. Communication with Trustee Loveridge**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nOn 12 January 2016, a representative of Trustee Loveridge wrote to inform the Tribunal that, while Trustee Loveridge was not currently seeking to participate in the arbitration, she might seek to do so in the future. Trustee Loveridge also asked for guidance on how she would obtain access to non-public case documents.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal invited the Parties\u2019 comments on Trustee Loveridge\u2019s letter. The Claimants submitted their comments on 27 January 2016, and the Respondent submitted its comments on 29 January 2016.\n\n152.\n\nBy letter of 9 February 2016, the President of the Tribunal responded to Trustee Loveridge\u2019s representative, requesting that the Trustee identify precisely which documents she would like to consult and the relevance of the documents to her mission.\n\n153.\n\nBy email of 30 March 2016, Trustee Loveridge requested copies of the expert reports filed in this arbitration. In response to an invitation from the Tribunal, the Claimants commented on this request on 11 April 2016, and the Respondent commented on 12 April 2016. Neither Party objected to Trustee Loveridge being given access to the documents, but each Party specified information that it believed should be communicated to Trustee Loveridge together with the documents.\n\n154.\n\nOn 6 May 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that Trustee Loveridge would be provided with the expert reports and would be informed that (a) the Claimants have not had an opportunity to rebut the expert reports filed by Respondent with its Rejoinder, and (b) the procedural timetable does not foresee any rebuttal by Claimants to such reports.\n\n**I. Procedural Issues Leading up to the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nOn 17 June 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the reservation for the hearing rooms at the ICC from 12 to 16 September would be confirmed. The Tribunal also invited the Claimants to clarify who would represent them at the rescheduled hearing.\n\n156.\n\nBy letter of 21 June 2016, the Respondent confirmed that it was proceeding on the understanding that the hearing would go forward in September.\n\n157.\n\nBy letter of 4 July 2016, Dr. Hamid Gharavi informed the Tribunal that his firm no longer represented EuroGas in this arbitration and provided the contact details for Mr. Wolfgang Rauball. In response, on 8 July 2016, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order EuroGas to immediately state its intentions regarding its attendance at the September hearing.\n\n158.\n\nOn 11 July 2016, Mr. Rauball informed the Tribunal that going forward, EuroGas would be represented in the arbitration by Ms. Mona Lyman Burton of Holland & Hart LLP. Mr. Rauball also confirmed that EuroGas would attend the hearing in September. EuroGas subsequently provided a power of attorney in favour of Ms. Burton of Holland & Hart LLP.\n\n159.\n\nBy email of 25 July 2016, the Respondent confirmed its letter of 7 January 2016, identifying which of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and experts it intended to cross-examine.\n\n160.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the pre-hearing teleconference. The Tribunal requested that the Parties confer and attempt to reach agreement on the agenda items in advance of the pre-hearing teleconference.\n\n161.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, Belmont identified which of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses and experts it intended to cross-examine. On the same day, EuroGas, through its new counsel, informed the Tribunal that it intended to cross-examine the same witnesses identified by Belmont.\n\n162.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that a pre-hearing teleconference would be held on 5 September 2016.\n\n163.\n\nOn 23 August 2016, the Respondent responded to the Tribunal regarding the draft agenda for the pre-hearing teleconference. The Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties\u2019 agreement on certain procedural matters and identified four issues on which the Parties could not agree. The Respondent stated its position on those four issues.\n\n164.\n\nAlso on 23 August 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Trustee Loveridge had filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval of an agreement with EuroGas II. The Respondent offered to provide the Tribunal with a copy of the motion and the proposed agreement. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent provided a copy of this document on 25 August 2016.\n\n165.\n\nBy email of 26 August 2016, EuroGas submitted corrected versions of the Claimants\u2019 legal authorities CL-225, CL-227 and CL-233.\n\n166.\n\nOn 28 August 2016, Belmont informed the Tribunal of its position on the four contested procedural matters identified in the Respondent\u2019s letter of 23 August 2016. The following day, EuroGas did the same.\n\n167.\n\nOn 1 September 2016, EuroGas wrote to the Tribunal regarding recent developments in the Bankruptcy Proceedings. EuroGas alleged that the Respondent was interfering with EuroGas\u2019 rights in that proceeding in an effort to obstruct the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Together with its letter, EuroGas filed exhibits C-359 and C-360 and legal authorities CL-257 to CL-264. On 3 September 2016, Belmont informed the Tribunal that it agreed with EuroGas\u2019 submission.\n\n168.\n\nBy joint letter of 3 September 2016, EuroGas and Belmont requested that the Tribunal order Mr. Peter Kazimir, acting Minister of Finance for the Slovak Republic, to appear as a witness at the hearing. The Claimants argued that Mr. Kazimir\u2019s testimony was material and that he was under the Respondent\u2019s control.\n\n169.\n\nBy letter of 5 September 2016, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 respective letters of 1 and 3 September 2016 concerning the Bankruptcy Proceedings and their joint letter of 3 September 2016. The Respondent (a) rejected the Claimants\u2019 attempt to raise new claims relating to the Bankruptcy Proceedings, and (b) opposed the Claimants\u2019 request for Mr. Kazimir to appear as a witness.\n\n170.\n\nOn 5 September 2016, EuroGas wrote to the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants to request:\n\n*a provisional measure pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, ordering the Slovak Republic (i) to cease any and all interferences in the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, in a continuing attempt to obstruct or delay the resolution of issues that it raised in this arbitration proceedings as a defense; or at the very least (ii)... to withdraw its request to**continue/postpone the U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing set for September 8 to formally approve the conclusions of the Trustee\u2019s independent investigation into the Rozmin interest, and the Agreement with EuroGas...*\n\n171.\n\nTogether with this letter, EuroGas filed the Slovak Republic\u2019s Motion to Continue the 8 September 2016 hearing before the Bankruptcy Court as exhibit C-363.\n\n172.\n\nLater on 5 September 2016, the Tribunal held a prehearing teleconference. The Tribunal and the Parties discussed the organization of the hearing and other outstanding procedural matters, as well as the Claimants\u2019 request for a provisional measure. Following the teleconference, the Respondent submitted a letter to memorialise its opposition to the Claimants\u2019 request for a provisional measure.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal then issued Procedural Order No. 7, dated 5 September 2016. The Tribunal first addressed the organization of the hearing, including: the hearing schedule, allocation of time, opening and closing statements, witness and expert examination, hearing materials, and post-hearing submissions. In addition, the Tribunal denied the Claimants\u2019 request for an order requiring Mr. Peter Kazimir to appear for examination at the Hearing. In this regard, the Tribunal noted that it had \"taken into account the short notice of this request and determined that such an order would not be practicable at this stage, just one week before the Hearing.\" Finally, the Tribunal denied the Claimants\u2019 3 September 2016 request for a provisional measure, based on its determination that the Claimants had not articulated a right meriting protection under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal further stated that it was not inclined to interfere with the administration of the Bankruptcy Proceedings, particularly in a way that would effectively pre-empt the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision on the Slovak Republic\u2019s motion for a postponement of the 8 September 2016 hearing.\n\n174.\n\nBy letter of 6 September 2016, EuroGas requested leave to introduce into the record six documents relating to alleged corporate transactions involving the interest in Rozmin. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the following day, the Respondent submitted observations on EuroGas\u2019 request, opposing it. On 8 September 2016, the Parties were informed of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to admit the new documents. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the new documents orally at the hearing and, if it wished, in writing before or during the hearing.\n\n175.\n\nLater on 8 September 2016, Belmont requested leave to introduce two additional documents into the record, namely an affidavit sworn by Mr. Wulf Dietrich Keller, former CEO of Mondo Minerals, and an email addressed to Mr. Keller concerning the reassignment of the Mining Area.\n\n176.\n\nOn 9 September 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of further developments in the Bankruptcy Proceedings. In particular, the Respondent stated that a hearing had been held the previous day to address Trustee Loveridge\u2019s proposed deal with EuroGas, but that the Bankruptcy Court had decided not to approve or reject the deal at that time. With its letter, the Respondent filed exhibits R-291 and R-292.\n\n177.\n\nAlso on 9 September 2016, Belmont requested leave to file two publicly available documents concerning Belmont\u2019s business. Belmont noted that the Respondent had objected to the introduction of these documents, which the Respondent confirmed by email the same day.\n\n178.\n\nLater on 9 September 2016, the Tribunal issued directions to the Parties concerning a number of outstanding procedural matters. The Tribunal (a) acknowledged the introduction of R-291 and R-292, (b) granted Belmont\u2019s 8 September 2016 request to introduce new documents, (c) denied Belmont\u2019s 9 September 2016 request to introduce new documents, and (d) provided further guidance relating to the organisation of the hearing.\n\n179.\n\nBy letter of the same day, the Respondent asked that the Tribunal reconsider its decision to grant Belmont\u2019s 8 September 2016 request because the Respondent had not had a sufficient opportunity to state its objection to the request. In response, the Tribunal explained that it had not understood that the Respondent wished to object. Therefore, in light of the objection, the Tribunal suspended its decision on the matter and informed the Parties that it would make its final decision on the first day of the hearing. Ultimately, after hearing both Parties at the hearing, the Tribunal decided not to admit the documents.\n\n180.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, EuroGas submitted exhibits C-366 to C-370 pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of 6 September 2016.\n\n**J. Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and merits took place at the ICC in Paris from 12 to 16 September 2016 (the **\"Hearing\").** The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\nTribunal\n\nProfessor Pierre Mayer   \nProfessor Emmanuel Gaillard   \nProfessor Brigitte Stern\n\nAssistant of the Tribunal\n\nMs. C\u00e9line Lachmann\n\nSecretary of the Tribunal\n\nMs. Lindsay Gastrell\n\nEuroGas\n\n*Counsel:*\n\nMs. Mona Burton, Holland & Hart LLP   \nMs. Maureen Witt, Holland & Hart LLP *Party:*Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, EuroGas, Inc.\n\n*Observer:*\n\nMr. Michael Coombs, Mabey & Coombs, L.C.\n\nBelmont\n\n*Counsel:*\n\nDr. Hamid Gharavi, Derains & Gharavi International   \nMr. Emmanuel Foy, Derains & Gharavi International   \nMs. Ellen-Louise Moens, Derains & Gharavi International   \nMs. Yuhua Deng, Derains & Gharavi International (Intern)  \nMs. Laeticia Morard, Derains & Gharavi International (Intern)\n\n*Party:*\n\nMr. Vojtech Agyagos, Belmont Resources Inc.\n\n*Observer:*\n\nMr. Guy Lepage\n\nRespondent\n\n*Counsel:*\n\nMr. Stephen Anway, Squire Patton Boggs  \nMr. David Alexander, Squire Patton Boggs   \nMr. Rostislav Pekar, Squire Patton Boggs   \nMr. Ra\u00fal Ma\u00f1\u00f3n, Squire Patton Boggs   \nMs. M\u00e1ria Pol\u00e1kov\u00e1, Squire Patton Boggs   \nMs. Eva Cibulkov\u00e1, Squire Patton Boggs   \nMr. Oliver Hodgson, Squire Patton Boggs\n\n*Parties:*\n\nMs. Andrea Hol\u00edkov\u00e1, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic   \nMr. Radovan Hronsk\u00ff, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic   \nMr. Tom\u00e1s Jucha, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic   \nMr. Juli\u00e1n Kupka, Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\n\nInterpreters\n\nMr. Will Behran   \nMr. Pavol Sveda   \nMs. Katarina Tomova\n\nCourt Reporter\n\nMr. Trevor McGowan\n\n182.\n\nThe following persons testified on behalf of the Claimants:\n\nMr. Vojtech Agyagos, Witness   \nMr. Wolfgang Rauball, Witness   \nDr. Ondrej Rozloznik, Witness   \nMr. David E.

Post-Hearing Phase**\n-------------------------\n\n186.\n\nFollowing the Hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, dated 23 September 2016, in which it restated its directions on the procedural matters discussed at the close of the Hearing.\n\n187.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, on 7 October 2016, the Respondent filed documents related to VSK Mining\u2019s activities as exhibits R-295 to R-297.\n\n188.\n\nOn the same date, and also in accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, Belmont filed documents relating to the agreement between EuroGas and Belmont as exhibits C-370 to C-374.\n\n189.\n\nBy letter of 20 October 2017, Belmont requested (a) leave to comment on the documents produced by the Respondent on 7 October 2016 and (b) an extension of time for the Parties to file their submissions on costs. By letter of the same date, EuroGas joined Belmont\u2019s request.\n\n190.\n\nBy letter of 21 October 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the Claimants\u2019 requested extension of time for the Parties to file their submissions on costs, provided that the Claimants would not object to an extension of time for the filing of the transcript corrections. Both Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to the Respondent\u2019s proposal.\n\n191.\n\nOn 26 October 2016, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement on the procedural schedule. In addition, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 request to comment on the documents submitted by the Respondent on 7 October 2016.\n\n192.\n\nBy letter of 1 November 2016, the Respondent provided the Tribunal with an update on the Bankruptcy Proceedings. In particular, the Respondent noted that the Bankruptcy Court had approved Trustee Loveridge\u2019s proposed deal with EuroGas in an order dated 29 October 2016, which the Respondent attached as exhibit B. The Respondent also attached the transcript of the hearing before the Bankruptcy Court as exhibit A and two legal authorities as exhibits C and D. The Respondent argued that this order had not resolved the issue of ownership of the ICSID claim.\n\n193.\n\nAlso on 1 November 2016, Belmont submitted its comments on the documents disclosed by the Respondent on 7 October 2016. As part of its comments, Belmont requested that negative inferences be drawn against the Respondent. Belmont attached an additional document concerning VSK Mining\u2019s activities as exhibit C-375. By letter of the same date, EuroGas joined Belmont\u2019s arguments.\n\n194.\n\nOn 3 November 2016, the Respondent requested leave to respond to Belmont\u2019s 1 November 2016 letter, which the Tribunal granted on 7 November 2016.\n\n195.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, the Parties submitted their Joint Notice of Errata and Interpretation Errors, identifying corrections to the Hearing transcript. The Tribunal subsequently informed the Parties that it confirmed all of the agreed amendments to the transcript, and that it would not issue any decision with respect to four disputed amendments. The Tribunal noted that if it later determined that one or more of the disputed issues were relevant and material to the dispute, it would issue a decision at that time.\n\n196.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, EuroGas filed a letter commenting on the Bankruptcy Proceedings, together with exhibits A to R. EuroGas argued that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order of 28 October 2016, which the Respondent discussed in its letter of 1 November 2016, supported EuroGas\u2019 position in the arbitration.\n\n197.\n\nOn 11 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its response to Belmont\u2019s letter of 1 November 2016, together with exhibits R-298 to R-306. The Respondent argued that Belmont had raised new allegations that were untimely, improper and incorrect.\n\n198.\n\nIn accordance with the revised post-Hearing procedural schedule, EuroGas, Belmont, and the Respondent each filed a Statement of Costs on 14 November 2016.\n\n199.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS ON THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over EuroGas\u2019 claims because: (a) the company EuroGas, Inc. that is a Claimant in this arbitration does not own the alleged investment in the Slovak Republic and therefore has no standing to bring its claims;111 and (b) the Respondent has validly denied the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT to EuroGas, a company without substantial business activities in the United States that is controlled by a German national.112\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a711.A; Rejoinder \u00a711.A.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7II.B; Rejoinder \u00a711.B.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Belmont for two fundamental reasons:\n\n*(i) Belmont sold its ownership in the alleged investment to EuroGas I in 2001 and thus does not own the alleged investment, and (ii) the Canada-Slovak BIT only covers disputes arising after 14 March 2009, and all of Claimants\u2019 colorable allegations occurred prior to that date.113*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 128.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal summarises below in greater detail each Party\u2019s position on the Respondent\u2019s objections, focusing on the Parties\u2019 arguments as set forth in their written submissions.114 During the Hearing, the Parties elaborated upon these arguments, and the examination of witnesses revealed further relevant information. The Tribunal will address these additional points as necessary in its analysis contained in Sections V and VI below.\n\nFor this reason, this Section refers to \"the Claimants\" rather than to \"EuroGas\" and \"Belmont\" separately. As noted above in Section II.I and J, at the Hearing, EuroGas and Belmont were represented by different counsel and made separate oral submissions.\n\n**A. EuroGas\u2019 Standing**\n------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection with respect to EuroGas is that this Claimant does not in fact own the alleged investment in the Slovak Republic and, as a result, has no standing to bring its claims before this Tribunal.\n\n204.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants have misrepresented EuroGas\u2019 identity in this proceeding. In particular, the Respondent points to the description in the Request for Arbitration of EuroGas as a U.S. company incorporated in Utah in 1985.115 The Respondent discovered that this statement was false when its research of Utah\u2019s corporate records revealed that the company named EuroGas, Inc. that was incorporated in 1985 (to which the Respondent refers as \"EuroGas I\") no longer exists, and the only entity named \"EuroGas, Inc.\" in operation is a company incorporated in 2005 (to which the Respondent refers as \"EuroGas II\").116\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b631, *reproducing* Request for Arbitration \u00b67.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b631-32; *see* Rejoinder \u00b646.\n\n205.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, after this information was uncovered, the Claimants \"were forced to change their story\" and admit that the real Claimant was, in fact, EuroGas II.117 The Respondent asserts that the Claimants have since presented \"one false explanation after another,\" which the Respondent has disproven each time.118 The Claimants argued in the Memorial that EuroGas II acquired the interest in Rozmin through a 2008 Type-F reorganization of EuroGas 1.119 Then, after the Respondent proved that position untenable, the Claimants \"changed their story\" in the Reply and argued that the two EuroGas companies merged through a *''de facto* merger.\" The Claimants also asserted for the first time in the Reply that EuroGas II acquired the interest in Rozmin from McCallan Oil & Gas **(\"McCallan\"),** a U.K. company.120 According to the Respondent, each of these various theories is false and results in multiple jurisdictional problems for EuroGas.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b633-34, *reproducing* Memorial \u00b6\u00b612-13.\n\nRejoinder \u00b65.\n\nRejoinder \u00b64, *citing* Memorial \u00b621.\n\nRejoinder \u00b64, *citing* Reply \u00b664.\n\n206.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent contends that these theories are rendered moot by a threshold issue: EuroGas I did not emerge from bankruptcy with the alleged investment. Therefore, neither EuroGas II nor McCallan ever could have acquired the investment from EuroGas I.121\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b655-57.\n\n207.\n\nAddressing this threshold issue, the Respondent submits that under U.S. Bankruptcy law, EuroGas I could not have survived the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy with its interest in Rozmin.122 In this regard, the Respondent draws a distinction between Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In Chapter 11 proceedings, the debtor\u2019s business is reorganized, usually with the debtor retaining control of its assets, whereas in Chapter 7 proceedings, the debtor\u2019s assets are marshalled by the bankruptcy trustee and liquidated to repay creditors. The only exception is when an asset is \"abandoned\" by the trustee, in which case it remains with the debtor.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7II.A.4.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code governs abandonment of property, as recognized by the Claimants\u2019 experts.123 Under this provision, there are only two ways for property to be abandoned in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: (a) when the court enters an order authorizing the abandonment and the trustee takes affirmative action to abandon the property, pursuant to Sections 554(a)-(b); or (b) by operation of law for property scheduled under Section 521, pursuant to Section 554(c). Otherwise, the property remains part of the bankruptcy estate.124\n\nRejoinder \u00b660, *citing* 11 U.S.C. \u00a7554(a) (RL-69); Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b6\u00b672-73.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b677, *citing* 11 USC \u00a7554(c) (RL-69); Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 6007 (RL-55); Jarvis ER \u00b675.\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 position that abandonment of EuroGas I\u2019s interest in Rozmin occurred by operation of law under Section 554(c). That section expressly requires that the asset be scheduled under Section 521(a)(1).125 Yet it is undisputed that EuroGas Es interest in Rozmin was never scheduled in the Chapter 7 proceeding.126 Therefore, the Respondent concludes that Section 554(c) could not apply.127\n\n11 USC \u00a7554(c) (RL-69) (\"Unless the court orders otherwise, any property scheduled under section 521(a)(1) of this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor...\").\n\nRejoinder \u00b662.\n\nRejoinder \u00b662.\n\n210.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, U.S. courts have consistently held that, for property to be abandoned by operation of law, it must be disclosed in the schedule of assets. The Respondent cites, for example, recent rulings of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Tenth Circuit, which have precedential value in Utah. Those cases concerned a bankruptcy debtor who failed to disclose the relevant asset in her bankruptcy filings, and the courts held that as a result, the asset was not abandoned but instead remained property of the estate.128\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b664-68, *citing Brumfiel v.

LEXIS 3477 (BAP 10th Cir., 2015) (RL-136).\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it follows that EuroGas Es interest in Rozmin remains with the bankruptcy estate.129 The Respondent does not accept the Claimants\u2019 argument that the investment was abandoned by operation of law because Trustee Marker knew of the interest in Rozmin but elected not to administer it.130 According to the Respondent, the actual or imputed knowledge of a Chapter 7 trustee is irrelevant in light of the requirement that property must have been formally scheduled to be abandoned.131 As held by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit:\n\n*[I]n order for property to be abandoned by operation of law pursuant to section 554(c), the debtor must formally schedule the property before the close of the case. It is not enough that the trustee**learns of the property through other means; the property must be scheduled pursuant to section 521(1).132*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b676-91.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b618-19; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b673.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b681; Rejoinder \u00b677; Jarvis ER \u00b673.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b679-80, *quoting Vreugdenhillv.

Answer: That\u2019s correct.\").\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 reliance on time entries of the Trustee\u2019s accountant indicating that he reviewed filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission **(\"SEC\").** These entries do not specify which SEC filings were reviewed or in any way reflect the Trustee Marker\u2019s knowledge of EuroGas\u2019 assets.136 In any event, EuroGas\u2019 2004 and 2005 Annual Reports (10-Ks) suggest that EuroGas I no longer had any interest in the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit.137 It was not until its 2007 10-K, filed after the bankruptcy had closed, that EuroGas disclosed that it was contesting the reassignment of the Mining Area.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b684.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b684-85, *citing* EuroGas, Inc., Form 10-K for Fiscal Year Ended 31 December 2004, p. 5 (R-74); EuroGas, Inc., Form 10-K for Fiscal Year Ended 31 December 2005, p. 5 (R-75). The Claimants also rely on a Quarterly Report (10-Q) of EuroGas that was submitted to the Bankruptcy Court. The Respondent highlights that this document was not filed by EuroGas but rather by the creditors\u2019 representative, to support the proposition that the SEC filings did not adequately inform shareholders about the bankruptcy case. For the Respondent, it \"speaks volumes\" that the Claimants\u2019 own evidence states that EuroGas\u2019 SEC filings were inaccurate. Counter-Memorial \u00b689.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that because EuroGas I did not emerge from the bankruptcy with its interest in Rozmin, EuroGas II could never have come to possess the alleged investment, and the Tribunal therefore has no jurisdiction over EuroGas II.138\n\nRejoinder \u00b684.\n\n216.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that, even if EuroGas I had somehow retained the interest in Rozmin, the Tribunal would still not have jurisdiction over EuroGas II, given that none of the Claimants\u2019 theories as to how EuroGas II obtained the interest in Rozmin is tenable.139\n\nRejoinder \u00a7II.A.2.\n\n217.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent denies that EuroGas II could have \"stepped into the shoes\" of EuroGas I, as asserted by the Claimants. The Claimants rely on a Joint Unanimous Consent Resolution entered into by the directors of the two EuroGas companies on 31 July 2008 (the **\"Joint Resolution\"),** which provides that the companies are \"deemed to have merged\" through a Type-F reorganization that is retroactively effective to 15 November 2005.140 According to the Respondent, this is a \"sham document\" that is invalid under both Utah law and U.S. Bankruptcy law.141\n\nJoint Unanimous Consent Resolution of the Directors of EuroGas, Inc., a Utah Corporation Dissolved in 2001 and EuroGas, Inc., a Utah Corporation Formed In 2005 Approving Proposed Class \"F\" Reorganization, dated 31 July 2008 (\"Joint Resolution\") (C-57); Memorial \u00b621.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b645.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, in response to its Counter-Memorial, the Claimants were forced to admit in the Reply that Section 368(a)(1)(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which governs Type-F reorganizations, is a tax statute that cannot effectuate corporate mergers.142\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 104, *citing* Reply \u00b6\u00b689-90.\n\n219.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants then offered a new theory based on \"the common law doctrine of *de facto* merger,\" which is invalid for two main reasons.143\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 105, *quoting* Reply \u00b685.\n\n220.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the *de facto* merger doctrine does not work to merge two entities engaged in an asset acquisition; rather, it is applicable only in successor liability cases as a remedy to protect the creditors of an entity that sells substantially all of its assets to another entity but retains its liabilities.144 Therefore, it could not apply to effect a merger of EuroGas I and II.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6107-114; Dorsey ER \u00b6\u00b666 *et seq.*\n\n221.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that EuroGas I did not have the capacity to merge with EuroGas II because under Utah law, dissolved corporations cannot merge.145 In this regard, it is undisputed that EuroGas I was dissolved in 2001 and did not seek reinstatement within two years after its dissolution.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b665-71; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6116-132.\n\n222.\n\nPursuant to the Utah Code, a dissolved corporation \"may not carry on any business except that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs,\" and Utah legal authorities have held that mergers do not fall into that category.146\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b649-55, *citing In re Flavor Brands, Inc.,* Docket Nos.

A dissolved corporation has no shares to offer, sell or swap. The shares of a dissolved corporation are invalid.148*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b651, *quoting Holman v.

U.S. courts have found that as a consequence of this provision, the debtor company is \"defunct\" at the conclusion of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and cannot carry out business activities.153 Therefore, EuroGas I was rendered \"defunct\" after the Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding concluded on 19 March 2007 and could not have transferred assets to or merged with EuroGas II after that date.154\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b667-68, *quoting Thornton v. Mankovitch,* 626 S.E. 2d 189, 191 (Georgia App. 2006) (RL-83) (\"The consequence of denying discharge to a corporation in a Chapter 7 proceeding is to render such entities \u2018defunct,\u2019 which is akin to a dissolved corporation.\") and *Liberty Trust Co. v.

Counter-Memorial \u00b671.\n\n227.\n\nFinally, the Respondent challenges the purported retroactive effect of the Joint Resolution.155 First, Utah corporate law expressly prohibits mergers from being effective retroactively.156 Second, when the bankruptcy petition against EuroGas I was filed on 18 May 2004, an automatic stay came into effect under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code preventing \"any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.\"157 Thus, because the Joint Resolution purports to make the merger and asset transfer effective as of 15 November 2005, when this stay was already in effect, it must be \"void and without effect.\"158\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b672-75.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b658. The Respondent also submits that \"the \u2018type-F reorganization\u2019 referenced in the Joint Resolution could not reinstate or revive EuroGas I [because] a federal tax reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) has no bearing on the legal incapacity and statutory limitations placed on EuroGas I under Utah law.\" In addition, \"U.S. courts have held that entities adjudicated and liquidated in bankruptcy cannot engage in type-F reorganizations.\" Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b659-61, 90, *citing Templeton\u2019s Jewelers, Inc. v.

Czech Republic.*167 Specifically, EuroGas II \"acquired a troubled asset embroiled in national court litigation seeking to remedy the very act that is the subject of this investment treaty claim.\"168\n\nd. *From 4 June 2012:* The Claimants allege that on 4 June 2012, EuroGas II caused McCallan to transfer its interest in EuroGas GmbH to a Swiss subsidiary, EuroGas AG, but they offer no information or evidence about this transaction, making it impossible to assess its impact on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.169\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b685-105.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b654, 85-86.\n\nRejoinder \u00b687.\n\nRejoinder \u00b688.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b689-91.\n\nRejoinder \u00b692.\n\nRejoinder \u00b693.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b693-95, *citing* *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale In respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, SA. v.

A.1.\n\nReply \u00a7I.A.4.\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 first main argument is summarized as follows:\n\n*[I]f the challenge of EuroGas\u2019 ownership interest in Rozmin were to be accepted by the Tribunal, despite the fact that Respondent does not have standing under U.S. law to raise this challenge and that it would in fact be prevented in a U.S. court from doing so, the Slovak Republic would literally be the only one to benefit from this decision.175*\n\nReply \u00b625.\n\n233.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the results of the Respondent\u2019s position would be:\n\na. EuroGas\u2019 interest in Rozmin would remain with the bankruptcy estate and never be administered. It \"would make strictly no business sense to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings\" because: (i) the estate would not have the financial means to bring this claim against the Respondent; (ii) a trustee would not take on the burden and expense of bringing a claim, especially because his fees would not be paid until the conclusion of the arbitration; and (iii) selling the interest in Rozmin at auction would not generate a worthwhile return. The asset would have little value to any entity other than the 1985 Company or \"a company that had genuinely stepped into the shoes of the 1985 Company before there was even any prospect of arbitration,\" because no other entity would be considered a genuine investor with the right to bring a claim.176\n\nb. The shareholders of the 1985 Company would own shares in a defunct company with no assets, rather than shares in EuroGas, a company in good standing.177\n\nc. The creditors of the 1985 Company would remain creditors of a defunct company with no assets and have no means of recovering from EuroGas.178\n\nd. The Respondent would never be held accountable for its breaches of international law.179\n\nReply \u00b624.1.\n\nReply \u00b624.2.\n\nReply \u00b624.3.\n\nReply \u00b624.4.\n\n234.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants assert that \"EuroGas is the only party capable of successfully holding the Slovak Republic liable for its breaches.\"180 The Tribunal should therefore reject the Respondent\u2019s objection, as it would benefit only the Respondent.181 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the unreasonableness of the Respondent\u2019s position is highlighted by \"the fact that Respondent does not have standing under U.S. law to raise this challenge and that it would in fact be prevented in a U.S. court from doing so.\"182\n\nReply \u00b626.1. In the Reply, submitted before the reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings, the Claimants argued that any creditor who considered petitioning the U.S. court to reopen the EuroGas bankruptcy would recognize its own best interest in instead acknowledging that EuroGas\u2019 interest in Rozmin was validly abandoned in the Bankruptcy Proceedings and that the two EuroGas companies validly merged. The creditor could then seek a settlement with or assert a claim against EuroGas, which may prevail in this case with a substantial award.\n\nReply \u00b628.\n\nReply \u00b635, *citing* Snell & Wilmer ER, \u00b6\u00b623, 95-99.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that, in any event, the Respondent\u2019s objection fails on the merits. According to the Claimants, the 1985 Company (a) emerged from bankruptcy with the interest in Rozmin;183 (b) was not prevented from acting to wind up its affairs;184 and (c) validly merged with EuroGas to become the rightful owner of the investment.185\n\nReply \u00a7I.A.2.\n\nReply \u00a7I.A.3.\n\nReply \u00a7I.A.4.\n\n236.\n\nOn the first point, the Claimants submit that the Respondent is wrong to argue that the 1985 Company could not have emerged from the bankruptcy with its interest in Rozmin. According to the Claimants:\n\n*Respondent relies on the strictest interpretation of the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, one which U.S. courts themselves do not follow, and which moreover blatantly disregards the very peculiar circumstances of this case, not to mention the very strong policy reasons that would prohibit finding that the 1985 Company did not emerge from the Chapter 7 reorganization process..., in disregard of the good faith interpretation required under international law and the principle of form over substance.186*\n\nReply \u00b630.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimants and their legal experts acknowledge that some U.S. courts have ruled that property cannot be abandoned by a bankruptcy trustee unless it is formally scheduled in the Bankruptcy Proceedings.187 However, they argue that other courts have found that when a trustee is aware of the asset and chooses not to administer it, the asset is deemed to have been abandoned.188 One court set forth the test as follows:\n\n*The party claiming the abandonment must demonstrate the trustee had knowledge of the asset as property to the estate such that the court could impute an intent to abandon the asset upon the closing of the case. [...] The claiming party must also show an absence of active administration of the asset at the time of the abandonment.189*\n\nReply \u00b631; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b673.\n\nReply \u00b632; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b673.\n\nReply \u00b633, *quoting Starrett v. Starret,* 541 A.2d 1119, 1123 (N.J. App. Div. 1988) (internal citations omitted) (CL-214).\n\n238.\n\nApplying this test in the present case, the Claimants assert that Trustee Marker knew of EuroGas\u2019 interest in Rozmin and chose not to administer it; as a consequence, that interest is deemed to have been abandoned.190 In this regard, the Claimants point out that *no* schedules were filed in the Bankruptcy Proceedings, so the administration of the entire estate was based on knowledge obtained by Trustee Marker from external sources.191\n\nReply \u00b634.\n\nReply \u00b634.\n\n239.\n\nAccording to the Claimants and their legal experts, the following facts show that Trustee Marker was aware, or should have been aware, of the Rozmin interest:\n\na. The interest was reported in EuroGas\u2019 public SEC filings, two of which were attached to a pleading filed in the bankruptcy case.192 Indeed, these filings provide more information about Rozmin than the schedule of assets would have provided.\n\nb. Trustee Marker\u2019s time records show that he reviewed tax documents relating to EuroGas, which stated the company\u2019s interest in EuroGas GmbH, RimaMur\u00e1\u0148, and Rozmin.193\n\nc. Trustee Marker\u2019s accountant, according to its time records and application for fees, reviewed \"[b]usiness records of the prior accountants... to identify possible assets of the company which were unknown to the Trustee,\" accounting data and tax returns, and also searched SEC filings for additional information.194\n\nd. EuroGas\u2019 2006 tax return, which was reviewed, signed and filed by Trustee Marker, identified the company\u2019s interest in Rozmin.195\n\ne. Online news articles from September 2005, which Trustee Marker could have easily found, report that Rozmin had challenged the Government\u2019s decision to revoke Rozmin\u2019s mining rights.196\n\nReply \u00b636.1. The Claimants point to EuroGas\u2019 10-Q for the third quarter of 2005, which states that the company \"acquired a direct 43% interest in Rozmin s.r.o., [which] holds a talc deposit in Eastern Slovakia,\" and that \"Rozmin s.r.o. was notified that the concession regarding the Tale deposit had been cancelled by the Slovakian Government for unspecified and dubious reasons,\" and that it \"will be forced to impair the cost of the assets, $3,843,560, because of the cancellation of the concession.\" Trustee\u2019s Response to Motion to Reconsider or Grant New Trial Filed by W.

Trustee Marker had a duty on the basis of the SEC filings \"to investigate what, if anything, he could have done, or what actions had already been undertaken to recover Rozmin\u2019s interest in the Deposit\"; and\n\nc. when considering a \"contingent, equitable legal claim,\" such as Rozmin\u2019s claim against the Respondent, U.S. courts have held that the level of disclosure required to establish abandonment is \"much lower.\"199\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b63 9-41.\n\nReply \u00b640.\n\nReply \u00b642 *citing In Re Kane,* 628 F. 3d 631 (3d Cir. 2010) 641, 643 (CL-217) (holding that a trustee had abandoned a debtor\u2019s property in a potential lawsuit against her ex-husband, even though that property was unscheduled).\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Trustee Marker himself concluded that he had sufficient information from external sources to administer the estate, and elected to close the case.200 Otherwise, he could have asked the Bankruptcy Court to hold EuroGas and its representatives in contempt for failing to file the schedules of assets as ordered, or to dismiss the case under Section 707(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code for \"unreasonable delay by the debtor that is prejudicial to creditors.\"201 Instead, he apparently believed that he had the information required to fully administer the estate, declaring in his final report that he had \"faithfully and properly fulfilled the duties of the trustee.\"202\n\nReply \u00b644.\n\nReply \u00b644.\n\nReply \u00b647, *quoting* Final Report and Application for Compensation and Motion for Order Approving Payment of Administrative Costs and Expenses, EuroGas I Bankruptcy, Docket No. 140, p. 35 (C-328).\n\n242.\n\nTo the Claimants, it is clear that Trustee Marker did not actively administer the claim against the Respondent as an asset in the Bankruptcy Proceedings. The Claimants point out that, even though no schedules were filed, Trustee Marker located and sold EuroGas\u2019 interest in four of its subsidiaries.203 He did not, however, take such action with EuroGas GmbH, likely because he considered the interest in Rozmin to be overly burdensome or too expensive and risky to liquidate.204 According to the Claimants, as a result of Trustee Marker\u2019s decision not to actively administer EuroGas\u2019 interest in Rozmin, it was abandoned back to EuroGas.\n\nReply \u00b647, *citing* Order Confirming Four-Lot Auction of Debtors Interests in Certain Affiliates, dated March 30, 2006, EuroGas I Bankruptcy, Docket Entry No. 97, pp. 2 *et seq.* (C-71).\n\nReply \u00b646; Snell & Wilmer ER, \u00b693. In the Claimants\u2019 view, such a determination by Trustee Marker would have been reasonable, given that he did not have the time or financial resources to challenge the revocation of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights in national or international fora, and at the time (before the Slovak Supreme Court decision of 2008), the chance of success of such a challenge would have seemed weak.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 second main argument is that, despite the administrative dissolution of the 1985 Company, it was able to undertake any act necessary to wind up its affairs, including the merger with EuroGas.\n\n244.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants contest the opinion of the Respondent\u2019s expert that under Utah corporate law, a dissolved corporation has no legal existence.205 They argue that the Utah court cases on which Ms. Jarvis relies were decided under the Utah Business Corporation Act, which was repealed on 1 July 1992 and replaced by the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act.206 This point is important to the Claimants because under the previous law, a dissolved corporation could only pursue a claim that arose prior to its dissolution, and only if the action was initiated within two years after dissolution. On the other hand, the current law allows a corporation to undertake any act necessary to wind up its affairs, and it does not contain a two-year limitation on legal actions.207\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b651-57, *citing* Jarvis ER \u00b644.\n\nReply \u00b653; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b6142.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b655-56, *citing* Utah Revised Business Corporation Act \u00a7 1405(2)(b) (CL-197). The Claimants also argue that the two cases supporting the Respondent\u2019s position that a dissolved corporation cannot act to wind up it affairs \"have no precedential value whatsoever, and are moreover wrong in law, having disregarded the very plain language of the Current Act.\" Reply \u00b657.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants also contest the Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to U.S. Bankruptcy law. They submit that the Bankruptcy Proceedings could not prevent EuroGas from acting to wind up its affairs for the following reasons:\n\na. Bankruptcies cannot cause the dissolution of a company because they are governed by U.S. federal law, whereas the creation and dissolution of corporate entities is governed by state law.208\n\nb. Not only is there nothing in the Bankruptcy Code to suggest that bankruptcies can result in dissolution, but the preparatory works of that law contemplate the survival of the debtor, stating: \"[i]n adopting section 727(a)(1), Congress intended that corporate debt would survive Chapter 7 proceedings and be charged against the corporation when it resumed operations.\"209\n\nc. The majority of case law, including a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, has confirmed that Chapter 7 proceedings do not dissolve a corporation. The cases cited by the Respondent are \"outlier decisions\" that have been subject to criticism.210\n\nd. Ms. Jarvis\u2019 position is nonsensical and inconsistent with her recognition that property can be abandoned back to the debtor after the conclusion of the Chapter 7 proceeding.211\n\nReply \u00b659.\n\nReply \u00b660, *quoting N.L.R.B. v. Better Bldg. Supply Corp.,* 837 F.2d 377 (9th Cir. 1988), 13 January 1988 (CL-102).\n\nReply \u00b661 ; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00a7IV(B).\n\nReply \u00b662, citing *Catamount Const, v.

EuroGas did both:\n\n*On July 13, 2007, the 1985 Company sold its interest in EuroGas GmbH to a third party company, namely McCallan Oil & Gas (UK)**... EuroGas thereafter acquired the entirety of McCallan\u2019s issued shares, and ultimately, on June 4, 2012, caused McCallan to transfer its interest in EuroGas GmbH, and thus Rozmin, to its new Swiss subsidiary, EuroGas AG.*\n\n*Further, in order to complete the winding up process, and at the same time maintain the interest of its shareholders, the 1985 Company validly merged with EuroGas on July 31, 2008.212*\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b664-65.\n\n247.\n\nRelying on the Joint Resolution entered into by the directors of the two EuroGas companies on 31 July 2008, the Claimants assert that the companies underwent \"a type-F reorganization whereby EuroGas assumed all of the assets, liabilities and issued stock certificates of the 1985 Company.\"213\n\nMemorial \u00b621; Joint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the two EuroGas companies merged pursuant to the common law doctrine of *''de facto* merger.\"214 They contend that the Respondent\u2019s arguments challenging the validity of this merger are \"convoluted and/or formal\" and must fail for a number of reasons.215\n\nReply \u00a7I.A.4.\n\nReply \u00b666.\n\n249.\n\nFirst, according to the Claimants, nothing in the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act prevents a dissolved corporation from merging with another corporation; rather, the law expressly allows a corporation to take any \"act necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs\" and specifies that \"dissolution of a corporation does not... prevent transfer of its shares or securities.\"216\n\nReply \u00b670; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b6103; Utah Revised Business Corporation Act \u00a71405(2)(b) (CL-197).\n\n250.\n\nFurther, the Claimants argue that the requirement of registering a merger with the Utah Division of Corporations is mandatory only in the case of statutory mergers (as opposed to common law mergers).217 According to the Claimants, the validity of such non-statutory and *de facto* mergers is recognized in the official commentary to Utah\u2019s corporate statute, which states that a \"transaction may have the same economic effect as a statutory merger even though it is cast in the form of a non-statutory transaction.\"218 The Claimants cite Utah court decisions holding that a dissolved corporation had undergone a *de facto* merger with a corporation in good standing, just as they argue occurred in the EuroGas merger.219\n\nReply \u00b671.\n\nReply \u00b672, *citing* Official commentary to section 1101 of the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act (CL-240).\n\nReply \u00b673, *citing In the Matter ofSynetix Group Inc,* Case No. 080500140 (3rdDist.

Utah, 2004) (RL-34).\n\n251.\n\nAccording to the Claimants\u2019 legal experts, there are four factors that must be satisfied for a *de facto* merger to be valid under common law, and they are all met in this case. In particular:\n\na. *continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets and general business operation:* As specified in the Joint Resolution, the two EuroGas companies share the same directors and officers, principle place of business and assets.220\n\nb. *continuity of shareholders:* The Joint Resolution states that EuroGas \"shall have the same shareholders as the Predecessor Corporation, and in the same denominations\" and that EuroGas \"shall fully and completely recognize and honor the Predecessor Corporation\u2019s shareholders as its own.\"221 This is confirmed by the 2011 share ledger of EuroGas.222\n\nc. *cessation of ordinary business by the predecessor:* The 1985 Company had already been dissolved and with the merger it completed its winding up and \"ceased to exist entirely.\"223\n\nd. *assumption of successor liability:* The Joint Resolution states that \"all assets, liabilities, rights privileges, and obligations of Predecessor Corporation are in fact the assets, liabilities, rights privileges, and obligations of [EuroGas].\"224\n\nReply \u00b677, *citing* Joint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\nReply \u00b678; Joint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\nReply \u00b681 ; Snell & Wilmer ER \u00b6\u00b6 117-119.\n\nReply \u00b682.\n\nReply \u00b683; Joint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\n252.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Claimants\u2019 legal experts opine that Utah courts would affirm this merger, especially given that \"all parties with an interest in the 1985 Company, EuroGas, or the merger between the two, have benefitted from said merger.\"225\n\nSnell & Wilmer ER \u00b6122.\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s argument that, since the Joint Resolution purports to be retroactively effective to 15 November 2015, when an automatic stay was imposed on EuroGas\u2019 assets through the Chapter 7 proceeding, the merger is not valid. The Claimants point out that the Joint Resolution was entered into in July 2008, more than one year after the stay had been lifted on 19 March 2007, and therefore could not have interfered with the automatic stay.226 In any event, even if the Joint Resolution could not have had retroactive effect, the merger would still have been validly completed on 31 July 2008.\n\nReply \u00b687.\n\n254.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to deny the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection relating to EuroGas.\n\n**B. Denial of Benefits to EuroGas**\n------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n255.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second jurisdictional objection relating to EuroGas is based on the \"denial of benefits clause\" found in Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT:\n\n*Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company the advantages of this Treaty if nationals of any third country control such company and, in the case of a company of the other Party, that company has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party.*\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it validly denied the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT to EuroGas pursuant to this provision.227\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7II.B; Rejoinder \u00a711.B.\n\n257.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, this denial of benefits clause covers all \"advantages of this Treaty\" and therefore applies to the right to the procedural benefits of the BIT, including the right to initiate international arbitration.228 The Respondent points out that the Claimants do not dispute this.229 As a result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* over EuroGas\u2019s claims.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6119.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6135.\n\n258.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the two requirements for a denial of benefits set forth in Article 1.2 are met in this case: (a) EuroGas is controlled by a national of a third country, and (b) it has no substantial business activities in the territory of the United States.230\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b693.\n\n259.\n\nRegarding the first requirement, the Respondent notes that the Claimants have not disputed that EuroGas is controlled by Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, a national of Germany.231 In addition, the Respondent points to the following facts, which in its view demonstrate Mr. Rauball\u2019s control of the company:\n\na. Mr. Rauball has consistently held the key executive positions in EuroGas II (including CEO, President and Director). In particular, he held these positions when the Respondent denied the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT in 2012.232\n\nb. Mr. Rauball has been EuroGas\u2019s largest shareholder, holding 27% of its stock in 2009 and 30% in 2010.233\n\nc. EuroGas\u2019 2009 SEC annual report states that the company is \"dependent on the services of Wolfgang Rauball, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company\" and that Mr. Rauball had personally guaranteed investments by creditors.234\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b694; Rejoinder \u00b6135.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b694, *citing* Registered Principals - Utah Business Search for EuroGas II, 4 June 2015 (R-144); Annual Report-Change Request for EuroGas, Inc., 10 September 2014 (R-145); Annual Report for EuroGas II from the Utah Division of Corporations, 5 November 2012 (R-146).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b695, *citing* EuroGas, Inc., Form 10-K for Fiscal Year Ended 31 December 2009, p. 24 (R-76); SEC Filing of EuroGas Inc., 21 July 2010 (R-147).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b695, *citing* EuroGas, Inc., Form 10-K for Fiscal Year Ended 31 December 2009, p. 9 (R-76).\n\n260.\n\nWith respect to the second requirement in Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT, that the relevant company \"has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party,\" the Respondent asserts that:\n\n*EuroGas II has provided no documentary evidence showing anything remotely close to \"substantial business activity\" in the U.S., and all the evidence points to the opposite conclusion:**EuroGas II lacks any physical presence in the U.S., and it has no operational or management activities in that jurisdiction.235*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6113.\n\n261.\n\nTo support this position, the Respondent alleges the following facts:236\n\na. Under Utah corporate law, EuroGas I was dissolved in 2001.237\n\nb. EuroGas I entered a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in 2004 during which all of its assets (none of which were based in the United States) were auctioned off. The company became legally \"defunct\" after the bankruptcy.238\n\nc. The address for EuroGas\u2019 principle office identified in its 2007 Annual Report is only a \"mail drop.\"239\n\nd. From the time EuroGas II was created in 2005 to the present, there is no evidence that either EuroGas entity conducted material operations in the United States. Indeed, EuroGas has acknowledged that it is managed from its \"North American Headquarters\" in Canada and its \"Central European Headquarters,\" and that \"Austria and Switzerland have more recently been its principal places of business.\"240\n\ne.

TEC claims that EuroGas entered into an agreement to provide financing for TEC\u2019s exploration activities in the United States in exchange for stock in TEC, but then failed to perform its obligation. According to the Respondent, this only further demonstrates EuroGas\u2019 lack of substantial business activities in the United States.246\n\nb. *EuroGas\u2019 shareholding in TEC:* TEC is a Canadian company with no operating revenues and significant losses.247 In any event, EuroGas\u2019 substantial business activities cannot be established by the activities of another company. As held by the tribunal in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador,* it is the claimant itself which must be shown to have substantial business activities in the relevant territory.248\n\nc. *The business activities of EuroGas Silver and Gold Inc., a Nevada corporation* ***(\"ESG\"):*** Similarly, the Claimants cannot rely on the activities of ESG to defeat the Respondent\u2019s denial-of-benefits.249 This is especially true because ESG is not owned directly by the Claimant EuroGas, but is rather a \"low-level subsidiary\" owned through EuroGas AG, a Swiss subsidiary.250 In any event, the Claimants have offered no evidence of any operational activity of ESG, other than Mr. Rauball\u2019s statements.251\n\nThe Claimants assert that EuroGas conducts substantial business activities in at least three ways: (a) a lawsuit between Tombstone Exploration Corporation and EuroGas, (b) EuroGas\u2019 joint business activities with TEC and (c) the business activities of EuroGas Silver and Gold Inc. Nevada.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6104-106, *citing* TEC\u2019s Complaint, 21 August 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27 (R-149); TEC\u2019s Amended Complaint, 21 August 2014, \u00b6\u00b630-33 (R-150). *See* Rejoinder \u00b6152.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6107, *citing* Tombstone Exploration Corporation Form 20-F for Fiscal Year Ended 31 December 2013, p. 19 (R-153).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6108; Rejoinder \u00b6153, *citing Pac Rim Cayman LLC. v.

In its document request No. 24, the Respondent requested \"documents showing any business activities of EuroGas I or EuroGas II in the U.S. since 1998.\" The Tribunal denied that request in Procedural Order No. 4, stating that \"Claimants have the burden of proof.\"\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent states that it does not understand the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Respondent did not attempt to \"discharge its burden of proof\u2019 on the issue of substantial business activities until the Counter-Memorial. Aside from the question of who bears the burden of proof, Article 41 of the ICSID Convention clearly states that an objection to jurisdiction or admissibility may be raised in the counter-memorial.254\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6137-138.\n\n266.\n\nTherefore, according to the Respondent, the two requirements of Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT are clearly met. On this basis, the Respondent denied EuroGas the benefits of the BIT on 21 December 2012. The Respondent submits that this denial of benefits was valid and timely.255\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7II.B.3.\n\n267.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent disputes the proposition that such a denial of benefits can have only prospective effect. Relying on *Ulysseas v. Ecuador, Pac Rim v. El Salvador* and *Guaracachi v. Bolivia,* the Respondent asserts that tribunals in recent cases have interpreted denial of benefits clauses to have retroactive effect, and have also confirmed that States may deny an investor the right to arbitrate up until the filing of the countermemorial.256 Therefore, according to the Respondent, it could have denied benefits to EuroGas as late as its Counter-Memorial in this case.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6115-117, *Ulysseas, Inc. v. Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 28 September 2010, \u00b6173 (RL-103); *Pac Rim Cayman LLC. v.

Plurinational State of Bolivia,* PCA Case No. 2011-17, Award, 31 January 2014 (RL-20).\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that, in any event, even if Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT could not be applied retroactively, the Respondent still validly denied EuroGas the right to arbitration, by doing so *prospectively257* It denied EuroGas this right by letter of 21 December 2012, more than one year before the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration.258 That letter states:\n\n*[P]ursuant to Article 1(2) of the Treaty, the Slovak Republic hereby exercises as of today, 21 December 2012, its right to deny EuroGas,**Inc. the benefits of the Treaty, including the right to arbitration under Article VI of the Treaty.259*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6119.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6121, *citing* Letter from the Slovak Republic to EuroGas Inc., 21 December 2012 (C-41/R-5).\n\nLetter from the Slovak Republic to EuroGas Inc., 21 December 2012 (C-41/R-5).\n\n269.\n\nIndeed, according to the Respondent, it is \"the first country to deny benefits under an investment treaty prior to the commencement of arbitration.\"260\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b66.\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent does not accept the Claimants\u2019 assertion that, by the \"Notification of a Claim against the Slovak Republic\" of 31 October 2011, EuroGas accepted the Slovak Republic\u2019s offer to arbitrate before this denial of benefits. First, there is a distinction between when EuroGas agreed to arbitration (the 31 October 2011 letter) and when it exercised the right to arbitrate (the Request for Arbitration). To the Respondent, the critical question is whether the Slovak Republic denied the right to arbitrate before that right was actually exercised, which it did.261 Second, EuroGas did not in any event validly agree to arbitration by its 31 October 2011 letter because that letter did not specify a choice of arbitration forum, as required under Article IV of the US-Slovakia BIT.262\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 123.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6124.\n\n271.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have adopted an overly-restrictive interpretation of the denial of benefits clause, which should be rejected. The Respondent addresses three specific aspects of the Claimants\u2019 interpretation:\n\na. The Claimants are wrong to suggest that the denial of benefits clause applies only to \"shell\" or \"sham\" companies. There is nothing in the language of Article 1.2 that would limit its application to particular *types* of companies. In fact, by its express terms, the clause could apply to a company that is active in one country but not in the territory of the relevant treaty party.263 In any event, \"EuroGas II indeed is no more than a sham company with no demonstrable business activities.\"264\n\nb. The Claimants attempt to read the word \"substantial\" out of the text of the clause. This approach runs counter to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the **\"VCLT\").265** The ordinary meaning of \"substantial\" is \"real and material.\"266 Therefore, Article 1.2 \"requires an assessment of the nature of the business of the company at stake and review the quality of its activities.\"267\n\nc. The Claimants make a novel argument that it is sufficient for a company to carry out substantial business activities at any point in time. However, as held by the tribunal in *Ulysseas v. Ecuador,* the relevant time for the fulfilment of the requirements for a valid denial of benefits is the time of the notice of arbitration.268 Applying that test, the Respondent has shown that EuroGas has not had any substantial business activities in the United States since its incorporation in 2005. Therefore, the requirements for a valid denial of benefits were satisfied at all relevant times.269\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 140.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6141.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT provides that \"a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6143-145, *citing* the definition of \"substantial\" in online Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (R-267); definition of \"substantial\" in online Oxford Dictionary (R-268); *Limited Liability Company Amto v.

The Claimants state that they advanced these invitations in a notice of dispute dated 23 December 2013, Request for Arbitration dated 25 June 2014, Answer to Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated 16 October 2014, and Rejoinder to Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures dated 21 November 2014.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, \"in accordance with general principles of international arbitration and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, jurisdictional objections are to be raised in *limine litis* in order to be admissible,\" and therefore the Respondent should have attempted to discharge its burden of proof at the earliest opportunity.272\n\nReply \u00b698.\n\n275.\n\nMoreover, in the present case, the Respondent\u2019s delay puts the Claimants at a procedural disadvantage that could result in an irreparable infringement of their due process rights.273 This, according to the Claimants, is because they have been \"forced to preemptively address matters for which Respondent bears the burden of proof\u2019 in their Reply and will not have the opportunity to address in writing the Respondent\u2019s response. A decision to admit the Respondent\u2019s objection \"would essentially be rewarding Respondent for its recurrent failure to meet its procedural obligations.\"274\n\nReply \u00b699.\n\nReply \u00b699.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 alternative position is that, even if the Respondent\u2019s objection is deemed admissible, it must fail on the merits. In the Claimants\u2019 view, the burden of proving that EuroGas \"has no substantial business activities\" in the territory of the United States lies with the Respondent, and the Respondent has entirely failed to discharge this burden. The Claimants offer three main arguments to support this view.\n\n277.\n\nFirst, the Claimants submit that EuroGas does not fall into the very narrow category of claimants that the parties to the US-Slovakia BIT intended to be covered by Article 1.2. In accordance with the VCLT, that provision must be interpreted in light of its \"object and purpose.\"275 According to the Claimants, the object and purpose of denial of benefits clauses in United States BITs is reflected in the *amicus curiae* submission of the United States in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador276* In that submission, the United States indicated that such provisions are meant \"to safeguard against the potential problem of \u2018free rider\u2019 investors, i.e., third-party entities that may only as a matter of formality be entitled to the benefits of a particular agreement,\" and that they allow a treaty party \"to deny benefits to an enterprise if it is merely a \u2018sham company\u2019 having no \u2018substantial business activities\u2019 in the... country in which it is established.\"277\n\nReply \u00b6103, *citing* Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, Article 31(1).\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Submission of the United States of America, 20 May 2011, \u00b63 (CL-241).\n\nReply \u00b6104, *quoting Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Submission of the United States of America, 20 May 2011, \u00b63 (CL-241).\n\n278.\n\nTo the Claimants, it follows that the object and purpose of Article 1.2 is to prevent \"treaty shopping.\" The intended application is limited to companies that are formally incorporated in a particular State in order to take advantage of the relevant treaty. It would be \"nonsensical\" to suggest that EuroGas, which has been operating in the United States for 20 years (first as the 1985 Company and then as the Claimant EuroGas), was incorporated in order to secure the advantages of the US-Slovakia BIT.278\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6105-106.\n\n279.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants assert that EuroGas is unlike the claimant in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador.* In particular, until 2011, EuroGas was registered with the SEC and had publicly traded stock, and today it still has hundreds of shareholders.279 Notably, after 2011, EuroGas \"continued to own its U.S. assets, namely EuroGas Silver & Gold and Tombstone, both of which conducted mining exploration activities in the U.S.\"280\n\nReply \u00b6107, *citing* Complete Stock Holders List of EuroGas, Inc. - Common (as of 14 November 2011).\n\nReply \u00b6109.\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 second argument is that the Respondent has failed to show how its \"disjointed allegations\" regarding EuroGas demonstrate an absence of business activities, as required by Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT.281 According to the Claimants, these allegations are irrelevant in assessing EuroGas\u2019 main business and reflect a misunderstanding of junior mining companies. In particular, the Claimants assert that:\n\na. The absence of operational revenues is to be expected \"because the accumulation of substantial losses is inherent to the very nature of the activity of junior mining companies.\"282\n\nb. EuroGas had very few assets other than shareholding in projects outside of the United States to be auctioned in the Bankruptcy Proceedings because \"junior mining companies typically do not own many assets, and their most valuable one is their investment in the exploration of newly discovered deposits, in the hope of a high rate of return.\"283\n\nc. It is irrelevant whether EuroGas\u2019 management was based outside of the United States \"given that its activity as a junior mining company, which consisted mainly in raising capital to fund exploration projects, remained in the U.S.\"284\n\nd. EuroGas would not need to have a physical office to carry out its business, and it has always maintained an address in the United States (at times a P.O. Box) where it could be reached.285\n\nReply \u00b6110.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6111-114.\n\nReply \u00b6114.\n\nReply \u00b6114.\n\nReply \u00b6114.\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 third argument is temporal: the Respondent has failed to identify at which point in time a company must lack substantial business activities in order to fall within Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT.286 According to the Claimants, if a company has the requisite \"substantial business activities\" at any time during the life of the investment, that \"in itself would demonstrate a high level of commitment to the country\u2019s economy.\"287 To deny such an investor the benefits of the US-Slovakia BIT on the basis of a formal requirement would run counter to the BIT\u2019s object and purpose, which, as reflected in its preamble, is to stimulate investment by offering investors foreseeable protections.288\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6115-123. The Claimants point out that previous tribunals considering denial of benefits clauses have not been called upon to address this specific question. This is because, when compared to the element of foreign control, the level of a company\u2019s business activities is much less volatile, and significant time and money would be required to \"fake\" substantial activities. Reply \u00b6116.\n\nReply \u00b6118.\n\nReply \u00b6121, *citing* the US-Slovakia BIT, Preamble (C-l).\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 position is summarized as follows:\n\n*once the existence of substantial business activities has been ascertained at one point during the life of the investment, or at the very least at the time of the initial investment... any purported attempt to invoke the denial of benefits clause would go against the object and purpose of the Treaty and should fail. Any other conclusion would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, especially in circumstances where it may very well be the host State\u2019s very own breaches that could have caused the investor to cease having any substantial activities in the US289*\n\nReply \u00b6122.\n\n283.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent has not shown, or even attempted to show, that EuroGas lacked substantial business activities in the territory of the United States in 1998, at the time of the initial investment.290 In light of EuroGas\u2019 operations at that time, the Claimants consider the existence of EuroGas\u2019 substantial business activities to be undisputable.\n\nReply \u00b6123.\n\n***C. Ratione Temporis***\n-------------------------\n\n**Application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT (1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Belmont finds its basis in Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which limits the treaty\u2019s application \"to any dispute that has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into force.\" The Respondent submits that because the Canada-Slovakia BIT entered into force on 14 March 2012, it covers only disputes arising after 14 March 2009, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Belmont in relation to any dispute arising before that date.291\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7II.B; Rejoinder \u00a7III.B.\n\n285.\n\nIn applying Article 15(6) to Belmont\u2019s claims in this arbitration, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants advance two distinct types of claims: (a) one for the Respondent\u2019s wrongful reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights in 2005 (referred to by the Respondent as the \"Reassignment Claim\"); and (b) another for the Respondent\u2019s failure to remedy the wrongful reassignment through its administrative and judicial processes (referred to by the Respondent as the \"Denial-of-Justice Claim\").292\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6146-147; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6244-245. According to the Respondent, the Claimants have not disputed this distinction between types of claims, and they have admitted that they are not asserting a claim for a single \"creeping expropriation.\" Rejoinder \u00b6246; *see* Counter-Memorial \u00b6145.\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s primary argument is that the \"real cause\" of this dispute is the reassignment of the Mining Area in 2005; the decisions of Slovak administrative and judicial authorities at issue in this case cannot be considered a separate dispute.293\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.B.2. The Respondent applies the objective definition of \"dispute\" offered in the *Mavrommatis* case (a \"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons\"), and concludes that the dispute leading to the Reassignment Claim arose on 3 May 2005.

Peru,* in which the tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to hear a dispute with the same subject matter as a dispute that arose before the relevant treaty came into force.294 The tribunal considered the critical inquiry to be \"whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.\"295 Applying this test to the present case, the Respondent argues that the Slovak administrative and judicial proceedings \"merely continued the earlier dispute.\"296\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6160-163; Rejoinder \u00b6248, *citing Industria Nacional de Alimentos, SA. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, SA.

However, the Respondent argues that it has shown that case to be fundamentally different and that the Claimants have not disagreed with its analysis.301\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6251-255, *citing* *Jan de Nul NV and Dredging International NV v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 June 2006, \u00b6\u00b6127-128. The Respondent asserts that, unlike in the present case, in *Jan de Nul,* the State was not involved in the underlying dispute; it only became involved through its courts. Therefore, the judicial action was considered to be a \"decisive factor\" in defining the dispute. That cannot be the case here, where the State has been involved since the reassignment of the Mining Area. *Id.*\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the Claimants\u2019 assertion that a dispute arises only when the complaint is articulated.302 For the Respondent, \"the moment when a dispute arises must be determined objectively and cannot depend solely on the formalistic manner of articulation of claims.\"303 This has been confirmed by numerous international tribunals, including the tribunals in *Lao Holdings v. Laos* and *African Holding v. Congo304* An objective analysis shows that this dispute arose upon the reassignment of the Mining Area.305\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.B.3\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 169.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6256, *citing* *Lao Holdings N.

For example, the tribunal in *Teinver v. Argentina* stated that: \"To instigate a dispute... does not refer to the commission of the act that caused the parties to disagree, for the very simple reason a breach or violation does not become a \u2018dispute\u2019 until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.\" *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas SA. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur SU. v.

In a letter to the DMO of 13 January 2005, Rozmin complained of the withdrawal of its rights and, after referring to the Canada-Slovakia BIT, stated: \"It is undisputable that the unlawful withdrawal of the excavation area... is in conflict with the stated international treaties that have precedence over the Slovak laws.\"309\n\nb. In a letter to the Slovak Minister of Economy of 3 November 2005, Mr. Agyagos (as Belmont\u2019s President and CEO) challenged the reassignment and threatened arbitration under bilateral investment treaties.310\n\nc. In a letter of 22 September 2008, EuroGas GmbH also threatened to bring an international investment claim.311\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6171, Rozmin\u2019s complaint against DMO\u2019s acts, 13 January 2005 (R-161).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6172, *citing* Letter from Mr. Agyagos and Belmont to the Minister of Economy of the Slovak Republic, 3 November 2005 (R-162).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6174, *citing* Letter from EuroGas GmbH to the Minister of Economy of the Slovak Republic, 22 September 2008 (R-163).\n\n293.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent asserts that Belmont\u2019s own words contradict the Claimants\u2019 position that the dispute arose after 1 August 2012, when the local Slovak proceedings were concluded. In Claimants\u2019 notice of dispute of 23 December 2013, the Claimants refer to EuroGas\u2019 notice of dispute of 2011 and state that \"Belmont\u2019s claims are the very same as those of EuroGas.\"312\n\nRejoinder \u00b6268, *citing* Letter from EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. to the Government of the Slovak Republic, 23 December 2013, \u00b635 (C-42).\n\n294.\n\nIn light of these facts, the Respondent concludes that there is no doubt that the dispute leading to the Reassignment Claim arose before 14 March 2009 when the Canada-Slovakia BIT first began to apply.\n\n295.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimants try to avoid this clear result by improperly conflating the words \"arise\" and \"initiate\" under the Canada-Slovakia BIT.313 However, the Canada-Slovakia BIT intentionally distinguishes between the time when a dispute is initiated (by being notified to the State under the terms of the treaty), and the time when it arises, which logically must precede its initiation.314\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.B.5.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6167, *citing* Canada-Slovakia BIT, Article X(2) (C-2) (\"if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which the dispute was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration.\").\n\n296.\n\nTurning specifically to what Respondent calls the Claimants\u2019 \"Denial-of-Justice Claim,\" the Respondent states:\n\n*Once the dispute over the reassignment of the Excavation Area was submitted to the Slovak Republic\u2019s administrative and judicial authorities, the treatment by these authorities may only give rise to a claim for denial of justice,315*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6177. *See* Rejoinder \u00b6245.\n\n297.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the tribunal lacks jurisdiction over any administrative/judicial actions prior to 14 March 2009. Thus, the Respondent identifies just four events occurring after that date: (a) the Regional Court decision of 3 February 2010, (b) the Supreme Court decision of 18 May 2011, (c) the DMO\u2019s reassignment on 30 March 2012, and (d) the MMO\u2019s confirmation of that assignment on 1 August 2012.316 However, for the Respondent, the fact remains that \"the reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s Excavation Area in 2005 is the one and only source of this dispute.\"317\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6178.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6247.\n\n298.\n\nFinally, the Respondent addresses the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Respondent is estopped from raising its objection *ratione temporis* against Belmont because it \"represented, as late as in May 2012, that the dispute was not yet ripe and that the filing of the arbitration should therefore be delayed.\"318 In Respondent\u2019s view, none of the three requirements for estoppel under international law is met in this case:319\n\na. First, there is no clear statement of fact. In the 2 May 2012 letter upon which the Claimants rely, the Respondent never stated that the \"dispute was not ripe,\" as the Claimants allege. Even if this statement had been made, it would be merely a legal characterisation, not a statement of fact.320\n\nb. Second, the Respondent\u2019s statements in the 2 May 2012 letter were not unconditional. Indeed, the letter contains an express reservation of rights.321\n\nc. Third, there was no good faith reliance on the Respondent\u2019s statement.322 In fact, Belmont could not have relied on any statement in the 2 May 2012 letter, because that letter related only to EuroGas\u2019 claims brought under the US-Slovakia BIT.\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.B.6; Letter from the Slovak Republic, 2 May 2012, (C-40). The Respondent also rejects any suggestion that this letter could form an independent basis for jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Belmont\u2019s claims, as suggested by the Claimants, given that this letter related only to EuroGas\u2019 claims. Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6182-183.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6276. The Respondent adopts the requirements set forth by the tribunal in *Pan Am v.

Indeed, for the Respondent, Article X(5) only confirms that a treaty claim can arise before the conclusion of local proceedings.325\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.B.7.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, those domestic proceedings and the \"investment claim are totally independent.\" Rejoinder \u00b6289.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6239.\n\n300.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Belmont had more than seven years to seek recourse to arbitration under the previous Canada-Slovakia BIT, and by waiting, it assumed the risk that its claim would be time-barred.326 This principle was recently upheld by the tribunal in *Ping An v. Belgium,* which held that disputes already notified to the host State, but not yet submitted to arbitration when a successive investment treaty came into force, fell outside of the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* For the Respondent, the same is true here.327\n\nRejoinder \u00b6269.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6297-299, *citing Ping An Life Insurance Company of China, Limited and* *Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Limited v.

Respondent\u2019s position is inconsistent and Respondent is therefore estopped from raising, in the proceedings, any timing issue with respect to the initiation of the proceedings.332*\n\nReply \u00b6192.\n\n304.\n\nIndeed, according to the Claimants, the Respondent continued to intentionally delay the initiation of proceedings, even after the Claimants sent the Respondent a \"Final Notice of Dispute\" on 23 December 20 1 3.333\n\nReply \u00b6193, *citing* Letter from EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. to the Government of the Slovak Republic, 23 December 2013, \u00b635 (C-42). In response to this letter, the Respondent cited the six-month period of negotiation and consultation under Article X(2) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n305.\n\nIn any event, in the Claimants\u2019 view, even if the Tribunal were to determine that the Respondent is not estopped from raising this jurisdictional objection, the objection should still be dismissed.334\n\nReply \u00a7II.B.2.\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimants accept that under Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, the dispute itself must have arisen after 14 March 2009.335 However, unlike the Respondent, their position is that the dispute arose only after that critical date. The Claimants raise five main arguments to contest the Respondent\u2019s position.\n\nReply \u00b6197.\n\n307.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that the Respondent mistakenly focuses on the events leading up to the dispute, when the only relevant factor in determining whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is the time when the dispute itself arises.336 In this regard, the Claimants point to *Maffezini v. Spain,* in which the tribunal held that it had jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because, even though the events giving rise to the dispute predated the entry into force of the relevant treaty, the dispute itself did not arise until after that date.337\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6197-199.\n\nReply \u00b6198, *citing* *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, \u00b696 (CL-39) (\"there tends to be a natural sequence of events that leads to a dispute.... The conflict of legal views and interests will only be present in the latter stage, even though the underlying facts predate them. It has also been rightly commented that the existence of the dispute presupposes a minimum of communications between the parties, one Party taking up the matter with the other, with the latter opposing the Claimant\u2019s position directly or indirectly.\").\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimants also cite Professors Dolzer and Schreuer\u2019s statement that:\n\n*The time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events leading to the dispute. By definition, the allegedly illegal acts must have occurred some time before the dispute. Therefore, the exclusion of disputes occurring before the treaty\u2019s entry into force should not be read as excluding jurisdiction over events occurring before that date,338*\n\nReply \u00b6197, *quoting* Rudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2008), p. 44 (CL-36).\n\n309.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this important distinction is reflected in the text of Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which provides that the treaty \"shall apply to any *dispute* which has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into force.\"339 In contrast, the Claimants point out that the PCIJ\u2019s jurisdiction in *Phosphates of Morocco* depended on the time at which the \"situations or facts\" leading up to the dispute occurred.340 Similarly, in *African Holding v. Congo,* the tribunal explained that it was the date of the events leading up to the dispute, rather than the dispute itself, which was determinative of its jurisdiction.341 Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s reliance on these cases is entirely misplaced.\n\nReply \u00b6197, *quoting* the Canada-Slovakia BIT, Article 15(6) (C-2) (emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\nReply \u00b6200, *citing* *Phosphates in Morocco (Italy v.

Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 October 2006 (CL-61), \u00b652.\n\n313.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s position that the present dispute could have arisen when Rozmin stated on 13 January 2005 that a withdrawal of its mining rights would constitute a breach of international law,348 or on 3 November 2005 when Mr. Agyagos wrote to the Slovak Minister of Economy mentioning \"the relevant international institutions to which we intend to subsequently refer.\"349 The Claimants consider these to be merely \"one-sided observations, which were not accompanied by any claim.\"350 Similarly, the dispute could not be deemed to have arisen on the basis of EuroGas GmbH\u2019s 22 September 2008 letter to the Minister of Economy,351 as EuroGas GmbH is not even a Party to this arbitration and did not formulate any claim in that letter.352\n\nRozmin\u2019s complaint against DMO\u2019s acts, 13 January 2005 (R-161) (referring to \"foreign investors - the companies Belmont Resources Inc. with its seat in Canada and EuroGas GmbH, with its seat in the Federal Republic of Austria, whose investments are protected by bilateral investment treaties concluded with the Federal Republic of Austria and with Canada\" and stating that \"[i]t is undisputable that the unlawful withdrawal of the excavation area, which will evidently occur without any compensation, is in conflict with the stated international treaties.\").\n\nLetter from Mr. Agyagos and Belmont to the Minister of Economy, 3 November 2005 (R-162).\n\nReply \u00b6212.\n\nLetter from EuroGas GmbH to the Minister of Economy of the Slovak Republic, 22 September 2008 (R-163).\n\nReply \u00b6212\n\n314.\n\nThird, the Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the dispute arose as soon as Rozmin asserted its claims in domestic proceedings.

The applicable treaty in that case provided that it would not apply to disputes that had arisen before its entry into force.\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the dispute before the Slovak courts is not the same as the one before the Tribunal. They differ *ratione personae* as Belmont was not a party to the local proceedings, and they differ *ratione materiae* as the local proceedings concern Rozmin\u2019s rights under Slovak domestic law. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s reliance *ort Lucchetti v.

The Claimants point out in particular that in *Lucchetti v.

Furthermore, as late as 28 January 2015, two years after the Canada-Slovakia BIT entered into force, the Respondent asserted that it was unaware of any dispute with Belmont.357\n\nReply \u00b6230.\n\nReply \u00b6221, *citing* Letter from the Slovak Republic, dated 2 May 2012(C-40) (\"the administrative procedure before the Slovak mining offices is still pending, therefore any discussions regarding the alleged claims of EuroGas Inc. seems to me to be premature prior relevant decisions of local authorities are rendered.\").\n\nReply \u00b6225, *citing* Letter from Mr. Peter Kazimr, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic to Dr. Hamid Gharavi, Counsel for Claimants, 28 January 2014 (C-59) (stating that Dr. Gharavi\u2019s letter of 23 December 2013 was \"the first information that the Slovak Republic [had] received regarding a dispute from Belmont Resources Inc.\").\n\n317.\n\nAlso in this context, the Claimants oppose the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Canada-Slovakia BIT as distinguishing between the moment when a dispute is \"initiated\" and when it \"arises.\" According to the Claimants, under Article X(2) of that treaty, \"the outset of the dispute - the moment when the dispute arises or is \u2018initiated\u2019 - corresponds to the moment one party articulates its claims, which triggers the parties\u2019 duty to engage in settlement negotiations.\"358\n\nReply \u00b6217. The Claimants state that the BIT distinguishes between the moments when the dispute is initiated or arises, on the one hand, and when the dispute is submitted to arbitration, on the other. *Id., citing* Canada-Slovakia BIT Article 15(6) (C-2).\n\n318.\n\nFourth, the Claimants recall that one of the breaches they are alleging is that the Slovak Republic failed to comply with the decisions of the Slovak Supreme Court, issued on 27 February 2008 and 18 May 2011. They argue that it was not until 1 August 2012, when the MMO confirmed the DMO\u2019s reassignment of the Mining Area that any prospect of Belmont\u2019s recovery through the local proceedings was closed.359 That was well after the critical date for the purpose of jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6235-236.\n\n319.\n\nFinally, according to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s argument that Belmont should have initiated arbitration sooner, before the exhaustion of local remedies, contradicts its own position on the merits that the Claimants\u2019 claims relating to the Supreme Court decisions were not ripe until all local remedies had been exhausted.360\n\nReply \u00b6237.\n\n**D. Belmont\u2019s Ownership of the Investment**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection relating to Belmont\u2019s standing is that this Claimant no longer holds any shares in Rozmin and cannot bring a claim on the basis of an alleged investment it does not own. Belmont therefore \"has no standing to bring its claims, and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over them.\"361\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6142. *See* Rejoinder \u00a7III.A.\n\n321.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Belmont sold its 57% interest in Rozmin to EuroGas I through a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated as of 27 March 2001 (the **\"SPA\").362** The date of the SPA is important to the Respondent, who asserts that the agreement was executed at a time when EuroGas I still had the legal capacity to enter the SPA, before the company was dissolved and before it entered the Bankruptcy Proceedings.363\n\nShare Purchase Agreement between EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc., 17 April 2001 (R-15). The Respondent notes that the Claimants did not disclose this document to the Tribunal, and the Respondent had to uncover it through its own research.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6223.\n\n322.\n\nTo support this jurisdictional objection, the Respondent relies on the analysis of the SPA provided by its expert on British Columbia Law (which governs the SPA), as well as on certain public statements and actions of EuroGas and Belmont after the SPA\u2019s execution.364\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.A.\n\n323.\n\nThe Respondent and its expert oppose the Claimants\u2019 argument that Belmont still owns the shares in Rozmin, as certain conditions precedent provided in the SPA were unfulfilled. The analysis of the Respondent\u2019s expert focuses in particular on Sections 2.1, 4.1, and 6.1 of the SPA:\n\na. Section 2.1(a) requires EuroGas to transfer 12,000,000 of its common shares (the **\"Purchase Price Shares\")** to Belmont. Under Section 6.1 of the SPA, this is a condition precedent to closing of the sale. It is undisputed that this condition was satisfied.365\n\nb. Section 2.1(e) requires EuroGas to pay Belmont a USD 100,000.00 non-refundable advance royalty. Under Section 6.1 of the SPA, this too is a condition precedent to closing of the sale. The Claimants acknowledge that at least USD 74,000.00 was paid, and in fact, Belmont\u2019s audited financial statements show, effectively, that the entire amount was paid.366\n\nc. Section 2.1(b), (c) and (d) are obligations that \"need only be undertaken, not actually be performed, before the 57% interest transfers.\"367 This interpretation is confirmed by the language of the provision and the nature of the obligations. For example, Section 2.1(d) grants to Belmont a 2% royalty on \"the gross sale revenue of any talc sold [during] the mining life of the deposit.\" The only condition to closing is the *grant* of a 2% royalty; the *payment* of the royalty could not take place until later, after closing.368\n\nd. Sections 4.1(b) and (c) provide that EuroGas will issue additional shares to Belmont in certain circumstances following the closing. EuroGas did issue 3,830,000 additional shares to Belmont under Subsection 4.1(b).369\n\ne. Section 4.1(d) states that EuroGas I *''agrees* to arrange the necessary financing.\"370 EuroGas obviously met this requirement by signing the SPA. If EuroGas could not arrange financing, it was to \"pay [Belmont] an advance royalty of USD 10,000.00 per month.\" Any failure to pay that monthly royalty would not prevent the closing of the sale, although it might be grounds for a breach of contract claim by Belmont.\n\nf. Section 6.1 states that ownership of the 57% interest in Rozmin will not pass to EuroGas \"unless and until [Belmont] has received 125% of its initial investment equal to CDN $3,000,000 through the sale of the Purchase Price Shares.\" However, \"it is clear that the words cannot be given their plain meaning\" because that would lead to a commercially absurd result: after receiving payment, Belmont could prevent the transaction by simply selling the shares for less, or not at all.371 Further, there is a disconnect between Section 6.1 and Subsections 4.1(b) and (c). To reconcile this, Section 6.1 should be read to provide that \"the shares to the 57% interest remain with Belmont as collateral, which secures EuroGas I\u2019s obligation to issue additional shares under Subsections 4.1(b) and (c).\"372\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 175.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6176-177, *citing* Belmont Resources Inc.\u2019s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended 31 January 2002 and 2001, notes 2 and 3 (R-114) (referring to \"[p]ayment by EuroGas of $100,000 U.S. as advance royalties (subsequently net recovery to Belmont of $96,744)\").\n\nRejoinder \u00b6181.\n\nAnderson ER \u00b612.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 185, *citing* Letter from Belmont to EuroGas, dated 10 October 2002 (R-112).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6208-212, *quoting* SPA, Section 4.1(d) (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nAnderson ER\u00b6 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6131; Rejoinder \u00b6200; Anderson ER \u00b67. In other words, Belmont could foreclose and repossess legal title to the shares in Rozmin if EuroGas failed to issue additional shares under Subsections 4.1(b) and (c).\n\n324.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Respondent concludes that Belmont transferred its 57% stake in Rozmin to EuroGas at the time of closing, retaining only a security interest in those shares to secure EuroGas\u2019 compliance with other covenants in the SPA.373\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6131; Anderson ER\u00b65.\n\n325.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this conclusion is consistent with the fact that the Claimants have repeatedly declared that Belmont sold the 57% interest to EuroGas, including on the following occasions:\n\na. Belmont\u2019s 2002 audited financial statements stated that Belmont \"sold its 57% interest in Rozmin s.r.o. effective 27 March 2001... and holds the shares as a collateral measure only.\"374\n\nb. Belmont\u2019s Annual Information Form of 30 September 2002 also stated that it sold interest in Rozmin to EuroGas.375\n\nc. In September 2004, Belmont alleged a breach of the SPA and threatened to \"repossess\" its shares from Rozmin but then agreed not to \"foreclose\" on the collateral interest.376\n\nd. Belmont and EuroGas I entered into a letter agreement on 24 September 2004, in which they recognized \"EuroGas, Inc.\u2019s 57% interest in Rozmin s.r.o.\"377\n\ne. Mr. Vojtech Agyagos, President and Director of Belmont, testified before Slovak criminal authorities that Belmont \"sold its shares probably in 2002 to EuroGas\" and \"did not suffer any direct damage\" from the Respondent\u2019s acts alleged in this arbitration.378\n\nf. On 17 August 2013, Mr. Alexander Danicek, an executive of Rozmin from 2008 to 2014, stated before Austrian criminal authorities that EuroGas owned a 90% share in Rozmin.379\n\ng. Claimants have stated that Belmont will receive just a 3.5% interest in any award in this case and that it will not cover any of the arbitration costs.380\n\nh.

However, \"[t]he fact that Belmont both claimed and denied ownership whenever it suited their interests should hardly be the basis for giving them the benefit of the doubt.\"382 The Claimants bear the burden of establishing the factual basis of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and Belmont cannot rely on its ownership in Rozmin after having repeatedly admitted that it does not own Rozmin.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6140.\n\n327.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, its position is also supported by the actions of EuroGas and Belmont. After receiving the EuroGas shares as consideration for the 57% transfer, Belmont sold them to a third Party.383 Similarly, EuroGas claims to have granted an irrevocable option on the 57% interest in Rozmin to Protec Industries, Inc. and then transferred it to EuroGas GmbH.384\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6204-205, *citing* Belmont Resources Inc.\u2019s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years ended 31 January 2004 and 2003, note 3 (R-43); Agyagos WS, \u00b626.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6206, *citing* Letter from Mr. Wolfgang Rauball to Mr. Ame Przybilla, of Protec Industries Ltd., 12 January 2004 (R-118); EuroGas AG Statement about participation (German original: DGAP-News EuroGas AG:Klarstellung zur Untemehmens-Beteiligung), (with extended translation), 25 February 2012 (R-265).\n\n328.\n\nRespondent further argues that none of the other facts alleged by the Claimants demonstrate that Belmont retained ownership of the Rozmin interest. First, in the Respondent\u2019s view, it is \"legally irrelevant\" that Belmont is registered as a shareholder of Rozmin.385 Under the Slovak Commercial Code in effect when the SPA was executed, \"the registration of the change in ownership of shares in a limited liability company was not dispositive of ownership.\"386 Second, the appointment of Mr. Agyagos to the board of EuroGas only undermines the Claimants\u2019 position, as it was precisely Belmont\u2019s shareholding in EuroGas - acquired through the SPA - that gave Belmont the right to appoint a director.387 Similarly, \"Belmont\u2019s injections of working capital into the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma project are fully consistent with Belmont\u2019s new position as shareholder of EuroGas I,\" particularly because Belmont was to receive a royalty based on revenues from the project.388\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6141.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6141.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6219.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6221.\n\n329.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent challenges the Claimants\u2019 legal argument that even if Belmont held the shares in Rozmin only as collateral, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction over Belmont. The Respondent contends that:\n\na. If Belmont held only a collateral security interest, then it would be nothing more than a creditor of EuroGas. As held by the tribunal in *Burimi v. Albania,* the creditor of an investor has no standing to bring claims for losses suffered by the investor. This is true even if the creditor holds the investment as collateral.389\n\nb. Belmont\u2019s collateral security interest would not qualify as an \"investment\" under the *Salini* test, as it \"involves no transfer of economic value from Belmont to the Slovak Republic, no effective contribution over a period of time, and no contribution to the development of the Slovak Republic\u2019s economy.\"390\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6225-226, *citing* *Burimi SRL and Eagle Games SHA v.

Czech Republic* is misplaced because the claimant in that case owned shares in the investment, and it was the ownership of those shares that qualified as an investment.

Therefore, in accordance with the general principle of law that \"the beneficial (and not the nominal) owner of property is the real Party-in-interest before an international court,\" Belmont would still not have standing to bring its claims before this Tribunal.391\n\nRejoinder \u00a7III.A.5.\n\n**(2) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n331.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s submissions relating to the SPA, the Claimants argue that (a) Belmont remains the owner of a 57% interest in Rozmin because certain conditions for the transfer of its shares under the SPA were never satisfied; and (b) even if Belmont retained only a security interest in the 57% stake in Rozmin, this would still qualify as an \"investment\" under the Canada-Slovakia BIT and the ICSID Convention.392\n\nReply \u00a711. A.\n\n332.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Belmont never transferred its shares in Rozmin to EuroGas under the SPA because neither the conditions set forth in Article 2 of the SPA nor the condition precedent stipulated in Article 6.1 were fulfilled.393\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6133 *et seq.*\n\n333.\n\nFirst, the Claimants point out that Article 2(1)(a) and (e) of the SPA required EuroGas to transfer the Purchase Price Shares to Belmont, and to pay Belmont a non-refundable advance royalty of USD 100,000.00.394 In turn, under Article 6.1, Belmont was to deliver to a trust all documentation necessary for the transfer of its shares in Rozmin. According to the Claimants, while EuroGas did transfer the common shares to Belmont, it fell short on the advance royalty payment by approximately USD 26,000.00. Therefore, Belmont never delivered the transfer documentation to the trust, and the shares were not transferred.395\n\nReply \u00b6135, *citing* SPA, Article 2.1(a), (d) and (e) (R-15).\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6139-142.\n\n334.\n\nThe Claimants contest the opinion of the Respondent\u2019s expert that Belmont waived the shortfall on the advance royalty payment.396 They assert that none of the correspondence cited by Mr. Anderson supports his assumption, and \"there is no ground to assume an implicit waiver of any of the conditions stipulated in the SPA.\"397\n\nReply \u00b6140, *citing* Anderson ER \u00b614.\n\nReply \u00b6141. Mr. Anderson cites, *inter alia,* a letter from Belmont to EuroGas of 27 April 2004 (C-296). The Claimants point out that it does not mention a waiver and states that \"[e]xcept as provided in this Letter of Understanding (\u2018LOU\u2019), all other terms and conditions of the March 27/01 Share Purchase Agreement and November 8/03 Agreement shall continue to have the same effect and force as though the parties had not entered into this LOU.\"\n\n335.\n\nSecond, the Claimants point to Article 2.1(d) of the SPA, which provided that EuroGas would pay Belmont a 2% royalty on the revenue of any talc sold over the life of the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit. The Claimants argue that since the deposit never went into commercial production, EuroGas was unable to pay the 2% royalty. Further, it did not perform its obligation to make monthly advance royalty payments as required under Article 4(d).398\n\nArticle 4(d) required EuroGas to arrange the financing necessary to get the deposit into production within one year of the SPA. If this was not achieved, EuroGas was to pay Belmont \"an advance royalty of U.S.$ 10,000 per month for each month of delay in achieving commercial production.\" Share Purchase Agreement between EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc., 27 March 2001, Article 4(d) (R-15).\n\n336.\n\nThird, the Claimants refer to Article 6.1 of the SPA, which stipulated that \"the ownership of the Shares shall not pass to the Purchaser [...] unless and until the Vendor has received 125% of its initial investment equal to CND $3,000,000 through the sale of the Purchase Price Shares.\" According to the Claimants, this condition precedent was never satisfied. In 2002, EuroGas issued Belmont an additional 3,830,000 restricted shares, but by 31 January 2006, Belmont had recovered only USD 1,505,400.00. The Claimants point out that the Respondent expressly acknowledged this fact in its Application for Provisional Measures.399\n\nReply, \u00b6153, *citing* Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures and Opposition to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, 10 September 2014, \u00b6\u00b641-43 (\"As of 31 January 2006, Belmont had disposed of all of the 15,830,000 EuroGas I shares for approximately US$1,505,400\").\n\n337.\n\nIn addition to these contractual arguments, the Claimants submit that, in any event, after EuroGas\u2019 dissolution in 2001, it could no longer acquire Belmont\u2019s shares in Rozmin. Under Utah law \"a dissolved company may enter into agreements after its dissolution only for purposes of winding up and liquidating its business and affairs. That does not include acquiring new assets or issuing new shares.\"400\n\nReply \u00b6176. In this regard, the Claimants submit that, if the Tribunal were to accept the Respondent\u2019s argument that EuroGas I did not have capacity to enter into a merger with EuroGas II after its dissolution, it \"would also have to conclude that the 1985 Company could not have acquired Belmont\u2019s 57% interest in Rozmin after its dissolution.\" Reply \u00b6177.\n\n338.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in correspondence beginning in October 2003, Belmont and EuroGas acknowledged that Belmont had never transferred the 57% interest in Rozmin to EuroGas.401 For example, on 18 June 2004, Belmont threatened to \"offer for sale [its] 57% interest in Rozmin s.r.o. to any interested third party.\"402 Although the companies tried to recover the deal, EuroGas never performed its obligations.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6145-152, citing Letter from Belmont Resources Inc. to EuroGas Inc., 30 October 2003 (C-337); Letter Agreement between Belmont Resources and EuroGas Inc., 8 November 2003 (C-298); Letter of Understanding between Belmont Resources and EuroGas Inc. dated 27 April 2004 (C-296) (\"Belmont agrees, once the remaining 50% is paid (Item3/Promissory Note) to transfer without any delay the recorded ownership of the 57% interest in Rozmin from Belmont to EuroGas Inc.\"); Letter from Belmont Resources Inc. to EuroGas Inc., 18 June 2004 (C-338); Letter from EuroGas Inc. to Belmont Resources Inc., 24 September 2004, accepted and counter-signed by Mr. Agyagos on behalf of Belmont Resources Inc. (C-297).\n\nLetter from Belmont Resources Inc. to EuroGas Inc., 18 June 2004 (C-338).\n\n339.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants conclude that Belmont remains the owner of its shares in Rozmin. The Claimants highlight that Belmont is still today a registered shareholder of Rozmin.403 Further, EuroGas never acted as the beneficial owner of Belmont\u2019s interest in Rozmin.404 Belmont remained active in Rozmin\u2019s management even after the SPA was executed and never ceded exclusive control to EuroGas. It also continued to make advances of working capital after the SPA was concluded, none of which was ever reimbursed.405\n\nReply \u00b6156, *citing* Extract from the Business Register of the Slovak Republic, 21 December 2014 (C-74). The Claimants consider the Respondent\u2019s statement that registration of a change in ownership was not legally required at the time of the SPA to be irrelevant; \"the absence of re-registration cannot in any way be deemed proof than [sic] an actual change of ownership occurred.\"\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6157-159.\n\nReply \u00b6159, *citing* Rozmin s.r.o.

As Mr. Anderson himself states, under the law of British Columbia, courts \"initially interpret a contact by giving the words of a contract their ordinary meaning.\"408\n\nb. Mr. Anderson incorrectly assumes that if the Purchase Price Shares were sold for less than CAD 3 million, the precondition in Article 6.1 of the SPA could never be met. He fails to consider that Article 4(c) requires EuroGas to \"issue such additional common shares to compensate for any shortfall from the CDN$3,OOO,OOO.\"409\n\nc. Mr. Anderson opines that Belmont had no obligation under the SPA to use its best efforts to sell the Purchase Price Shares. However, Belmont clearly had such a duty, given that Article 4(c) would apply only if Belmont was \"unable\" to recover CAD 3 million.410\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6160-168.\n\nReply \u00b6163, *citing* Anderson ER \u00b616.\n\nReply \u00b6163, *citing* Anderson ER \u00b6 10(a) and (b).\n\nReply \u00b6166.\n\nReply \u00b6167.\n\n341.\n\nThe Claimants also challenge the reliance of the Respondent and Mr. Anderson on public statements regarding the sale of shares under the SPA. These statements have no legal effect \"because mere declarations by one party alone... cannot bind or create rights and/or obligations for the other party.\"411\n\nReply \u00b6161.\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that in Belmont\u2019s 2001 and 2002 financial statements, the company stated that it held the 57% interest in Rozmin as collateral only.412 They assert that at this time, Belmont was hopeful that EuroGas would fulfil its obligations. Indeed, in 2002, Belmont explained that it held the Rozmin shares \"pending settlement of the amount of guarantee shares to be issued by EuroGas and completion of the U.S. registration statement.\"413 Around the same time, Mr. Agyagos was appointed to serve on the board of EuroGas to ensure the company would perform its obligations under the SPA, and the press release announcing the appointment stated that Belmont had *\"conditionally* accepted the sale of Belmont\u2019s 57% interest in Rozmin s.r.o. to EuroGas, Inc.\"414\n\nReply \u00b6170.\n\nReply \u00b6170, *citing* Belmont Resources Inc.\u2019s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended 31 January 2002 and 2001, note 2, p. 8 (R-114).\n\nReply \u00b6171, *quoting* News Release and Material Change Report issued by Belmont and filed on SEDAR in anticipation of the transaction, 16 May 2001 (R-111) (emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants point to additional Belmont press releases from 2005415 and 2008,416 stating that Belmont still owned a 57% stake in Rozmin.

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS ON LIABILITY**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nAs discussed in Sections V and VI below, the Tribunal has decided that it lacks jurisdiction over both Claimants. Therefore, in this Section, the Parties\u2019 positions on liability are summarised briefly for information purposes only. This brief summary provides a general overview of the Parties\u2019 positions and does not reflect the detailed arguments and subarguments raised by the Parties in this proceeding.\n\n**A. Expropriation Claim**\n--------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n348.\n\nBoth Claimants argue that the taking and reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights, as confirmed by the DMO\u2019s letter of 3 January 2005 informing Rozmin that its rights had *de facto* been revoked and were to be awarded to a new organization, constitutes an unlawful expropriation. The Claimants submit that direct and indirect expropriation is prohibited under both BITs unless the expropriation was carried out for a public purpose, in a non-discriminatory manner, in accordance with due process of law and upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n349.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the taking of Rozmin\u2019s rights was a substantively unlawful indirect or creeping expropriation because it was not conducted for a public purpose. Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s position, the Claimants argue that the 2002 Amendment could not validly justify the revocation of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights because the Amendment entered into force after Rozmin was awarded its rights and had no retroactive effect. Therefore, the Amendment could not be applied to Rozmin. In addition, the Claimants submit that even if the 2002 Amendment did apply, its application could not justify the taking of Rozmin\u2019s rights in the circumstances. Notably, the Claimants recall that (a) on 31 May 2004, the DMO granted Rozmin an authorization to carry out activities until 13 November 2006; (b) Rozmin officially announced to the DMO that it would resume mining activities by 18 November 2004; and (c) the DMO never warned Rozmin of the application of the 2002 Amendment.\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the taking of Rozmin\u2019s right was an unlawful expropriation having regard to the procedure followed by the DMO. The Claimants complain that the taking was performed \"abruptly,\" without consideration for the \"most basic due process rights,\" notably due to the lack of any prior notice that the Slovak authorities contemplated revoking Rozmin\u2019s rights. The Claimants emphasise that the Slovak Supreme Court itself found on three occasions that the procedure followed to reassign Rozmin\u2019s mining rights was unlawful.\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimants finally argue that in any event, the taking was not accompanied by the \"immediate adequate and effective compensation\" due in case of a lawful expropriation, because Rozmin received no compensation at all.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe Slovak Republic maintains that the reassignment of the Mining Area was a legitimate exercise of the State\u2019s regulatory powers. According to the Respondent, the 2002 Amendment was mandatory law aimed at fostering effective use of the Slovak Republic\u2019s mineral resources by preventing speculative practices. Rozmin did not excavate from 1 January 2002 to 1 January 2005 and thereby failed to comply with the 2002 Amendment.\n\n353.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimants merely complain that the value of their shareholding decreased as a result of the reassignment of the Mining Area; however, the fact that their shareholding may be worth less does not constitute an expropriation.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment Claims**\n------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Claimants\u2019 Position\n-----------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions, taken individually or collectively, constitute substantive and procedural breaches of the fair and equitable treatment standard set forth in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Slovakia BIT and Article III(1)(a) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n355.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants submit that the Respondent failed to act consistently and to meet their legitimate expectations having regard to the following chronology of events:\n\na. on 31 May 2004, the DMO authorised Rozmin to carry out mining activities until 13 November 2006;\n\nb. on 8 November 2004, Rozmin officially announced to the DMO that it would resume mining activities by 18 November 2004, and the DMO did not react;\n\nc. on 8 December 2004, the Director of the DMO conducted an inspection of the deposit and concluded that Rozmin\u2019s activities were in compliance with legal regulations in force; and\n\nd. on 3 January 2005, the Slovak Republic announced that Rozmin\u2019s mining rights had been awarded to Economy Agency.\n\n356.\n\nThe Claimants also consider that the Respondent failed to act transparently and to treat their investment non-arbitrarily and reasonably, notably because:\n\na. the Claimants were neither notified that the authorities were contemplating revoking their mining rights nor afforded an opportunity to present their case;\n\nb. the Respondent announced that it was initiating a new tender procedure for the assignment of the Mining Area before informing Rozmin of the revocation of its mining rights;\n\nc. the DMO disregarded the decision of the Slovak Supreme Court by \"stubbornly\" reassigning Rozmin\u2019s rights to VSK Mining in July 2008 and again in March 2012, which amounts to a denial of justice and hence a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard;\n\nd. in July 2008, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 27 February 2008 cancelling the DMO\u2019s decision to reassign Rozmin\u2019s rights, the DMO did not initiate a new tender and simply awarded these rights to VSK Mining; and\n\ne. finally, in June 2014, on the eve of commencement of ICSID proceedings as announced in settlement discussions, the Respondent launched criminal proceedings targeting Rozmin and the Claimants.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the Claimants\u2019 fair and equitable treatment claim as a denial of justice claim because it is based on the assumption that the Slovak administrative and judicial bodies issued incorrect decisions and caused delays in administrative proceedings commenced by Rozmin following the reassignment of its mining rights.\n\n358.\n\nThe Respondent states that\n\n*it is a fundamental principle of international law that a low-level administrative or judicial decision can constitute an international delict only if no effective remedy is available or if the aggrieved party\u2019s applications for remedy do not lead to redress. In other words, a State should always be judged by its \"final product\", and**will only be held liable if the overall process of its decision-making is erroneous.420*\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6370.\n\n359.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that denial of justice requires exhaustion of local remedies and that the Claimants\u2019 claims therefore cannot succeed, because the Claimants abandoned the domestic proceedings they commenced by not appealing the decision of the DMO confirming the assignment of the Mining Area on 1 August 2012. Respondent adds that Claimants were at all times provided with a fair opportunity to present their case.\n\n360.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that even if the high standard required for finding a denial of justice does not apply, the Claimants still have failed to prove a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In particular, the Respondent argues that a claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations may be based only on specific assurances given by the host State at the time when the investor makes the investment; however, the Claimants have not shown that they received any such assurance from the Slovak Republic with respect to Rozmin\u2019s mining rights.\n\n361.\n\nRegarding the criminal investigation complained of by the Claimants, the Respondent states that the issue is moot because the Slovak Republic has already returned all seized documents. In this context, the Respondent refers to its Opposition to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures dated 10 September 2014 and its Rejoinder Opposition to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures dated 21 November 2014.\n\n**C. Arbitrary and Unreasonable Treatment Claim**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions identified as being in violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard are also in breach of (a) Article IX(1) of the of the US-Slovakia BIT421 and (b) Article IX(1) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT,422 which is to be read *a contrario.* They submit that the DMO\u2019s conduct could not be inspired by a rational policy.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the US-Slovakia BIT provides: \"neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments.\"\n\nArticle IX(1) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT provides: \"Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary: (a) to protect human, animal or plant life or health; (b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; or (c) for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.\"\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the DMO\u2019s reassignment of the Mining Area was substantively correct, and that \"any and all errors in the Slovak Republic\u2019s administrative and judicial proceedings were remedied and had no impact on Rozmin.\"423 Thus, in the Respondent\u2019s view, such errors could not meet the high threshold for arbitrariness established by the International Court of Justice in the *E.L.S.I.* case. The Respondent emphasises that the correct application of Slovak law would have led to the same result and that the 2002 Amendment was enacted to address a rational policy (namely fostering effective use of mineral resources and avoiding speculative practices).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6539.\n\n**D. Full Protection and Security Claim**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions identified as being in violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard also constitute a violation of the standard of full protection and security, which is provided in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Slovakia BIT and Article III(1)(a) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, as well as customary international law.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n365.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the standard of full protection and security invoked by Claimants is not applicable to their claims as this standard requires events of threats or actual injury to aliens attributable to a third party, which are absent in this case. Further, according to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal were to adopt a more expansive interpretation of the full protection and security standard, the Claimants have failed to establish facts that would rise to a violation of that standard.\n\n**E. Failure to Comply with Specific Commitments Claim**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimants contend that both BITs require the Slovak Republic to honour its specific obligations towards foreign investors.\n\n367.\n\nAs regards the US-Slovakia BIT, the Claimants invoke Article II(2)(c), which provides that \"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n368.\n\nAs regards the Canada-Slovakia BIT, the Claimants recognise that that treaty does not contain a similar provision and submit that Article II(2)(c) of the US-Slovakia BIT may be applied to Canadian investors via Article III(2) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT, which is a most favoured nation clause.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"the Slovak Republic specifically undertook to allow Rozmin to carry out mining activities at the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit until November 13, 2006, by way of decision of the DMO issued on May 31, 2004, which was reconfirmed on December 8, 2004, by Mr. Baffi, the DMO\u2019s Director, following an inspection of the Mining Area\"424 and breached that obligation by revoking Rozmin\u2019s rights in the weeks which followed.\n\nMemorial \u00b6378.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it did not undertake any commitment that it would not reassign the Mining Area under the 2002 Amendment. Therefore, the Claimants\u2019 specific commitments claim should fail.\n\n**V. TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISIONS ON JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS RELATING TO EUROGAS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nTo begin, the Tribunal notes that EuroGas was erroneously described as being incorporated in 1985 in the Request for Arbitration, leading to confusion as to which company is a claimant in this arbitration. Even though the mistake would have been very serious if it had not been rectified, at this stage, the Tribunal sees no consequences to be drawn from the incorrect description of one of the Claimants in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n372.\n\nIn the following sections, the Tribunal will refer to one of the Claimants as **\"EuroGas II.\"** The Tribunal will refer to the company called EuroGas Inc. that was incorporated in 1985 and later dissolved as **\"EuroGas I.\"** EuroGas I is not a party to these proceedings.\n\n373.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal to resolve is whether EuroGas II validly qualifies as an investor under the US-Slovakia BIT through its shareholding in EuroGas GmbH, which was a shareholder in Rozmin at the time of the reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights.\n\n374.\n\nIn order to establish that it does, EuroGas II must demonstrate:\n\na. that when the Bankruptcy Proceedings closed on 19 March 2007, EuroGas I owned the shares in EuroGas GmbH and thereby owned the claim relating to the 2005 reassignment of the Mining Area (the **\"Talc/Reassignment Claims\");** ***and***\n\nb. that EuroGas I validly transferred the Talc/Reassignment Claims to EuroGas II.\n\n**A. Did EuroGas I Emerge from the Bankruptcy Proceedings Owning the Talc/Reassignment Claims?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, it is important to recall the chronology of the Bankruptcy Proceedings initiated in respect of EuroGas I on the basis of Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.425\n\nSee also \u00a7I(B)(9) above.\n\n376.\n\nOn 18 May 2004, Mr. Steve Smith, Trustee for the bankruptcy estate of Harven Michael McKenzie, a creditor of EuroGas I **(\"Trustee Smith\"),** filed an involuntary petition of bankruptcy against EuroGas I in the Bankruptcy Court.426 Trustee Smith subsequently obtained a judgment against EuroGas I in a separate bankruptcy proceeding in Texas, in the amount of USD 113,371,837.65 and filed this claim against EuroGas I in the Bankruptcy Court in Utah.\n\nA Public U.S. Bankruptcy Filing from the EuroGas Bankruptcy Case, Case No. 04-28075, Docket No. 1 - EuroGas Bankruptcy Petition, 18 May 2004 (R-85).\n\n377.\n\nThe Chapter 7 trustee appointed to administer EuroGas I's estate was Trustee Marker. The Tribunal understands that a Chapter 7 trustee is required to \"collect and reduce to money the property of the estate for which [he] serves, and close such estate as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties in interest.\"427\n\n*In re Buerge,* 2014 WL 1309694 (10th Cir. BAP 2014) (CL-257).\n\n378.\n\nOn 27 January 2005, the Bankruptcy Court ordered Mr. Wolfgang Rauball, Mr. Reinhard Rauball and Mr. Hank Blankenstein, as designated principals of EuroGas I, to file schedules and statements of assets and to turn over property and records of the estate of EuroGas I to Trustee Marker.\n\n379.\n\nNo schedules or statements of assets were ever filed. Trustee Marker therefore conducted an investigation and liquidated EuroGas I\u2019s interest in several affiliated companies and distributed the proceeds to creditors. The proceedings were closed on 19 March 2007, without the estate\u2019s interest in EuroGas GmbH or any potential claims that EuroGas I might have against the Slovak Republic being administered.\n\n380.\n\nThe question whether the potential claims against the Slovak Republic (the Talc/Reassignment Claims), which should have been scheduled, became property of the estate or were abandoned to EuroGas I by Trustee Marker, is debated. The Tribunal has heard expert evidence from both sides and has been provided with several legal authorities on the issue. However, the Tribunal considers that the question has become moot due to the reopening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings and subsequent developments.\n\n381.\n\nIndeed, in September 2015, a creditor described as an affiliate of EuroGas II, Texas EuroGas Corp., sent a letter to the U.S. Trustee, requesting that the Bankruptcy Proceedings be reopened to investigate whether the Talc/Reassignment Claims were property of the EuroGas I estate. On 21 December 2015, following a Motion to Reopen from the U.S. Trustee,428 the Bankruptcy Court ordered the reopening of the case \"for the specific purpose of determining the bankruptcy estate\u2019s interest in the asset identified in the Motion to Reopen.\"429 The Bankruptcy Court also ordered the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, Trustee Loveridge, to investigate the bankruptcy estate\u2019s interest in the asset identified in the Motion to Reopen.430\n\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s Motion to Reopen Under 11 U.S.C. \u00b6350, 18 September 2015 (R-248).\n\nOrder Granting Motion to Reopen Under 11 U.S.C. \u00b6350, 21 December 2015 (R-242).\n\nNotice of Appointment of Interim Trustee, 22 December 2015 (R-264).\n\n382.\n\nHaving looked into the issue and conducted her own investigation, Trustee Loveridge entered into discussions with EuroGas II and with the Slovak Republic with a view to concluding an agreement with one of them to generate cash for distribution to EuroGas I\u2019s creditors. Eventually, Trustee Loveridge entered into an agreement with EuroGas II on 9 August 2016, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court (the **\"Agreement\").431** The Bankruptcy Court approved the Agreement on 28 October 2016.432 The Agreement provides as follows in Recitals and substantive provisions:\n\n*Based on her independent investigation, the Trustee has concluded that (a) the Former Trustee* [Trustee Marker] *had information available to him concerning the existence of the Talc Claims; (b) the Former Trustee did not expressly abandon the Talc Claims, but may**or may not have intended that the Talc Claims were abandoned upon closing of the Bankruptcy Case; (c) in any case, the issue whether the Talc Claims may not have been abandoned by the Former Trustee has not been resolved; (d) to the extent the Talc Claims were abandoned by the Former Trustee, they are burdensome to the estate and of inconsequential value to the estate;* *(e) creditors would stand to benefit from EuroGas pursuing the Talc Claims because EuroGas has assumed the Debtors liabilities; and* *(f) an abandonment of whatever remaining interest the Bankruptcy Estate may have in the Talc Claims* nunc pro tunc *to the petition date* [the petition date is 18 May 2004, commencement of the Bankruptcy Proceedings - *cfi* Recital C] *under the terms of this Agreement is in the best interests of creditors.*\n\n*In consideration of the terms and conditions contained therein, the Parties now agree as follows:*\n\n[...]\n\n*3. Remittance upon Execution. Immediately upon execution,**EuroGas will remit to the Trustee $150,000.00.* [...]\n\n*4. Notice of Abandonment. Together with the motion to approve the Agreement, the Trustee shall file a notice of abandonment of any remaining interest, if any, that the Bankruptcy Estate may still have in the Talc Claims.* [...]*433*\n\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s Motion to Reopen, 18 September 2015 including draft agreement (C-360).\n\nBankruptcy Court Memorandum Decision, 28 October 2016 (Exhibit A to EuroGas Il\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 9 November 2016).\n\nU.S. Trustee\u2019s Motion to Reopen, 18 September 2015 including draft agreement (C-360).\n\n383.\n\nThe abandonment *nunc pro tunc* of any interest that may have remained with EuroGas Es bankruptcy estate means that the Talc/Reassignment Claims must be considered has having remained with EuroGas I since the opening of the Bankruptcy Proceedings on 18 May 2004. As stated by the Bankruptcy Court in its Memorandum Decision approving the Agreement:\n\n*The Trustee has requested a determination that the abandonment is effective* nunc pro tunc *to the petition date* [18 May 2004], *Making a judicialfinding that the abandonment is effective* nunc pro tunc *to the petition date is available only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\" The legal effect of abandonment is determined as a**matter of law. When property is abandoned, it* \"reverts to the debtor and stands as if no bankruptcy petition was filed.\"434\n\nBankruptcy Court Memorandum Decision, 28 October 2016 (Exhibit A to EuroGas Il\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 9 November 2016).\n\n384.\n\nTherefore, either the Talc/Reassignment Claims had been validly abandoned by Trustee Marker initially and reverted to EuroGas I, or they had not been abandoned, remained property of the estate, and reverted to EuroGas I *nunc pro tunc* following their abandonment by Trustee Loveridge under the terms of the Agreement. In both scenarios, the Talc/Reassignment Claims must be deemed property of EuroGas I as from 18 May 2004.\n\n385.\n\nTherefore, notwithstanding the fact that it is uncontested that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the thorny issue whether Trustee Marker validly abandoned the Talc/Reassignment Claims or not, the Tribunal need not embark on this complex legal and factual enquiry.\n\n386.\n\nThe main question to resolve in respect of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over EuroGas Il\u2019s claims in these ICSID proceedings therefore lies in the alleged transfer of the Talc/Reassignment Claims from EuroGas I to EuroGas II. The Tribunal notes that the Bankruptcy Court acknowledged the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on this point and made no factual or legal determination in that respect in the Memorandum Decision approving the Agreement. The Bankruptcy Court stated that\n\n*EuroGas I was administratively dissolved in 2001 for failure to file an annual report and pay a nominal fee. EuroGas II was incorporated after the bankruptcy petition was filed, and signed the Merger documents in which it sought to inherit all EuroGas I\u2019s assets and liabilities. Whether the Talc Claims passed to EuroGas II in the Merger or remained with EuroGas I will be a matter for the Arbitration Tribunal to decide. This Court takes no position on that question other than to note that whatever interest the bankruptcy**estate had or has in the Talc Claims is authorized to be abandoned by the Trustee.435*\n\nBankruptcy Court Memorandum Decision, 28 October 2016 (Exhibit A to EuroGas IPs letter to the Tribunal dated 9 November 2016).\n\n387.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal specifies that it need not determine EuroGas II's argument that the Respondent has no standing to challenge the abandonment of the interest in EuroGas GmbH by Trustee Marker.436 As noted above, the Tribunal does not make any finding in that respect and simply draws consequences from the terms of the Agreement between EuroGas II and Trustee Loveridge, as approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\n\nReply \u00b625. Snell & Wilmer ER, \u00b6\u00b695-99.\n\n**B. Did EuroGas I Validly Merge with EuroGas II, Making the Latter the Continuation of the Former?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nAccording to EuroGas II, the alleged transfer of EuroGas I\u2019s assets and liabilities (including the Talc/Reassignment Claims) to EuroGas II was implemented through a *''de facto* merger\" between EuroGas I and EuroGas II in 2008, making the latter the continuation and the successor of the former. The merger was allegedly effectuated through the Joint Resolution, the full title of which is \"Joint Unanimous Consent Resolution of the Directors of EuroGas Inc, a Utah corporation dissolved in 2001 and EuroGas Inc, a Utah corporation formed in 2005 and in good standing approving proposed class \u2018F\u2019 reorganisation made retroactively effective to November 15, 2005.\"437\n\nJoint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\n389.\n\nThe effectiveness of this merger as a means of transfer by EuroGas I of its interest in EuroGas GmbH and of the Talc/Reassignment Claims to EuroGas II is contested.\n\n390.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the merger is void (or at least voidable) because EuroGas I, as a dissolved company, could not enter into any contracts other than for the purpose of winding up its activities. According to the Respondent, a merger agreement purporting to enable the business of the dissolved company to continue through a different corporate shell is inconsistent with winding up. In addition, since EuroGas I had been dissolved for longer than two years, there was no possibility of reinstatement and therefore of retroactive validation of any other contracts that EuroGas I might have entered into while it was dissolved.\n\n391.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the Joint Resolution could not possibly effectuate a merger between EuroGas I and EuroGas II because, under Utah law, the corporate law of both EuroGas I and EuroGas II, mergers may only be effectuated in accordance with certain legal provisions which have not been followed.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal will address both arguments in turn.\n\n**(1) Can a Dissolved Company Validly Merge with Another Company?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nRegarding whether EuroGas I could validly merge with another entity while it was dissolved, the Tribunal notes that the evidence submitted by the Parties is unclear. It appeared uncontested during most of the proceedings that EuroGas I, as a dissolved company, was authorised to enter into contracts aiming at the winding up of its affairs (although a recent case discussed during the cross examination of Mr. Gardiner appeared to stand for the proposition that all contracts entered into by a dissolved company are void).438\n\n*See* Tr. Day 3, 78:15 *et seq.* (discussion between Mr. Gardiner and Ms. Burton of *Wittingham LLC v. TNE Limited Partnership* (2016 UT App 176, or 2016 Utah App Lexus 19 193, or 820 Utah Advance Report 68).\n\n394.\n\nTo add to the confusion, the Joint Resolution suggests that the Utah Division of Corporations considers that a dissolved company cannot merge with another company in good standing. The Joint Resolution recalls:\n\n*WHEREAS, under Utah law, a dissolved domestic corporation cannot formally merge with another domestic corporation under Utah\u2019s corporate merger statute, the [Utah Division of Corporations], among other things, being unwilling and lawfully incapable of accepting and stamping Articles of Merger involving a dissolved corporation or in which a dissolved corporation is a Party.439*\n\nJoint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\n395.\n\nThe fact that the Utah Division of Corporations appears to have refused to accept articles of merger involving EuroGas I due to the fact that it was a dissolved corporation is not conclusive evidence of whether dissolved companies may take part in a merger under Utah law. However, it is a strong signal that they may not. If that were the case, there would be no legal avenue for EuroGas I to transfer the Talc/Reassignment Claims to EuroGas II through a merger.\n\n396.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal will assume that the practice of the Utah Division of Corporations as recalled in the Joint Resolution is inconclusive or should not be given any weight in the context of its analysis because neither side has relied on the Utah Division of Corporations practice in the context of the jurisdiction debate.\n\n397.\n\nWhat the Parties have addressed is the meaning and effects of Section 1405(1) of the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act, which provides:\n\n*A dissolved corporation continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs including:*\n\n*(a) collecting its assets;*\n\n*(b) disposing of its properties that will not be distributed in kind to its shareholders;*\n\n*(c) discharging or making provision for discharging its liabilities;*\n\n*(d) distributing its remaining property among its shareholders according to their interests; and*\n\n*(e) doing every other act necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs.440*\n\nUtah Code. Ann. \u00a716-10a-1405 (R-19).\n\n398.\n\nIn the opinion of Mr. Brad W. Merrill, EuroGas Il\u2019s Utah corporate law expert, this provision authorises a dissolved company such as EuroGas I to merge with another entity. Mr. Merrill states in the expert opinion dated 28 September 2015 that:\n\n*None of the provisions of the* [Utah Revised Business Corporation Act], *including the merger provisions or dissolution provisions, in any way restrict or limit a dissolved corporation from pursing or consummating a merger in connection with its wind up activities.**Indeed, given the very nature of a merger - to combine two**companies into one surviving legal entity where the surviving entity assumes all assets, rights and liabilities of the extinguished entity -a merger into an active corporation would in fact be one of the most effective and efficient ways to wind up and liquidate a dissolved corporation.441*\n\nSnell & Wilmer ER \u00b6103.\n\n399.\n\nMr. Merrill concludes that there is no legal obstacle under Utah law to a merger between EuroGas I and EuroGas II.\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s experts, Ms. Jarvis and Mr. Gardiner, hold a different view. They consider that the merger that allegedly took place between EuroGas I and EuroGas II cannot have been entered into validly because it aimed at perpetuating EuroGas I\u2019s existence, not liquidate it. In support of this conclusion, these experts emphasise the terms of the Joint Resolution:\n\n*The Joint Resolution attempts to establish EuroGas II \"as a continuation\" of EuroGas I, specifically \"to continue and carry on the business and affairs\" of EuroGas I. Such an effort runs contrary to the* [Utah Revised Business Corporation Act]*\u2019s explicit prohibition of a dissolved corporation from continuing its business.**In addition, such an action is not of the same kind as \"disposing of [the corporation\u2019s] properties.\"442*\n\nJarvis/Gardiner ER \u00b658.\n\n401.\n\nHaving considered both sides\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal leans toward the conclusion that EuroGas I, though dissolved, was authorised under Utah law to merge with EuroGas II. The alleged merger would have the effect of transferring all the assets and liabilities of one company to another, leaving nothing behind in the first company\u2019s corporate shell. This outcome, which is clearly the desired outcome of the Joint Resolution, is consistent with Section 1405(1) of the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that EuroGas I could merge with EuroGas II in 2008 even though it was dissolved. The only reason it would have to doubt that this conclusion is correct is the practice of the Utah Division of Corporations, as described in the Joint Resolution (quoted above at paragraph 392). However, as previously stated, the Tribunal has not taken this into account.\n\n402.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that a dissolved corporation may, under Utah law, take part in a merger in order to liquidate its assets is without prejudice to the crucial issue as to whether a merger between EuroGas I and EuroGas II did occur in the present case.\n\n**(2) Did EuroGas I Validly Merge with EuroGas II?**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the issue whether the Joint Resolution validly effectuated a merger between these two entities, with the result that the Talc/Reassignment Claims passed to EuroGas II.\n\n404.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that it is uncontested that the alleged merger did not comply with the statutory requirements for mergers under Utah law, in particular the filing of articles of merger with the Utah Division of Corporations (due to, it appears, the Utah Division of Corporations\u2019 refusal to accept and stamp articles of merger involving a dissolved corporation). Section 16-10a-1105(2) of the Utah Code states that a \"merger or share exchange takes effect upon the effective date of the articles of merger or share exchange, which may not be prior to the date of filing.\"443\n\nUtah Code, \u00a716-10a-l 105(2) (RL-93).\n\n405.\n\nThe first question to resolve, therefore, is whether there was any possibility for the Joint Resolution to effectuate a merger without complying with the Utah law statutory requirements.\n\n406.\n\nAccording to the express terms of the Joint Resolution, the parties to this resolution intended to effectuate the merger on the basis of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to circumvent the refusal of the Utah Division of Corporations to register a merger involving a dissolved company. They envisaged a so-called \"Class F reorganization\" to achieve the merger that the Utah Division of Corporations refused:\n\n*WHEREAS, the \"winding up\" of a dissolved corporation\u2019s affairs would seem NOT to exclude the engaging or participating in a Class \"F\" reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended,**particularly when nothing in the law appears to require that a Class F reorganization requires filing and recording of Articles of Merger with the Division;444*\n\nJoint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\n407.\n\nOn the basis of this (hesitant) understanding that the Class F reorganisation described in Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 would enable EuroGas I and EuroGas II to achieve the same outcome as a statutory merger, the signatories to the Joint Resolution *(i.e:* the directors of these companies) resolved as follows *(inter alia):*\n\n*that the Corporation* [EuroGas II] *proceed to carry on the business and affairs for which it was incorporated, namely, to continue and carry on the business and affairs of the Predecessor Corporation* [EuroGas I]; *and, in addition, that the Corporation hereby complete the so-called Class \"F\" reorganization with its Predecessor, namely, carrying out that which is necessary to make the Corporation assume and inherit the shareholders\u2019 list and other assets and liabilities of the Predecessor Corporation, including the recognition of the Predecessor Corporation, including the recognition of the Predecessor Corporation\u2019s issued and outstanding shares, shareholder base and issued and outstanding stock certificates;445*\n\nJoint Resolution, 31 July 2008 (C-57).\n\n408.\n\nConsistent with the text of the Joint Resolution, EuroGas II initially argued, relying on the Joint Resolution, that the transfer of EuroGas I\u2019s assets and liabilities to EuroGas II was effectuated through the Class F reorganisation process referred to in the Joint Resolution and that this made EuroGas II the continuation of EuroGas I under Utah law:\n\n*On July 23, 2008, EuroGas\u2019 corporate documents were amended to mirror those of the 1985 Company and in order to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs, in accordance with Utah State law, the 1985 Company entered into a joint resolution with EuroGas and performed a type-F reorganization, whereby EuroGas assumed all of the assets, liabilities and issued stock certificates of the 1985 Company.446*\n\nMemorial \u00b621.\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent protested, in the Counter-Memorial, that the Joint Resolution is \"a sham document that is a nullity under both (i) the legal regime of the sovereign State of Utah, and (ii) the legal regime of U.S. federal bankruptcy.\"447 It notably argued that \"Section 368(a)(1)(F) addresses only whether a corporate transaction qualifies for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It cannot revive a corporation under state law or authorize reorganization of a corporate entity under state law.\"448\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b645.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b660.\n\n410.\n\nIn its Reply, EuroGas II did not express a disagreement and stated that\n\n*the reference in the Resolution to Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the U.S.**Internal Revenue Code only reflected the parties\u2019 intention to treat the merger as a tax-free transaction. It did not however constitute the legal basis pursuant to which the merger would be operated and become effective.449*\n\nReply \u00b690.\n\n411.\n\nEuroGas II then re-focused its arguments on the (alleged) transfer of EuroGas I\u2019s assets and liabilities to EuroGas II to a *de facto* common law merger theory.\n\n412.\n\nThe Respondent has contested the possibility that such a *''de facto* merger\" could ever be deemed to have occurred between EuroGas I and EuroGas II for the purpose of transferring the Talc/Reassignment Claims from the former to the latter. According to the Respondent, the common law *de facto* merger theory is a liability theory developed by the courts to sanction parties which attempt to avoid the applicable requirements of a statutory merger, for example by implementing the merger operation through a series of transactions which minority shareholders cannot oppose.450 The *de facto* merger theory can also apply where two companies enter into an agreement whereby one of them transfers all its assets to another to the detriment of its creditors.451\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6107-114; Utah Department of Commerce Division of Corporate & Commercial Code, Utah Corporation and Business Laws (1992) (RL-154).\n\n*City of New York v. Charles Pfizer & Co.,* 688 N.Y.S.2d 23, 24 (NY App. 1st Dep\u2019t 1999) (6 April 1999) (RL-175).\n\n413.\n\nMr. Gardiner, the Respondent\u2019s Utah corporate law expert, convincingly explained why, in his view, the *de facto* merger common law theory is not an autonomous legal basis for companies to merge validly under Utah law, without complying with the statutory provisions on mergers. Notably, he provides a full quote of an authority relied upon by EuroGas II\u2019s corporate law experts: the official commentary of Utah corporation and business laws. The Tribunal finds this authority helpful in understanding the concept of *\"de facto* merger\" and notes that it was only partially cited by EuroGas II\u2019s experts. The commentary states:\n\n*A transaction may have the same economic effect as a statutory merger even though it is cast in the form of a non statutory transaction. For example, assets of the disappearing corporations may be sold for consideration in the form of shares of the surviving corporation, followed by the distribution of those shares by the disappearing corporations to their shareholders and their subsequent dissolution. Transactions have sometimes been structured in nonstatutory form for tax reasons or in an effort to avoid some of the consequences of a statutory merger, particularly appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders. Faced with these transactions, a few courts have developed or accepted the \"de facto merger\" concept which, to some uncertain extent, grants to dissenting shareholders the rights they would have had if the transaction had been structured as a statutory merger.... These problems should not occur under the Revised Act since the procedural requirements for authorization and consequences of various types of transactions are largely standardized.452*\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6107-114; Utah Department of Commerce Division of Corporate & Commercial Code, Utah Corporation and Business Laws (1992) pp. 185-186 (RL-154).\n\n414.\n\nThis passage of the official commentary of Utah corporate law, deemed relevant and authoritative by both sides, supports the Respondent\u2019s position that the *de facto* merger theory is not an autonomous legal basis for Utah corporations to merge, but a theory developed by the courts to address situations which fall in the gaps of statutory provisions. It addresses situations where the legal rights of third parties to the transactions under review are unjustly affected, and aims to protect them.\n\n415.\n\nAs explained by Mr. Gardiner, the legal authorities cited by EuroGas II do not support the proposition that Utah law authorises mergers between entities outside the framework of the statutory provisions on mergers, which both sides agree have not been followed.\n\n416.\n\nBut even assuming that such a *de facto* merger could have taken place in theory, the Tribunal is doubtful that the merger could have taken place through a joint resolution of the directors of the allegedly merging entities without shareholders\u2019 consultation and agreement, especially where the companies are listed.\n\n417.\n\nEven if this could be admitted, which the Tribunal cannot accept, there is a real question as to whether the Joint Resolution on its own effectuated the contemplated merger.\n\n418.\n\nAs noted by Mr. Gardiner, the Joint Resolution falls short of an actual transfer of rights and liabilities from EuroGas I to EuroGas II. The Joint Resolution records the signatories\u2019 *(i.e.:* the directors\u2019) agreement to proceed with the transfer, but it also records their (justified) doubts as to the necessary legal steps to be taken to render the transfer effective and valid. The Joint Resolution indeed records that:\n\n*RESOLVED FURTHER, that a confirmatory transfer of the assets of the Predecessor Corporation to EuroGas, Inc (incorporated on November 15, 2005) is hereby authorized and that at least one of the officers and directors of the Predecessor Corporation is hereby authorized to execute, on behalf of the Predecessor Corporation, those documents necessary, if any, to confirm transfer of any personal property and liabilities from the Predecessor Corporation to the new successor EuroGas, Inc.453*\n\nJoint Resolution, 31 July 2008, (C-57).\n\n419.\n\nMr. Gardiner explained at the hearing that the directors\u2019 agreement to proceed with an action is insufficient to make that action occur:\n\n*(Mr Gardiner):.... This joint resolution reflects the intentions of the two boards of directors to do something to, in essence, combine the two corporations and make them into one, without complying with merger statute or without at least providing evidence of actual transfers of assets or contractual assumptions of liabilities. It also contemplates that the new EuroGas entity would simply treat the outstanding shares of the prior EuroGas entity, or EuroGas I, as I**call it, simply treat those shareholders as its own, which in my experience as a corporate lawyer, I don\u2019t know how you do that.**One company can\u2019t, just by a resolution - and by the way, the directors are the same on both sides, right? - decide that the shareholders of one company are now the shareholders of another company. That just doesn\u2019t work, at least in Utah corporate law.*\n\n*Q. How do companies merge in Utah?*\n\n*A. (Mr Gardiner) They enter into an agreement: we usually call it an \"agreement and plan of merger.\" And they agree to file articles of merger with the Division of Corporations, and they file them. The public gets notice of the fact that these corporations have merged.**And the merger is effective once those articles of merger have been filed.*\n\n*Q. So the merger cannot take effect before the articles of merger are filed?*\n\n*A. (Mr Gardiner) No.454*\n\nHearing Tr. Day 4, 110:5-111:6.\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced by this testimony and finds that EuroGas II and its experts have failed to establish any basis under Utah law (statutory or common law) by which the Joint Resolution could have resulted in a valid merger. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Joint Resolution could not, and did not, effectuate a valid merger between EuroGas I and EuroGas II, with the result that the Talc/Reassignment Claims validly passed from EuroGas I to EuroGas II.\n\n**C. Are the Transactions with McCallan Relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the transactions with McCallan, raised for the first time in EuroGas\u2019 Reply, have no bearing on that conclusion. Indeed, in the Reply, EuroGas II submitted that EuroGas I sold the EuroGas GmbH shares to McCallan in 2007 (before the alleged merger) and that EuroGas II then acquired that shareholding from McCallan at an unspecified time between 13 July 2007 and 4 June 2012 (after the merger). The process was described as follows in the Reply:\n\n*On July 13, 2007, the 1985 Company sold its interest in EuroGas GmbH to a third party company, namely McCallan Oil & Gas (UK)**(hereafter \"McCallan \"). EuroGas thereafter acquired the entirety of McCallan\u2019s issued shares, and ultimately, on June 4, 2012, caused McCallan to transfer its interest in EuroGas GmbH, and thus Rozmin, to its new Swiss subsidiary, EuroGas AG.455*\n\nReply \u00b664.\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal regrets that EuroGas II did not file the documents underlying these transactions in these proceedings. The documents on file do not enable the Tribunal to have a complete picture of those (complex) transactions involving third parties.456 However, in any event, the Tribunal views the ownership of the EuroGas GmbH shares after the reassignment as having no real bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over EuroGas II. The alleged sale of EuroGas GmbH shares by EuroGas I to McCallan took place in 2007, years after the reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s rights. The right to receive compensation under the US-Slovakia BIT, which arose at the time of the reassignment, in 2005,457 belonged to EuroGas I; it was not transferred together with the EuroGas GmbH shares to McCallan, since it is by no means incorporated in those shares; it remained with EuroGas I. Therefore, the right to compensation under the US-Slovakia BIT could not be subsequently transferred back to EuroGas II with McCallan\u2019s shares or EuroGas GmbH shares.\n\nNotariatsakt (Deed), 13 July 2007 (C-330); Amended Agreement to the Share Option Agreement, 22 April 2008 (C-366); Agreement between EuroGas Inc. and Hans D. Deitmann, 26 May 2008 (C-367); Public Deed regarding the resolutions of the board of directors of ZB Capital Inc., 17 November 2011 (C-368); Public Deed regarding the resolutions of the board of directors of EuroGas AG, 17 November 2011 (C-369); Record Motion, 4 June 2012 (C-370). *See also* Hearing Tr. Day 1, Respondent\u2019s Opening, 45:21-53:18.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 5, 265:25 *et seq.* (\"PRESIDENT:... That was the second question. And the third one, to Dr Gharavi: what are the dates of the breaches of international law that you are complaining about? That's not related to the issue of when did the dispute arise; it\u2019s not that. And I am not asking you to make a choice, not at all, because there may be several breaches or a continuous breach. But can you clarify that for us? DR GHARAVI: For us it\u2019s the date of the revocation, of January 3rd 2005, of our rights. And then there are subsequent breaches, I would say. We do not read the decisions of the District Mining Authority when its decision is quashed and sent back to it, that just rubber-stamps it, we think that\u2019s an independent breach afterwards; \"independent\" meaning within the context of the same global breach.\").\n\n423.\n\nTherefore, the obscure transactions with McCallan have no bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as to its jurisdiction over EuroGas II, as explained above. Since the Talc/ Reassignment Claims never passed from EuroGas I to EuroGas II through the alleged merger (which the Tribunal considers ineffective), and there is no evidence that EuroGas I sold its Talc/ Reassignment claims to McCallan in a way that those claims could have then been transferred to EuroGas II, the Tribunal is compelled to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over the claims raised by EuroGas (EuroGas II) in these proceedings.\n\n424.\n\nBecause the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant EuroGas for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not need to address the Respondent\u2019s objection based on the \"denial of benefits clause\" in Article 1.2 of the US-Slovakia BIT. The Tribunal turns now to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections relating to Belmont.\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISIONS ON JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS RELATING TO BELMONT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with the Respondent\u2019s objection that Belmont\u2019s claims fall outside the *ratione temporis* application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n426.\n\nThe Slovak Republic\u2019s arguments in respect of the *ratione temporis* application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT and Belmont\u2019s responses have been summarised in Section III(C). The Tribunal will therefore refer only briefly to the Parties\u2019 positions in the analysis that follows.\n\n427.\n\nArticle 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT provides that the treaty will only \"apply to any dispute which has arisen not more than three years prior to its entry into force.\"458 The Canada-Slovakia BIT entered into force on 14 March 2012. Therefore, the dispute between Belmont and the Slovak Republic must have arisen on or after 14 March 2009 to be captured by the Canada-Slovakia BIT and for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over Belmont\u2019s claims.\n\nCanada-Slovakia BIT, Article XV(6) in fine (C-2).\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the dispute with Belmont arose prior to 14 March 2009 and therefore falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s *ratione temporis* jurisdiction. In response, Belmont argues, first, that the Respondent is \"estopped\" from asserting this objection. In addition, Belmont submits that the Respondent confuses the events leading up to the dispute with the dispute itself, and that in fact, the dispute arose after the critical date.\n\n**A. Is the Respondent \"Estopped\" from Relying on Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nBelmont places great emphasis on the fact that EuroGas sent the Respondent a notice of dispute on 31 October 2011459 and that the Respondent reacted on 2 May 2012 by asserting that it was premature to trigger the dispute resolution process provided in the Canada-Slovakia BIT.460 According to Belmont, the State is now \"estopped\" from asserting that the dispute is not captured by the *ratione temporis* application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT. Belmont\u2019s argument assumes that its dispute with the Slovak Republic is one and the same with the dispute between EuroGas and the Slovak Republic (which relates to a different BIT).\n\nLetter from EuroGas Inc. to the Government of the Slovak Republic, dated 31 October 2011 (C-3 9).\n\nLetter from the Slovak Republic, dated 2 May 2012 (C-40).\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the legal consequence that Belmont seeks to draw from the Respondent\u2019s posture in its correspondence of 2 May 2012 is excessive and unsupported. First, the Respondent\u2019s letter does not imply any admission that the US-Slovakia BIT, and *a fortiori* the Canada-Slovakia BIT (which is not even mentioned) were applicable. The letter contains an express reservation as regards the applicability of the US-Slovakia BIT:\n\n*Therefore, as long as the above mentioned proceedings are ongoing, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic is of the view that this dispute could not be amicably settled at this stage. For avoidance of doubt, this letter is subject to the reservation that such conduct is in no way a confession that the claim articulated in your Notification of claim against Slovak Republic meets the jurisdiction or substantive requirements of the Slovak-US Bilateral Investment Treaty The Slovak Republic fully reserves all rights arising under that Treaty and all applicable laws.461*\n\nLetter from the Slovak Republic, dated 2 May 2012 (C-40).\n\n431.\n\nSecond, by saying that EuroGas\u2019 claim was premature, the Respondent did not indicate that it was too early for the factual situation to be considered a *dispute* within the meaning of the Treaty; it clearly meant that it was premature to *start negotiations* under the Treaty while a dispute was still pending before the local courts.\n\n432.\n\nThird, even assuming that the Respondent had accepted to extend the applicability of the Treaty in spite of its temporal limitation, it is doubtful that such extension would have any legal effect, because the applicability *ratione temporis* of the Canada-Slovakia BIT depends only on the intentions of the Parties to the Treaty.\n\n433.\n\nThere is therefore no basis for Belmont to claim that it is entitled to the protections of the Canada-Slovakia BIT on the ground of statements made by the Respondent in response to EuroGas\u2019 notice of dispute. The Tribunal rejects Belmont\u2019s argument that the Respondent is \"estopped\" from arguing that Belmont\u2019s claims fall outside the *ratione temporis* realm of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n434.\n\nThe real question is whether the dispute arose after 14 March 2009, within the meaning of Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n**B. Is the Treaty Dispute Distinguishable from the Dispute Submitted to Domestic Courts?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nAccording to Belmont, the dispute must be distinguished from the events leading to the dispute, a distinction notably made by the authors Dolzer and Schreuer in the following words (cited by Belmont):\n\n*The time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events leading to the dispute. By definition, the allegedly illegal acts must have occurred some time before the dispute. Therefore, the exclusion of disputes occurring before the treaty\u2019s entry into force should not be read as excluding jurisdiction over events occurring before that date.462*\n\nRudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2008), p. 44 (CL-36).\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal naturally agrees that the allegedly illegal acts necessarily precede the dispute in respect of such acts, and that the relevant date is the date when the dispute arose.\n\n437.\n\nAs regards the occurrence of a dispute, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent\u2019s submission that the relevant consideration is the articulation of opposing views and interests, as opposed to the articulation of a specific legal basis for the claim. The landmark case on this point remains the PCIJ *Mavrommatis* case, where the Court stated that a dispute is \"[a] disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"463 A conflict of legal views does not require the expression of all possible legal arguments and grounds in support of one\u2019s position.\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* Objection to the Jurisdiction of the Court, 30 August 1924, PCIJ, Series A No. 2,p. 11 (RL-108).\n\n438.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties diverge as to whether the dispute submitted to the Slovak courts prior to the commencement of this arbitration should be treated as the same dispute as the dispute under the Canada-Slovakia BIT. If it is the same dispute, then the dispute falls outside the *ratione temporis* application of the BIT. If the dispute submitted to this Tribunal is a different dispute, then the question arises as to when that different dispute arose and whether it is captured by the BIT or not.\n\n439.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is essentially one dispute about the reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights (and potentially a denial of justice dispute). The dispute arose in 2005, when Rozmin\u2019s mining rights were reassigned and this reassignment was contested. The dispute therefore falls outside the *ratione temporis* application of the Canada-Slovakia BIT.\n\n440.\n\nThe Slovak Republic draws a parallel between the present situation and the situation in the *Lucchetti* v. *Peru* case, where the arbitral tribunal recalled that \"[a]ccording to a recent ICSID case, the critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter.\"464\n\n*Industria Nacional de Alimentos, SU. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, SU. (formerly* *Empresas Lucchetti, SU. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A.) v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Award, 7 February 2005, \u00b650 (RL-21).\n\n441.\n\nIndeed, a provision such as Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT obviously aims at avoiding that disputes which have accumulated for more than a certain number of years (three years in the case of the Canada-Slovakia BIT) give rise at the same time to a multitude of treaty claims brought before arbitral tribunals. A pre-existing \"dispute,\" in that context, is any dispute whose intrinsic elements are invoked by the investor as the basis of the treaty claim.\n\n442.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Respondent considers that the dispute submitted to domestic courts in the Slovak Republic concerns the same \"subject-matter\" as the dispute submitted to the Tribunal under the Canada-Slovakia BIT, and that since 2005, that dispute involved the same complaints against the State as those now invoked by Belmont before this Tribunal.\n\n443.\n\nBelmont attempts to distinguish the present situation from that in the *Lucchetti v. Peru* case, on two accounts.\n\n444.\n\nFirst, Belmont emphasises that in the *Lucchetti v. Peru* case, the Tribunal relied on the fact that no treaty existed at the time when the investment was made, and therefore the investor did not make the investment based on the expectation that it would receive the protections of the treaty which later came into force. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that the distinction made by Belmont has an impact on the proper approach to determine the existence of a dispute for the purpose of the application of Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT : this provision must be applied in accordance with its terms, the meaning of which is not affected by the existence of a prior BIT in force before the entry into force of the BIT invoked by Belmont.\n\n445.\n\nSecond, Belmont submits that the facts of *Lucchetti v. Peru* are different from the present situation because in that case the claimants were the same in the domestic proceedings and in the BIT proceedings, whereas in the present case the claimants are different: Rozmin was the claimant in the domestic proceedings whereas its shareholder Belmont is the claimant in the present ICSID proceedings.\n\n446.\n\nHowever, it would be artificial to distinguish the dispute between Rozmin and the State authorities concerning Rozmin\u2019s own mining rights, from the dispute between Rozmin\u2019s shareholders and the State in respect of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights.\n\n447.\n\nThe terms of the letter from Mr. Agyagos, who was both the executive director of Rozmin and the President and CEO of Belmont,465 to the then Minister of Economy of the Slovak Republic Mr. Malch\u00e1rek on 3 November 2005, while domestic proceedings were pending, already encapsulated the terms of the dispute as it is submitted to this Tribunal:\n\n*The company Rozmin s.r.o. has been engaged, since June 1997, in the mining activity, in particular in the activity relating to the opening, preparation and excavation of the talc deposit in the excavation area \"Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma\" which is located in the district Rozhava. [...]*\n\n*It was a big surprise when there appeared, in Commercial Bulletin No. 253/2004 dated 30 December 2004, a notice on the announcement of the selection procedure for the assignment of the excavation area \"Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma\" to another organization, which was justified to us by the mining office by the fact that we discontinued the mining activity in the site for a period exceeding three years. However, such a reason has no support in the Mining Act and moreover it is not based on the truth because our mining activity was discontinued for a shorter period (2 years and 10 months). The conduct of the mining office is incomprehensible also given the fact that it issued to us, on 31 May 2004 by decision No.**1023/511/2004, an authorization for performance of the mining activity in the excavation area \"Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma\" with validity until 13 November 2006! The procedure of the mining office, which we consider as made on purpose and unlawful, we immediately challenged by available legal means; however, all filed complaints were evaluated by the relevant bodies in the competence of the Ministry of Economy of the SR as unjustified, to which we do not agree until today. [...]*\n\n*On 22 April 2005, the planned selection procedure for the assignment of the excavation area was held, in which bids were submitted also by leading world talc producers, as, for example,**Mondo Minerals, as well as leading Slovak companies engaged in the mining activity in various areas. It was a great surprise for the entire European expert economic society that in such a strong**competition the excavation area was assigned to an absolutely unknown Rozhava company, Economy Agency RV, s.r.o. with its seat at Marikovszk\u00e9ho 53, Rozhava 048 01, BIN: 36 582 760 with registered capital of SKK 200,000, which until then was only engaged in bookkeeping and obtained the mining permit only a week before holding the selection procedure. [...]*\n\n*We believe that the procedure of the District Mining Office in Spissk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves is unlawful, non-standard and made on purpose; however, unfortunately it is shielded by means of the assistance of the Main Mining Office and until now it also had ensured the highest political shield from the side of the former Minister of Economy. On the other hand, we are convinced that neither the Slovak courts nor* ***the relevant international institutions to which we intend to subsequently refer,*** *will make any allowances for the interests of the former Minister, and they will proceed strictly under law and* ***international treaties on mutual support and protection of investments (because the shareholders of Rozmin a.s.ro. are foreign companies),*** *which can cause to the Slovak Republic considerable damage in the form of an obligation to compensate damage including the lost profit that will range approximately at hundreds of millions of crowns, as well as damage of reputation and cause of an international scandal of similar extent as it was, for example, in the recent so-called CSOB case.466*\n\nMr. Agyagos indeed identifies himself as follows in his First Witness Statement: \"Since October 17, 1996,1 hold the position of President and Director of Belmont Resources Inc. (\"Belmont\"), an emerging resource company listed on the Canadian TSX Venture Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specialized in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral resources. Since May 22, 2001, I also act as Managing Director of Rozmin s.r.o. (\"Rozmin\"), a company that was incorporated in the Slovak Republic in 1997 for purposes of carrying out a mining project at the Gemersk\u00e1 Poloma deposit in the Slovak Republic, one of the world\u2019s largest talc deposits.\" Agyagos WS \u00b63.\n\nLetter from Mr. Agyagos and Belmont to the Minister of Economy, 3 November 2005 (R-162) (emphasis added).\n\n448.\n\nClearly, the possibility of investment treaty proceedings to challenge the reassignment of Rozmin\u2019s rights was already foreseen and was the subject of correspondence by the CEO of Belmont to a Minister in November 2005. A dispute between Belmont and the Slovak Republic already crystallized with Mr. Agyagos\u2019 letter, which expressly refers to claims by Rozmin\u2019s shareholders against the State under \"international treaties on mutual support and protection of investments (because the shareholders of Rozmin a.s.r.o are foreign companies), which can cause to the Slovak Republic considerable damage in the form of an obligation to compensate damage including the lost profit that will range approximately at hundreds of millions of crowns.\" In addition, Mr. Agyagos signed the letter in his two capacities of Executive of Rozmin and President and CEO of Belmont:467\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/b2e5313892f1aea2d4a03f53e026ae5211dae7ce.png)\n\nExcerpt from Letter from Mr. Agyagos and Belmont to the Minister of Economy, 3 November 2005 (R-162).\n\n449.\n\nBelmont considers that this letter is only a one-sided position, and invokes the decision in *Railroad Development Corporation* v. *Guatemala,* in which an ICSID tribunal held that \"a dispute is a conflict of views on points of law or fact which requires sufficient communication between the parties for each to know the other\u2019s view and oppose them.\"468 However, such was the case after Mr. Agyagos had sent this letter to the Minister, since the position of the Slovak Republic on points of fact and law was already known to him at the time he wrote the letter, and was not changed after the Minister received it. Moreover, it is paradoxical to maintain that a dispute does not exist after one of the parties has threatened the other of bringing a lawsuit before a tribunal.\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation (RDC)* v. *Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 18 May 2010 (CL-133), \u00b6129.\n\n450.\n\nEuroGas\u2019 notice of dispute of 31 October 2011 does not highlight anything new, as compared with Mr. Agyagos\u2019 letter of November 2005, except for the outcome of the domestic court process regarding the re-assignment of Rozmin\u2019s mining rights.\n\n451.\n\nTo counter the approach taken by the tribunal in *Lucchetti* v. *Peru,* which this Tribunal approves, Belmont relies heavily on *Jan de Nul* v. *Egypt,* where a provision similar to Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT was at stake. In that case, a dispute between Jan de Nul and the Suez Canal Authority had been submitted to local courts well before the entry into force of the investment treaty. When the treaty came into force, the dispute was pending before the Administrative Court of Ismai'lia, which eventually rendered an adverse decision in 2003, approximately one year after the BIT\u2019s entry into force. Notwithstanding the fact that the BIT excluded disputes that had arisen prior to its entry into force, the Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction. However, in the *Jan de Nul v. Egypt* Decision on Jurisdiction, the tribunal reasoned as follows:\n\n*... the claims regarding the judgment and the manner in which the Egyptian courts dealt with the dispute address the actions of the court system as such, and are thus separate and distinct from the conduct which formed the subject matter of the domestic proceedings. Hence, they do not coincide with the conduct examined in the course of the dispute brought under domestic law. [...]*\n\n*[...] Admittedly, the previous dispute is one of the sources of the present dispute, if not the main one. It is clear, however, that the reasons, which may have motivated the alleged wrongdoings of the SC A* [Suez Canal Authority] *at the time of the conclusion and/or performance of the Contract, do not coincide with those underlying the acts of the organs of the Egyptian State in the post-contract phase of the dispute. Since the Claimants also base their claim upon the decision of the Isma\u00eflia Court, the present dispute must be deemed a new dispute.*\n\n*The intervention of a new actor, the Isma\u00eflia Court, appears here as a decisive factor to determine whether the dispute is a new dispute.**As the Claimants\u2019 case is directly based on the alleged wrongdoing of the Isma\u00eflia Court, the Tribunal considers that the original dispute has (re) crystallized into a new dispute when the Isma\u00eflia Court rendered its decision.469*\n\n*Jan de Nul N. V. and Dredging International N. V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 June 2006, \u00b6\u00b6119, 127-128 (Exhibit CL-58).\n\n452.\n\nThus the *Jan de Nul v. Egypt* tribunal clearly distinguished between two phases. In the first phase the actor accused of a wrongdoing was the Suez Canal Authority, which as the tribunal observed, was not an organ of the State. In the second phase, the actor accused of a wrongdoing was the Court of Isma\u00eflia, an organ of the State. By contrast, in the present case all the actors accused of a wrongdoing were organs of the State, which were the same at all stages: the DMO, the MMO and the Regional Court confirming their decisions.\n\n453.\n\nThe situation in the present case is to some extent similar to that in the PCIJ case *Phosphates in Morrocco,470* in which the PCIJ drew a distinction between the \"real causes of the dispute\" and \"subsequent factors which either presume the existence or are merely the confirmation or development of earlier situations or facts.\" What matters is the real cause of the dispute.\n\n*Phosphates in Morocco (Italy v. France).* PCIJ Reports, Ser. A/B No. 74, 1938, p. 16 (CL-33).\n\n454.\n\nIn this case, there has been no separate act by a Slovak State organ that could be deemed to have crystallized a new dispute. The chronology of relevant events in this case helps distinguish the present situation from the situation in *Jan de Nul* v. *Egypt'.*\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **DATE** | **EVENT** |\n| 3 May 2005 | DM0 reassigns Mining Area to Economy Agency |\n| 3 November 2005 | Letter from Mr. Agyagos, acting in the name of Rozmin *and* Belmont to Minister of the Economy, threatening international arbitration |\n| 7 February 2008 | Regional Court affirms the reassignment |\n| 27 February 2008 | Supreme Court reverses on procedural grounds |\n| 2 July 2008 | DM0 reassigns the Mining Area to VSK Mining s.r.o. |\n| 12 January 2009 | MMO affirms the reassignment |\n| **14 March 2009** | **Canada-Slovakia BIT takes effect** |\n| 3 February 2010 | Regional court affirms the reassignment |\n| 18 May 2011 | Supreme Court reverses on procedural grounds |\n| 30 March 2012 | DM0 reassigns the Mining Area to VSK Mining s.r.o. |\n| 1 August 2012 | MMO affirms the reassignment (which Rozmin does not appeal) |\n\n455.\n\nThis chart illustrates the fact that the situation was exactly the same on 3 May 2005, before the BIT entered into force, and 1 August 2012, after the BIT entered into force: the mining rights that were lost by Rozmin were reassigned to another company. In other words, the mining rights were taken from Rozmin in 2005, allegedly in violation of Belmont\u2019s rights under the Canada-Slovakia BIT and international law, and several decisions of the mining authorities (not the judicial authorities) refused to restitute the rights to Rozmin. The decision of the DMO, on 30 March 2012, to reassign exclusive rights over the Mining Area to VSK Mining, and its confirmation by the MMO on 1 August 2012, did not change Belmont\u2019s legal and factual situation: since the reassignment of the Mining Area in 2005, it had lost its rights on the Mining Area and was not present on the site.\n\n456.\n\nContrary to Belmont\u2019s position, the decisions of 30 March 2012 and 1 August 2012 cannot be considered the source of a new dispute; rather, they were a refusal to resolve the ongoing dispute, which arose from the alleged breach in 2005.\n\n457.\n\nAll the decisions by Slovak authorities that have been mentioned in this arbitration are elements of the same dispute, the main feature of which is the taking of Belmont\u2019s investment. Pursuant to Article 15(6) of the BIT, the relevant time is the time when the dispute *arose.* It arose with Mr. Agyagos\u2019 letter of 3 November 2005, more than six years before the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n458.\n\nSince no new State conduct has given rise to a new dispute after 14 March 2009 (or even (re)crystallised an old dispute), the Tribunal must conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over Belmont\u2019s claims. To conclude otherwise would deprive Article 15(6) of the Canada-Slovakia BIT from any meaning and effect, and would require the Tribunal to engineer a legalistic and artificial reasoning to bypass this provision, and effectively extend the *ratione temporis* application of the Treaty to a long-standing dispute dating from well over three years prior to the entry into force of the treaty.\n\n459.\n\nThe State Parties to the Canada-Slovakia BIT cannot have intended that Article 15(6) be read and applied in a way that exposes them to claims from investors that could date from more than three years before the entry into force of the treaty, just because a certain dispute was not settled and/or might give rise to a follow-up action. Considering that the State\u2019s refusal to overturn an existing alleged breach gives rise to a new dispute would open the floodgates to a possible complete disregard of the condition *ratione temporis* of the application of a BIT. The consequence would be that an investor could bypass the *ratione temporis* limitations of a treaty by commencing local court proceedings after the entry into force of the treaty, in respect of an old dispute. This cannot be a sensible legal result.\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that an investor may invoke the last event in a series of related or similar actions by the State to claim the benefit of the treaty. In the present case, the situation is clear-cut since there has not been a series of (alleged) transgressions by the Respondent, but one (alleged) transgression whose effects have been maintained throughout domestic court proceedings and repeated decisions by the mining authorities.\n\n461.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that Belmont\u2019s claims fall outside the ambit of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Canada-Slovakia BIT. Because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant Belmont\u2019s claims for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not need to address the Respondent\u2019s objection based on Belmont\u2019s standing.\n\n**VII.

The attorney fees related only to the arbitration are USD 296,118.30 for Holland & Hart and USD 10,000.00 for Mabey & Coombs. The costs related to the arbitration are USD 22,040.78 and EUR 6,698.26 for Holland & Hart and USD 2,225.00 and EUR 2,551.70 for Mabey & Coombs.\n\nb. Seventy percent of the fees and costs outlined above relate to responding to jurisdictional objections raised against EuroGas and the remaining 30% relate to responding to the Respondent\u2019s defence on the merits.\n\nc. Belmont and EuroGas have agreed that they are liable in proportion of their respective shareholding in Rozmin for (i) the advances paid to ICSID, (ii) the fees and expenses of KPMG and WAI, (iii) the translation costs incurred in connection with the present arbitration, and (iv) travel and lodging expenses relating to Dr. Rozloznik\u2019s attendance at the Hearing.\n\n**(2) Belmont\u2019s Costs**\n-----------------------\n\n465.\n\nBelmont claims reimbursement of the following costs:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description** | **Amount** |\n| ICSID | USD 332,500.00 |\n| Counsel (fees and expenses) | EUR 1,103,510.38 |\n| Translations costs | USD 196,860.96 |\n| KPMG (fees and expenses) | USD 221,161.90 |\n| WAI (fees and expenses) | GBP 58,160.72 |\n| Travel and related expenses for the hearing | EUR 6,336.57 and CHF 1,719.97 |\n| Grand total | EUR 1,108,846.95  USD 750,522.86  GBP 59,160.72  CHF 1,719.97 |\n\n466.\n\nBelmont specifies that the grand total of counsel fees and expenses incurred by Belmont in connection with the present arbitration (EUR 1,103,510.38) is broken down as follows: EUR 250,000.00 was incurred on issues of jurisdiction, EUR 718,990.78 was incurred on the merits and EUR 134,519.60 was incurred on quantum.\n\n467.\n\nBelmont confirms that (i) the advances on costs paid to ICSID, (ii) the fees and expenses of KPMG and WAI, (iii) the translation costs incurred in connection with the present arbitration, and (iv) travel and lodging expenses relating to Dr. Rozloznik\u2019s attendance at the Hearing were allocated between Belmont and EuroGas in proportion of their respective shareholding in Rozmin.\n\n**(3) Respondent\u2019s Costs**\n--------------------------\n\n468.\n\nThe Respondent claims reimbursement of the following costs:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **External costs** | |\n| Counsel fees | EUR 3,051,946.52 |\n| Counsel travel costs | EUR 153,555.45 |\n| Experts | EUR 1,025,000.44 |\n| Other services (translator, courier, etc.) | EUR 48,458.00 |\n| **TOTAL: EUR 4,278,960.41** | |\n| **Internal costs** | |\n| Travel costs of Ministry of Finance | EUR 4,181.13 |\n| Translation costs of Ministry of Finance | EUR 331.52 |\n| **TOTAL: EUR 4,512.65** | |\n| **Other costs** | |\n| Payments to ICSID | USD 300,000.00 |\n|  | USD 200,000.00 |\n| **TOTAL: USD 500,000.00** | |\n| **Grand total: EUR 4,283,473.06 + USD 500,000.00** | |\n\n**B. Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nThe costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal\u2019s Assistant, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):473\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses\n\nProfessor Pierre Mayer 298,022.39  \nProfessor Emmanuel Gaillard 115,799.50  \nProfessor Brigitte Stern 160,848.19\n\nAssistants\u2019 fees and expenses 49,875.00\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees 96,000.00\n\nDirect expenses (estimated)474 129,979.63\n\n**Total** **850,524.71**\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (printing, copying and courier).\n\n470.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 1, these arbitration costs have been paid out of advances made by the Parties in equal parts (50% by the Claimants and 50% by the Respondent). As a result, the Claimants\u2019 share of the arbitration costs amounts to USD 425,262.35, and the Respondent\u2019s share also amounts to USD 425,262.35. In addition, as mentioned above, the Claimants have agreed that Belmont and EuroGas are liable for the Claimants\u2019 share of the arbitration costs in proportion to their respective (alleged) shareholding in Rozmin. Belmont claims to have a 57% interest in Rozmin, and EuroGas claims to have a 33% interest in Rozmin. Therefore, Belmont bears 63.3% of the Claimants\u2019 share of the arbitration costs (USD 269,332.82),475 and EuroGas bears 36.6% (USD 155,929.53).476\n\nBecause the Claimants together own 90% of Rozmin\u2019s shares, the applicable formula to determine Belmont\u2019s share of the arbitration costs is USD 425,262.35 x (57/90).\n\nThe applicable formula to determine EuroGas\u2019 share of the arbitration costs is USD 425,262.35 x (33/90).\n\n471.\n\nArticle 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention provides that\n\n*the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.*\n\n472.\n\nThis provision establishes the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in allocating the costs of the arbitration and the Parties\u2019 costs, including legal fees and expenses.\n\n473.\n\nIn reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has considered in particular the following circumstances: the Respondent has succeeded in its plea that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. However, the jurisdictional issues arising in this matter were complex, and it was not unreasonable for the Claimants to attempt to establish jurisdiction under the BITs, even if the Tribunal eventually found that treaty protection was not available in the specific and complex circumstances of the case.\n\n474.\n\nTherefore, in exercising its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal finds it equitable that the arbitration costs identified in paragraph 469 above are finally apportioned just as they were borne by the Parties during the proceeding, *i.e. :* the Respondent shall bear USD 425,262.35 of the arbitration costs; Belmont shall bear USD 269,332.82; and EuroGas shall bear USD 155,929.53.\n\n475.\n\nEach Party shall bear its own costs for the preparation and presentation of its case (legal and expert fees and expenses, travel costs, translation and other costs).\n\n**VIII.
