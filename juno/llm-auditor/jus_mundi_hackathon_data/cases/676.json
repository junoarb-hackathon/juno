Procedural background\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 12, 2003 Total S.A. (hereinafter \"Total\" or the \"Claimant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes a \"Request for Arbitration\" against the Argentine Republic (hereinafter \"Argentina\" or the \"Respondent\") pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (hereinafter the \"ICSID Convention\") and the Treaty between France and Argentina concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investment (hereinafter the \"BIT\") of July 3, 1991.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the \"Institution Rules\"), the Secretary-General on November 3, 2003 acknowledged receipt of the request and on November 4, 2003 transmitted a copy of the request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C. After further correspondence, the Secretary-General duly registered Total\u2019s request for arbitration on January 22, 2004 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and gave notice thereof to the parties. At the same time, the Secretary-General invited the parties, pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Institution Rules, to proceed as soon as possible to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, the Claimant appointed Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, a Canadian national, as arbitrator. On April 14, 2004, the Argentine Republic appointed Dr. Luis Herrera Marcano, a national of Venezuela, as arbitrator. On August 20, 2004, in accordance with Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the \"Arbitration Rules\"), the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appointed Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti, a national of Italy, as President of the Tribunal. On August 24, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of the ICSID informed the parties that all members of the Tribunal had accepted their appointment so that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that same day.\n\n4.\n\nThe first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on 15 November 2004. The parties appeared and were duly represented. The parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted on August 24, 2004 in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n5.\n\nDuring the course of the first session, the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters as reflected in the written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Among the various procedural decisions taken at that hearing, it was agreed that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 22, the languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish. The Claimant would file its pleadings in English and Argentina would file its pleadings in Spanish, without the need of subsequent translation of the written pleadings into the other party\u2019s chosen procedural language. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal decided by Procedural Order No.l that the Claimant would file its Memorial on the merits within five months from the date of the first session. The Tribunal also decided that if the Respondent wished to raise any objections to jurisdiction, it should do so within 45 days from the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the merits. In the event of an objection to jurisdiction, the Claimant would file its counter-Memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days from the receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on jurisdiction. In the same Procedural Order, the Tribunal further decided that should the Respondent not raise any objections to jurisdiction, it should file its Counter-Memorial on the merits within five months from the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the merits; the Claimant should thereafter file its Reply on the merits within 60 days from the receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the merits; and the Respondent should file its Rejoinder on the merits within 60 days from the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply on the merits.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on the merits on April 11, 2005 (hereinafter \"CMM\u2019j; Argentina filed its *\"Memorial sobre objeciones a la jurisdicci\u00f3n del Centro* *y a la competencia del Tribunal\"* (hereinafter \"RMJ\") on June 3, 2005. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3), the proceeding on the merits was thereby suspended. In conformity with Procedural Order No.l, the Claimant then submitted its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction (hereinafter \"CCMJ\") on August 1, 2005.\n\n7.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held in Washington on September 5, 2005. Ms. Cintia Yaryura, Ms. Maria Victoria Vitali and Mr. Ariel Martins addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Argentina. Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Georgios Petrochilos and Mr. Luis A. Erize addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. During the course of the hearing, the Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided for in Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\nII. The Subject Matter of the Dispute\n-------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nBefore examining the issue of jurisdiction submitted to the Tribunal, it appears useful to highlight briefly the subject-matter of the dispute, in fact and in law, as presented by the Claimant in its \"Request for Arbitration\", as thereafter expanded in the CMM taking into account also the statements presented to date by Argentina. Such presentation is made for the sole purpose of setting out the factual circumstances and the legal claims made by Claimant in respect of which Argentina has raised objections to jurisdiction. No legal evaluation is hereby implied or made by the Tribunal, nor should any such significance be attached to it for the purpose of the present case.\n\n9.\n\nAs indicated by Total in its submissions, the Claimant is a company incorporated in accordance with the laws of France and has its registered office in France, therefore qualifying as a French \"investor\" within the meaning of Article 1.2(b) of the BIT. Total has made a number of investments in Argentina in the gas transportation, hydrocarbons exploration and production and power generation industries. According to Total, its investments in Argentina include majority and minority shareholding interests in companies operating in the gas transportation, exploration and production, and power generation sectors, as well as various licenses and rights, concessions and loans, all and each of them qualifying as an \"investment\" in accordance with the meaning of this term in Article 1.1 of the BIT.\n\n10.\n\nIn the gas transportation industry, Total has an indirect 19.21% stake in Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (\"TGN\"), one of two gas transmission companies established when the Republic of Argentina privatized Gas del Estado, Sociedad del Estado, in 1992. TGN was granted a license to transport gas in northern and central Argentina for a term of 35 years, extendable at TGN\u2019s option for a further ten years. In May 1992, Argentina enacted Law 24,076 (the \"Gas Law\") and Decree 1738/1992 (the \"Gas Decree\"), which established the legal framework for the privatization of the gas industry. After a public bidding process, the Government of Argentina then sold a 70% share in TGN to Gasinvest, a consortium of investors, in 1992. In May 2000, one of the investors in Gasinvest, the TransCanada Group, agreed to sell its 19.21% share in TGN to Total. This agreement was completed on January 23, 2001. Total currently holds its shares in TGN through Gasinvest, in which it holds a 27.23% indirect stake, and a number of other indirect shareholdings.1\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 101 and Exhibit C-56 which shows the structure of Total\u2019s shareholding in TGN. See also copies of extracts from TGN\u2019s share register reflecting Total\u2019s shareholdings in TGN at Exhibit C-44.\n\n11.\n\nTotal\u2019s investments in the petroleum exploration and production industry commenced in 1978 when it formed a consortium with three other companies (the \"Consortium\") to explore and exploit a series of oil and gas lots in the area around Tierra del Fuego. In 1979, each of the Consortium members, including Total Exploraci\u00f3n, S.A., now known as Total Austral S.A., entered into a contract (Contract 19,944) with Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Sociedad del Estado (\u2018YPF\") to explore and exploit hydrocarbons in that area. As part of a plan to privatize the oil and gas industry beginning in 1989, this contract was replaced by a new 25 year concession to exploit oil and gas in accordance with Law 17,319/1967 (the \"Hydrocarbons Law\") and its regulating Decrees Nos. 1055/1989, 1212/1989 and 1589/1989. According to Total, in order to induce it and the other investors to agree to terminate their previous contract and to enter into the new concession, Argentina offered the Consortium partners the right to explore and exploit additional lots and certain rights to dispose of the oil and gas they extracted.2 Further, according to Total, the representations made by Argentina were incorporated into Decree 214/1994 (the \"Concession Decree\") which was adopted to govern the new investment.3 Other aspects of the legal and regulatory framework governing Total\u2019s investment were set out in a number of decrees and laws. Total states that as a result of the representations and assurances provided to it and incorporated in the legal and regulatory framework, it agreed to terminate its earlier contract and make new investments as part of the new concession. These investments were made through Total Austral and include exploration and production assets in various areas in southern Argentina, production facilities and equipment and long-term gas sale contracts.\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, paras. 122-123.\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, para. 124 and the decrees and sources referred to at footnotes 126 and 127.\n\n12.\n\nIn the power generation industry, Total has invested in two major power generation companies, Central Puerto S.A. (\"Central Puerto\") and Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Piedra de Aguila S.A. (\"HPDA\"). Central Puerto is a large dual-fuel electricity generator, having the capacity to produce 2,165 megawatts, which represents 9.5% of Argentina\u2019s total installed capacity. Central Puerto was created in 1992 as part of the privatization of Servicios El\u00e9ctricos del Gran Buenos Aires S.E. (\"SEGBA\"), a state-owned enterprise, whose power generation business was split into four thermal power generation companies. At the time of privatization, approximately 63.93% of the total stock of Central Puerto was acquired by three Chilean companies. Eventually, one of these companies, Compania Chilena de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica (later renamed \"Gener\") acquired the interest of the other two companies. In July 2001, Total acquired all of the shares in Central Puerto held by Gener (which had been acquired in 2000 by AES Corporation). Total says it paid approximately US $255 million and subscribed to US $120 million of debt to acquire the shares of Central Puerto.4 Total states that Central Puerto subsequently made significant investments of approximately US $387 million in acquiring power generation units to expand and upgrade its capacity. HPDA is said to be the largest private hydroelectric generation company in Argentina. It was created in 1993, as part of the privatization of Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Norpatag\u00f3nica S.A., the state-owned hydroelectric generation company which was split into five separate business units for the purposes of privatization. At the time of privatization in 1993, a number of foreign investors created an Argentine company, Hidroneuqu\u00e9n S.A., for the purposes of bidding for and acquiring 59% of HPDA\u2019s shareholding. Hidroneuquen S.A. remains the owner of the shares. In September 2001, Total, through Total Austral, acquired 70.03% of Hidroneuquen from Gener for the payment of US $72.5 million and by acquiring approximately US $57 million of subordinated debt in the form of bonds. As a result, Total owns indirectly a 41.3% shareholding in HPDA.5 After privatization, HPDA expended significant sums to acquire equipment and services (US $161.7 million) and has assumed existing debt (US $405 million). According to Total, HPDA\u2019s hydroelectric plant currently comprises four units with an aggregate installed capacity of 1,400 megawatts. These units entered into service in 1993-1994 and represent 6.13% of Argentina\u2019s installed electricity capacity.\n\nSee Exhibit C-70 for a diagram of Total\u2019s shareholdings in Central Puerto and Exhibit C-44 for a copy of an extract from Central Puerto\u2019s share register.\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, paras. 158-160 and Exhibits C-72, a diagram showing Total\u2019s participation in HPDA and Exhibit C 44, a copy of HPDA\u2019s share register.\n\n13.\n\nTotal maintains that in respect of each of the areas in which it invested, it did so on the basis of the representations and promises made by the Argentine government in the legal and regulatory framework for privatized gas transmission companies, the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the power generation industry. Total alleges that a number of measures taken by the Argentine government, most of which derive from or followed Law 25,561/2002 (the \"Emergency Law\") together with the Emergency Law itself, breached or revoked the commitments given to attract investment upon which Total relied in making its investments.\n\n14.\n\nMore specifically, Total indicates that the measures (the \"Measures\" in Total\u2019s submissions) include the forced conversion of dollar-denominated public service tariffs into pesos (or \"pesification\") at a rate of one to one the abolition of the adjustment of public service tariffs based on the US Producer Price Index and other international indices the \"pesification\" of dollar-denominated private contracts at a rate of one to one the freezing of the gas consumer tariff (which is the sum of the: (a) well-head price of gas; (b) gas transportation tariff; and (c) gas distribution tariff) the imposition of (a) export withholding taxes on the sale of hydrocarbons; and (b) restrictions on the export of such hydrocarbons the abandonment of the uniform marginal price mechanism in the power generation market by price caps and other regulatory measures the pesification, at a one to one rate, of all other payments to which power generators are entitled; and the refusal to pay power generators their dues, even at the dramatically reduced values resulting from the Measures.6\n\nThis list is contained in para. 33 of the CMM of April 8, 2005. A more detailed description of the measures complained of and their specific impact is found in Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration, paras. 104-116, 135-140, 180-198.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant complains that those Measures adopted by Argentina have resulted in several breaches of the BIT. As to Total\u2019s gas transmission assets, Total argues that the Measures expropriated Total\u2019s investment in TGN, in breach of Article 5.2 of the BIT; that the Measures treated Total\u2019s investment in TGN unfairly and inequitably, in breach of Article 3 of the BIT; that the Measures discriminated against Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT; and that Argentina has breached its obligation to respect specific undertakings in violation of Article 10 of the BIT.\n\n16.\n\nAs to Total\u2019s investments in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas, Total complains that the various measures listed revoked Total\u2019s right freely to dispose of its hydrocarbons in breach of the duty of fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT; that the measures treated Total in respect of its hydrocarbon production in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner contrary to Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT by benefiting domestic, industrial, commercial or residential consumers to the detriment of Total; and that the measures restricting export of hydrocarbons constitute further, separate breaches of the duty of fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n17.\n\nAs to Total\u2019s investments in the power generation sector, according to Total, Argentina through the Measures has failed to observe the obligation not to take measures equivalent to expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in breach of Article 5.2 of the BIT; has breached the duty of fair and equitable treatment in Article 3 of the BIT and that of refraining from discriminating against Total (Article 4) owed to Total in respect of its investments in Central Puerto and HPDA.\n\n18.\n\nBased on the above, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to declare that Argentina by its various acts and conduct specified in Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration and Memorial has breached the above mentioned Articles of the BIT. The Claimant further seeks compensation for the alleged damages caused thereby to its investment \"in an amount to be assessed and which is provisionally assessed to be no less than US$ 940 million\",7 in addition to interest, additional reparation to be further specified and payment by Argentina of all costs and expenses of this arbitration. Total considers that an ICSID Tribunal is competent under the ICSID Convention and the BIT to examine its claims and grant to it the relief sought. Total asserts that it is a French investor having made protected investments in Argentina in accordance with Article 1.1 of the BIT. Total asserts further that the parties to the dispute have duly given their consent to the present arbitration in accordance with Article 25(1) and (2) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8 of the BIT, so that all the requirements to establish jurisdiction are met.\n\nCMM para. 403.\n\n19.\n\nArgentina has yet to reply to the Claimant\u2019s arguments on the merits since Argentina has raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction. Acceptance of any of these cannot therefore be inferred from Argentina\u2019s silence on any given matter. However, for the sole purpose of deciding the preliminary objections, the Tribunal takes note that certain matters pertaining directly to its jurisdiction in this case have not been challenged by Argentina. Thus, Argentina has not challenged the claim that Total is a French corporation that has made investments in Argentina, nor has it basically challenged the facts referred to by Total concerning its operations in Argentina, nor Claimant\u2019s references to the various Argentine laws in force before, during and after the privatization process relevant to Total\u2019s operations. Neither has Argentina challenged the existence and scope of the measures it enacted in 2001/2002 to which Total refers as relevant to the legal regime applicable to its investments.\n\nIII. The objections of Argentina to jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn the RMJ Argentina raises six grounds for challenging the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal to hear the present dispute. The objections to jurisdiction are listed here and thereafter specifically described and addressed together with the counter-arguments of the Claimant.\n\nA. The claim is not admissible *ab initio,* since the foreign investor seeks remedies from the effects of a general crisis.\n\nB. The dispute submitted to the Tribunal does not arise directly from a measure adopted against the investment.\n\nC. The dispute submitted to the Tribunal is not an \"investment dispute\" according to Article 8 of the BIT, because: (1) the dispute is not a legal dispute; (2) even if the dispute were a legal dispute, it would be of a contractual nature, and it consequently would fall outside the competence of the Tribunal.\n\nD. Total lacks the *ius standi* to sue under international law and applicable Argentine law.\n\nE. The Tribunal lacks competence because the parties agreed on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal contentious-administrative tribunals of the City of Buenos Aires, for the interpretation and enforcement of the concession contract.\n\nF. The claim is inadmissible due to lack of damages.\n\nA. First objection:\u00a0*Inadmissibility of the claim*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments:\n----------------------\n\n21.\n\nAccording to Argentina, any damages which may have been suffered by the foreign investor have been caused by the economic crisis which affected the Republic of Argentina. As a consequence of the crisis, all those who have been affected have suffered proportionately to their means. It follows that the foreign investor cannot claim protection from the effects of a general crisis under the protection standards laid down in a bilateral investment treaty.\n\nClaimant\u2019s counter-arguments:\n-----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn the CCMJ, the Claimant maintains that the so-called *ab initio* objection is to be considered \"a point going to the merits, not the admissibility, of the claim.\" In support of this position, the Claimant refers to various decisions to this effect by other ICSID tribunals before which Argentina raised the same objection.\n\nB. Second objection:\u00a0*The dispute submitted to the Tribunal does not arise directly from a measure adopted against the investment.*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments:\n----------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe second objection presented by Argentina concerns the requirement that the \"dispute aris[e] directly out of an investment\" according to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.8 In order to meet such a requirement, in Argentina\u2019s view, the measure or measures alleged in violation of the pertinent BIT have to be specifically addressed to the investment. Universal measures addressed to everyone - investors and others, nationals and foreigners alike - cannot be considered by ICSID Tribunals. Argentina argues that to hold otherwise would be judging Argentina\u2019s public policy and not deciding a legal dispute.\n\nThe text of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is as follows: \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n24.\n\nArgentina considers that none of the measures complained of by the Claimant have been addressed or directed specifically at its investments. The fact that the Claimant suffered as a consequence of the economic crisis which had a general character, does not automatically mean that the investor has been directly affected by a measure specifically taken against it. In support of this approach, Argentina relies on the theory of legal causation construed by the *Methanex* tribunal in its Partial Award of August 7, 2002. In Argentina\u2019s view, since the various measures at issue adopted by the Republic of Argentina have not been directed specifically at the investor, the dispute cannot be considered as \"arising directly out of an investment\", under the terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nClaimant\u2019s counter-arguments:\n-----------------------------\n\n25.\n\nTo reply to the second jurisdictional objection made by the Respondent, the Claimant relies, first of all, on a literal interpretation of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requiring that the disputes submitted to the Centre \"arise directly out of an investment\". According to the Claimant, Argentina reads this requirement wrongly as relating not to the investment *per se* but to the measures complained of by the Claimant. Moreover, the Claimant submits Argentina errs in considering the word \"directly\" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as synonymous with \"specifically\", thus reading the above-mentioned article \"as providing for ICSID jurisdiction in respect of disputes \u2018arising directly out of measures specifically directed at an investment\u2019\"9. According to the Claimant, on the contrary, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must be correctly interpreted as requiring that the dispute brought to the Centre be \"directly\" - and not \"specifically\" - related to \"an investment\" - and not to the \"measures complained of\u2019.\n\nCCMJ para. 27.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant specifies also that it \"does not complain of the economic conditions in Argentina, nor does it take issue with the Government\u2019s general economic policies, including the floating of the peso and its devaluation. Rather the Claimant complains of \"specific\" measures taken by Argentina \"in furtherance or as a consequence of its general economic policies.\"10 These measures were, in the Claimant\u2019s view, \"directly aimed at Total\u2019s investments\"11 and violated the commitments given by Argentina in order to attract investment and relied on by the investor, thus constituting a breach of the BIT provisions granting protection to French investors.\n\n***Ibid,*** para 42.\n\n***Idem.***\n\n27.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant opposes Argentina\u2019s reliance on the award rendered in the *Methanex* case to support its position. The Claimant argues that since that dispute concerned a claim under different language contained in NAFTA Chapter 11 and was decided according to different procedural rules from the case at issue here (that is, the UNCITRAL Rules), it would be misleading to use the reasoning developed by the arbitral tribunal on that occasion to address the issues in dispute in these proceedings.\n\nC. Third objection:\u00a0*The dispute submitted to the Tribunal is not an \"investment dispute\" according to Article 8 of the BIT because: (1) the dispute is not a legal dispute; (2) even if the dispute were a legal dispute, it would be of a contractual nature, and it consequently* *would fall outside the competence of the Tribunal. In any case Total\u2019s minority shareholdings were not affected.*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments:\n----------------------\n\n28.\n\nArgentina maintains that the dispute submitted to the Centre should be about rights and obligations and not about some negative factual consequences that affected the Claimant. In Argentina\u2019s view, the dispute at issue here is about a price control system, concerning the alleged intangibility of the public service utility tariffs: the only right that the Claimant could invoke in this respect is the right to renegotiate a contract. Since Total\u2019s claim is of a contractual nature, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and competence to hear the case. Argentina suggests that the alleged legal disputes that may arise from any disagreements about the process of tariff revision, which is still ongoing, should be submitted to the domestic tribunals freely agreed by the parties in dispute. For these reasons, Argentina denies that the Claimant\u2019s complaints give rise to a \"legal dispute\" under the terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, or to an \"investment dispute\" according to Article 8 of the BIT.12\n\nArt. 8.1, 2 and 3 of the Argentine-France BIT is as follows:  \n 1. Any dispute relating to investments made under this Agreement between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the two parties concerned.  \n 2. If any such dispute cannot be so settled within six months of the time when a claim is made by one of the parties to the dispute, the dispute shall, at the request of the investor, be submitted:  \n - Either to the domestic courts of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute;  \n - Or to international arbitration under the conditions described in paragraph 3 below.  \n Once an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party concerned or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other of these procedures is final.  \n 3. Where recourse is had to international arbitration, the investor may choose to bring the dispute before one of the following arbitration bodies:  \n - The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature in - Washington on 18 March 1965, if both States Parties to this Agreement have already acceded to the Convention. Until such time as this requirement is met, the two Contracting Parties shall agree to submit the dispute to arbitration, in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Additional Facility of ICSID;  \n - An ad hoc arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nation Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n29.\n\nArgentina also challenges the competence of the Tribunal on the ground that the dispute at issue concerns the rights of minority shareholders (19.23 % in TGN and 41.3 % in HPDA) and no measure taken by the Republic of Argentina has ever impaired those rights. Argentina recalls in this regard that the BIT refers to \"any body corporate effectively controlled, directly or indirectly, by nationals of one Contracting Party or by bodies corporate having their registered office in the territory of one Contracting Party\". In any case, according to Argentina, the BIT requires a situation of control. Argentina concludes that the dispute at issue is not a legal dispute because it concerns indirect minority shareholders who do not exercise any control over the Argentine companies involved. The Claimant complains of the impairment of rights pertaining to those companies due to alleged contractual violations of their rights.\n\nClaimant\u2019s counter-arguments:\n-----------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn the CCMJ, the Claimant stresses that the third objection raised by Argentina relates only to Total\u2019s investment in TGN. Total then addresses separately the different aspects of the third objection to jurisdiction. First, the Claimant disputes Argentina\u2019s argument that Total\u2019s claim does not involve an \"investment dispute\" under the BIT because it is about a tariff renegotiation process. Second, it contests the argument that the dispute is a \"political dispute or - at most - a contractual matter subject to the \u2018renegotiation process\u2019 under Argentine law\".13\n\nCCMJ para. 54.\n\n31.\n\nAccording to the Claimant \"\u2018renegotiation\u2019 was a mechanism that Argentina unilaterally imposed on TGN... in order to evade its international obligation to arbitrate under Article 8 of the Treaty.\"14 The Claimant submits that the renegotiation process is not a bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because the Claimant does not ask the Tribunal to second-guess the on-going renegotiation process, but to decide on the breaches of the BIT by Argentina. Total has never participated directly in the renegotiation process and its treaty claims are entirely distinct from that process. The Claimant contends at length in the CMM that in taking the measures at issue Argentina has breached the legal rules contained in the BIT. The fact that the legal dispute stemming therefrom may have political repercussions or aspects is immaterial. Claims involving the international responsibility of a State, such as those presented by Total in this case, often involve the compatibility of the exercise of sovereign powers with treaty obligations and entail a political dimension. Such a dispute does not cease to be legal and does not become, as a consequence, non-justiciable because of those dimensions.\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 58-59\n\n32.\n\nAs to Argentina\u2019s argument that it has taken no measure that impairs the rights of Total as a minority shareholder and that the BIT protects French investors only if they exercise control, Total points to the definition of investments in Article 1.1(b) of the BIT. The definition includes explicitly \"Shares...and other forms of participation, *albeit minority or indirect,* in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party\" (emphasis added), without any requirement that control be exercised by the foreign investor. Total addresses further this point within its response to Argentina\u2019s fourth objection which involves the same or similar arguments.\n\nD. Fourth objection:\u00a0*Total lacks the* ius standi *to sue under international law and applicable Argentine law.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments:\n----------------------\n\n33.\n\nArgentina submits that Total lacks *ius standi* to sue because, according to a well-known principle of both international and Argentine law, a company\u2019s shareholders cannot bring a claim to redress the impairment of rights of the company itself. Allowing shareholders to exercise such an action and eventually obtain compensation for damages suffered by the company, would lead to the ultimate destruction of the company. Therefore, corporate claims of a derivative nature are inadmissible unless a specific provision, as found also in some international agreements, would provide for them. In Argentina\u2019s view, if the Tribunal allowed the action brought by some shareholders, it could not ensure (in the event of deciding in their favor) that the resources so recovered by the shareholders would compensate the company for the corporate property allegedly damaged. This would lead to the anticipatory liquidation of the company because of the ensuing diversion of the company\u2019s resources, a measure that an ICSID tribunal is clearly not competent to order. The shareholders, as shareholders, have no legal right to the preservation of the value of their shares.\n\n34.\n\nTo support its argument, Argentina relies first of all, as to international law, on the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") decision in the *Barcelona Traction* case. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the pronouncement by the ICJ in that case supports its argument that a harm caused to shareholders by measures taken by the State against the company itself cannot imply the shareholders\u2019 entitlement to compensation. Argentina submits that the Id\u2019s decision is still valid and also extends beyond the exercise of diplomatic protection. The same principles apply in respect of ICSID because foreign shareholders do not enjoy under the Convention a right of action on behalf of their locally incorporated subsidiary, which does enjoy such a right in accordance with Article 25(2)(b). A specific international treaty provision would be necessary to that effect which, Argentina submits, is found in the NAFTA and some other free trade agreements.\n\n35.\n\nFurther relying on its Companies Law (Ley de Sociedades Comerciales N\u00b0 19550),15 Argentina explains that only the corporation can defend its own interests. There is no provision in the Companies Law that allows a shareholder to make a complaint on behalf of the corporation. According to the same line of reasoning, a shareholder cannot make a complaint on its own behalf in order to obtain compensation for the alleged damages suffered by him in proportion to his corporate participation. This would be tantamount to a misappropriation of the company\u2019s assets. Argentina distinguishes the inadmissible derivative claims that in its view Total has put forth from certain corporate actions that its company law grants in certain cases to a shareholder in defense of the corporate interest. In the present proceedings, the Claimant did not however introduce such a claim, nor an individual claim for damages directly caused to its own property. The Claimant is seeking to enforce rights of another legal person. This is inadmissible according to Argentine law, which Argentina submits is the only law applicable to the present case.\n\nIn support of its arguments based on Argentine corporate law, Argentina has submitted a legal opinion by Prof. Ricardo Augusto Nissen, Chief Inspector of the Argentine Regulatory Agency of Corporations.\n\nClaimant\u2019s counter-arguments:\n-----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nTo address the fourth objection to jurisdiction advanced by Argentina, Total relies, first of all, on the provision of the BIT defining covered investments. In fact, Total\u2019s equity participation in TGN, Central Puerto and HPDA, all of which are companies incorporated in Argentina, is contemplated by Article 1.1 of the BIT as: \"(b) Shares,... and other forms of participation, *albeit minority or indirect,* in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party.\" (emphasis added). Consequently, according to the Claimant, the dispute at issue relates to investments made under the BIT within the coverage of Article 8.1 of the BIT.\n\n37.\n\nThe reference made by the Respondent to Argentine Companies Law, which would not admit derivative claims, is irrelevant in these proceedings because Total\u2019s claim is a claim based on the BIT. For this reason, general international law, referred to by the Respondent, also has no bearing on the matter. Total challenges consequently the reliance by Argentina on the *Barcelona Traction* case.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant submits that in order to dismiss the objection to jurisdiction at issue, it suffices to refer to Article 1.1(b) of the BIT, which defines an investment as including different forms of participation - including minority or indirect - in companies constituted in the territory of the other Contracting State. In order to protect these investments, the BIT grants a direct right of protection, including access to international arbitration under the ICSID Convention. According to Total, the Respondent\u2019s position that a claim for the defense of the rights of the shareholders would be admissible under the ICSID Convention only through Article 25(2)(b), that is through a direct claim by the locally incorporated company, runs contrary to the ICSID Convention itself and does not take into account the very provision of the BIT which defines covered investments. According to the Claimant, Article 1.1(b) of the BIT was meant to enlarge the jurisdictional protection available to investors pursuant to the ICSID Convention. Answering the Respondent\u2019s assertion that derivative claims are admissible only when an international agreement so provides, the Claimant maintains that \"Article 1.1(b) of the Treaty contains a clear and dispositive rule to that effect\".16 Total concludes that treaty provisions such as Article 1.1(b) of the BIT \"permit shareholders to claim for the damage caused to their shareholdings by measures directed at the company in which they participate\"17 as is well established in arbitral case law, independent from any right of action that the company itself may have.\n\nCCMJ para. 107.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 109\n\nE. Fifth objection:\u00a0*The Tribunal lacks competence since the parties agreed on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal contentious-administrative tribunals of the City of Buenos Aires, for the interpretation and enforcement of the concession contract.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments:\n----------------------\n\n39.\n\nArgentina points out that the Bidding Rules for the privatization of *Gas del* *Estado* provide (at Section E3.5) that \"The Bidders, the Investor Company and the Licensee shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Contentious-Administrative Courts of the City of Buenos Aires for the purpose of any conflict arising in connection with the Bidding Process, including performance or termination of the Transfer Agreement, hereby waiving any other competent court or jurisdiction.\" (Translation).\n\n40.\n\nArgentina cites as relevant precedents the *Woodruff* case decided by the Claims Committee between the US and Venezuela; the *North American Dredging* *Company (NADC)* case decided by the American-Mexican Claims Committee in 1926 and the more recent *SGS v. Pakistan* and *SGS v. Philippines* cases. In the Respondent\u2019s view, such jurisprudence points out a fundamental theory of continental law, namely the theory of *\"ados propios \",* known also in international law under the common law term of \"estoppel\".\n\n41.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant, by agreeing to a clause providing for exclusive jurisdiction of domestic courts, waived its consent to the jurisdiction of the ICSID to hear the dispute. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Centre, \"unless otherwise stated\".18 In the Respondent\u2019s view, through the above-mentioned clause of the Bidding Rules, Total clearly declined Argentina\u2019s offer to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention and consented instead to the jurisdiction of domestic tribunals of Argentina over any dispute related to the investment. Argentina concludes that Total has waived its consent to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention by agreeing to a clause recognizing a different jurisdiction. As a result, the written consent required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is lacking as to the Claimant since it has consented instead to accept the jurisdiction of the domestic courts.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention provides as follows: \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s counter-arguments:\n-----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant rejects Argentina\u2019s argument that the Tribunal cannot hear the claim because the Bidding Rules for the privatization of the *Gas del Estado* provide, at section 1.3.5, for the exclusive jurisdiction of domestic tribunals to hear any dispute arising in connection with the Bidding Process. The Claimant maintains that it is not bound by the Bidding Rules, since it was not a party to that agreement, and that its claims have nothing to do with the Bidding Rules since its claims are founded on the BIT. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, invoked by Argentina, is totally irrelevant here. Total never signed a clause regarding disputes related to its investment which would have the effect of \"dec!in|ing] Argentina\u2019s offer to arbitrate Treaty disputes pursuant to the ICSID Convention\".19\n\nCCMJ para. 116.\n\n43.\n\nTo distinguish the *NADC* case relied upon by the Respondent, the Claimant points out that *NADC* dealt with the subscription by an investor to a so-called \"Calvo clause\" in a contract with the host State. Such a clause would prevent the investor from asking its home State to intervene in diplomatic protection; it cannot however bar a foreign investor from pursuing its claim under international law. In the same line of reasoning, according to the Claimant, the reference by the Respondent to the *SGS v. Philippines* case is misplaced. That case concerned a contractual claim brought under the cover of an \"umbrella clause\" of a BIT before an arbitral tribunal. Although the tribunal admitted in principle its competence to hear the case, it declined to exercise it because the parties had submitted the claim to the Philippine courts. In the present case, on the contrary, Total\u2019s claims are not contractual, they are not asserted under Article 10 of the BIT, and they have not been submitted to any other forum. In support of this argument, the Claimant relies on various decisions on jurisdiction by arbitral tribunals in investment disputes, such as *Impregilo v. Pakistan;* *CMS* v. *Argentina; Enron v. Argentina;* and *Azurix v. Argentina.* The Claimant goes on to refer to other cases in support of its position that \"claims asserting a cause of action under a treaty cannot be reduced to contract claims... simply because they may raise some contractual issues, or be somewhat related to an underlying contract.\"20\n\n***Ibid.*** para. 128.\n\nF. Sixth objection: *The claim is inadmissible due to lack of damage.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArgentina\u2019s arguments :\n-----------------------\n\n44.\n\nUnder this argument Argentina asserts the non-existence of a controversy because the damages that Total claims it has suffered do not exist and the issues raised by Total have been resolved by an agreement for the normalization of the \"Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista\" (MEM). Argentina considers that the dispute has thereby ceased to exist so that the contentious jurisdiction of the Tribunal does not subsist. To support its view, Argentina relies on a passage of the ICJ decision in the *Nuclear Tests* case to the effect that \"the existence of a dispute is the primary condition for the Court to exercise its judicial function.\"21 In Argentina\u2019s submission, this function cannot be further exercised if the dispute has disappeared.\n\nSee the ***Nuclear Tests Case*** (Australia v. France). International Court of Justice. December 20, 1974. para. 55. Respondent\u2019s Legal Authority AL RA 14.\n\n45.\n\nSpecifically, as far as the alleged lack of damage is concerned, Argentina refers to certain measures that it has taken, as part of its emergency measures, in order to cope with the increase of costs incurred by energy generators. Argentina maintains that, during the period January 2002 to December 2003, power generators did not suffer any damage because, when the costs of power generation companies increased, the differences were covered by the Stabilization Fund of the MEM. As far as the subsequent period from January 2004 to December 2006 is concerned, the special fund \"Foninvemem\" (established in 2004) will use the \"sales credit\" (liquidaciones de venta) of the generators in order to finance new power plants. These generators (including the Claimant) would become shareholders of the new plants, entitled to receive dividends, as allegedly accepted by the Claimant. At the present time, Argentina maintains that power generators\u2019 income has increased by 25% in 2005 compared with 2001. The profits of the Claimant being unchanged, the non-existence of damage on the part of the Claimant is so evident that the claim must be considered inadmissible, without any need to look further to the merits.\n\nClaimant\u2019s counter-arguments:\n-----------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn reply to the sixth objection to jurisdiction advanced by Argentina, Total relies on two arguments: first, it maintains that the existence of damage is not a necessary element of a dispute under international law; second, it contests the Respondent\u2019s refutation of any damage suffered by Total in respect of Central Puerto and HPDA as contrary to the evidence and belonging to the merits.\n\n47.\n\nIn order to assert its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must be satisfied, according to Article 8 of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, of the existence of a \"dispute\". According to international law, a dispute is a \"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"22 The reliance on the *Nuclear Tests* case is thus misleading because it concerned \"the absence of a legal interest in the resolution of a dispute on account of the disappearance of the facts that give rise to the dispute\".23 In the present case, on the contrary, the Claimant complains of measures taken by the Respondent which have reduced the value of its investment in an amount that the Claimant provisionally estimated in its Request for Arbitration.\n\nSee ***The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*** case, PCIJ, Series A, No.2 (1924) at 11.\n\nCCMJ para. 134.\n\n48.\n\nFor the above-mentioned reason, the Claimant considers the assertion by Argentina that it has not suffered any damage since 2002 as \"disingenuous\". The Claimant explains with reference to the various periods referred to by Argentina how the stabilization funds and other actions referred to by Argentina did not eliminate or mitigate the damages brought about by the measures in respect of which Total complains.\n\nIV. Consideration by the Tribunal of the Objections to Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn conformity with Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal is called upon to decide, as a preliminary question, the objections raised by the Respondent to the effect that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre nor within the competence of the Tribunal. While the parties have advanced many arguments, some of which touch upon the merits, the Tribunal will consider hereafter only those that are relevant to its decision regarding the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore ascertain, for the sole purpose of determining its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, whether the criteria that define disputes for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction under those two instruments are met. These criteria are the following:\n\na) that the dispute is between Argentina (as a contracting party to the ICSID Convention and the BIT) and a national of France (as defined in the BIT and in the ICSID Convention);\n\nb) that the dispute is a \"legal\" dispute (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention),\n\nc) that said legal dispute arises \"directly\" out of an investment (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention);\n\nd) that said dispute is a *\"controversia relativa a las inversiones, en el* *sentido del presente Acuerdo, entre una Parte Contratante y un inversor de* *la otra Parte Contratante\"*, that is a \"dispute relating to investments made under this Agreement between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\" (Article 8.1 of the BIT)24; and\n\ne) that such investments are of the type protected by the BIT (Article 1.1 of the BIT).\n\nThe BIT was made \"in the French and Spanish languages, both texts being equally authentic\" (Art. 13, last paragraph). When using an English translation, the Tribunal will use the text appearing in 1728 UNTS 298 (1993), No. 30174, also relied upon by the Claimant.\n\nA. The proper methodology to resolve the jurisdictional challenge\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nBefore starting the above examination on the basis of the parties\u2019 arguments and documentation, but not necessarily in the same order as the parties have raised them, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to elucidate the type of analysis that it is called upon to make in order to ascertain its jurisdiction in the present case.\n\n52.\n\nSince, as has been noted above, preliminary objections to jurisdiction are made before the Respondent has replied to Claimant\u2019s memorial on the merits, in order to determine its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must consider whether the dispute, as presented by the Claimant, is *prima facie* within the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal established to decide a dispute between a French investor and Argentina under the BIT. The requirements of a *prima facie* examination for this purpose have been elucidated by a series of international cases.25 The object of the investigation is to ascertain whether the claim, as presented by the Claimant, meets the jurisdictional requirements, as to the factual subject matter at issue, the legal norms referred to as applicable and having been allegedly breached, and the relief sought.26 For this purpose the presentation of the claim as set forth by the Claimant necessarily forms the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. The investigation does not prejudge whether the claim is well founded, but aims only to determine whether the Tribunal is competent to pass judgment upon it.\n\nA detailed examination of international cases can be found in the recent Decision on Jurisdiction by the ICSID Tribunal in ***Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of April 22, 2005, paras. 237-253, available at: http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/awards.htm.\n\nThis corresponds to the traditional Roman law description of the elements of a claim: ***factum, causa petendi*** and ***petitum.***\n\n53.\n\nAs to the facts of the case, the presentation of the Claimant is fundamental: it must be assumed, for the sole purpose of determining jurisdiction, that the Claimant would be able to prove to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction in the merits phase the facts that it invokes in support of its claim. That is, the existence and impact of Argentina\u2019s measures and actions that the Claimant considers have affected its investments in breach of the BIT. This does not necessarily mean that the Claimant\u2019s description of the facts must be accepted as true, without further examination of any type. The Respondent might supply evidence showing that the case has no factual basis even on a preliminary scrutiny, so that the Tribunal would not be competent to address the subject matter of the dispute as properly determined.\n\n54.\n\nIn the present dispute, however, there does not appear to be any basic disagreement between the parties as to most of the factual elements of the case, as far as this may be relevant to identifying the ambit of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in relation to the dispute. Argentina does not dispute, factually, that Total has made and holds certain investments, as Total has described in detail in its submissions and supporting documents, in the gas transportation industry, the petroleum exploration and production industry, and the power generation industry in Argentina. Furthermore, Argentina has not disputed that the Measures27 complained of by Total as having breached its rights under the BIT, have had generally the scope described by Total. As mentioned above at paragraph 16, these measures have eliminated the free convertibility of the peso into US dollars at the rate of one to one; have abolished the right of regulated public utilities - including TGN - to adjust their tariffs according to the CPI, the US dollar or other foreign currencies and indexes; have frozen the gas consumer tariff; have imposed an export withholding tax on the sale of hydrocarbons and have restricted export thereof; and have restricted the ability of power generators to adjust their prices. Argentina does not dispute either, as far as it might have addressed this issue in the jurisdictional phase, that those measures have specifically affected the operations of the local companies in which Total has invested, in accordance with the conditions that resulted from the legislation applicable to those operations when Total had made its investment therein.\n\nReferred to by the Claimant in its various submissions and summarized above at paragraph 16, including specifically the Emergency Law of 2002 and those others that followed it and derived from it.\n\n55.\n\nAs to the legal foundation of the case, in accordance with accepted judicial practice, the Tribunal must evaluate whether those facts, if established, namely the unilateral changes of the legal regime just mentioned and their alleged negative impact on Total\u2019s investment, could possibly give rise to the Treaty breaches that the Claimant alleges, and which the Tribunal is competent to pass judgment upon.28 In other words, those facts, if proven to be true, must be \"capable\" of falling within the provision of the BIT and of having caused or representing treaty breaches as alleged by the Claimant.29 It is of course a question for the merits whether the alleged facts (that is Argentina\u2019s measures and conduct) constitute breaches of the BIT for which Argentina must be held liable under the BIT in accordance with applicable legal provisions.30 It is also for the merits to determine whether those measures have actually had on Total\u2019s investments the specific negative impact of which Total complains, to the extent such determination is relevant to establish the alleged breaches and assess damages.\n\nSee ICJ, ***Oil Platforms*** case (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Order of March 10, 1998, ICJ Reports 1998, p. 806, para. 16; see also the separate Opinion of Judge Higgins at para. 32; ***SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of the Philippines,*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decision on Jurisdiction of January 29, 2004, in ICSID Reports (2005), p. 518, para. 157.\n\nICJ, ***Case Concerning Legality of the Use of Force*** (Yugoslavia v. Italy), ICJ Reports 1999-1, Order of June 2, 1999 para. 25.\n\nArt. 8.4 of the BIT is as follows: \"The ruling of the arbitral body shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the legislation of the Contracting Party which is party to the dispute, including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law\".\n\n56.\n\nAs to the relief sought, there is no doubt as to the admissibility of the claim for relief that the Claimant has sought against and from Argentina, notably a declaratory judgment that Argentina has committed various breaches of the BIT provisions and an order that Argentina compensate Total for the damages stemming therefrom.\n\n57.\n\nWith these considerations in mind the Tribunal will turn to examine the jurisdictional basis of the claim challenged by Argentina. The Tribunal wishes immediately to dispose of the first requirement listed above, namely the nationalities of the parties. Total has submitted evidence that it was incorporated and constituted in accordance with the laws of France and maintains its registered office *(si\u00e8ge social)* in France. Argentina has not disputed that the Claimant, Total S.A., is a juridical person having the nationality of another Contracting State in conformity with Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. More specifically, Argentina has not disputed that the Claimant meets the requirement of being a French body corporate having its registered office in France in accordance with French law as required by Article 1.2(b) of the BIT.\n\nB. The first objection to jurisdiction by Argentina:\u00a0*Inadmissibility of the claim.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nArgentina considers that Total\u2019s claim is inadmissible because a foreign investor cannot claim to be sheltered from the effects of a general crisis in the host country by invoking a BIT\u2019s protection. In other words, Argentina submits that general measures of the host country cannot be challenged as being in breach of a BIT by an investor who alleges that it has been damaged thereby. However, international practice shows that many disputes based on an alleged breach of international standards concerning the treatment of the property of aliens, settled either by means of diplomatic protection or direct arbitration, have arisen from general measures taken by host States which affected those investments. Were this not admissible, nationalization measures, either aimed at the property of both nationals and foreigners, or just at foreign property, which have been the subject maher of a substantial portion of those disputes, would have escaped any international litigation and dispute settlement mechanisms.\n\n59.\n\nIt is important to clarify that the subject matter of the dispute is not those general measures of Argentina *per se* (including the changes of its exchange policy); nor is the Tribunal entitled to pass judgment on whether they were right or wrong from an economic or domestic legal point of view. The Tribunal is called upon by the Claimant to determine whether any specific measures, \"or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\".31 \"What is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre [are] not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments\".32\n\n***CMS Gas Transmission Co v. Argentine Republic,*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/08), Decision on Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003, para. 33. available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/awards.htm\n\n***Ibid,*** para. 27 cited by Argentina. The approach of the ***CMS*** Tribunal has been consistently followed by other ICSID tribunals before which Argentina has raised this argument; ***see,*** for example, ***Enron*** ***Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentine Republic*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction (Ancillary Claim), August 2, 2004, para 12. available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/awards.htm; ***Camuzzi International S.A. v. Argentine Republic,***  (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/2), Decision on Jurisdiction, May 11, 2005, para. 59. available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/awards.htm.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal sees therefore no bar to its jurisdiction in this respect: the fact that the breach of the BIT\u2019s protection alleged by Total might derive, in whole or in part, from general measures adopted by Argentina does not deprive the present dispute of the requirement that it be a \"legal dispute\" in accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nC. The second objection to jurisdiction by Argentina:\u00a0*The dispute submitted to the Tribunal does not arise directly from a measure adopted against the investment.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nWe turn now to Argentina\u2019s objection that its measures are not \"specifically\" addressed against Total\u2019s investments. Argentina bases this objection on the premise that by referring to \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\", Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that the measures impugned by the Claimant as being contrary to the BIT must be \"specifically\" addressed to, or directed at an investment. In the present case, according to Argentina, Total complains of general measures, taken for the general welfare (\"coz? *el objeto de* *lograr el bien com\u00fan\").* Furthermore, according to Argentina, Total\u2019s claims raise contractual issues stemming from tariff questions pertaining to public services concessions.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Argentina\u2019s argument nor its conclusions for the following reasons. From a textual point of view, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention refers to \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\": this cannot be construed as meaning \"any legal dispute arising from a measure by the host country directed specifically at an investment\". First, it is the \"legal dispute\" that must arise directly from, or be related to the investment (in a direct relation with the investment), not any \"measure\" that may have caused the legal dispute; second, \"arising directly out of an investment\" is not the equivalent of \"specifically directed at an investment\". In any case, a measure of the host State can affect an investment directly, so that the dispute as to the international legality of that measure arises directly out of that investment, even if the measure is not specifically aimed or directed at that investment.\n\n63.\n\nIn the present case, it appears from Total\u2019s claims and *prima facie* evidence, (as is sufficient for purpose of establishing jurisdiction) that certain measures, starting with Emergency Law N\u00b0 25,561, and more particularly its Sections 8 and 10, specifically affected Total\u2019s investments. For example, the legal regime applicable to the gas distribution service performed by TGN was changed and appears to have affected TGN\u2019s operations.\n\n64.\n\nThe requirement that the dispute arise directly out of an investment according to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is met when, as is here the case, the Claimant challenges certain measures of the host State that affected the investment directly, in that these measures were applicable to such an investment as a matter of law and that they were in fact implemented in respect of such an investment.\n\n65.\n\nMoreover, in the present case one could consider that the more restrictive criterion advocated by Argentina is also met. This is because a number of the measures referred to by Total as having affected adversely its investments, both legally and economically, were directed at and applied specifically to public services *(servicios publicos)* and their providers under license *(los concessionaries),* including gas and electricity distributors, such as TGN, and Total\u2019s power generation companies.33 In this respect, the Tribunal does not consider that for a measure to be found \"specifically\" directed at a certain entity or at its assets it is necessary that said entity be singled out by name as an addressee of such measure.\n\nSee above para. 62. As to its hydrocarbons exploration and production operations, Total points to Decrees 1606/2001 and 2703/2002 which imposed on hydrocarbon producers the obligation to repatriate all or a substantial part of the foreign currency income derived from oil and gas exports. As to its power generation operation, Total points to various measures that have forcibly changed the previous mechanisms of price adjustment and frozen or capped relevant electricity prices \"at artificial levels\" (such as a number of Resolutions of the Secretariado de Energia issued in 2002/2003).\n\n66.\n\nArgentina relies to the contrary on the decision on jurisdiction in the well known *Methanex* case, rendered under Chapter 11 of NAFTA. In that case, the arbitral tribunal found that a measure enacted by the state of California that restricted the use of an additive of gasoline (MTBE) for environmental purposes, thus preventing Methanex from supplying to the producers of that additive a component it manufactured in the USA (methanol), did not present a measure \"relating to\" a protected investor or to an investment as required by Article 1101(1).34 The Methanex Tribunal held that the language of Article 1101(1) required that \"there must be a legally significant connection between the measure and the investor or the investment\".35 It concluded that since the measure did not relate to methanol or Methanex it had no jurisdiction over the claim: Methanex had not alleged facts \"establishing a legally significant connection between the US measures, Methanex and its investments\".36 It must be noted that NAFTA does refer to \"measures\", while the ICSID Convention, as has been pointed out above, refers to \"legal disputes\", and that while NAFTA refers to measures \"relating to\" an investment, the ICSID Convention refers to legal disputes \"arising directly out of an investment\". Irrespective of this question, however, the Tribunal believes that the factual circumstances are here quite different. In the present case, the assets that the Claimant indicates as representing its investments in Argentina were directly subject to, and legally and economically affected by the measures at issue. In the light of what has been said above, the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute arise \"directly\" from an investment is satisfied.\n\n***Methanex Corp. v. USA,*** Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 7, 2002, para. 127-139 (this decision on jurisdiction has since been applied in the Final Award of August 3, 2005), available at: www.naftalaw.org. Art. 1101(1) of NAFTA is as follows: \"This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: (a) investors of another Party; (b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and (c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory of the Party.\"\n\n***Ibid,*** para. 139. Even if the Tribunal were to consider jurisprudence under the NAFTA, the Tribunal notes that other tribunals have interpreted the same NAFTA language differently and reached different results.\n\n***Ibid,*** para. 150.\n\nD. Third jurisdictional objection of Argentina:\u00a0*The dispute submitted to the Tribunal is not an \"investment dispute\" according to Article 8 of the BIT because: (1) the dispute is not a legal dispute; (2) even if the dispute were a legal dispute, it would be of a contractual nature, and it consequently*\u00a0*would fall outside the competence of the Tribunal. In any case Total\u2019s minority shareholdings were not affected.*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to share Argentina\u2019s view that Total is claiming a tariff revision while invoking a *\"supuesta intangibilitad de las tarifas de los servicios publicos\"37* Rather, as emerges clearly from Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration, subsequent memorials and documents, Total challenges the various measures taken by Argentina from 2001 onward that modified the tariff regimes as being in breach of various BIT provisions. Specifically as to gas transmission, Total has claimed that it invested in TGN based on the dollarized adjustable tariff structure and that this was a basic premise and condition of the IPO of Gas del Estado in 1992. Total alleges that as a result of the Argentinean measures of 2001-2003, which subverted that regime, it has been substantially deprived of the value and economic benefit that it reasonably expected to obtain from its investment in TGN. Total claims that Argentina breached thereby the BIT\u2019s obligations not to take measures equivalent to expropriation, to accord fair and equitable treatment, to refrain from discriminating and to respect specific undertakings as to TGN.\n\nRMJ para. 40.\n\n68.\n\nFor the purpose of ascertaining jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers the above claims to fall within its competence since, *prima facie,* they present conduct by Argentina that may constitute a violation of the BIT obligations and standards of protection to which Total as a French investor is entitled. Total has clearly not asked this Tribunal to evaluate the renegotiation process under Argentina\u2019s regulations nor to enter into the merit of this process, on which - as Argentina points out - this Tribunal would have no competence. On the contrary, Total claims that the renegotiation process is itself in breach of the BIT and that, by invoking such process under its domestic law, Argentina attempts to evade its international obligations, including that of arbitrating the dispute in accordance with Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n69.\n\nIn the light of the above, the Tribunal cannot accept Argentina\u2019s arguments that the present dispute is not a legal dispute involving the application of the BIT under international law. Nor can the Tribunal accept that it is a contractual dispute involving the renegotiation process.\n\n70.\n\nWith reference to Total\u2019s rights as a minority shareholder in TGN (19.23%) and in HPDA (41.3%), Argentina objects in substance that a minority shareholder is not legally protected in respect of measures that cause prejudice to the local company in which such shareholding is owned by the other country\u2019s investor, as long as the latter\u2019s legal rights as an owner of those shares are not thereby affected in breach of the BIT.38\n\nAlthough Argentina does not specifically refer to Central Puerto in this section of its memorial, from the Tribunal\u2019s review of the facts it appears that this objection also applies to Total\u2019s minority shareholding in Central Puerto.\n\n71.\n\nTotal relies to the contrary on the inclusion of \"Shares, issue premiums and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party\", within the definition of the term \"investment\" in Article 1.1(b) of the BIT. Total considers that it is immaterial that its rights as an owner of those shares may not have been affected, suppressed or interfered with by the measures it challenges. Total submits that since the minority shareholdings fit within the definition of \"investments\" in the BIT, Article 8.1 of the BIT unequivocally grants Total a direct right to protect its shareholdings from Argentina\u2019s measures, including access to international arbitration under the ICSID Convention.\n\n72.\n\nTotal argues further that Argentina\u2019s measures affected the economic conditions and value of the local companies in which Total holds both majority and minority investments. Total submits that Argentina radically changed - contrary to promises, guarantees and legitimate expectations - the legal regime in which the local companies operated, by changing the denomination and adjustment of tariffs and by unilaterally altering the terms of the licenses held by these companies.39 Total further submits that the measures had an economic impact on the value of the companies: in particular, TGN\u2019s tariff income was reduced by about 70% due to the various measures that affected its operations, while its dollar-denominated costs and liabilities remained unchanged so that, as a consequence, TGN had to default under its loans. As a result, TGN\u2019s value plummeted, which in turn impacted the value of Total\u2019s shareholding in TGN. As to HPDA, Total says that as a consequence of the measures that affected its operations and dramatically reduced its source of income, HPDA defaulted on its loans, and both HPDA and Central Puerto are currently at the mercy of their creditors.\n\nTotal argues that its acquisition of an equity participation in TGN in the year 2000 \"was predicated on several explicit, firm guarantees provided by Argentina in the Gas Law, the Gas Decree and the TGN Licence\" (CCMJ para. 56; CMM para. 51 ff.)\n\n73.\n\nThe question at issue here is whether the measures of Argentina that allegedly adversely affected the local companies, in which Total holds minority shareholdings and whose value was in turn affected, are capable of constituting a breach of the protection afforded by the BIT to Total\u2019s investments as therein defined.40 If the answer is affirmative on the basis of a *prima facie* examination, then the present case is one of a \"dispute arising directly out of an investment\" on which this Tribunal has jurisdiction.\n\nSome of the arguments raised and discussed in respect of this issue here are also relevant in case of majority shareholdings and have been raised by Argentina in its fourth objection to jurisdiction.\n\n74.\n\nThe definition of \"investments\" in BITs is generally broad in accordance with their purpose of promoting reciprocally investments by nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other in the form of capital, technology, know-how and related activities, by ensuring to the investors a definite standard of protection.41 The employment of capital and other factors in the host economy is normally made through companies incorporated in the host country, owned and controlled by the foreign investor. As shareholder in these companies, the foreign investor is entitled and able to manage and control its investments. This is often the only way for a foreign investor to make investments, whenever the host State requires that certain activities be carried out by locally incorporated companies, as was the case for Argentina\u2019s privatization schemes. The protection that BITs afford to such investors is accordingly not limited to the free enjoyment of the shares but extends to the respect of the treaty standards as to the substance of their investments.\n\nUNCTAD, ***Bilateral Investment Treaties in the Mid-1990s,*** United Nations 1998, at p.1-2: \"Bilateral investment treaties are one of the policy instruments available to provide legal protection to foreign investments under international law and thus to reduce as much as possible the non-commercial risks facing foreign investors in host countries\". See also Rudolf Dolzer & Margrete Stevens, ***Bilateral Investment Treaties*** (1995), pp. 25-31.\n\n75.\n\nThese considerations are applicable to the BIT between Argentina and France interpreted in the light of its object and purpose.42 The above conclusions are supported by international case law43, by authors and by studies of international organizations active in this field.44 There is no reason to hold otherwise when minority shareholdings in a locally incorporated company are at issue in a situation such as the present one.45 The BIT specifically includes minority shareholdings within the definition of investment. The fact that minority participations are at stake here does not change the nature of the investment nor the exposure of the foreign investor to risks in respect of which the BIT is meant to afford protection. The position and role of Total as a French investor in respect of the companies in which it held minority shares does not appear different than in respect to the other companies it owns and controls in Argentina and their activities.\n\nThe Preamble recites that the two Governments have agreed on the operative provisions of the BIT \"[D]esiring to develop economic cooperation between the two States and to create favourable conditions for French investments in Argentina and Argentine investments in France; Convinced that the promotion and protection of such investments are likely to stimulate transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their economic development\". Moreover, the BIT, besides defining investments and related terms, also covers \"activities in connection with such investments\", granting most-favored-nation and national treatment in that respect (Article 4, first paragraph of the BIT).\n\nSee i.e. ***Antoine Goetz and others v.

Thus, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8.1 of the BIT with respect to these legal disputes arising directly out of an investment. The issue of whether Argentina\u2019s measures actually breached any of Total\u2019s treaty rights is one for the merits stage of the proceedings and has not been considered by the Tribunal at this stage.\n\nE. Fourth jurisdictional objection of Argentina46*: Total lacks* ius standi *to sue under international law and applicable Argentine law.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nObjection D by Argentina is mistakenly indicated as ***\"Tercerca defensca\"*** in the index and in the caption at page 22 of the RMJ.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that, notwithstanding Argentina\u2019s third objection, Total\u2019s claims fall within the ambit of the BIT and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear these claims.\n\n78.\n\nArgentina is misplaced when it relies on the *Barcelona Traction* case to assert that action taken by the host country against the activities and assets of a local company cannot constitute a breach of the BIT. The factual and legal context was different in that case and only the protection of foreign shareholders under customary international law was at issue in that dispute. Without entering into the specifics of that case, the ICJ itself recognized in its decision that the protection of shareholders required that recourse be made to treaty stipulations. The Court recalled that \"indeed, whether in the form of multilateral or bilateral treaties between States, or in that of agreements between States and companies, there has since the Second World War been considerable development in the protection of foreign investments\".47 The impressive development of BITs has been a response to the uncertainty of customary international law relating to foreign investment.\n\nICJ Reports (1970), para. 90. Respondent\u2019s Legal Authority AL RA 10. In the subsequent ***ELSI***  case (Elettronic Sicula S.p.A.) the Court upheld the applicability of Art. III.2 of the bilateral treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1948 between the US and Italy (granting to nationals and corporations of either party the right to \"control and manage\" corporations controlled by them and created under the law of the other party), in a case where Italian authorities had requisitioned property of an Italian company owned by two US corporations, ICJ Reports (1989), paras. 68 ff. The relevance of this decision for the interpretation of BITs has been highlighted by F.A. Mann in his comment ***Foreign Investment in the International Court of Justice,*** in ***Am. J. Int. Law,*** 1986, p. 92-102.\n\n79.\n\nThe other defenses raised by Argentina under its fourth objection are based on the assumption that the assets and rights affected by the measures of Argentina challenged by the Claimant pertain exclusively to the local companies in which the foreign investor has bought shares representing the investment. As a consequence, Argentina considers that the claim brought here by Total could only be defined as a derivative suit. Argentina describes a derivative suit as one by which the shareholder attempts to make good in its own name rights that belong instead to its subsidiary in the host State. Such \"derivative\" suit being inadmissible under the domestic law of the subsidiary, namely the law of Argentina, the Claimant cannot present such a claim to an international arbitral tribunal.\n\n80.\n\nHaving found, however, that the assets and rights that Total claims have been injured in breach of the BIT fall under the definition of investments under the BIT, it is immaterial that they belong to Argentine companies in accordance with the law of Argentina. Total asserts its own treaty rights for their protection, regardless of any right, contractual or non-contractual that the various companies (TGN, Total Austral, Central Puerto, HPDA) might assert in respect of such assets and rights under local law before the courts of other authorities of Argentina, in order to seek redress or indemnification for damages suffered as a consequence of actions taken by those authorities.\n\n81.\n\nTotal, on the other hand, invokes here treaty rights concerning its investment in Argentina protected by the BIT. The claims of Total cannot therefore be defined as indirect claims (or \"derivative\" claims), as if Total was claiming on behalf or *in lieu* of its subsidiaries in respect of rights granted to the latter by the laws of Argentina. It is therefore irrelevant that such claims would be inadmissible under those laws and that they would not be amenable in any case to the jurisdiction of an ICSID arbitral tribunal. This objection of Argentina is therefore without merit.\n\nF. Fifth jurisdictional objection of Argentina:\u00a0*The Tribunal lacks competence since the parties agreed on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal contentious-administrative tribunals of the City of Buenos Aires, for the interpretation and enforcement of the concession contract.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nTotal claims that Argentina has breached its BIT obligation; the Claimant does not rely on any breach of contract under Argentine law. To the contrary, Total considers that the terms of the Bidding for Gas del Estado to which Argentina refers are foreign to the present case and do not bind Total, which was not a party to the Bidding Rules.\n\n83.\n\nSince this Tribunal has concluded that the rights that Total invokes qualify for protection under the BIT, recourse to the treaty dispute settlement mechanism provided in Article 8 is possible as a matter of right. The claim that the host State has breached the protections granted by the BIT in respect of a given investment can be entertained by this Tribunal irrespective of the existence of contractual remedies available to the Argentine companies in which Total has invested or to Total itself, should this be the case. The exclusive choice of forum clause contained in the TGN Bidding Rules and related documents operates therefore only in respect of claims based on those rules and documents and between parties bound by them. It cannot prevent the performance by this Tribunal of its obligations in accordance with the BIT. Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration under the BIT and the ICSID Convention has not been displaced or rendered ineffective with respect to the present dispute by the choice of forum clause in the Bidding Rules.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant has referred in support of its position to various cases where ICSID tribunals have held that claims based on alleged breaches of the BIT with respect to an investment by a foreign investor cannot be equated with contractual claims under a license agreement.48 Argentina on the other hand relies on various cases to the effect that a contractual choice of local forum should be given effect over the international agreement that serves as the foundation of the jurisdiction of the international tribunal.49\n\nSee, for example, ***LG&E Energy Corp. v. Argentine Republic,*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Jurisdiction, April 30, 2004, para. 66, available at: http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/awards.htm.\n\n***Woodruff*** Case (1974), IX Reports of International Arbitral Awards, p. 213 ff; ***North America Dredging Co.*** (1926), IV Reports of International Arbitral Awards, p. 26 ff; ***SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decisions of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, cit., para. 154.\n\n85.\n\nIt is not necessary to examine closely the issues raised in those cases and the decisions rendered by those tribunals because those issues are not before us in this case. Based on its examination of the claims made by Total and the respective arguments of the parties, this Tribunal considers that the subject-matter of the claims of Total to be decided here, and of which Argentina challenges the jurisdiction, is not the breach of a contract containing a choice of domestic forum clause. Total is not pursuing a contractual claim in these proceedings. The choice-of-forum clause of the Bidding Rules is therefore immaterial and cannot be a bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The Tribunal is presented here with a claim based on the alleged breach by Argentina, through its legislative and other measures from 2001 onwards, of the legal regime applicable to Total\u2019s investments in violation of various terms of the BIT. The jurisdiction of this Tribunal over such claims must therefore be upheld.50\n\nThis would not prevent the Tribunal when dealing with the merits, from examining ***incidenter tantum***  whether there have been breaches of the Bidding Rules, should this be relevant in order to ascertain whether Argentina has committed the BIT breaches that Total alleges. See also the ***Vivendi*** Annulment decision, ***Comp, de Aguas del Aconquija (Annulment),*** 41 ILM 1135 (2002) at para. 112.\n\nG. Sixth jurisdictional objection of Argentina:\u00a0*The claim is inadmissible due to lack of damages.*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nTotal has claimed that the measures enacted by Argentina that affected its investments have inflicted on it substantial damages, notably by the transformation of the tariffs from US dollars (to which the peso was pegged at the rate of one to one) to devalued pesos; by the elimination of certain adjustment mechanisms; the imposition of restrictions on exports and on the use of the proceeds thereof; and by the introduction of regulatory measures affecting electricity producers. Total says that this constitutes a breach of the BIT\u2019s protection to which its investments in Argentina are entitled.\n\n87.\n\nIn order to establish jurisdiction over the claims made by the Claimant, the statements, arguments and documents submitted by Total appear sufficient to conclude *prima facie* that Total may have suffered economic prejudice from those measures. Contrary to Argentina\u2019s position that the dispute is non existent or has ceased to exist, a dispute definitely exists between the parties, because Argentina opposes the claims, while Total insists on them notwithstanding the argument of Argentina that Total suffered no damage.\n\n88.\n\nThe possible uncertainty as to the final amount of the damages does not represent a bar to jurisdiction, but rather an issue to be decided in the merits phase. Thus the arguments developed by Argentina concerning the establishment and operation of the Stabilization Fund and other measures it took in order to cover the additional costs incurred by power generators pertain to the merits. Further, the arguments raised by Argentina address only some of the claims made by Total, namely those concerning the measures affecting the power generation companies.\n\n89.\n\nFinally the Tribunal observes that the Claimant has requested a declaratory judgment that Argentina has breached the BIT. In this respect the issue of the damages is immaterial.51 As a consequence, the objection by Argentina based on the alleged lack of damages must be rejected.\n\nA basic issue in the present dispute is whether Argentina has committed an internationally wrongful act, that is whether it has breached the international obligations contained in the BIT by conduct attributable to it. As held by the I.L.C. these two conditions are sufficient to establish such a wrongful act giving rise to international responsibility. Having caused damage is not an additional requirement, except if the content of the primary obligation breached has an object or implies an obligation not to cause damages, see I.L.C., ***Draft Articles on State Responsibility*** cit., commentary to Art. 2, para. 9.\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\n90.\n\nFor the reasons stated above the Tribunal concludes that all jurisdictional requirements set out in the ICSID Convention and in the BIT are met in the present dispute. The Tribunal rejects accordingly Argentina\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal. Each party has requested that the costs of the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings, including its own costs, be home by the other. The Tribunal decides to consider this matter as part of the merits. So decided."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Concurring Opinion of Luis Herrera Marcano (Decision on Liability)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Concurring Opinion of Luis Herrera Marcano (Decision on Liability)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI support the decision of the Tribunal on liability as I believe that its conclusions are in conformity with the law and justice and with what was claimed and proven during the course of the proceedings. However, this does not mean that I fully agree with every statement contained in the decision.\n\n2.\n\nSpecifically, as concerns the concept of fair and equitable treatment, I do not share the interpretation of this concept given by a number of arbitration tribunals in proceedings between States and investors, namely, that it entails an obligation on the part of the State not to affect the \"investor's legitimate expectations\" that are based on the explicit or implicit promises of government officials or entities (promises, commitments or representations), even where such promises are not binding on the State under its own laws.\n\n3.\n\nIn my view, this interpretation is not based on the ordinary meaning of the words \"fair and equitable treatment\" which must be the first source of interpretation in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of Treaties (Vienna Convention), which is generally accepted in this subject-matter as reflecting customary international law, even by countries, such as France, that have not ratified it.\n\n4.\n\nNeither have I found any reference to the effect that Contracting States in the Treaty at hand, nor in any other of the thousands of international treaties providing for the protection of investments that are in force across the world, accord such meaning to the term \"fair and equitable treatment\".\n\n5.\n\nConversely, I have only found two cases where Contracting States have expressed officially an interpretation of the term \"fair and equitable treatment\". The first one of these cases is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Member States, Canada, United States and Mexico stated that the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" does not imply a superior standard of treatment than the minimum standard of treatment required under international law. The second case is that of Switzerland: in an official statement, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of the Swiss Confederation referred to the concept of fair and equitable treatment (*traitement juste et \u00e9quitable*): *\u00abOn se r\u00e9f\u00e8re* *ainsi au principe classique du droit des gens selon lequel les \u00c9tats doivent mettre les \u00e9trangers se trouvant sur leur territoire et leurs biens au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du \u00abstandard minimum\u00bb international, c'est-\u00e0-dire leur accorder un minimum de droits personnels, proc\u00e9duraux et \u00e9conomiques\u00bb.*1\n\n\"It is also referred to the classic principle of *jus cogens* according to which States must offer to foreigners who are on their territory (and their assets), the benefit of the international minimum standard *i.e.*, grant them the minimum of personal, procedural and economic rights.\" *Annuaire suisse de droit international*, 178 (1980), quoted in OECD working paper, Direction des affaires financieres et des entreprises, documents de travail sur l'investissement international num\u00e9ro 2004/3, *La Norme du Traitement Juste et Equitable dans le Droit International des Investissements,* p.11 *.*\n\n6.\n\nMoreover, it also is not possible to base such a broad meaning of the concept of *fair and equitable treatment* on a generally recognized principle in the legislation of the States. In all legal systems of which I am aware, a State is only bound by the \"promises\" or \"representations\" of its bodies or officers in specific cases in which the State's law so provides. I am not aware of any legal system in which a \"promise\" by authorities not to raise taxes or not to devaluate a currency would give the right to citizens to claim compensation if the authorities fail to keep it.\n\n7.\n\nThe relationship  between a State and an investor cannot be compared to the relationship between the parties to a contract. In the investor-State relationship, the State does not act *jure gestionis*, as in a commercial relationship, but rather it acts *juri imperii*. Notwithstanding, arbitral tribunals applying investment protection treaties, when interpreting the term \"fair and equitable treatment\", have introduced certain concepts such as \"representation\", which are applicable only to contractual relationships in some legal systems influenced by the Common Law.\n\n8.\n\nLikewise, it is not possible to compare the role of an investor with that of the State and to treat the investor as though the investor was a party to the treaty for the protection of investments, when, in fact, the investor is only a beneficiary under the treaty, or otherwise to apply for the investor's benefit the rules of acquiescence or \"estoppel\", which are applicable only to the relations between States, subject to much stricter requirements than those some investment arbitration tribunals have applied, to the prejudice of the State.\n\n9.\n\nInvestment arbitral tribunals quote previous decisions of other investment treaty tribunals, issued during recent years, as though they reflected mandatory rules of international law. Practically speaking, those tribunals were attempting to transpose into international law the notions of \"case law\" and \"precedent\" that are characteristic of Anglo-Saxon legal systems. However, the Statute of the International Court of Justice, which is universally recognized, clearly states that the decisions of the International Court of Justice, as the highest international tribunal, are not a source of international law but, rather an ancillary means to clarify the scope of international law, and are binding only on parties to the particular cases. If this is the case with respect to the International Court of Justice, then the power to create or change international law cannot possibly be attributed to other tribunals which are not international tribunals under international law, since they do not settle disputes between States and/or other subjects of international law, but rather are a hybrid located half-way between international law arbitral tribunals and arbitral tribunals in international private legal disputes.\n\n10.\n\nThe decision at hand, despite making the necessary reference to the interpretation of the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" developed in previous decisions, in my view provides a more solid basis for its conclusions. It seems evident that, pursuant to the ordinary sense of the term, a State's conduct cannot be considered to provide fair and equitable treatment when that conduct does not comply with the State's own laws to the investor's detriment, or when the State exercises in an abusive manner the regulatory power granted by its own laws, imposing tariffs which are manifestly unfair for indefinite periods of time, or when it attempts to apply taxes retroactively, or when it unjustifiably revokes permits or authorizations granted in accordance with its laws."}, {"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Henri \u00c1lvarez (Decision on Liability)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Henri \u00c1lvarez (Decision on Liability)\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nUnfortunately, I find myself in disagreement with my esteemed colleagues with respect to a number of points. While I agree with a number of the conclusions in the Majority Decision and recognize the desirability of unanimity, I am compelled to write this separate, dissenting opinion to address a number of important, basic points.\n\n2.\n\nThe particular investments at issue in this arbitration are those made by Total in Argentina. This arbitration is, in essence, three large arbitrations combined. Total made investments in companies that explored for and produced hydrocarbons; that generated power; and that transported natural gas in Argentina. Total has been an investor in Argentina\u2019s exploration and production sector since 1978. Total\u2019s investments in gas transportation and power generation came later - in 2000 and 2001, respectively.1\n\nIn the gas transportation sector, Total entered into a share purchase agreement with the TransCanada Group on 30 May 2000 for its shares of Gasinvest; Total\u2019s indirect purchase of 19.23% of TGN closed on 23 January 2001. In the power generation sector, Total purchased the shares of Central Puerto and the shares of HPDA from Gener in July and September 2001, respectively.\n\n3.\n\nThe parties to this arbitration agree that Argentina has had a turbulent economic history. In the 1970s and again in the late 1980s, the Argentine economy was plagued by hyperinflation and economic crises and it was difficult for Argentina to attract foreign investment to assist in the development of its infrastructure. By the late 1980s, Argentina\u2019s power generation sector was in a state of crisis. Power shortages were common and the system required an overhaul and significant investment to function. In order to address these problems and attract foreign investment, Argentina made a number of changes to its laws. The basic instruments governing Argentina\u2019s economic reforms were  Law 23,696 on the Reform of the State of 1989, Law No. 23,928 on Currency Convertibility of 1991 and Decree No. 2128/91 pegging the value of the Argentine peso to the US dollar. Further, specific instruments were enacted to govern the privatization of a number of industries and the provision of certain public services. Relevant to this arbitration are the further measures related to the gas transportation sector, the exploration and production of the hydrocarbons sector and the power generation sector, each of which has been discussed in detail in the Majority Decision.\n\n4.\n\nIn order to induce foreign investors to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure in Argentina, Argentina had to create an investment environment that was stable enough to justify the associated risks related to long-term investment. It accomplished this in a number of ways. In relation to natural gas, through the Gas Law and the Gas Decree, Argentina established ENARGAS,2 a regulator charged with maintaining the economic equilibrium: setting tariffs that would be sufficient to cover all reasonable costs of providing the service, taxes, amortization and a reasonable rate of return while protecting consumer rights through access to reasonably priced natural gas. Tariff reviews were to be conducted on a regular basis and both licensees and consumers were able to require ENARGAS to carry out an extraordinary review in the event that there were unforeseen circumstances that justified modifications to the tariff. Under the Gas Law, the Consumer Gas Tariff comprised the well-head gas price represented by a reference price; the gas transportation tariff; and the gas distribution tariff. Simplistically, the reference price is the portion that the gas producer receives; the gas transportation tariff is the portion that the gas transportation company receives; and the gas distribution tariff is the portion that the gas distributor receives. The gas distributor collected the Consumer Gas Tariff from consumers. The distributor would negotiate with the producers to establish the well-head gas price, which ENARGAS was supposed to pass through to consumers as part of the overall tariff.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, capitalized terms in this individual opinion have the same meaning as in the Majority Decision.\n\n5.\n\nIn the power generation sector, the system was privatized and designed to encourage investment by allowing the market to set electricity pricing, which assured recovery of the system\u2019s economic cost and rewarded efficiency by promising a uniform price in the spot market for all producers as well as free negotiation of term contracts. The Electricity Law, the Electricity Decree and related decrees set up the system and the wholesale market was regulated by CAMMESA.\n\n6.\n\nIn the exploration and production sector, Argentina converted existing long-term contracts between the State-owned energy company, YPF, and Total\u2019s consortium of foreign investors into a concession system in which investors had the right to freely dispose of the hydrocarbons that they produced at deregulated prices. YPF was then privatized. The effect of deregulation was to allow holders of production concessions to own the hydrocarbons that they extracted and to dispose of those hydrocarbons either domestically or to export them at prices they could freely negotiate.\n\n7.\n\nThus, in the early 1990s, Argentina privatized part or all of a number of its State-owned energy companies and created a legal framework that was supportive of foreign investment. Argentina recognized that foreign investors were the only ones with sufficient operational experience and access to financial markets to fund the necessary long-term investments required to upgrade and modernize the country\u2019s energy infrastructure.3 It also passed laws aimed at restructuring its economy and curbing inflation (the Convertibility Law). Argentina also entered into a number of bilateral investment treaties to signal its commitment to the international community. The legislative framework set up for each sector (gas transportation, power generation and exploration and production of hydrocarbons) was designed to allow markets to react to economic changes without the need to make *ad hoc* changes, thus signalling a shift from the old regime characterized by political interference from the State. This legal framework operated successfully for almost a decade without any fundamental changes by the Argentine government.\n\nSee generally, Claimant\u2019s Memorial at paras. 21-25 and the sources cited there, including World Bank/FIEL Working Document No. 39 Workshop on \"Private Investment Finance in Infrastructure Sectors\", dated December 1993 at Exh. C-93(2).\n\n8.\n\nIn Argentina, as in many jurisdictions, activities in the energy sector are highly regulated by the State. There has been a transition from State monopolies to privatized energy companies over the past three decades, as described above. While there may be some rationale for a State entity to operate at a loss, the same rationale does not transfer to privately owned investors who are accountable to shareholders. The tension between attracting investment in an essential part of the economy that requires large, up-front investments that need to be recouped over a number of years from consumers and the desire to keep consumer tariffs at a reasonable level to encourage development results in heavy regulation, Argentina is no exception. There is no doubt that Argentina has the right to regulate its energy sector, or any other sector it chooses. This arbitration concerns the commitments, if any, that Argentina made to investors, in particular Total, and whether Argentina\u2019s interventions in response to the economic crisis, which altered the various regimes it had established in order to induce investment, violated the legitimate expectations of investors who had relied on those commitments. If so, Argentina is liable to compensate those investors for losses that they suffered as a result of those violations.\n\n9.\n\nIn late 1999, Argentina\u2019s economy was in a recession. By late 2001, the economy was (again) in a state of crisis. However, at the time of this economic crisis, there was no energy crisis. That is, up to and until 2003, the Argentine market for natural gas was characterized by oversupply.4 In order to deal with the economic crisis, Argentina passed emergency legislation and a number of implementing decrees and regulations. These general Measures had a very profound impact on investors in the energy sector. Argentina began to regulate what had been a free market system in order to control consumer prices. Total argues that these Measures violated its rights under the BIT.\n\nTranscript (\"TR\") (English) Day 3, 888:9 - 10; direct examination of Yves Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 888:11 - 22; CPHB at para. 678.\n\n10.\n\nI set out this basic background in order to provide context for this dissenting opinion. I do not disagree that the Measures passed by Argentina, and of which Total complains in this arbitration, were taken in the face of a grave economic crisis. I agree that Argentina was entitled to take any measures it thought appropriate to deal with that economic crisis. However, I believe that Argentina made commitments to foreign investors, including Total, which, if breached by measures of certain types causing damage to those investors, require compensation.\n\n**II. THE ARGENTINA - FRANCE BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn this arbitration, Total claims that Argentina breached a number of its obligations under the BIT. In particular, Total complains that the Measures breached Article 3 (duty to afford fair and equitable treatment), Article 5(1) (obligation to provide full protection and security), Article 5(2) (no expropriation or equivalent measures without full compensation) and Article 4 (duty to extend national and most favoured nation treatment). The Majority Decision has dealt with each of these obligations in turn. In general, I agree with the reasoning of the Tribunal with respect to the analysis of Articles 4, 5(1) and 5(2) of the BIT and, accordingly, agree that Argentina did not breach any of these treaty obligations in respect of Total\u2019s investments. However, I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues on their interpretation and application of Article 3 of the BIT. It is this difference of opinion which compels me to dissent from the majority in the interpretation and application of the duty to afford fair and equitable treatment, as provided in Article 3 of the BIT,\n\n12.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT requires treaties to \"be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\" Article 31(2) of the VCLT confirms that \"context\" includes the text of the treaty, including its preamble.\n\n13.\n\nThe preamble to the BIT provides as follows:\n\nThe Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Argentine Republic, hereinafter referred to as \"the Contracting Parties\",\n\nDesiring to develop economic cooperation between the two States and to create favourable conditions for French investment in Argentina and Argentine investments in France,\n\nConvinced that the promotion and protection of such investments are likely to stimulate transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their economic development,\n\nHave agreed on the following provisions:...5\n\nThe French text provides as follows:  \n*Le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9nomm\u00e9s \"les Parties contractantes\",*  \n*D\u00e9sireux de renforcer la coop\u00e9ration \u00e9conomique entre les deux Etats et de cr\u00e9er des conditions favorables pour les investissements fran\u00e7ais en Argentine et argentins en France,*  \n*Persuad\u00e9s que l\u2019encouragement et la protection de ces investissements sont propres \u00e0 stimuler les transferts de capitaux et de technologie entre les deux pays, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de leur d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique,*  \n*Sont convenus des dispositions suivantes :*  \n The Spanish text provides as follows:  \n*El Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina y El Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Francesa, en adelante denominados \"las Partes Contratantes\",*  \n*CON EL DESEO de intensificar la cooperaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica entre los dos Estados y de crear las condiciones favorables para las inversions francesas en la Argentina y las inversions argentinas en Francia.*  \n*CONVENCIDOS que la promoci\u00f3n y la protecci\u00f3n de estas inversions son propicias para estimular las transferencias de capital y de tecnolog\u00eda entre los dos pa\u00edses con vistas al desarrollo econ\u00f3mico de ambos, HAN CONVENCIDO las disposiciones siguientes:*\n\n14.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of \"promote\" is to \"help forward; encourage; support actively\"6 and not just to allow or permit. The Spanish text uses the same word as the English version \"promoci\u00f3n\". The French text of the BIT uses the word \"encouragement\", which has the same connotation. Argentina and France committed to both encourage and promote investment. Argentina and France also agreed \"to create favourable conditions for French investment in Argentina\". The BIT should be interpreted with this context in mind.\n\n*The Canadian Oxford Dictionary,* s.v. \"promote\". The definition in Spanish is similar: \"iniciar o impulsar una cosa o un proceso, procurando su logro.\" See the definition in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola.\n\n15.\n\nArticle 3 of the BIT provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall undertake to accord in its territory and maritime zone just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law, to the investments of investors of the other Party and to ensure that the exercise of the right so granted is not impeded either *de jure* or *defacto.*\n\n16.\n\nThe BIT, which Argentina signed, specifically provides for \"just and equitable treatment\" and not the \"international minimum standard of treatment\". The language that the State parties to the treaty specifically chose must be interpreted in light of the context of the treaty.\n\n17.\n\nOther international tribunals have applied the fair and equitable treatment standard by determining whether, in all of the circumstances, the actions in question were fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. This has been discussed as an objective standard.7 Perhaps the most widely cited and accepted definition of the fair and equitable treatment standard is the following:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that [the fair and equitable treatment] provision of the Agreement, in light of the good faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in **a** consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices and directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.8\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S. A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award 20 August 2007 (English) (\"Vivendi *IT')* at para. 7.4.12; F.A. Mann, \"British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments\", (1981) 52 Brit. YB Int\u2019l L. 241 at 244; *CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *Argentine Republic* (English) *(\"CMS\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award 12 May 2005 at para. 280 (the conclusion that the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard was an objective one was not challenged by Argentina in its annulment application and the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning with respect to \"fair and equitable treatment\" was found by the Committee to be \"adequately founded on the applicable law and the relevant facts\", see *CMS* Annulment Decision 25 September 2007 at para. 85.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Teemed S.A. v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award 29 May 2003 *(\"Teemed\")* at para. 154.\n\n18.\n\nSimilarly, in interpreting the US-Argentina BIT, the *Azurix* tribunal said the following with respect to the meaning of \"fair and equitable\" with respect to that treaty:\n\n...it follows from the ordinary meaning of the BIT that fair and equitable should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. The text of the BIT reflects a positive attitude towards investment with words such as \"promote\" and \"stimulate\". Furthermore, the parties to the BIT recognize the role that fair and equitable treatment plays in maintaining \"a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources.\"9\n\n*Azurix v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award 14 July 2006 *(\"Azurix\")* at para. 360.\n\n19.\n\nWhile I agree with the majority that decisions of other ICSID tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal, it would not be beneficial for the legitimacy of the investment treaty system for tribunals to reach inconsistent decisions based on similar facts without compelling analysis of why the differences exist and are justified. Not only have other tribunals found that the fair and equitable treatment standard should be objectively determined, I concur in their reasoning in this respect. Importing a subjective standard into the interpretation of \"fair and equitable treatment\", in my opinion, has the effect of incorporating a margin of appreciation approach that is not appropriate at the first stage of the analysis, which concerns whether a breach of the standard has occurred. Some consideration must be given to all of the circumstances, as those circumstances affect both the State and the investor. In my view, concluding that the Measures were justified to deal with the economic crisis without also giving adequate consideration to the profound impact those Measures had on investors in the context of the commitments and promises made to them does not fairly consider all of the circumstances. In my opinion, this approach by the majority amounts to a back door way of admitting an element of Argentina\u2019s necessity defence into the fair and equitable treatment analysis.10 I wish to make it clear that I agree with the majority that Argentina failed to make out its necessity defence in this case either on the law or on the facts.\n\nWhile the Majority Decision rejects Argentina\u2019s defence of necessity at customary international law, I believe that the manner in which the majority\u2019s fair and equitable treatment analysis has been conducted has the effect of importing consideration of this defence into the assessment of whether the BIT has been breached. The margin of appreciation approach was not the subject of argument by the Parties.\n\n**III. THE NATURE OF THE PROMISES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nWith respect to its claims in the gas transportation and power generation sectors, Total relies on the existence of a detailed legislative framework, which set mechanisms for pricing that were designed to maintain the economic equilibrium of the system. In these sectors, there is no agreement concluded directly between Total and any Argentine State entity that sets out the promises at issue.\n\n21.\n\nIn the gas transportation sector, Total\u2019s investment, TGN, does have a license, which sets out a number of obligations owed to it by Argentina. Argentina says, however, that any promise made in the licence was to TGN, not Total. Argentina also argues that Total is unable to rely on the information memoranda circulated to potential investors at the time of privatization, as Total made its investment later, in a much different economic context. Finally, Argentina argues that a general, legislative framework is not a guarantee and that Total cannot argue that by changing the framework, Argentina violated its rights under the BIT.\n\n22.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal accepts the first two arguments, finding that Total is not entitled to rely on the TGN License and that Total cannot invoke the promises made in the information memoranda.11 The majority then goes on to characterize the remaining issue as whether it was legitimate for Total to expect \"stability\" of the legal framework.12 I agree that Total cannot rely on either the TGN License or the information memoranda as promises made directly to it by Argentina. However, I disagree to the extent that the existence of the detailed license granted to TGN and documentation which clearly set out Argentina\u2019s intentions in privatizing the energy sector have not been considered as part of the relevant circumstances in determining Total\u2019s legitimate expectations at the time of its investment. The TGN License specifically provides that the government will not modify the basic rules without consultation with the Licensee or without adjusting the tariff if economic equilibrium is affected. Further, freezing of tariffs and price controls are prohibited.13\n\nSee Majority Decision at paras. 99 - 101.\n\nSee Majority Decision at paras. 101-102.\n\nSee Exh. C-53, TGN License, at sections 1.9.1.9.2.9.5.9.8 and 18.2.\n\n23.\n\nThe majority then goes on to an analysis of whether Total was entitled to \"stability under a fair and equitable treatment clause\".14 I believe that this mischaracterizes Total\u2019s arguments. I do not understand Total to have argued that any change in the legislative framework would have been a breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under the BIT. The majority acknowledges this when it says that \"Total submits that it is not challenging the pesification of Argentina\u2019s economy as effected by the Emergency Law\".15 However, the majority then goes on to review the various specific promises alleged by Total to have been made by Argentina and to find that the calculation of tariffs in US dollars16 and US PPI adjustments were not promises on which Total could rely.17\n\nSee Majority Decision at para. 122.\n\nSee Majority Decision at para. 142. Note that when I use the terms \"pesification\" or \"pesify\" in this Individual Opinion, I am referring to the Measures contained in the Emergency Law through which all obligations existing on the date of the enactment of that law that were payable in dollars were converted into pesos (redenomination) at a fixed exchange rate (forced conversion at the artificial rate of one dollar to one peso subsequent to the delinking of the peso from the dollar).\n\nSee Majority Decision at para. 180. Note that the majority finds that the right to tariffs in US dollars was linked to the Convertibility Law. This finding is contrary to most of the previous awards that have looked at this issue, which also consider the right to calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars to exist independently, see for example *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&.E International Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability 3 October 2006 *(\"LG&E\")* at paras. 133 - 134; *CMS,* supra note 7, at paras. 134 - 137, 160 - 161; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award 28 September 2007 *(\"Sempra\")* at paras. 141-151. I agree with the conclusion reached by these tribunals on this issue.\n\nSee Majority Decision at para 145 et seq. Note that the majority\u2019s findings with respect to the US PPI adjustment and US dollar tariffs are inconsistent with the vast majority of the other ICSID cases which have considered these issues in the same factual context.\n\n24.\n\nI do not consider this to be a \"close case\". Viewed objectively, the Measures taken by Argentina in response to its crisis had an unjust and inequitable effect on investors in the gas transportation sector of the economy. In the early 1990s, Argentina consciously decided to break from its turbulent economic past and to create a stable and welcoming environment for desperately needed foreign investment in its energy sector. In the gas transportation sector, Argentina promised investors economic equilibrium - tariffs sufficient to cover costs and to generate a reasonable rate of return. It constructed a regulatory system (the Gas Law and Gas Decree) that ensured this promise through regular tariff reviews, dollar calculated tariffs, tariffs adjusted semi-annually by the US PPI and no freezing of tariffs without the licensee\u2019s consent. Based on these promises, over a number of years, investors invested hundreds of millions of dollars in fixed assets in Argentina. The system operated successfully for almost a decade until Argentina\u2019s reaction to the crisis at issue. The Measures did not tinker with this system; they totally and completely dismantled it.\n\n25.\n\nRequiring Total to point to a specific \"stabilization clause\" or guarantee made directly to it in order for it to succeed in demonstrating that Argentina breached the obligation to treat it fairly and equitably is, in my respectful view, not the proper analysis for the determination of legitimate expectations. Argentina negotiated a treaty with the express purpose of creating \"favourable conditions for French investment in Argentina\". As evidenced by the modernization of the energy sector, Argentina was successful in creating this environment. These investments were meant to be long-term and the legislative and regulatory frameworks by their prospective nature were not meant to attract only initial investment in the system, but to encourage the ongoing modernization, expansion and efficiency of the energy infrastructure. The evidence clearly established that Total relied on this framework in making its decision to expand its investments in Argentina.\n\n26.\n\nIn my view, the question should then be whether, to use the words of the *Teemed* tribunal, it was fair and equitable for Argentina to \"affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment\" and whether Argentina acted \"in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices and directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations\".18 This approach was also adopted by the **Saluka** tribunal. The Tribunal in **Saluka** was also faced with a bilateral investment treaty which did not specifically refer to the stability of the host State\u2019s legal framework. In this context, the tribunal applied a balanced approach to the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the bilateral investment treaty between The Netherlands and the Czech Republic and determined:\n\n\"Seen in this light, the [FET] standard prescribed in the Treaty should therefore be understood to be treatment which, if not proactively stimulating the inflow of foreign investment capital, does at least not deter foreign capital by providing disincentives to foreign investors. An investor\u2019s decision to make an investment is based on an assessment of the state of the law and the totality of the business environment at the time of the investment as well as on the investor\u2019s expectation that the conduct of the host State subsequent to the investment will be fair and equitable.\"19\n\n*Teemed,* supra note 8 at para. 154.\n\n*Saluka Investments B. V.* v. *The Czech Republic,* Partial Award 17 March 2006 *(\"Saluka\"*) at para. 301.\n\n27.\n\nThe legal framework will consist of \"legislation and treaties, of assurances contained in decrees, licences and similar executive assurances as well as in contractual undertakings. A reversal of assurances by the host state that have led to legitimate expectations will violate the principle of fair and equitable treatment.\"20 I note that with respect to the gas transportation sector, the TGN License did contain a specific promise that the Government would not change the framework without the consent of the licensee. Total may not be able to rely on the license as a contractual or quasi-contractual promise made to it, but surely the existence of such a clear promise granted to the investment itself created a legitimate expectation on Total\u2019s part that Argentina would not totally and unilaterally dismantle the system.\n\nR. Dolzer and C. Schreuer. *Principles of International Investment Law (* New York: Oxford University Press, 2008) at p. 134.\n\n28.\n\nFurther, requiring a specific stabilization clause deprives the regulatory framework of all of the benefits that it was designed to create - Argentina\u2019s entire purpose was to create a stable regulatory environment that induced and promoted foreign investment so that it could benefit from access to US dollars for its infrastructure upgrades and the experience of foreign companies in modernizing systems to generate real benefits for the local economy through reliable service and competitive pricing.\n\n29.\n\nThe purpose of the BIT, outlined in the *Mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo* which accompanied the BIT for ratification by the Argentine Congress, was to maintain a stable environment which would mitigate a foreign investor\u2019s concerns relating to political risks:\n\n\"The main objective of this type of agreement is to encourage genuine and productive investment and consequently to prevent certain acts which could impinge on the value of the investment.\n\n[...]\n\nTo create a stable and satisfactory environment which mitigates the concerns of foreign investors with regard to non-commercial risks, in other words political risks, and to encourage the international movement of capital.\"21\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n*Mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo al Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n* for Law 24,100/1992 **(Exhibit C-89).**\n\n30.\n\nIt is also interesting to note the *Mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo* with regard to other BITs entered into by Argentina. Although these statements do not directly concern the France-Argentina BIT at issue, they are nonetheless useful in ascertaining Argentina\u2019s general intentions as to the protection of foreign investments within its territory. In the context of the ratification of the BIT between Argentina and Italy, the Argentine *Poder Ejecutivo* stated the following:\n\n\"It should be assumed that, in the real world, the only way to establish and maintain an adequate international stream of capital is by setting and keeping clear, balanced, equitable, and institutionalized rules which are appealing for investors and, at the same time, compatible with the laws of the host country.\n\nBasically, foreign investors will no longer fear the instability of legal norms and economic policies, including the risk of a decrease in the value of their investments [...].\n\n[...]\n\nThe risks covered by this agreement are non-commercial, or political risks, that is to say, those with no relation to the commercial aspects of the operation, and which stem from the political and legal framework in which the investment is carried out.....\"22\n\n*Mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo al Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n* for Law 24,122/1992 **(Exhibit C-88).**\n\n31.\n\nThe *Poder Ejecutivo\u2019* s statement at the time of the ratification of Argentina\u2019s BIT with the UK is to the same effect.23\n\n*Mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo al Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n* for Law 24,184/1992 **(Exhibit C-87).**\n\n32.\n\nAs has been discussed, the France-Argentina BIT sets forth in its Preamble the importance of fostering the promotion and protection of foreign investments in the following terms: \"(Translation] Convinced that the promotion and protection of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their economic development\".24 Although the stability and predictability of the legal environment are not mentioned, tribunals faced with similar wording have nevertheless found that the principles of stability and predictability of the legal and business framework were inherent to the fair and equitable treatment standard.25\n\nSee para. 13, above and note 5.\n\nFor instance, the Teemed award, supra note 8, was based on the 1995 BIT between Spain and Mexico, which provided for fair and equitable treatment in the following terms:  \n\"Article 4(1): Each Contracting Party will guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment, according to International Law, for the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n33.\n\nAs discussed above, despite the fact that the Mexico-Spain BIT made no reference to the stability of the legal environment, the *Tecmed* tribunal came to the conclusion that the basic expectations taken into account by the foreign investor included the rules and regulations that will govern its investment.26\n\nSee para. 17, above, and *Tecmed,* supra note 8 at para. 154. This interpretation by the *Teemed* Tribunal has been cited with approval by a number of Tribunals, for example in the following cases: *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award 27 August 2008 *(\"Plama\")* at para. 176; *Siemens A.G. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award 6 February 2007 *(\"Siemens\")* at para. 299; *MID Equity Sdn.

This is the goal of such undertaking in light of the Agreement\u2019s preambular paragraphs which express the will and intention of the member States to \u2018...intensify economic cooperation for the benefit of both countries...\u2019 and the resolve of the member States, within such framework, \u2018...to create favourable conditions for investments made by each of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other...\u2019.\"27\n\n*Tecmed,* supra note 8 at para. 156. See also para. 167 *in fine.*\n\n35.\n\nThe tribunal in *Saluka* was also faced with a bilateral investment treaty that did not specifically refer to the stability of the host State\u2019s legal framework. In this context, the tribunal applied a balanced approach to the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT between The Netherlands and the Czech Republic and determined:\n\n\"Seen in this light, the [FET] standard prescribed in the Treaty should therefore be understood to be treatment which, if not proactively stimulating the inflow of foreign investment capital, does at least not deter foreign capital by providing disincentives to foreign investors. An investor\u2019s decision to make an investment is based on an assessment of the state of the law and the totality of the business environment at the time of the investment as well as on the investor\u2019s expectation that the conduct of the host State subsequent to the investment will be fair and equitable,\"28 [Emphasis added]\n\n*Saluka,* supra note 18 para. 301.\n\n36.\n\nThe *BG Group* v. *Argentina* case was determined pursuant to the UK-Argentina BIT, which, like the France-Argentina BIT, does not mention the objective of maintaining a stable framework for investment either in its Preamble29 or its fair and equitable treatment provision.30 In spite of the wording of the UK-Argentina BIT, the tribunal found that \"[t]he duties of the host State must be examined in the light of the legal and business framework as represented to the investor at the time that it decides to invest\"31 and that Argentina had violated the legal stability and predictability inherent to the fair and equitable treatment standard.32\n\nPreamble of the UK-Argentina BIT: \"The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina; Desiring to create favourable conditions for greater investment by investors of one State in the territory of the other State; Recognising that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international agreement of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of individual business initiative and will increase prosperity in both States; Have agreed as follows\".\n\nArticle 2(2) of the UK-Argentina BIT: \"Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection and constant security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n*BG Group Pic.* v. *Argentina,* Final Award, 24 December 2007 *(\"BG Group\")* at para. 298.\n\n*Id.* at para. 307.\n\n37.\n\nThus, in my view, the fair and equitable treatment standard under the France-Argentina BIT does not differ significantly from the standard applied by tribunals in the context of other bilateral investment treaties and, in particular, under the US-Argentina BIT and UK-Argentina BIT. As I explain in detail below, I believe that by totally destroying the regulatory framework that existed at the time Total made its investment, Argentina breached its obligation to treat Total fairly and equitably.\n\n38.\n\nThe situation is similar with respect to the power generation sector. As has been described by the majority, in the early 1990s, Argentina revamped its power generation and distribution sector in order to attract desperately needed private investment. The new system was designed to respect free-market rules and to create a spot market with a uniform tariff based on the economic cost of the system. Argentina created a wholesale electricity market (the \"MEM\"). In late 1991, Argentina passed Law 24,065 (the \"Electricity Law\"), which established the roles of each of the market participants, the State and its regulatory agencies.33 The system is described at length in the Majority Decision. To summarize, the spot price system was characterized by a uniform spot price paid to all dispatched producers based on the variable costs declared by the marginal producer (the highest cost dispatched generator); and a separate capacity payment and \"risk of failure\" payment, each fixed in US dollars, set by the Secretary of Energy and intended to encourage investment in the system; and generators were also free to negotiate sales contracts with other market participants on mutually agreed terms. The prices were set by market forces, cost-efficient producers were rewarded by larger margins and investment in the system was successfully encouraged. The term market allowed generators to sell the power they produced directly through contracts freely negotiated with other market participants. The Measures radically altered the operation of this detailed legislative framework and undermined the economic equilibrium upon which it was based and upon which Total relied when making its investments in this sector.\n\nSee, for example, Ex. C-709(w).\n\n39.\n\nWith respect to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, the nature of the promises is different. Total does not rely on a general legislative framework, but rather specific instruments that were renegotiated as Argentina\u2019s hydrocarbons sector evolved over the three decade span of Total\u2019s investments in this sector. As will be discussed in detail below, Total and its consortium members had a detailed agreement with the Government, which was confirmed by legislative decree.\n\n**IV. THE MEASURES**\n--------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe majority concludes that \"the abolition of the convertibility of pesos assets, value and tariffs, that were under the convertibility regime interchangeable with their expression in dollars (the dollar being in free circulation in Argentina, accounts being freely available in dollars, etc.), was within the competence of Argentina and not barred by the BIT clauses invoked by Total.\"34 With all due respect, I believe this misses the point entirely. I agree that Argentina, as a sovereign nation, has every right to change its laws in any way it sees fit. The BIT does not limit Argentina\u2019s sovereignty. Rather, its adoption reflects the exercise of Argentina\u2019s sovereignty. Argentina agreed to compensate investors when it acted in such a way as to deny investors fair and equitable treatment and that denial caused the investor to suffer damages. Total did not argue that Argentina did not have the competence to change its laws. Neither did Total argue that Argentina did not have the competence to abolish the convertibility of peso assets. Total did argue that all of Argentina\u2019s Measures, taken together, breached the duty to provide fair and equitable treatment to investors under the BIT. The majority finds that not only pesification generally, but also the pesification of tariffs required by legislation to be calculated in US dollars and adjusted in accordance with the US PPI, were not a breach of the BIT because pesification was a general measure and thus non-discriminatory.35\n\nSee paragraph 317 of the Majority Decision.\n\nSee paragraph 317 of the Majority Decision:  \n \"The Tribunal has also justified its conclusion why even tariffs specifically fixed in US dollars and periodic readjustments to be made based on a US price index (PPI) could be pesified in the circumstances without breaching the BIT. This is because of the serious reasons that forced Argentina to cut the peg of the peso with the dollar when the country was faced with a major economic, monetary and social crisis, entailing by the end of 2001 the loss of competitiveness, the capital flight, the loss of reserves, the de facto devaluation, etc. The Tribunal has found that the pesification affected all sectors of the economy and was carried out in a non discriminatory way.\"\n\n41.\n\nThe pesification may have been carried out in a non-discriminatory way, but it did have a profound effect on businesses operating in Argentina. All private law contracts, which previously had prices or terms expressed in US dollars, were automatically converted to pesos. This redenomination, when coupled with the subsequent conversion of those currency amounts at a 1:1 ratio had the effect of instantly reducing the amounts received under those contracts by about two-thirds. Then, in the energy sector, tariffs so reduced were legislated to stay that way, as Argentina froze the tariffs at the newly converted rates. It is the pesification coupled with freezing that Total argues amounted to a breach of its rights under the BIT. These Measures were taken at the outset of the economic crisis. The majority has found that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard did not occur until after the expiry of the first renegotiation period imposed by Argentina. I agree that the failure to review the tariffs as promised clearly amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. However, for the reasons just described, I believe that the initial pesification and freezing of tariffs was, from the outset, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and, accordingly, I would have found a breach as of 6 January 2002, the date of the Emergency Law. I think that it was legitimate for Total to expect that Argentina would adjust tariffs in accordance with the detailed legislative framework that existed for that purpose, either through regular or extraordinary tariff reviews and not to reduce the tariffs by two thirds and then freeze them indefinitely. I note that finding a breach of fair and equitable treatment at the time the Measures were taken is consistent with the vast majority of other tribunals that have considered the Measures and their impact on investors in the energy sector.36\n\n*BG Group, CMS, Enron, LG&E* and *Sempra,* all of which dealt with investments in gas transportation. I note that only the tribunal in *National Grid,* a case which dealt with the power generation sector, found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard as of June 25.2002 \"when the Respondent required that companies such as the Claimant renounce to the legal remedies they may have recourse as a condition to re-negotiate the Concession.\" See *National Grid* at para. 180. I note that a number of these decisions have been reviewed and some annulled by ICSID annulment committees. None of the criticisms contained in the recent annulment committee decisions are relevant to the analysis on this point.\n\n42.\n\nI note that this disagreement impacts my opinion with respect to the finding of a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in all three of the sectors in which Total maintains its claims: gas transportation, power generation and exploration and production. To the extent my reasoning is relevant, I will discuss it below in the context of each sector.\n\n**V. GAS TRANSPORTATION**\n-------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe majority has found that Total was not treated unfairly or unjustly as a result of the general measures (pesification, forced conversion at 1:1 and the freezing of tariffs) in part because the measures were of general application and in part because it found that Argentina did not make specific promises to Total, as Total did not purchase its shares of TGN directly from Argentina. With all due respect to my colleagues, I cannot agree with these findings,\n\n**A. The Timing of the Investments**\n------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nWhether or not Argentina breached the duty to afford fair and equitable treatment owed to Total depends on whether Total\u2019s legitimate expectations with respect to its investments were violated. The analysis of whether Total\u2019s expectations were legitimate must be carried out at the appropriate point in time, *i.e.,* at the time Total made its various investments.\n\n45.\n\nArgentina says that the context in which Total made its investments in the gas transportation sector was very different from the context in which investments were made in the early 1990s at the time of the privatization pursuant to State Reform Law No. 23,696 of 1989. Argentina says that Total invested much later in a context which could not reasonably give rise to the expectations upon which Total says it relied in making its investments. Argentina goes so far as to argue that \"[t]here is a 10-year distance and there exist huge differences between the facts stated by TOTAL\u2019S legal counsel and the real context of its investment. Nobody went to look for TOTAL for it to invest in Argentina. TOTAL took part in no *road shows* and did not invest in Argentina based on alleged promises.\"37 Argentina says that by the time Total made its investments in both the gas transportation and power generation sectors, there existed a desperate policy to save the Argentine economy and the country\u2019s economic and social situation was in a \"deep depression process\". In this regard, Argentina emphasized that in January and July 2000, TGN and the other Licensees had entered into agreements with the Government suspending the US PPI Adjustment of tariffs; in August 2000, following the initiation of the claim by the National Ombudsman, the courts issued an injunction suspending US PPI adjustments pending the final ruling by the court; in October 2000, Law No. 25,344, *Emergencia Economica Financiera,* which, *inter alia,* permitted the State to terminate public sector contracts and to consolidate its debts, had been adopted.38\n\nArgentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief (\"RPHB\"), unofficial English translation at para. 81\n\nSee RPHB, \u00b6\u00b668-86. \u00b6\u00b679-82 provide as follows:  \n 79. But TOTAL fails to make clear that such context was not the context in which such company made its investment neither in oil, which began in the height of the last Argentine military dictatorship, nor in gas and electricity. Indeed, with respect to these last two cases: (a) instead of a \"conscious policy of the Argentine Government to attract foreign investment\", there existed a desperate policy to save the economy; (b) instead of a State Reform Law implementing a \"massive privatization program\", there was an Economic Emergency Law authorizing the intervention of administrative contracts; (c) instead of the recent signature of 39 BITs, there were two Agreements and a preliminary injunction with effects with respect to natural gas transportation and distribution licenses, and an investor (CMS) who resorted to the ICSID; and (d) instead of a recent currency pegged to the US dollar pursuant to the Convertibility Law as a measure against hyperinflation, there was a currency heading for a mega-devaluation, and an economic and social situation that was described in an emergency law as a \"deep depression process\".  \n 80. All this took place before, and was the context in which, TOTAL made the investments in gas and electricity. Curiously, TOTAL, later, would claim damages for another emergency law.  \n 81. There is a 10-year distance and there exist huge differences between the facts stated by TOTAL\u2019S legal counsel and the real context of its investment. Nobody went to look for TOTAL for it to invest in Argentina. TOTAL took part in no *road shows* and did not invest in Argentina based on alleged promises.  \n82. If it decided to invest in a country undergoing a declared emergency state it must take responsibility for such action. This is not to insinuate that the Argentine Government is entitled to do anything or that private parties cannot object to certain measure, but it is clear that the expectations of an investor cannot be the same as in regular conditions.\n\n46.\n\nTotal says that it was properly entitled to rely on the commitments contained in the gas regulatory regime and the Electricity Law at the time it made its investments in the gas transportation and power generation sectors. The protection of investments under international law, and the BIT specifically, is not limited to investments made through the bidding processes immediately after privatizations but, rather, the protection carries over to the subsequent acquisition of those investments, the benefit of which continues to enure to Argentina. Total says that it was entitled to rely upon the stability of the legal and business framework in place at the time it invested in the gas regulatory framework in 2000 and that it could legitimately have expected that Argentina would apply the various provisions of the gas regulatory framework which had been put in place precisely to promote and protect investment from the effects of the economic and financial emergencies experienced by Argentina in the past. Total points to a number of other companies that made substantial investments in Argentina\u2019s privatized gas assets after the privatization process and says that, in light of the successful implementation and application of the gas regulatory framework over a period of eight years, it would have had greater expectations than those who invested at the time of privatization.39\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief (\"CPHB\"), \u00b6\u00b61377-380. With respect to the latter, Total refers to the following companies: Sempra made its initial investment in Argentine gas assets in 1996 and made additional investments in October 2000 and December 2001, all of which the tribunal in that case held to be \"investment decisions made in good faith\"; BG Group PLC made its initial investment at the time of privatization in 1992, but made additional investments in 1994 and 1998 increasing its stake in the relevant gas Licensee from 28.7% to 45.11%; CMS acquired its stake in TGN after privatization in 1995; LG&E made its initial investment in Argentine gas assets in 1997 and made additional investments in March 1999; Enron made its initial investment in TGS in 1992 and then increased its stake in 1996 and 1999.\n\n47.\n\nTotal also contests the suggestion made by Argentina that it invested in the midst of an economic crisis. Rather, Total says that it made its decision to invest when the economy was in a recessive cycle that had recuperated slightly. Further, Total says that it conducted appropriate due diligence and was aware of Argentina\u2019s history of economic instability. Total submits that as a long-term investor in the country, it was familiar with Argentina\u2019s history of economic instability and frequent devaluations as well as the cycles in capital intensive sectors like oil exploration, gas transportation and power generation. It says it reasonably and legitimately expected that Argentina would observe the basic principles of its gas regulatory framework which had been designed to address the macro economic risks inherent in an investment in Argentina.40 Further, Total says that a number of other investors, lenders and credit rating agencies continued to have faith in TGN during the recession which commenced in 1998 and at the time that Total made its investment in TGN. Total says that it had no expectation that the Government of Argentina would unilaterally terminate and dismantle the gas regulatory regime, including the guiding principles of the Gas Law as implemented in the Gas Decree and TGN\u2019s license as well as the other elements of the gas regulatory regime.41\n\nCPHB, \u00ab382-385.\n\nSee CPHB, \u00b6387.\n\n**B. Due Diligence**\n--------------------\n\n48.\n\nArgentina also says that Total did not conduct an adequate due diligence enquiry or economic analysis before investing in TGN. Argentina says that if Total had done so, it would have foreseen the crisis that occurred in December 2001 and the adoption of emergency measures as a consequence of that crisis.42\n\nSee RPHB, \u00b6\u00b685, 202-228, 289-313. According to Argentina, what happened with the adoption of the Emergency Law of January 2002 was the same as what had occurred in the past in each case of the declaration of a national state of emergency; see \u00b685.\n\n49.\n\nTotal\u2019s first opportunity to invest in TGN arose in October 1998 when the Argentine company SCP, through its subsidiary Compania General de Combustibles (\"CGC\"), offered for sale a number of its investments in various assets, including its indirect 19.2% stake in TGN (through its 27.2% holding in Gasinvest). At the time, Total had been an investor in Argentina since 1978 when it became the first foreign oil and gas company to invest in the country. In light of its investment in oil and gas production in Argentina, Total submitted that it considered it important to invest in the gas transportation system connecting its production with its customers. Consistent with this, Total made its first investment in gas transportation in June 1998 by purchasing a 10% stake in the GasAndes pipeline. Based on these previous investments, Total had some knowledge of the general regulatory framework applicable to the gas industry and certain aspects of the gas transportation sector. Nevertheless, when the opportunity to invest in TGN first arose in October 1998, Total conducted what it refers to as an \"in-depth analysis of the regulatory framework applicable to TGN and the gas transportation sector in Argentina\".43 In addition to its own internal resources, Total was assisted by a number of external advisors, including US and Argentine legal counsel, financial advisors and accountants.44 A number of the due diligence reports and memoranda prepared during the due diligence exercise were entered in evidence. These were substantial.45 In addition, Total reviewed and discussed the various due diligence reports it received with its advisors who had authored them. Total concluded that TGN was a profitable company which guaranteed, statutorily and contractually, a long-term, stable and predictable US dollar based revenue stream, adjustable in accordance with US PPI and sufficient to provide the company with a reasonable rate of return. Total valued the 19.2% stake in TGN being offered by SCP at USD 207 million.46\n\nSee Charpentier, WS1,\u00b627. For a description of the due diligence process undertaken by Total, more generally, see Charpentier, WS1,\u00b6\u00b626-80.\n\nProskauer Rose LLP in New York; P\u00e8res Alati Grondona Benits Arntsen & Martinez de Hoz (PAGBAM) in Buenos Aires; investment banks (Chase Manhattan and JP Morgan); and accountants (Arthur Andersen).\n\nSee CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6369-370 and the various sources cited there, including PAGBAM due diligence and financial reports at Ex. C-346, C-347, C361, C-362, C-363, C-348 and C-l 14.\n\nSee Charpentier, WS 1,\u00b647.\n\n50.\n\nUltimately, Total\u2019s efforts to purchase part of CGC\u2019s investment in TGN through Gasinvest did not succeed. In or about December 1999, Total learned that TCPL (which had merged with Nova in June 1998) was interested in selling its stake in TGN along with a number of other assets. Total entered into negotiations with TCPL for the acquisition of the assets which were of interest to it. Total again engaged a team of legal and financial advisors to conduct a due diligence review and carry out a new valuation of TGN. In light of the recent due diligence and valuation undertaken in respect of the potential purchase of CGC\u2019s share in TGN, the due diligence exercise was more limited in nature.47 Total\u2019s new valuation of the 19.23% stake in TGN was approximately USD 230 million.48 Total made an initial offer for all of TCPL\u2019s assets in the southern cone of South America in March 2000. That offer was rejected and negotiations continued on the basis of a more limited number of assets in respect of which Total presented a formal offer on 21 April 2000. On 30 May 2000, Total and TCPL signed a binding Share Purchase Agreement.49\n\nThe initial due diligence reports were updated in the following exhibits: C-359, C-360, C-361. C-362, and C-363.\n\nCharpentier, WS 1,\u00b670.\n\nSee Ex. C-55.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Total, only one relevant development had occurred in respect of the key provisions of the gas regulatory framework between the completion of its first due diligence exercise conducted in 1998 and the signature of the Share Purchase Agreement with TCPL. On 6 January 2000, ENARGAS and the gas transportation and distribution licensees signed an agreement in which the latter agreed to defer the US PPI adjustment of their tariffs for a period of six months from 1 January to 30 June 2000 (the \"January Agreement\").50 Total was aware of this agreement and took it into account in its due diligence and valuation of TGN. Total says that the agreement was the result of an unusual increase in the US PPI as compared to the local price index in the context of a recession in Argentina.51 Total notes that the January Agreement expressly stated that the deferral would be made on an \"exceptional and once only\" basis and was to be recovered six months later with interest. Further, the deferral was stated to constitute neither a precedent nor an amendment to the gas regulatory framework and provided that the licensees would be indemnified for all losses resulting from the deferral. In their negotiations, TCPL and TGN agreed that the relevant share of TGN\u2019s profits from 1 January 2000 until the date of closing a year later would be split between them. As a result, the six month deferral of the US PPI adjustment would have only a limited impact on Total. In light of the foregoing, Total says that it did not take the six month deferral of the US PPI pursuant to the January Agreement into consideration in its valuation of TGN in April 2000.52\n\n*Acta Acuerdo* of 6 July 2000: Ex. C-119. The *Acta Acuerdo* reads, in relevant part, as follows:  \n 2. That in accordance with said purpose, under the integrity guarantee of the applicable legal framework and the granted licenses, and in compliance with the commitments and agreements in force executed in the context of Gas del Estado privatization, the Secretariat of Energy of the Nation has shown concern for the current economic situation and the need to provide solutions in keeping with the economic plan designed by the national authorities, without this preventing compliance with the applicable legal framework.  \n 3. That to these aims, during the meeting of December 22, 1999, the Secretary of Energy deemed it convenient to invite the Concessionaires to reconsider on a temporary basis the application of the PPI-based adjustments prescribed for in art. 41 of law 24,076 and paragraph 9.4.1.1 of the Basic Rules of the Licenses, from January 1 and June 30, 2000, thus deferring their application until July 1, 2000, as an exception, with the consent of the Parties and without this modifying the applicable legal framework.  \n 4. Moreover, the representatives of the Licensees, aware of the social needs emerging from the economic general situation of the country, wish to make clear that this situation is not foreign to their own economic situation and outcome; therefore, it is of utmost importance for them that privatization public policies remain in full force,  \n 5. That this, as accepted by the Licensees, should not impact negatively on the economic or financial integrity of their income, and should hold them harmless from any resulting loss, with the express acknowledgment by the authorities that this will not entail grounds for amendment or effective amendment to the applicable legal framework.  \n**THEREFORE**  \n**THE PARTIES AGREE**  \n 1. Licensees hereby agree to suspend, on an exceptional and one-time basis, the application of the PPI adjustment during the deferral period and under the conditions prescribed for in recitals 3.4,5 and 8 herein, and to set for full recovery of the suspended adjustments the period spanning from July 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001.\n\nIn this regard, see CPHB, \u00b6\u00b6354-357, and the Table of Comparative Price Indices at \u00b6354.\n\nCharpentier, WS1, \u00b6\u00b657-58.\n\n52.\n\nThe Share Purchase Agreement between Total and TCPL provided that Closing was required to occur on or before 28 February 2001.53 In fact, Closing occurred on 6 January 2001. However, in the meantime and after execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, a number of further developments regarding the US PPI adjustment of TGN\u2019s tariffs occurred.\n\nEx. C-55,\u00b67.1(b).\n\n53.\n\nOn 17 July 2000, the Ministry of Economy and ENARGAS signed an agreement with the licensees for the transportation and distribution of natural gas (the \"July Agreement\") to defer the US PPI adjustment of tariffs from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2002.54 The July Agreement also provided for the application of the US PPI adjustment that had been deferred pursuant to the January Agreement by requiring ENARGAS to incorporate the deferred PPI adjustments into the tariff tables as of 1 July 2000. As in the case of the January Agreement, the deferral was stated to be without precedent and did not modify the rules provided for in the regulatory regime. In addition, the agreement provided for the implementation of two tariff increases in July and October 2000, the proceeds of which would be paid into a US PPI stabilization fund where they would accrue interest during the two year deferral period. The proceeds from the suspended tariff increases were to be paid out to the licensees commencing in July 2002 and additional US PPI adjustments occurring in the interim were to be factored into the adjusted tariffs as of that date.55 The July Agreement was approved by Decree 669/2000.56\n\nSee Ex. C-54, Annexo I - Acta.\n\nSee Ex. C-54, Annexo II. Article 4 of the agreement provided that the Parties recognized that the deferral of payment of the US PPI adjustments provided for in the basic rules of the relevant licenses required the consent of the Licensees pursuant to Article 41 of the Gas Law (Law 24,076) and, consequently, approval by the Executive in its capacity as grantor of the licenses was required.\n\nEx. C-54. Decree 669/2000 reads in relevant part as follows:  \n CONSIDERING:  \n That the rationale of the Legal Gas Framework consists of, *inter alia,* encouraging investments securing long-term natural gas supply, which require legal certainty and guarantee of compliance with the commitments undertaken by the national State in the context of GAS DEL ESTADO SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO privatization. In particular, the Agreement of January 6, 2000, entered into by the ENTE NACIONAL REGULADOR DEL GAS, an autarchic body of the SECRETARIAT OF ENERGY OF THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY and the Licensees and any prospective subscribing party, in relation to the regime securing the collection of tariffs for the public services of Natural Gas Transportation and Distribution (regarding Articles 38 and 39 of Law 24,075).  \n That the privatization process and the investments resulting therefrom are protected by the applicable rules and, in particular, by the Treaties concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments executed by the ARGENTINE REPUBLIC and ratified by several laws.  \n That Article 41 of Law 24,076 and the Basic Rules of the Gas Transportation and Distribution Licenses under Decree No. 2255 of December 2. 1992, ANNEXES A and B, SUB-ANNEXES 1: BASIC RULES, provide for a semi-annual adjustment of the Tariffs by application of the fluctuation of the Producer Price Index - Industrial Commodities (PPI) of the United States of America.  \n That such adjustment system is the fundamental condition of the bidding rules and the winning bids, and therefore, it must be considered a legitimately acquired right of the Licensees.  \n That in this sense, the application of international market indicators has been enshrined to reflect any \"changes in assets and services value representing suppliers' activities.\"  \n That, furthermore, the country is facing a deep economic-financial crisis as a result of the lack of resources, public debt enlargement and wide-spread recession affecting a many sectors of the population, which is being overcome progressively.  \n That this economic-financial situation calls for exceptional instant measures to reduce the negative impact that an increase in tariffs would cause on the society as a whole, as well as the need to make said measures compatible with the commitments undertaken by the National State.  \n That the NATIONAL EXECUTIVE POWER is currently analyzing the situation and adopting measures that would help overcome the crisis.  \nThat, for this reason and in order to fully acknowledge the gravity of the crisis, it is imperative that the National State and the gas Licenses, with the sole specific purpose of mitigating the economic impact of international market indications on the natural gas tariffs paid by consumers, accept the measures aiming at preventing an excessively harmful economic effect on the population in general and the industrial sector in particular.  \n THE PRESIDENT OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC DECREES:  \n Article 1\u00b0: The application of the adjustment provided for in paragraphs 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.4 of the Basic Rules of the Transportation and Distribution License is hereby deferred from July 1.2000, through June 30.2002.  \n Article 2\u00b0: The adjustment system based on the Producer Price Index, Industrial Commodities (PPI), provided for in article 41 of Law 24,076, its rules and paragraphs 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.4 of the Basic Rules of the Gas Transportation and Distribution Licenses, in force on January 1, 2000, be applied on a deferred basis on July 1, 2000, under the terms and conditions prescribed in Annexes I and II hereof, which are hereby approved.\n\n54.\n\nOn 18 August 2000, a federal judge issued an order suspending the adjustment of gas transportation and distribution tariffs. This order was issued as an interim measure pending the court\u2019s decision on a claim brought by the National Ombudsman against the National Executive Power and ENARGAS for a declaration that Articles 41 and 96 of the Gas Law (Law 24,076) were unconstitutional inasmuch as they permitted the indexation of gas tariffs. The claim also requested a declaration that Decrees 1738/92 and 2255/92 were unconstitutional and that Decree 669/00, which approved the July Agreement, was null,57 The court\u2019s interim order prohibited increases to transportation and distribution tariffs and suspended the application of Decree 669/00 pending a final decision on the claim. As a result of the court\u2019s order, ENARGAS ordered TGN to maintain the tariff rate approved for May 2000,58 TGN then appealed against ENARGAS\u2019s Note 3480/2000.59 On 22 September 2000, ENARGAS, the Ministry of Economy and the Attorney-General submitted an appeal of the Federal Court\u2019s interim injunction.60 According to Total\u2019s witnesses, TGN believed that the suspension of the US PPI tariff adjustments was only temporary and that the court\u2019s decision was based on weak legal grounds, particularly in light of the fact that ENARGAS, the Ministry of Economy and the Attorney-General of Argentina had all filed the appeal against the interim measure.61\n\nSee Ex. C-l22.\n\nSee ENARGAS Note 3840/2000, dated 30 August 2000. This excluded the application of the US PPI tariff adjustment due in January 2000 and July 2000. See Charpentier, WS1, \u00b678.\n\nSee Ex. C-l24, dated 13 September 2000.\n\nSee Ex. C-125. In their extensive appeal submissions, the Government parties alleged a number of basic procedural defects and substantive grounds.\n\nSee Charpentier, WS1, \u00b6 178: WS2,131. As a result, Total did not consider that the interim injunction impacted its valuation of TGN or the completion of the sale. In addition, Total says that it was not significant enough to permit Total to terminate or to modify the binding shareholders\u2019 agreement it had signed with TCPL on 30 May 2000. See, Charpentier, WS2. \u00b647. In addressing this submission, the majority, notwithstanding the clear wording of the January Agreement and July Agreement and the Government\u2019s subsequent defence thereof before the courts, says that \"[e]xpecting that after a 2-year block the government would have been willing and able to impose to the *usuarios* to pay retroactively the PPI increase for that period appears contrary to common sense or experience.\" See Majority Decision at para. 156.\n\n55.\n\nIn October 2001, the Appeals Court rejected the Government parties\u2019 appeal against the interim injunction. A further appeal was submitted to the Argentine Supreme Court. That appeal was still pending when the Emergency Law was adopted in January 2002.\n\n56.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal emphasizes the fact that immediately after the court declared that the July Agreement was null, CMS, a shareholder in TGN, sent a trigger letter to the Argentine government notifying its intention to commence ICSID arbitration under the US-Argentina BIT as a result of the court\u2019s decision suspending US PPI adjustments.62 I do not attach the same import to this fact. The fact that an existing investor in the gas transportation sector (subjectively) considered that the adjustments of US PPI suspensions were themselves a violation of its rights under an investment treaty does not mean that it was objectively unreasonable or illegitimate to expect that Argentina would abide by the January Agreement and the July Agreement. In those agreements and the related decrees, Argentina reconfirmed the licensee\u2019s rights to the US PPI adjustments under the existing legislative framework and ENARGAS and the State defended those agreements before the national courts. It is difficult to understand how either CMS\u2019s stance on Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations (i.e., that even a delay in payment of US PPI adjustments was a treaty violation) or the January and July Agreements themselves can be interpreted as a harbinger of the complete demise of the legislative framework in the energy sector. As indicated by the majority, and as set out above, Argentina has argued that Total should have foreseen the economic crisis and, accordingly, could not have legitimately expected the existing legal framework to survive. Argentina says the following with respect to the context in which Total made its later investments in the gas transportation and power generation sectors:\n\n... (a) instead of \"a conscious policy of the Argentine Government to attract foreign investments,\" there existed a desperate policy to save the economy; (b) instead of a State Reform Law implementing a \"massive privatization program,\" there was an Economic Emergency Law authorizing the intervention of administrative contracts; (c) instead of the recent signature of 39 BITs, there were two Agreements and a preliminary injunction with effects with respect to natural gas transportation and distribution licences, and an investor (CMS) who resorted to the ICSID; and (d) instead of a recent currency pegged to the US dollar pursuant to the Convertibility Law as a measure against hyperinflation, there was a currency heading for a mega-devaluation, and an economic and social situation that was described in an emergency law as a \"deep depression process.\"63\n\nSee paras. 66 and 155 of the Majority Decision.\n\nRPHB at para. 79.\n\n57.\n\nThis characterization is strongly dependent on hindsight and is inconsistent with what the Argentine Government was telling Total, other investors and the public at the time.\n\n58.\n\nIn my view, by accepting this argument, the majority has attributed to the foreign investor a higher level of foresight with respect to the Argentine economy and political reaction thereto than Argentina, itself, possessed at the time. While I agree that the appropriate time at which to assess Total\u2019s legitimate expectations was the time at which it made its various investments and that the circumstances at that time should be considered in assessing those expectations, I do not think that it is appropriate to confer on the investor a requirement to be prescient. In essence, Total submits that its expectations with respect to its investments in the gas transportation and power generation sectors were that the regulatory regimes would continue to reflect the government\u2019s commitment to economic equilibrium, which had, over the previous decade, led to massive foreign investment in Argentine energy infrastructure, modernization and improvement of Argentina\u2019s energy sectors, and some of the lowest energy prices for consumers as a result of the competition in the market. Total had been an investor in Argentina for over 20 years when it decided to make its further investments in the gas transportation and power generation sectors. It had weathered numerous economic crises in that time. However, in the decade leading up to its additional investments, Argentina\u2019s economy had performed remarkably well. It was no coincidence that this positive performance followed privatization and a commitment to free market principles in the energy sector.\n\n59.\n\nThe legislative and regulatory framework set up at the time of privatization was designed to provide flexibility, survive downturns in the economy and maintain the economic equilibrium of the system. Economic equilibrium by definition is not meant to benefit investors alone. The system was designed to allow investors to recover their costs and achieve a reasonable rate of return on those investments while providing energy at reasonable tariffs to consumers. It may not have been legitimate for an investor to expect that the rate of return on its investments would remain the same or that the government would allow tariffs to reach disproportionately high levels to the detriment of consumers and to the benefit of investors. However, this is not what Total expected, nor is it what it has argued here. In my opinion, at the time Total made its investments it was reasonable and legitimate to expect the government to continue its commitment to the economic equilibrium of the system that it had created and that had been so successful for almost a decade. It was also reasonable and legitimate for Total to expect that the government would set tariffs at levels that would permit it to earn a reasonable rate of return and would not force investors to operate their investments at a loss over a period of a number of years. In my view, Total was entitled to rely on the promises made by Argentina through its privatization programme; the related, supportive, transparent legislative framework; consistently worded licenses; the network of bilateral investment treaties; and almost a decade of consistent practice and successful results. Finally, it was legitimate for Total to expect that Argentina would not completely dismantle this system at the expense of investors alone.\n\n60.\n\nI agree that a bilateral investment treaty should not provide insurance for bad business decisions. However, I have been persuaded by the evidence presented that Total performed thorough and reasonable due diligence before deciding to invest more of its shareholders\u2019 money in Argentina and that, in doing so it relied, legitimately, on the Gas Regulatory Framework, including US dollar tariffs and US PPI adjustments, as established by Argentina. The evidence was clear that Total\u2019s losses were not caused by commercial problems; they were caused by changes to the regulatory framework.\n\n61.\n\nIn *LG&E* v. *Argentina,* the Tribunal found that:\n\n... it was unfair and inequitable to pass a law discarding the guarantee in Decree No. 1738/92 that the tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars and then converted into pesos. As pointed out by Claimants, this was not merely an economic and monetary policy of the Argentine Government which materialized through the Convertibility Law, Rather, it was a guarantee laid down in the tariff system. This guarantee was very important to investors to protect their investment, which was made in dollars, from a subsequent devaluation of the peso.64\n\n*LG&E,* supra note 15 at para. 134.\n\n62.\n\nWith respect to Argentina\u2019s actions in eliminating the right to calculate tariffs in US dollars, the *Sempra* tribunal made the following findings:\n\nIf the Gas Law, Gas Decree and Basic Rules of the License all unequivocally refer to the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, and if such feature was also explained in the same terms by the Information Memorandum, there cannot be any doubt that this is the central feature governing the tariff regime.\n\nGiven the emphasis that this regulatory framework placed on the stability of the tariff structure, it is not surprising that the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, as well as the PPI adjustment, were assigned a significant role therein. While the possibility of devaluation intervening at some time was not ignored, it was hardly addressed from the viewpoint of stability being the principal aim or, as will be explained, from that of the problem being corrected by means of the automatic adjustment of tariffs to the new exchange rate level.\n\nThe Respondent has devoted particular attention to the link which it alleges exists between these clauses and the Convertibility Law.... The Gas Law indeed made a link to the first aspect by referring to pesos convertible under the Convertibility Law. The reference of the License to a given parity established under the convertibility decree was more qualified, however. In fact, Clause 9.2 of the License takes into account the fact that the parity and the ratio could be amended in future, as it expressly refers to the eventual modifications of convertibility through Decree 2128/91. [...] The distinction drawn by [Argentina] between the modification of the convertibility regime and its abandonment is unpersuasive. Guarantees and stabilization are meant to operate specifically when problems arise, not when business continues as usual. The tariff regime approved was devised as a permanent feature of the privatization, not a transitory one.\"65\n\n*Sempra* supra note 15 at paras. 141-151.\n\n63.\n\nThe *LG&E* tribunal also found that:\n\n\"Argentina acted unfairly and inequitably when it prematurely abandoned the PPI tariff adjustments and essentially froze tariffs prior to the onset of the public disorder and threats to its essential security in December 2001, and when it refused to resume adjustments when conditions had normalized in April 2003, forcing instead the licensees to renegotiate.\"66\n\n*LG&E* supra note 15 at para. 136. Note that the LG&E tribunal found that there was a period of necessity between 1 December 2001 and 26 April 2003 and exempted Argentina for damages suffered during that period.\n\n64.\n\nAs already discussed above, I agree that an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations need to be assessed at the time of the investment. For Total, with respect to its investment in TGN, the relevant time is 2000. Total agreed to purchase TCPL\u2019s shares in May 2000. At that time, the Gas Law had been effectively regulating gas distribution for almost a decade. Also at that time, the Government had agreed with the distributors that the US PPI adjustments would be deferred (the January Agreement). Six months later, the Government and the distributors agreed to a further deferral (the July Agreement). In both cases, the deferred amounts were to be repaid with interest. Argentina submits and the majority accepts that, as a result of the January Agreement and the July Agreement, Total should have known that Argentina was on the brink of a financial crisis and that it was therefore not legitimate for Total to expect the gas regulatory regime to remain intact. I do not agree with this assessment of the facts. In January 2000, the Government demonstrated its commitment to the gas regulatory regime by negotiating (as provided in the license) with the gas distributors a suspension of the US PPI adjustment in response to the recessionary environment in Argentina. Six months later, they renegotiated that suspension. There was no indication at the time that the Government intended to dismantle the entire system. In fact, when the US PPI adjustments were challenged, the Government defended in the courts the adjustments as rights granted to the investors. In my opinion, it is inappropriate for Argentina to now argue that Total should have known that Argentina would renege on all of its promises.\n\n**VI. POWER GENERATION**\n------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Majority Decision has already set out in detail Total\u2019s holdings in the power generation sector in Argentina. Total\u2019s investments in this sector were ownership interests in two major power generation companies: Central Puerto S.A. (\"Central Puerto\") and Hidroelectrica Piedra de Aguila S.A. (\"HPDA\"). Total made its investments in 2001.67 Total sold these investments in 2006,68 at which time there had been no meaningful negotiations with the regulator regarding the changes to the system made as a result of the Measures in 2002.69\n\nCPHB at para. 835.\n\nCPHB at para. 98.\n\nTotal\u2019s Reply at para. 687.\n\n66.\n\nAs a result of the Measures, the capacity and risk of failure payments were pesified and the spot price was no longer set based on market principles, was no longer uniform and was capped. Further, power generators were not paid even the artificial, reduced rates and were required to convert their receivables into further investment through FONINVEMEM.\n\n67.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal, reiterating its findings with respect to the Measures generally, rejects Total\u2019s claims with respect to the pesification of the capacity and risk of failure payments. For the reasons expressed above, I do consider pesification and freezing of tariffs to be a breach of the duty to afford fair and equitable treatment, as I consider it legitimate for Total to have expected Argentina to maintain the basic economic equilibrium of the power generation regulatory system upon which Total relied when it decided to make its investment.\n\n68.\n\nFurther, the majority expresses the view that Total\u2019s decision to invest in the power generation sector in September 2001 was imprudent, as Total should have taken into account the possibility of an abandonment of the fixed parity with the US dollar.70 As discussed above with respect to the timing of Total\u2019s investments in the gas transportation sector, I think that this subjective requirement imposed by the majority requires greater foresight by a foreign investor than the Argentine government itself had at the time. Even if the abandonment of the link of the US dollar was a possibility, Argentina did more than just abandon the link - it redenominated contracts that were in US dollars through a forced conversion at the abandoned former linked rate and then froze tariffs and payments such that they could not be adjusted through the operation of market forces to economically viable levels. The Majority Decision recognizes this to some extent when it says that \"the pricing system that the SoE progressively put in place after 2002 is at odds with the principles spelled out in the Electricity Law\"71 before it goes on to find that the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism was a breach of the duty to afford fair and equitable treatment. I agree that the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism was a breach of this duty. However, I would also have found a breach of this duty as a result of the decision to pesify the capacity and risk of failure payments.\n\nSee Majority Decision at para. 324.\n\nSee Majority Decision at para. 328.\n\n69.\n\nI agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning and conclusions with respect to the non-payment of receivables and the forced participation in the FONINVEMEM scheme.\n\n**VII. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF HYDROCARBONS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Concession Decree**\n----------------------------\n\n70.\n\nTotal\u2019s investments in this sector, the Measures taken by Argentina and their alleged impact on Total\u2019s investment are set out in detail in the Majority Decision72 and will not he repeated here. Unlike Total\u2019s investments in gas transportation and power generation, Total\u2019s investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons were made early (commencing in 1978) and involved specific and detailed agreements between Total and Argentina. In particular, Argentina had negotiated with Total for the conversion of its \"take or pay\" contract with YPF to a separate exploitation permit and concession, according to which Total had the ownership, and the right to freely dispose, of the hydrocarbons that it produced. This agreement is found in the Concession Decree, which incorporates the terms of the *Acta Acuerdo* agreed between Total and Argentina. The Majority Decision describes this history, but goes on to find that the ownership and free disposition rights granted to Total were limited by other laws and decrees, such that Argentina could, in essence, dictate how, to whom and for what price Total must sell the hydrocarbons that it produced.73\n\nSee Majority Decision at paras. 347 - 405.\n\nSee Majority Decision at para. 427.\n\n71.\n\nThe majority\u2019s analysis starts with the clear language contained in the Concession Decree that Total holds \" *property and free disposition\"* of the hydrocarbons it produced *\"under the provisions of* [the **Hydrocarbons Law** and the Deregulation Decrees]\". It then looks at the requirements in Article 6 of Decree No. 1589/1989 that the Executive must give 12 months\u2019 notice of projected restrictions on crude oil exports prior to their coming into force and that, in such cases, the Executive may fix the crude oil price in a certain manner unless international crude oil prices, due to exceptional circumstances, are exceptionally high. The Majority Decision then goes on to conclude that because the general **Hydrocarbons Law** of 1967 gave the Executive the right to regulate prices and exports in the event of a domestic shortage of crude oil, \"Total\u2019s right freely to dispose of petroleum does not entail the right freely to fix its prices or to export it without limitations.\"74\n\nMajority Decision at para. 427.\n\n72.\n\nWith all due respect, I cannot agree with this interpretation of what, in my opinion, is very clear language in the Concession Decree. In my view, the majority\u2019s interpretation also expands Argentina\u2019s limited rights under the various general decrees by not analysing whether the conditions precedent to Argentina\u2019s ability to limit Total\u2019s rights of free disposition were met in this case. It must be remembered that the Concession Decree was negotiated to replace the \"take or pay\" contract that Total had with the State-owned energy company. Under the \"take or pay\" contract, Total did not have the right to freely dispose of the hydrocarbons it produced - it had to sell all of them to YPF who, in turn, was obligated to purchase all of them at abovemarket prices.75 The Concession Decree changed this situation. It also sought to preserve the security of supply for the domestic market in exceptional circumstances by incorporating earlier, general regulatory decrees. There was no evidence that these exceptional circumstances existed in this case. In fact, there was evidence that there were no restrictions on exports of crude oil until May 2002, when short-term restrictions were introduced, which occurred again in December 2004.76 So, while I agree that the Executive had some ability to limit Total\u2019s rights of free disposition to protect the domestic supply of hydrocarbons (and, only then, if appropriate compensation was paid to Total), I do not agree that these limitations generally impaired Total\u2019s right to freely fix its prices or to decide whether to sell its products domestically or to export them. Total was granted ownership and the right to freely dispose of the hydrocarbons that it produced.77 The majority\u2019s interpretation of this clause deprives it of virtually all meaning. What does \"ownership and the right to freely dispose\" mean if not the right to sell its products to whomever it chose at whatever price could be freely negotiated?\n\nContract 19,944 dated 24 April 1979 at Ex. C-63(1); also see Contie WS2 at paras. 7 - 17.\n\nDirect examination of Yves Grosjean, Transcript, (English) Day 3, 897:7 - 15.\n\n*\"el dominio y la libre disponibilidad\".*\n\n**B. The Hydrocarbons Law**\n---------------------------\n\n73.\n\nIn my view, the proper interpretation of Total\u2019s rights and legitimate expectations with respect to its investment in the exploration and production sector requires a review of the history of that investment and the context in which it was made and, at the insistence of Argentina, modified.\n\n74.\n\nWhen Total made its initial investment in 1978, the *Hydrocarbons Law* was in place. It constituted the basic legal framework applicable to the production, industrialization, transport and commercialization of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, which were to be provided by State enterprises and private entities pursuant to the provisions of the law and future regulations adopted by the National Executive power. Pursuant to the terms of the law, its principal purpose was stated to be to meet the country\u2019s need for hydrocarbons with the production from its own deposits and maintaining reserves to ensure that goal *(\"satisfacer las necesidades de hidrocarburos del pa\u00eds con el producido de sus yacimientos, manteniendo reservas que aseguren esa finalidad\").* Article 11 of the Law provided that State companies would be key actors in the achievement of those goals. It also provided that, in the future, the National Executive could assign new areas to those State corporations which would be entitled to exploit them directly or by way of contracts with private entities. Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law,* quoted in the Majority Decision, provided that permit holders and concessionaires had ownership *(\"el dominio\")* of the hydrocarbons which they extracted and, consequently, that they could transport, sell and industrialize them pursuant to the regulations adopted by the National Executive on reasonable technical-economical bases which addressed the needs of the internal market and stimulated exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Article 6 also provided that when national production of liquid hydrocarbons was not sufficient to cover internal needs it would be mandatory for all such hydrocarbons of national origin to be used in the country, except where legitimate technical reasons made this unadvisable.\n\n75.\n\nArticle 6 goes on to provide that if in the said period (during which national production did not meet internal needs), the Executive set the sale prices for crude petroleum products in the internal market, such prices were required to be equal to those established for the relevant State company, and, in any event, could not be less than the prices for imported petroleum of similar condition. In the event that the price of imported petroleum increased significantly due to exceptional circumstances, those prices were not to be considered for the setting of sale prices in the internal market. Rather, the latter could be set on the basis of the actual cost of production of the State company, the technically applicable depreciation rate and a reasonable rate of return on the investments made by the said State entity. Any prices fixed for sub-products were required to be compatible with those set for petroleum.\n\n76.\n\nWith respect to the export of hydrocarbons, the Executive was required to permit export of hydrocarbons or derivatives not required to adequately meet internal needs, provided that such exports were carried out at reasonable commercial prices. Further, the Executive was empowered to set rules for the internal market in order to ensure rational and equitable access to it by all producers in the country.\n\n77.\n\nThe *Hydrocarbons Law* was adopted well before the privatization of the State enterprises (YPF and Gas del Estado) which dominated the sector. In summary, the Law\u2019s primary objective was to ensure that the internal need for hydrocarbons was met by production from deposits within Argentina and that adequate reserves were assured. Hydrocarbons not required to meet internal needs were expressly permitted to be exported provided that exports were at reasonable commercial prices. With respect to liquid hydrocarbons (crude petroleum), in the event that national production was insufficient to cover internal needs and the National Executive decided to set sale prices in the internal market, the law provided that those prices would be the same as those set for the relevant State entity and, in any event, could not be less than the prices for comparable imported petroleum. An alternative method of setting prices was provided for in the case of \"exceptional circumstances\".\n\n78.\n\nWith respect to natural gas *(\"hidrocarburos gaseosos\"),* the law provided a preferential right for the use of gas by, first, production facilities and, second, the State entity responsible for public distribution of gas subject to purchase within a reasonable time frame and at agreed prices which assured a reasonable rate of return on the relevant investment. With the approval of the relevant authority, any remaining gas could be disposed of freely by the Concessionaire. Finally, Article 6 provided that the sale and distribution of gaseous hydrocarbons would be subject to the regulations adopted by the National Executive.\n\n79.\n\nAs indicated above, Decree 1212/89 called for the renegotiation of existing contracts between foreign investors and YPF. Pursuant to the terms of the decree, YPF was required to negotiate the conversion of existing service contracts to the concession system provided for in the *Hydrocarbons Law.* In its preamble, Decree 1212/89 provided that there was a need to do the following: substitute for State intervention free market mechanisms and free disposition of crude petroleum and its derivatives; permit prices for hydrocarbon products of national origin to reflect international prices; and permit the free sale of crude petroleum and its derivatives.78\n\nThese principles were set out in the provisions of the decree quoted in the Majority Decision at paragraph 352.\n\n80.\n\nDecree 1212/89 referred to Decree 1055/89, which had been adopted one month previously (12 October 1989). That decree stated that it was the objective of the national Government to replace State intervention in the setting of prices, margins and quotas with market mechanisms and the free play of offer and demand. It also stated that, with respect to hydrocarbons, it was the Government\u2019s policy to deregulate the sector to permit effective and free competition as quickly as possible in order to reflect international values and that, therefore, it was necessary to permit the free disposition of hydrocarbons both in the internal market and the export market. The decree also recited that the National Executive was authorized to undertake and implement these policies pursuant to specific provisions of the *Hydrocarbons Law.* The decree then went on to require YPF to assemble information with respect to certain areas and deposits for the purpose of organizing a public tender for the rights to explore and exploit hydrocarbons in these areas. Further, the decree provided, in general terms, that hydrocarbons produced from concessions would benefit from a full right of free disposition. This was defined to mean that the products could be sold freely in the internal and the external markets, within the terms of the applicable legal framework.79\n\nThe relevant provisions are quoted in the Majority Decision at paragraph 353.\n\n81.\n\nThe third of the Deregulation Decrees, Decree 1589/89, in its preamble, noted the interest of the Government in establishing clear and definite rules which guarantee the stability and legal security of existing contracts in the petroleum sector. Among other things, the decree went on to address the consequences of restrictions by the National Executive on exports of crude petroleum and its derivatives and on the right of free disposition of natural gas. In the case of the former, Article 6 of the decree provided that the provisions of Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law* would apply, pursuant to which the affected producers, refiners and exporters would receive per unit of product a value no less than that of petroleum products and derivatives of similar condition (grade/quality). In the event of restrictions on the free disposition of gas, Article 6 provided that the price could not be set lower than a minimum price calculated by reference to international petroleum prices (of 35% of the international price for a cubic metre of Arabian Light at 34\u00b0 API for 1000 m3 of gas at 9,300 kilocalories). Finally, Article 6 went on to provide that the National Executive was required to give 12 months\u2019 notice before the entry into effect of any restriction on the export of crude petroleum and/or derivative products.\n\n82.\n\nIn 1991, Argentina adopted the Reconversion Decree which noted and referred to the provisions of the Deregulation Decrees and authorized YPF to proceed to renegotiate its existing service contracts and convert these into new agreements providing for exploration permits and exploitation concessions. It went on to specifically set out the rights to which holders of the new concessions negotiated with YPF would be entitled. These included the ownership of the hydrocarbons produced in the concession-holders\u2019 respective areas, consistent with Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law,* and the right of free disposition of the same in accordance with Article 15 of Decree 1055/89, Article 4 of Decree 1212/89 and Articles 5 and 6 of Decree 1589/89. It also provided that any restriction on the rights of free disposition would give the concession-holders the right to receive compensation, at a level no less than that determined by Article 6 of Decree 1589/89, for the period of the restriction.\n\n83.\n\nIn 1992, Argentina adopted the *Gas Law* to address the transportation and distribution of natural gas. Article 3 of the law deals with the import and export of natural gas. With respect to exports, the article provides that exports of natural gas shall be authorized by the National Executive within 90 days of receipt of a request to the extent that internal supply is not affected. The article deems failure to respond or silence as acceptance of the request.80\n\nArticle 3 of the *Gas Law* provides as follows:  \n III Natural gas export and import  \n Art. 3\u00b0 - Natural gas imports, for which no prior approval shall be required, are hereby authorized.  \n Natural gas exports shall be, in each case, authorized by the national Executive Power within ninety (90) days as from reception of the application, provided they do not affect domestic supply.  \n Failure to provide an answer shall be deemed an admission.  \n Importers and exporters shall file a copy of their contracts with the *Ente National Regulator del Gas.*\n\n84.\n\nAs described in the Majority Decision, YPF and Total entered into negotiations to convert Contract 19,944 into a concession agreement pursuant to the terms of the Reconversion Decree. After lengthy negotiations, the Parties reached agreed terms and, on 23 November 1993, Total and YPF signed the *Acta Acuerdo.* In the recitals at the beginning of that agreement, the Parties provided as follows:\n\n(d) That such reconversion entails the transformation of the CONTRACT into a hydrocarbon Exploitation Concession concerning a set of exploitation lots located within the CONTRACT AREA and a hydrocarbon Exploration Permit covering the remaining parts of the AREA which have not been converted into exploitation lots, the effects of which need to be ruled under the *ACTA ACUERDO* and Law 17,319, in accordance with the conditions prescribed for in Decrees 2411/91, 1055/89, 1212/89 and 1589/89.\n\n(e) That such reconversion entails the termination of an agreement in force between the PARTIES, but termination thereof may only become effective prior consent of the parties.\n\n(f) That it has been taken into consideration that the reconversion of the CONTRACT entails a substantial legal change for the parties, by terminating their status as YPF's contractors and undertaking, in certain cases after the mining risk stage, the economic risk and cost of the hydrocarbon exploitation and marketing as well as transportation expenses.\n\n(g) That owing to the fact that the reserves hold large gas reservoirs, the undertaking of gas marketing in the case of this CONTRACT entails substantial constraints for the COMPANIES because of the significant difference in their favour resulting from the price that YPF must pay for it under the CONTRACT, *vis-\u00e0-vis* the price fixed by the NATIONAL EXECUTIVE POWER for such gas.\n\n(h) That as a result, it is necessary to apply agreements aimed at maintaining the economic balance of the project for the COMPANIES, taking into account the loss they would otherwise suffer and the new risks they undertake under the reconversion.\n\n85.\n\nThe agreement goes on to provide for the reconversion of Contract 19,944 into an exploration permit with a term until 1 May 1996 and a production concession with a term of 25 years plus a possible extension of ten years in return for the rescission of Contract 19,944. The agreement specifically incorporates by reference the terms of the Deregulation Decrees, and provides for the ownership and free disposition of the hydrocarbons produced from the concession areas (consistent with Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law* and in accordance with the Deregulation Decrees) for the full term of the Concession. Article 10 provides for compensation for any restriction on the free disposition of hydrocarbon products in an amount no less than that provided for in Article 6 of Decree 1589/89. In this regard, the *Acta Acuerdo* also provided in Article 21 that, in the event that Total and the other Consortium members were prevented from exercising their rights pursuant to the terms of the agreement by any fact or act emanating from a public authority, the National Executive would be required to instruct the appropriate authority or entity to receive the hydrocarbons produced from the Concession areas in accordance with the terms of Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 for the period of any restriction of the right of free disposition and that the National Executive would remain liable for indemnification and compensation which might arise pursuant to the application of Article 519 of the *Civil Code* of Argentina.\n\n86.\n\nThe *Acta Acuerdo* also attached as an annex a draft decree approving and incorporating the terms of the *Acta Acuerdo.* This draft decree was then adopted and published as Decree 214/94, the Concession Decree, on 15 February 1994. The most relevant portions of that Decree for present purposes are set out in the Majority Decision at paragraph 359. These are reproduced here for convenience:\n\nThat the reconversion of Contract No. 19,944 implies for its holders, a substantial juridical change for the abandonment of its position as contractor of *YPF SOCIEDAD ANONIMA,* preserved, to a great extent, from the economic risk of exploitation once the mining risk phase had been overcome. The important change in their economic position is also relevant for them upon the extinction of *YPF SOCIEDAD ANONIMA* \u2019s obligation to receive the hydrocarbons produced and to pay higher prices than the ones established by the National Executive for them.\n\nTherefore, it becomes necessary to implement agreements tending to maintain the economic balance of the project for the Companies which are holders of the Contract No. 19,944 in the light of the damage that they may otherwise sustain and the new risks that they may assume due to the reconversion.\n\nArt. 6. Holders of the Exploration Permit, of the Exploitation Concessions and of UTE Agreements celebrated between *YPF SOCIEDAD ANONIMA,* according to the attributions conferred by Articles 3 and 4 of the Law No. 24,145 and their Bylaws and *TOTAL AUSTRAL SOCIEDAD ANONIMA, DEMINEX ARGENTINA SOCIEDAD ANONIMA* and *BRIDAS AUSTRAL SOCIEDAD ANONIMA* for the complementary exploitation, development and exploration of the Areas \"AGUADA PICHANA\" and \"SAN ROQUE\", emerging from the conversion of the Contract No. 19,944 established in Article 1 hereof, shall have the ownership and the free availability of the hydrocarbons that are produced in the respective areas, pursuant to the provisions of the Law No. 17,319 and Decrees No. 1055, dated 10 October, 1989; No. 1212, dated 8 November, 1989; No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989 and No. 2411, dated 12 November, 1991, whose terms are in full force and effect as from 23 November, 1993, shall be incorporated in the titles of the corresponding Exploitation Concessions and the Exploration Permit and the aforementioned UTE Agreements for the validity term thereof.\n\nArt. 8. Every restriction to the free availability referred to in Article 6 hereof shall empower holders of the Exploration Permits, the Exploitation Concessions and the UTE Agreements mentioned in Article 6 of this Decree, to receive a value not lower than the one established in Article 6 of the Decree No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989, for the duration thereof.\n\nArt. 9. Holders of the Exploitation Permits of Exploitation Concessions and UTE Agreements mentioned in Article 6 herein shall be subject to the general fiscal legislation which apply to them, but the provisions that may be imposed on the person, judicial condition, or the activity of the permit holder or the concessionaire or the property intended for the execution of the respective tasks shall not be applicable in a discriminatory or specific way.\n\nArt. 17. In case that, as a consequence of the facts or the acts deriving from the Public Powers, the holders of the Exploration permit, of the Exploitation Concession and of the UTE Agreements mentioned in Article 6 of this Decree are prevented from exercising the rights emerging hereof, despite their intention to do so, they shall have the right to cause the National Executive Power to instruct the Application Authority or whoever it may correspond to receive the hydrocarbons produced pursuant to Article 6 of Decree No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989, for the duration of the restriction, pursuant to the terms of the Exploration Permit, of the Exploitation Concessions and of the UTE Agreements. The National Executive shall be responsible for the applicable indemnification and compensation pursuant to Article 519 of the Civil Code.\n\n87.\n\nThe conversion of Contract 19,944 proceeded on the basis set out in the *Acta Acuerdo* and the Conversion Decree. Thereafter, as set out in the Majority Decision at paragraphs 360 -363, Total expanded its exploration and hydrocarbon production activities in Argentina. It also entered into a series of long-term contracts with local distributors for the sale of natural gas and export contracts with Chilean customers.\n\n88.\n\nIn my view, the sequence of legislation and events described above reflects a clear intention on behalf of Argentina to induce investors in the exploration and production sector, and Total and the other members of the Consortium in particular, to convert service contracts with YPF into concessions. Total\u2019s Contract 19,944 with YPF was lucrative and provided Total with a number of advantages including favourable prices and the avoidance of a number of risks. Argentina wished to change its regime and sought to induce Total to convert its contract by way of certain assurances or commitments, including stability and legal security of existing contracts in the petroleum sector (Decree 1589/89 - Preamble); ownership and free disposition of hydrocarbons that concessionaries extracted (Decree 1055/89, Articles 14 and 15; Decree 1589/89 - Article 5; **Acta Acuerdo -** Article 8; Concession Decree - Article 6); the need to maintain the economic equilibrium of the contracts of the companies converting their contracts to concessions *(Acta Acuerdo -* Preamble, paragraphs (f), (g), (h); Concession Decree -Preamble); compensation and damages for restriction of the right of free disposition of hydrocarbons produced from the concessions (Decree 1589/89 - Article 6; Reconversion Decree - Articles 5 and 7; **Acta Acuerdo -** Articles 10 and 21; and Concession Decree - Articles 8 and 17). The evidence of Total\u2019s witnesses with respect to the negotiation and agreement of the *Acta Acuerdo* and adoption of the Concession Decree amply support this.81\n\nFor example, see the evidence of Mr. Contie, TR, Day 4, pp. 997-1003. Argentina provided no knowledgeable witness on the negotiations leading to the *Acta Acuerdo* and the Concession Decree.\n\n89.\n\nArgentina relies heavily upon the *Hydrocarbons Law,* and particularly Article 6, to argue that, despite what the Deregulation Decrees, the Reconversion Decree, the **Acta Acuerdo** and the Conversion Decree say about the rights of ownership and free disposition of hydrocarbons of the concessionaires and, in particular, Total, these were all subject to a broad power to regulate and to limit the right of free disposition by restricting sales and controlling prices. The majority accepts this position at paragraph 427 of the Majority Decision. In my view, this is not the correct interpretation of the **Hydrocarbons Law** and its Article 6, particularly in the context of Total\u2019s investment, the regulations adopted to induce and facilitate the conversion of service contracts to concessions and the negotiations leading to the signature of the **Acta Acuerdo** and the adoption of the Concession Decree. The majority\u2019s interpretation of Article 6 of the **Hydrocarbons Law** and its effect deprives the language of the various decrees and of the *Acta Acuerdo,* which guarantee to Total and other investors who converted their service contracts ownership and free disposition of the hydrocarbons they produce, of any real meaning. Further, it permits the arbitrary treatment of Total in breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment provided for in Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n90.\n\nAs indicated, the *Hydrocarbons Law* was adopted in 1967, well before the significant privatizations and restructuring of the hydrocarbon sector undertaken by Argentina commencing in approximately 1989. Article 6 establishes that permit holders and concessionaires have the ownership of the hydrocarbons they extract and, consequently, are entitled to transport, process and sell derivatives in accordance with regulations decreed by the National Executive on reasonable technical and economical bases which take into account the needs of the internal market and the need to stimulate exploration and production of hydrocarbons. It expressly limits the right to export hydrocarbons only in the case of petroleum *(\"hidrocarburos l\u00edquidos\")* in the event that national production of these is insufficient to meet internal needs and, if this applies, fixes sale prices in the internal market for crude petroleum during the period of shortage. Any such prices must be fair in that the prices must not be less than those for similar imported petroleum products. Where, due to exceptional circumstances, the price of imported petroleum increases significantly, prices shall be set on the basis of the true costs of production plus depreciation and a reasonable profit margin.\n\n91.\n\nArticle 6 goes on to establish the principle that the National Executive shall permit the export of hydrocarbons and derivatives not required to meet internal needs provided those exports are at commercially reasonable prices.82 With respect to gas *(\"hidrocarburos gaseosos\"),* Article 6 provides that, subject to approval, the Concessionaire will be free to dispose of the gas not required for use at the production facilities or purchased by the State gas distribution entity. Finally, the statement that sale and distribution of gaseous hydrocarbons would be subject to regulations adopted by the National Executive is unremarkable. The adoption of the *Gas Law* and related regulations in 1992 is an important example of this.\n\n*\"El Poder Ejecutivo*  *permitir\u00e1* *la exportaci\u00f3n de hidrocarburos o derivados...\u2019.* \"The State shall permit the export....\"\n\n92.\n\nWhile Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law* refers to future regulation by the National Executive, it does not provide for a broad form of immunity of the State from liability arising from such future regulation nor does it provide for a broad, unfettered right to limit disposition rights, to limit exports or to fix prices. It only addresses the possibility of limiting prices during periods when national production is insufficient to meet internal requirements for liquid hydrocarbons. In such cases, it specifically provides for the payment of fair prices to producers during the period of the shortage of supply. It also provides that the price to be paid by the State distribution entity for natural gas must be agreed and provide for a reasonable rate of return to investors.\n\n93.\n\nThe *Hydrocarbons Law* was a general law adopted to regulate the hydrocarbons industry at an early stage of its development in Argentina. Since the privatizations undertaken in the late 1980s, a number of its provisions have become antiquated. For example, the reference to State companies in Articles 6 and 11 of the law are now long out of date.\n\n94.\n\nThe National Executive did, of course, adopt regulations to implement national policy with respect to hydrocarbons. One important example of this was the Deregulation Decrees which led to the conversion of service contracts. It is worth noting that Contract 19,944, the \"take or pay\" contract between Total and its Consortium members and YPF, was negotiated after the adoption of the *Hydrocarbons Law.* This agreement turned out to be favourable to Total and the Consortium members, especially once Argentina became a net exporter of gas. Argentina and YPF wanted to renegotiate this agreement and, supported by regulations issued by the National Executive, this occurred.\n\n95.\n\nThe Deregulation Decrees reflect the clear intention by Argentina to induce holders of service or \"take or pay\" contracts to convert these to concessions in return for ownership of the hydrocarbons extracted and free disposition of these. Decree 1589/89, the last in the series of these decrees, noted the importance for the Government to establish clear and definitive rules which guaranteed the stability and legal security of existing agreements in the petroleum industry. It went on to provide that in the event that the National Executive should establish restrictions on exports, the provisions of Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law,* pursuant to which producers, refiners and exporters were entitled to receive a value no less than similar imported products, would apply. It also provided a specific minimum price in the event that restrictions on free disposition of gas were imposed. It did not in any manner expand the provisions of Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law.* Rather, it imposed the additional requirement that the National Executive give 12 months\u2019 notice of any restrictions on the export of crude oil and derivatives. The Reconversion Decree confirmed the Government\u2019s intention that market rules in the setting of prices and the free disposition of hydrocarbons was the governing principle of the Deregulation Decrees and of the conversion it mandated. It went on to incorporate by reference into the new concessions the terms of Article 15 of Decree 1055/89, Article 4 of Decree 1212/89 and Articles 5 and 6 of Decree 1589/89.83\n\nThe intention of the regulations was reflected in YPF\u2019s \"prospectus\". See Ex. C-308 and para. 359 of the Majority Decision. Further, Argentina\u2019s witness, Mr. Guich\u00f3n, confirmed that the Deregulation Decree and the Reconversion Decree reflected the fundamental aspect of the applicable framework and that these Decrees remained part of the said framework as late as 2006. See cross-examination of Diego Guich\u00f3n, TR, Day 5, pp. 1359-1362.\n\n96.\n\nIt was in this context that YPF, on behalf of Argentina, and Total negotiated the conversion of Contract 19,944 to a concession. The evidence was clear that Total explained during the course of the negotiations that Contract 19,944 was favourable to the Consortium and that it would lose a number of advantages and assume a number of risks with the conversion and that these had to be addressed adequately in order for the Consortium to agree to the conversion.84 These concerns were addressed in the **Acta Acuerdo** which recorded the fact that the conversion had to take into account the assumption of a number of added risks by the new concessionaire including the important price difference between what had been paid by YPF under the contract and the price to be set by the National Executive under the Concession and the importance of maintaining the economic equilibrium of the Concession for the Consortium in light of the prejudice and the new risks that they would face by reason of the Reconversion (Preamble, paragraphs (f), (g), (h)). As indicated above, the **Acta Acuerdo** then goes on to provide specifically for the rights of ownership and free disposition of the hydrocarbons produced from the Concession and the payment of minimum prices in the event that the National Executive were to impose any restrictions on the right of free disposition of these while such restrictions lasted. These provisions were specifically made applicable during the full term of the production Concession and exploration permits granted. These provisions were also all reflected in the Concession Decree.\n\nSee, for example, the evidence of Michel Contie: TR, Day 4, pp. 997-999.\n\n97.\n\nIn my view, it was entirely reasonable for Total, and the other Consortium members it represented, to expect that they had the full right of ownership and free disposition of the hydrocarbons they produced from the Concessions granted pursuant to the **Acta Acuerdo** and the Concession Decree, subject only to the possibility of restrictions where national production of hydrocarbons did not meet internal demand and subject to the specific minimum compensation provided for in these instruments should the situation arise. These commitments were made directly to Total through the negotiations for, and the contractual agreement contained in, the **Acta Acuerdo** and by way of public regulation, the Concession Decree. In my view, there is nothing in Article 6 of the 1967 *Hydrocarbons Law* which addresses the State\u2019s right to regulate or restrict the rights of ownership and free disposition of hydrocarbons beyond what is provided for in its text. Certainly, there is no provision which immunizes the State from liability for paying compensation for a substantial departure from the limited cases of restriction on the right of exports provided for in the law. In fact, the subsequent detailed decrees adopted to implement the conversion confirmed and reinforced the rights of ownership and free disposition of hydrocarbons and the rights to compensation in the event of the restriction of those rights. Further, the *Acta Acuerdo* and the Concession Decree recognized the significant change in regime from the take or pay contract to a concession and reflected the intention to maintain the economic equilibrium of the production projects. To adopt the interpretation put forward by Argentina, and accepted by the majority, in these circumstances is to deny any meaning to the clear commitments to ownership and free disposition of the hydrocarbons produced by Total.\n\n98.\n\nIn my view, the Deregulation Decrees, Reconversion Decree, **Acta Acuerdo** and Conversion Decree all implemented the national policy of Argentina and all were consistent with the provisions of the *Hydrocarbons Law.* Not only were these instruments consistent with that law, but they were subsequent, more specific expressions of a concerted policy of the Government of Argentina. Total and the other members of the Consortium had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that Argentina would comply with its specific commitments contained in both legislation and a publicly approved agreement. The evidence demonstrated that it was on the basis of those commitments that Total agreed to the conversion of Contract 19,944 and continued to invest in the concessions granted in exchange. It cannot have been the intention or the expectation of the parties that a reference to Article 6 of the **Hydrocarbons Law** would permit the complete avoidance of the rights acquired under the new decrees. In my respectful view, if the reference to the 1967 **Hydrocarbons Law** in the subsequent decrees and the **Acta Acuerdo** is interpreted to mean that Argentina exchanged its obligation to take all of the gas Total and the Consortium members produced at profitable (for Total) prices for an unrestricted right to require Total to sell all of the hydrocarbon products it produced at much lower, fixed prices, it leads to a manifestly absurd result.\n\n**(i) The Measures in the Context of the Hydrocarbons Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Measures adopted by Argentina do not fall within the limited restrictions contemplated by Article 6 of the *Hydrocarbons Law,* the Deregulation Decrees and the Reconversion and Concession Decree. Neither the *Emergency Law* nor the subsequent measures adopted to pesify and freeze the reference price in the consumer gas tariff had as its objective to ensure the domestic supply of hydrocarbons, whether of crude oil or gas. The purpose of these instruments was, in fact, quite different.85\n\nIn this regard, see: the *Emergency Act,* Ex. C-13; NR Gas Resolution 2612/2002, dated 24 June 2002, Ex. C-155; NR Gas Resolution 2665/2002, dated 15 August 2002, Ex. C-158; NR Gas Resolution 2614/2002, dated 24 June 2002, Ex. C-34(l); NR Gas Resolution 2653/2002, dated 22 August 2002, Ex. C-34(2); NR Gas Resolution 2654/2002, dated 22 August 2002, Ex. C-34(3); NR Gas Resolution 2660/2002, dated 22 August 2002, Ex. C-34(4); NR Gas Resolution 2663/2003, dated 22 August 2004, Ex. C-34(5); NR Gas Resolution 2703/2002, dated 25 September 2002, Ex. C-34(6).\n\n100.\n\nMoreover, all of the available evidence indicates that the Argentine market for natural gas was characterized by over-supply until 2003.86 It was not until 2004 that Argentina decided to suspend the export of natural gas due to a shortage of gas to meet internal needs.87 The evidence clearly indicates that by this time, Argentina had recovered in large part from the conditions that gave rise to the *Emergency Law* and the initial measures adopted by Argentina. The evidence indicated that the later shortages were the result of the significant reduction and freezing of the price of gas which resulted in, amongst other things, a significant downturn in exploration to find hydrocarbons and a surge in the consumption of natural gas.88\n\nSee Grosjean, TR, Day 3, p. 888; Contie, WS1 at para. 2; This condition had been long-standing as demonstrated by the disclosure made in YPF\u2019s 1993 Information Memorandum which stated:  \n The current supply of deliverable gas in Argentina exceeds the demand for gas by a substantial margin, and this condition is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  \n Ex. C-308, p. 13. Further, the approval by the Secretary of Energy of Total\u2019s various export contracts for natural gas confirmed this situation: see SoE Resolution 131/01, dated 9 February 2001, Exhibit C-133; the latest contracts were approved in 2002, see Ex. C-427/428 and cross-examination of Mr. Grosjean, TR, Day 4, 958:20 -959:3.\n\nSee Secretary of Energy Resolution 265/2004, Ex. C-205 *(\"programa de racionalizaci\u00f3n de exportaciones de gas\")* and Under-Secretary of Fuels Disposition 27/2004, Ex. C-206. These were replaced by Secretary of Energy Resolution 659/2004 of 18 June 2004, Ex. C-215.\n\nSee the evidence of Mr. Grosjean, TR (English), Day 4, pp. 934-935. According to Mr. Grosjean, he warned Argentine officials that the suppression and freezing of the price of natura, gas would have precisely these effects.\n\n**C. The Specific Claims Related to the Exploration and Production Sector**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Measures in the Context of the Concession Decree**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nWith respect to its investments in the exploration and production sector, Total argues that the Measures (redenomination, pesification and the freezing of tariffs) and, later, the imposition of export taxes and the elimination of the exemption from such taxes for exports from Tierra del Fuego, violated its rights to free disposition granted in the Concession Decree. The arguments and impact vary slightly depending on the product at issue (crude oil, natural gas or LPG) and the specific regulations. However, I consider it useful to discuss the Measures in this context generally before turning to specific arguments related to each product and market.\n\n102.\n\nTotal\u2019s arguments with respect to the Measures and their impact in this sector are similar to its arguments for its investments in gas transportation and power generation. However, in my view, the analysis for the investments in this sector is different. As has been set out in detail in the Majority Decision, Total was one of the first foreign investors in Argentina\u2019s exploration and production sector and has maintained and increased its investments in this sector for over 30 years. At the time of its original investment, this sector of the Argentine economy was in its infancy. Initial investments were made to explore for hydrocarbons in the remote and isolated region of Tierra del Fuego. The hydrocarbons produced were all sold to the State-owned energy company, thus guaranteeing Total a market for its products. At Argentina\u2019s request, this system was changed and Total and Argentina negotiated a change to their relationship. Instead of a \"take or pay\" contract, Total was granted an exploration permit and a concession, which was memorialized in the Concession Decree. Later developments in the other sectors, in particular the privatization and free market pricing systems established in the gas transportation sector through the Gas Regulatory Framework also impacted Total as a producer of natural gas. However, its claims as a producer are based not on the general regulatory frameworks, but on the specific promises made to it as part of the concession process.\n\n103.\n\nThus, in my view, with respect to Total\u2019s claims as a producer, the Tribunal must review the Measures and their impact on Total and determine whether they violated the express promises made in the Concession Decree and other instruments. Total was granted the right to freely dispose of the hydrocarbons it produced and, in the event that Argentina limited those rights, the agreement provided for specific means of calculating the compensation that would be paid. Accordingly, I consider the analysis with respect to this sector to be different from the analysis with respect to the others at issue in this arbitration. The question is not simply whether it was legitimate for Total to expect that Argentina would maintain its commitment to free market pricing and economic equilibrium of the gas transportation and power generation systems evidenced by the elaborate legislative frameworks designed for this purpose, but whether the Measures violated specific promises made by Argentina to Total. If so, the Tribunal must consider whether Argentina should be required to compensate Total. As I have already discussed, I consider the pesification and freezing of tariffs taken together as a breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to investments in the gas transportation and power generation sectors. I reach the same conclusion with respect to the exploration and production sector.\n\n**(ii) Crude Oil**\n------------------\n\n104.\n\nTotal argues that pesification and the imposition of export taxes on crude oil breached its right to fair and equitable treatment in light of the specific promises contained in the Concession Decree. With respect to the arguments related to pesification, the majority repeats its earlier conclusion (from the gas transportation analysis) with respect to pesification, *i.e.,* that \"[s]uch changes in general legislation in absence of specific stabilization promises to the foreign investor are legitimate exercise of the host State\u2019s governmental powers that are not prevented by a BIT\u2019S Fair and Equitable obligation and not in breach of same.\"89 As I have already discussed, this case is not about stabilization promises, *per se* and, in general, I do not understand Total\u2019s argument to be that Argentina was not entitled to change its legislation. In any event, with respect to its investments in the exploration and production sector, Total\u2019s arguments are different than with respect to its investments in the other sectors. This is because of the Concession Decree, which evidenced the bilateral agreement between Total and Argentina. Total summarizes its argument in these words:\n\nTotal does not advocate that Argentina should have been captive to legal or regulatory immobility. Of course, legal frameworks do evolve and adapt to changing circumstances. What is clear, however, is that a framework that Argentina promised to Total in the Concession Decree would remain stable for the life of its investments - and relied on by Total - may not be dispensed with without compensation.90\n\nMajority Decision at para. 429.\n\nCPHB at para 684.\n\n105.\n\nThe Concession Decree was for a limited period of time. It required Argentina to ensure that the financial equilibrium of all renegotiated contracts be preserved.91 In my view, this was a specific promise made by Argentina to maintain the financial equilibrium of the contracts. It did not necessarily mean that Argentina could not change its laws or even change them in such a way as to impact the underlying framework on which Total relied in making its investment. However, if such changes were made, Argentina was required to either maintain the financial equilibrium of the contracts or to compensate Total. Pesification very clearly impacted the equilibrium of the contracts, as it reduced the amount that Total received for its products by two-thirds. Pesification altered the price terms in contracts between Total and various refineries for the sale of crude oil. Total was only able to mitigate some of these losses through renegotiation of its contracts and claims for its remaining losses. In the context of the specific promises granted by the Concession Decree, I have no trouble finding that Argentina breached the duty to treat Total fairly and equitably when it unilaterally converted all of the amounts due under Total\u2019s private contracts from dollars to pesos at a forced conversion rate of 1:1.\n\nDecree 1212/1989, which was incorporated in the Concession Decree.\n\n106.\n\nWith respect to export taxes on hydrocarbons, the majority finds that these taxes form part of the general fiscal regime and, as such, Total agreed to be subject to them.92 I do not think that this approach gives due consideration to the impact of the specific taxes at issue. Through Resolution 397/07, Argentina imposed a tax on crude oil exports that effectively prevented Total from receiving more than US$42 per barrel of oil produced despite international prices in excess of US$100. It is difficult to classify this tax as anything but a price control. Although Total was free to set its export prices, it could never realize more than US$42 per barrel because of Argentina\u2019s export tax. As discussed in detail above, Argentina promised Total that it would have the right to ownership and free disposition of its products. Through the Concession Decree, Total gave up a guaranteed buyer for its product, taking on significantly more risk. The parties agreed to allocate that risk and the potential benefits in a certain way by negotiating an economic equilibrium in the Concession Decree. By imposing an export tax that effectively capped the price that Total could receive from its export customers for crude oil, Argentina altered that balance. In my view, this was improper and a violation of Total\u2019s legitimate expectations and the obligation to treat Total fairly and equitably. Argentina expressly stated in Resolution 394/2007 that the export tax was intended to cap domestic prices of crude oil. The export taxes not only decreased Total\u2019s revenues on its export contracts, they also impacted the domestic price of crude oil. In light of the specific promises contained in the Concession Decree, I consider the export taxes to be a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation for which Argentina should have to compensate Total.\n\nCiting Article 9 of the Concession Decree, which provides:  \n Art. 9. Holders of the Exploitation Permits of Exploitation Concessions and UTE Agreements mentioned in Article 6 herein shall be subject to the general fiscal legislation which apply to them, but the provisions that may be imposed on the person, judicial condition, or the activity of the permit holder or the concessionaire or the property intended for the execution of the respective tasks shall not be applicable in a discriminatory or specific way.\n\n107.\n\nI note that the majority considers Argentina\u2019s right to restrict the export of crude oil in the event of national shortage as set out in Article 6 of the ***Hydrocarbons Law*** as a general restriction on Total\u2019s right to ownership and free disposition of its products. While I agree that there were potential situations in which Argentina may have been able to invoke the provisions of Article 6 of the ***Hydrocarbons Law*** in order to ensure domestic supply and, in exceptional circumstances, even pay less than international prices for that crude oil, there was no evidence that that is what happened here. The export tax on crude oil was not intended to ensure the domestic supply. It was not suggested that the impact of the export tax on the domestic price of crude oil was intended to mimic the alternate pricing structure set out in the *Hydrocarbons Law.* It was not argued that there was a relationship between the possible specific limitations on exports (in the case of national shortage) with a promise of international pricing and the export taxes imposed. There is no such relationship. In my view, in order to avail itself of the rights it had reserved to itself in the ***Hydrocarbons Law*** (especially in light of the subsequent, detailed Concession Decree), Argentina needed to satisfy the preconditions, *i.e.* demonstrate that there was a shortage and take measures designed to deal with the shortage. Further, in order to derogate from the clear default international pricing compensation provisions in the *Hydrocarbons Law,* Argentina needed to submit some evidence of international price increases due to exceptional circumstances. There was no evidence that the significant increase in global oil prices at the time of the imposition of the export taxes was as a result of exceptional circumstances. In the absence of that evidence, at a minimum, Argentina was required to compensate Total at international prices.\n\n108.\n\nTotal also argues that the elimination of the tax-free status for both oil and natural gas exports from Tierra del Fuego is a further breach of its rights under the BIT. The majority accepts this argument on the basis that the retroactive change to the customs status (from 2007) was contrary to specific assurances made to Total that Tierra del Fuego would maintain its tax-free status. I concur with this part of the Majority Decision. However, the majority finds that the elimination of the tax-free status generally, *i.e.,* commencing in 2007, was not a breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT, as it did not see any basis for concluding that the exemption could not be revoked by a later statutory enactment.93 In my view, this conclusion ignores the evidence of Michel Contie who testified that Total would not have made its investments in Tierra del Fuego but for the tax exemption and absence of export restrictions from the region.94 Mr. Contie specifically referenced assurances made by Argentine officials to Total that the Mercosur deal regarding special economic zones would continue through 2013 at a minimum.95 Argentina did not challenge this evidence.96 In light of this evidence, I consider it unfair and inequitable for Argentina to have revoked the tax-free status for Tierra del Fuego without notice or without any consideration of how the elimination of this exemption would impact the economic equilibrium of the investments.\n\nMajority Decision at para. 439.\n\nContie WS2 at paras. 18 - 23.\n\nContie WS2 at para. 22.\n\nRPHB at paras. 150 - 166.\n\n**(iii) Natural Gas**\n---------------------\n\n109.\n\nSimilar to its arguments with respect to crude oil, Total argues that pesification and the imposition of export taxes on natural gas breached its right to fair and equitable treatment in light of the specific promises contained in the Concession Decree. Total says that the Measures changed the prices for natural gas that it had negotiated for its private contracts (effectively reducing the revenue under those contracts by two-thirds) and the freezing of the tariff had the effect of *de facto* setting the well head price in the natural gas market. As I have already discussed, I consider the language in the Concession Decree granting Total the right to freely dispose of the hydrocarbons it produced to be clear and to necessarily include the right to sell its products for the prices that it could negotiate freely with its contractual partners. Accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that the Measures were general in nature and in response to a genuine economic crisis, I would have found that the Measures breached Total\u2019s rights to fair and equitable treatment under the BIT as they eviscerated the specific rights granted to Total under the Concession Decree and the *Acta Acuerdo.* Referring to its earlier reasoning with respect to pesification in the context of the gas transportation sector, the majority finds no breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.97 However, with respect to the freezing of natural gas tariffs, the majority concludes that Argentina breached Total\u2019s treaty rights to the extent that it did not compensate Total at the rate envisaged in Decree 1589/89, the rate to be paid in the event that Argentina restricted Total\u2019s rights to freely dispose of natural gas.98 I agree with this conclusion and join with the majority on this portion of the decision.\n\nMajority Decision at para. 446.\n\nMajority Decision at paras. 452 - 455.\n\n***(1) Price Path Recovery Agreement***\n---------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nBy way of Decree 181/2004 (Exhibit C-197), the National Executive authorized the Secretary of Energy to enter into agreements with producers of natural gas to adjust the price of natural gas paid to producers in order to re-direct the production and sale of natural gas in the internal market towards a return to the free market pricing system. Pursuant to the terms of the decree, this was to be achieved by a scheme which was to be completed by 31 December 2006 and the Secretary of Energy signed with a number of gas producers, including Total, an agreement dated 2 April 2004. This agreement, known as the Price Path Recovery Agreement, was approved by way of Resolution 208/2004 adopted by the Ministry of Planning,99 A number of gas producers, including Total, signed a copy of the Resolution as well as the annex setting out the step price increases over time provided for in the Ministry of Planning\u2019s Resolution.\n\nSee Ex, C-208, which contains the Ministry of Planning\u2019s Resolution and copies of the agreement signed by the parties. The agreement signed by the parties is attached as Annex 1 to the Resolution and the supplementary agreement dealing with the suspension and possible waiver of rights as between the producers and gas distributors and energy generating companies is attached as Annex 2 to the Resolution.\n\n111.\n\nAnnex 2 attached to Resolution 208/2004 provides for a commitment by the producers not to initiate new lawsuits and to suspend existing lawsuits against distribution companies and electrical energy producers in respect of claims relating to the pesification of prices initiated under the *Emergency Law.* This annex also provides for the suspension of the running of limitation periods during the currency of the Price Path Recovery Agreement. Further, it says that provided that the terms of the Price Path Recovery Agreement are all fulfilled, the producers agree to waive any actions they may have against distributors or electrical energy producers. No mention is made of the waiver of any claims against the Government of Argentina or any of its ministries or institutions.\n\n112.\n\nThe oral evidence indicated that, during the course of negotiations for the agreement to implement the Price Path Recovery Agreement, Argentina requested that the producers waive any claims against it.100 Mr. Grosjean testified that Total refused to waive any such claims.101 A review of the Ministry of Planning\u2019s Resolution 208/2004 and the attached annexes reveals no indication of any waiver by Total, or any other producer as against Argentina. The only undertakings made by the producers were with respect to the distribution companies and electrical generation companies in respect of claims the producers may have brought against those companies in relation to the effects of the *Emergency Law* and related measures. Further, a condition of the suspension and possible eventual waiver of any such claim was clearly made subject to full compliance with the terms of the Price Path Recovery Agreement by Argentina, including the completion of the normalization scheme, by 31 December 2006.102\n\nSee Guich\u00f3n, TR (Spanish), Day 5, 1337:1 - 11.\n\nSee Grosjean, TR, Day 3, pp. 891-893. Mr. Grosjean was clear that under The Price Path Recovery Agreement, Total was prepared to waive rights as against the distribution companies and electrical generation companies, but not as against Argentina. In his evidence, Mr. Guich\u00f3n admitted that in the drafts of the Price Path Recovery Agreement that he saw, Argentina had requested from Total and the other natural gas producers a waiver of all claims related to the *Emergency Law* and related measures. He also stated that he was aware that this was an issue that had been discussed until the last minute. See, Guich\u00f3n, TR, Day 5 (Spanish), p. 1337.\n\nSee Ex. C-208, Anexo II, Art. 2.6. Art. 2.7 goes on to state that the suspension and waivers provided for could not be raised by the parties with respect to other claims not covered by the agreement. Other articles of the agreement also require the completion of agreements between the producers and the distribution and electrical power generating companies.\n\n113.\n\nTotal alleges that the Price Path Recovery Agreement was never fully implemented and its objective was never met. It says that amongst other failures, the last step of the price path and the return to the free market for industrial consumers was never fully implemented because of further measures implemented to introduce new forms of protection.103 The majority discusses the validity of the Price Path Recovery Agreement, *i.e.,* that Total signed the agreement, but does not address Total\u2019s reservation of rights argument.104\n\nSee Secretary of Energy Resolution 752/2005, dated 23 May 2005, Ex. C-497 and Secretary of Energy Resolution 659/2004, dated 18 June 2004, Ex. C-215.\n\nMajority Decision at paras. 456 - 457.\n\n114.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence and arguments presented, I must conclude that Total did not waive any claims it may have against Argentina by virtue of its signature of the Price Path Recovery Agreement. The language of the agreement and of Resolution 208/2004 is clear that any limitation, suspension or waiver was with respect to lawsuits or proceedings against distribution companies and generators of electrical power, only. There is no basis in the Price Path Recovery Agreement to find that Total somehow waived its rights pursuant to the BIT against Argentina. Further, the evidence of the history of negotiation indicates that, in fact, Argentina requested the waiver of all claims against it, but was unsuccessful in obtaining this. With respect to whether the Government of Argentina fully complied with the obligations contained in Decree 181/2004 and the Price Path Recovery Agreement, a decision on this issue is not required to address Argentina\u2019s argument regarding waiver.\n\n115.\n\nThe Price Path Recovery Agreement is, clearly, relevant to the assessment of damages suffered by Total and must be taken into account in assessing those damages. Further, the assessment of whether the terms of the Price Path Recovery Agreement were fully complied with can best be addressed as part of that exercise. On the basis of the evidence currently before the Tribunal, it does not appear that the stepped price increases provided for in the Price Path Recovery Agreement were fully implemented by the end date of that agreement, 31 December 2006 or at all, or that the price payable to producers ever returned to the original system of freely negotiated prices.\n\n***(2) Restrictions on Natural Gas Exports***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nTotal argues that Argentina restricted natural gas exports by interfering with export contracts that had been approved by the Government and by requiring producers to supply additional volumes of natural gas to the local market before being permitted to comply with their export commitments.105\n\nThe revocation of tax free status for exports from Tierra del Fuego has been discussed above in the context of export taxes on crude oil.\n\n117.\n\nThe majority finds that Argentina has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in interfering with Total\u2019s gas export contracts.106 I agree with this conclusion.\n\nMajority Decision at para. 461.\n\n118.\n\nThe majority also finds that Argentina has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT in so far as the domestic gas prices set by the Government were below the minimum price set out in Article 6 of Decree 1589/89107 in the event that Argentina required producers to sell into the domestic market because of shortage.108 I agree with this conclusion. However, the majority goes on to find that by signing the Price Path Recovery Agreement, Total waived its right to claim for compensation of past losses *(i.e.,* before June 2002). As discussed at paragraphs 110 to 115, above, I do not consider Total to have waived its right to make claims against Argentina by signing the Price Path Recovery Agreement. Further, and in any event, that agreement was never fully implemented because of further measures taken by Argentina. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion on this issue and would have found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation from the time the Measures were implemented.\n\n35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API\n\nMajority Decision at para. 455.\n\n**(iv) LPG**\n------------\n\n119.\n\nAs noted by the majority, Total\u2019s arguments with respect to its losses as a result of the LPG Law and losses on export taxes mirror its arguments with respect to crude oil.\n\n120.\n\nWith respect to the LPG price claims in the domestic market, Total claims that the LPG Law dated 8 April 2005109 capped the prices for domestic sales of LPG, thereby breaching Total\u2019s right to free disposition of LPG granted under the Concession Decree. Argentina\u2019s defence with respect to this claim is that Total waived its rights by signing the LPG Agreement dated 26 July 2002.\n\nLaw 26,020 dated 8 April 2005 at Exh. A RA 170.\n\n121.\n\nIn deciding Total\u2019s claim with respect to pesification of prices, the majority refers to its general reasoning and finds no breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation. Again, I must disagree. Setting the price domestically interfered with Total\u2019s right to free disposition. The *Hydrocarbons Law* contemplated regulation of prices in certain circumstances, none of which were adequately argued or demonstrated by Argentina with respect to LPG price caps. Accordingly, I would have found that the LPG Law resulted in a breach of Article 3 of the BIT.110\n\nLPG Law passed 8 April 2005, see Law 26,020 Exh. A RA 170\n\n122.\n\nI also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis with respect to the effect of the LPG Agreement. In 2002, Total and Argentina entered into the LPG Agreement, which set LPG prices and provided certain benefits to the producers, such as decreased export taxes on LPG. Total does not claim any losses under the LPG Agreement but, in any event, Total says that the LPG Agreement was signed by Total under protest and with a full reservation of rights.111 I agree with the majority that the evidence did not support this second position. However, I note that this finding is irrelevant to Total\u2019s claim under the LPG Law, which was passed a number of years after the LPG Agreement was signed. I also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis to the extent that it relies on the LPG Agreement as its basis for finding that LPG prices were not established by the market at the time the LPG Law was passed.\n\nCPHB at para. 780.\n\n**VIII. CONCLUSION**\n--------------------\n\n123.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the majority primarily with respect to the analysis of the breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation as it relates to redenomination and forced conversion at a rate of 1:1,112 particularly when combined with the freezing of tariffs and prices. I believe that Argentina breached this obligation in respect of Total\u2019s claims in each of the three sectors: gas transportation, power generation, and exploration and production. In my view, these Measures were particularly egregious in the context of the promises made by Argentina to Total in the Concession Decree and, consequently, as they impacted Total\u2019s investments in the exploration and production sector. Although the *Hydrocarbons Law* allowed Argentina to impose some limits on Total\u2019s rights to ownership and free disposition of its products, it was clear from the evidence that Argentina did not pass the Measures in response to a shortage of hydrocarbons in the domestic market and neither did it compensate Total for those limits, as contemplated by that law, Argentina\u2019s civil code or the subsequent decrees which provided for compensation. As set out in detail above, I also disagree with the majority\u2019s assessment of a variety of issues including the timing of Total\u2019s investments in the gas transportation and power generation sectors, its due diligence in making its investment in the gas transportation sector and the effect of the Price Path Recovery Agreement.\n\nWhat I have referred to as pesification in this Individual Opinion.\n\n124.\n\nI join with the majority in its findings of other breaches by Argentina of Article 3 of the BIT through subsequent acts. Since these findings do not coincide with the basis on which Total made and calculated its claims for damages, Total shall have the opportunity to present argument and evidence in support of its claims for damages as they relate to these breaches in a subsequent damages phase of the proceedings."}], "Content": "Decision on Liability\n---------------------\n\n***Part I - Introduction***\n---------------------------\n\n***1. Procedural Background***\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 12, 2003, Total S.A. (\"Total\" or the \"Claimant\") submitted before the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") a Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\" or the \"Respondent\"), pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"ICSID Convention\") and the Treaty between France and Argentina concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investment of July 3, 1991 (\"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\"), the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request for Arbitration on November 3, 2003. On November 4, 2003, the Centre transmitted a copy of the Request for Arbitration to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C. On January 22, 2004 the Secretary-General registered Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration and gave notice thereof to the parties, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. Pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Institution Rules, the Secretary-General also invited the parties to proceed as soon as possible to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, the Claimant appointed Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, a Canadian national, as arbitrator. On April 14, 2004, the Argentine Republic appointed Dr. Luis Herrera Marcano, a national of Venezuela, as arbitrator. On August 20, 2004, in accordance with Rule 4 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appointed Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti, a national of Italy, as President of the Tribunal. On August 24, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that all members of the Tribunal had accepted their appointments and that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that same day.\n\n4.\n\nThe first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on November 15, 2004. During the session, the parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n5.\n\nDuring the course of the first session, the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters as reflected in the written minutes of the session which were signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Among other matters, it was agreed that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 22, the languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish. It was confirmed that the Claimant would file its pleadings in English and Argentina would file its pleadings in Spanish, without a subsequent translation of the written pleadings into the other party\u2019s chosen procedural language. After hearing the parties, the Tribunal decided by Procedural Order No. 1 that the Claimant would file its Memorial on the merits within five months of the date of the first session. The Tribunal also decided that, if the Respondent wished to raise any objections to jurisdiction, it should do so within 45 days of the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the merits. In the event of an objection to jurisdiction, the Claimant would file its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days of the receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on jurisdiction. In the same Procedural Order, the Tribunal further decided that: if the Respondent did not raise any objections to jurisdiction, it would file its Counter-Memorial on the merits within five months of receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the merits; the Claimant would then file its Reply on the merits within 60 days of receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the merits; and the Respondent would file its Rejoinder on the merits within 60 days of receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply on the merits.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on the merits (\"CMM\") on April 11, 2005; Argentina filed its *\"Memorial sobre objeciones a la jurisdicci\u00f3n del Centro y a la competencia del Tribunal\"* on June 3, 2005. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3), the proceeding on the merits was thereby suspended. In conformity with Procedural Order No.l, the Claimant then submitted its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction on August 1, 2005.\n\n7.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held in Washington D.C. on September 5, 2005. Ms. Cintia Yaryura, Ms. Maria Victoria Vitali and Mr. Ariel Martins addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Argentina. Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Georgios Petrochilos and Mr. Luis A. Erize addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. During the course of the hearing, the Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided for in Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Decision on Jurisdiction\") on August 25, 2006, rejecting Argentina\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and deciding that the parties\u2019 dispute was within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal.1 In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal stated that the matter of costs relating to the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding would be considered as part of the merits phase.\n\nThe Decision is available at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/TotalSAv.Argentina\\_002.pdf\n\n9.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal confirmed that pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent would submit its Counter-Memorial on the merits within five months of the date of the Decision on Jurisdiction *i.e.,* by January 26, 2007. The Claimant would thereafter file its Reply on the merits within 60 days of receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the merits and the Respondent would file its Rejoinder on the merits 60 days of receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply on the merits. According to the schedule, Argentina filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits on January 26, 2007.\n\n10.\n\nOn February 9, 2007, the Claimant proposed a revised schedule for the submission of the Claimant\u2019s Reply and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. By letter of February 16, 2007, Argentina indicated that it did not oppose the Claimant\u2019s proposal to modify the schedule. Taking into consideration the parties\u2019 views in this respect, the Tribunal decided to modify the deadlines established in Procedural Order No. 1, which had been issued on August 25, 2006. Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to file its Reply on the merits by May 15, 2007 and the Respondent to file its Rejoinder on the merits within 102 days of receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of March 16, 2007, the Respondent requested a one-month extension for the submission of both the Claimant\u2019s Reply and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. On March 16, 2007, the Claimant submitted its observations on the Respondent\u2019s extension request. By letter of April 9, 2007, the Tribunal decided to grant the one month extension requested by Argentina. The Tribunal decided that the Claimant\u2019s Reply on the merits should be filed by June 15, 2007 and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the merits within 102 days of receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply on the merits.\n\n12.\n\nBy letters of May 9 and 18, 2007, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would submit its Reply on May 18, 2007, and that it expected Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder to be submitted around August 28, 2007. By letter of May 14, 2007, Argentina requested the Tribunal to maintain the one-month extension that it had requested and to order the submission of its Rejoinder by October 1, 2007. As indicated by the Claimant, the Reply on the merits was submitted on May 18, 2007.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of May 22, 2007, the Tribunal stated that the Respondent was entitled to rely on the one-month extension granted by the Tribunal. The Tribunal also confirmed that the Claimant was free to file its Reply before the deadline established by the Tribunal in its letter of April 9, 2007. Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered that the Secretariat should not forward the Claimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent until June 15, 2007, and that the Respondent should file its Rejoinder within 102 days of receipt of the Reply.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of September 25, 2007, the Respondent filed a request for production of documents and requested a 15-day extension for the filing of its Rejoinder on the merits. By letter of September 30, 2007, the Claimant submitted its observations on the Respondent\u2019s letter of September 25, 2007. By letter of October 3, 2007, the Tribunal granted the extension requested by the Respondent and ordered the submission of the Rejoinder of the merits by October 15, 2007.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of October 9, 2007, the Respondent requested the deadline to be moved to October 16, 2007, as October 15, 2007 was an official holiday in Argentina. By letter of October 10, 2007, the Tribunal granted the Respondent until October 16, 2007 to submit its Rejoinder on the merits. The Tribunal also indicated that it would fix a deadline for the Respondent to file comments on certain financial valuation issues as the Respondent had not yet received some documents that the Claimant had been ordered to produce. The Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the merits on October 16, 2007. The parties exchanged a number of communications regarding the production of documents dealing with financial valuation matters. Having considered the parties\u2019 positions in this respect, the Tribunal, by letter of November 5, 2007, ordered the Respondent to submit its report on quantum by November 20, 2007. The Respondent filed its expert report on damages on the date ordered by the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 10, 2007, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference call with the parties and, on December 13, 2007, it issued procedural directions for the organisation of the hearing on the merits.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal held a hearing on the merits at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. from January 7 through January 18, 2008.

In its submission, Argentina claimed that the cost incurred by Argentina amounted to US$1,215,222.99. In its submission on costs the Claimant:\n\n\"request[ed] that the Tribunal:\n\n(i) ORDER Argentina to reimburse to Total an amount of US$431,500, which is the present total of the costs-advances made by Total, with interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date of the Award until final payment; and\n\n(ii) ORDER Argentina to pay Total an amount of \u20ac 10,264,735.62 and US$4,368,881.87, which is the present total of \"the costs reasonably incurred\" by the Claimant in this arbitration, with interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date of the Award until final payment.\"3\n\nAs of the hearing on the merits Total and Argentina had filed 690 and 274 exhibits, respectively. This is without considering legal authorities, witness statements and expert reports.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 29.\n\n20.\n\nOn May 9, 2008, the Respondent requested the Tribunal\u2019s authorisation to produce certain documents. On May 15, 2008, the Claimant filed observations on the Respondent\u2019s request. By letter dated May 21, 2008, Ms. Natali Sequeira, Secretary of the Tribunal, informed the parties that the Tribunal had determined that the new exhibit RA-299, which Argentina sought to place on the record of the case, as well as exhibits RA 294-297 already introduced by the Respondent as annexes to its posthearing brief, were inadmissible. By the same letter, the parties were informed that, as a matter of due process and in view of the stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal had decided not to take into consideration new evidence and arguments submitted subsequent to the post-hearing briefs.\n\n21.\n\nOn February 20, 2009, the Claimant requested the Tribunal\u2019s authorisation to produce a number of documents concerning developments involving certain Argentine authorities that had affected TGN. On March 20, 2009, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant's request and requested authorisation to produce documents on the same issue concerning TGN. On April 9, 2009, the Tribunal issued a further decision on production of documents. Recalling its previous decision of May 21, 2008, the Tribunal restated that it would not take into consideration new evidence and arguments submitted subsequent to the post-hearing briefs and that it would rely solely on the evidence and the parties\u2019 submissions already on the record of the case.\n\n22.\n\nOn October 23, 2009, Argentina wrote to the Centre in order to inform the Tribunal about facts related to a labour dispute between Total and one of its former employees. According to Argentina\u2019s letter, the facts on which the aforementioned labour dispute are based are of particular relevance to these arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal expresses its doubts that the facts outlined by the Respondent in its letter are relevant to the ongoing arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent is seeking to place new documents and arguments on the record of the case, contrary to the previous decisions taken by the Tribunal relating to the production of documents. The Respondent\u2019s request was absolutely out of time in view of the stage of the proceedings. The Tribunal determines, therefore, that it cannot either admit these documents as evidence or take into consideration the legal arguments based thereon.\n\n2. ***General Overview of the Subject Matter of the Dispute and of Total\u2019s Claims and Request for Relief***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it useful to sum up briefly at the outset the subject-matter of the dispute, in fact and in law, as presented by the Claimant in its \"Request for Arbitration\" and subsequently particularised.\n\n24.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Total submits that it is a company incorporated in accordance with the laws of France, having its registered office in France and, therefore, that it qualifies as a French \"investor\" within the meaning of Article 1.2(b) of the BIT. Total has made a number of investments in Argentina in the gas transportation, hydrocarbons exploration and production and power generation industries. According to Total, its investments in Argentina include majority and minority shareholding interests in companies operating in the gas transportation, exploration and production and power generation sectors, as well as various licences, rights, concessions and loans, each of which qualifies as an \"investment\" in accordance with the meaning of this term in Article 1.1 of the BIT.\n\n25.\n\nTotal maintains that it made its investments in each of the various areas on the basis of the representations and promises made by the Argentine government about the legal and regulatory framework for privatised gas transmission companies, the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the power generation industry. Total alleges that a number of measures taken by the Argentine government, most of which derived from or followed Law 25,561/02 (the \"Emergency Law\"), together with the Emergency Law itself, breached or revoked the commitments made to attract investment and upon which Total relied in making its investments. More specifically, Total indicates that these measures include:\n\n- the forced conversion of dollar-denominated public service tariffs into pesos (or \"pesification\") at a rate of one to one;\n\n- the abolition of the adjustment of public service tariffs based on the US Producer Price Index (\"PPI\") and other international indices;\n\n- the \"pesification\" of dollar-denominated private contracts at a rate of one to one;\n\n- the freezing of the gas consumer tariff (which is the sum of the: (a) wellhead price of gas; (b) gas transportation tariff; and (c) gas distribution tariff);\n\n- the imposition of: (a) export withholding taxes on the sale of hydrocarbons; and (b) restrictions on the export of such hydrocarbons;\n\n- the abandonment of the uniform marginal price mechanism in the power generation market by price caps and other regulatory measures;\n\n- the pesification, at a one to one rate, of all other payments to which power generators are entitled; and\n\n- the refusal to pay power generators their dues, even at the dramatically reduced values resulting from the Measures.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the measures adopted by Argentina have resulted in several breaches of the BIT. As to Total\u2019s gas transmission assets, Total argues that the Measures: expropriated Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT; resulted in unfair and inequitable treatment of Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Article 3 of the BIT; discriminated against Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT; and are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligation to respect specific undertakings contrary to Article 10 of the BIT.\n\n27.\n\nAs to Total\u2019s investments in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas, Total claims that the Measures: revoked Total\u2019s right freely to dispose of its hydrocarbons in breach of the duty of fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT; affected Total\u2019s hydrocarbon production in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner contrary to Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT by benefiting domestic, industrial, commercial or residential consumers to the detriment of Total; and restricted Total\u2019s export of hydrocarbons in further breach of the duty to accord fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n28.\n\nIn relation to Total\u2019s investments in the power generation sector, Total claims that Argentina, through the Measures: failed to observe its obligation to refrain from taking measures equivalent to expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT; breached the duty of fair and equitable treatment in Article 3 of the BIT; and discriminated against Total\u2019s investments in Central Puerto and HPDA in breach of Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n29.\n\nBased on the above, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to declare that Argentina, by its various acts and the conduct specified in Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration and Memorials, breached the above mentioned Articles of the BIT. In its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant seeks compensation for the alleged damages caused to its investment by Argentina\u2019s violations of the BIT \"in an amount to be assessed and which is provisionally assessed to be no less than US$ 940 million\", in addition to interest, additional reparation to be further specified and payment by Argentina of all arbitration costs and expenses.\n\n30.\n\nTo support its request for damages, during the arbitral proceedings, Total filed three reports by its experts Mr. Spiller and Mr. Adbala (LECG, LLC). Based on the data contained in these Reports4, in its Post-Hearing Brief, Total claimed damages in the aggregate amount, as of 31 December 2006 of US$1,292,100,000, divided as between each of its various claims of breach of the BIT by Argentina as set forth below,5\n\nThe reports by Mr. Abdala and Mr. Spiller are as follows: \"Assessment of Argentina\u2019s Recent Regulatory Conduct in Electricity Generation\" (hereinafter LECG Report on Electricity), dated May 16, 2007; \"Damage Valuation for Total\u2019s Investments in Argentina\" (hereinafter LECG Report on Damages), dated May 18, 2007; and \"Corrections and Updates to \"Damage Valuation for Total\u2019s Investments in Argentina\" (hereinafter LECG Addendum on Damages), dated December 27, 2007.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 1161. The Tribunal notes that in Total\u2019s Annual Management Report of the Board of Directors for the year 2002, which was submitted at the hearing on the merits, the following statement appears at p. 34: \"Non-recurring items in 2002, comprised mainly of impairments in Argentina related to gas and power assets and the LPG marketing activity, had a negative impact on operating income of 659 M\u20ac.\"\n\n31.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Total submitted the following Request for Relief to the Tribunal:\n\n\"On the basis of the foregoing and the Claimant\u2019s prior written pleadings, the Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal, dismissing all contrary requests and submissions by Argentina:\n\n(i) DECLARE that Argentina has breached Article 5(2) of the Treaty by taking measures which deprived the Claimant\u2019s investment in TGN of substantially all of its value without provision for the payment of the prompt and adequate compensation required under Article 5(2) of the Treaty;\n\n(ii) DECLARE that Argentina has breached Article 3 of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant and its investments in TGN, the hydrocarbons exploration and production sector and the Claimant\u2019s equity participations in Central Puerto and HPDA;\n\n(iii) DECLARE that Argentina has breached Article 5(1) of the Treaty by failing to \"fully and completely protect[ ] and safeguard[ ]\" the Claimant\u2019s investments in TGN, in the hydrocarbons exploration and production sector, and as an equity investor in Central Puerto and HPDA;\n\n(iv) DECLARE that Argentina has breached Article 4 of the Treaty by taking discriminatory measures to the detriment of the Claimant in respect of its investments in TGN, in the hydrocarbons exploration and production sector, and in respect of its equity participations in Central Puerto and HPDA;\n\n(v) ORDER Argentina to compensate the Claimant for the foregoing breaches of the Treaty and international law, in the aggregate amount as of 31 December 2006 of US$1,292,100,000;\n\n(vi) ORDER Argentina to pay compound pre-judgment interest on all amounts awarded under (v) above, accruing from 1 January 2007 until the date of the Award, at a rate of:\n\ni. 13.5% per annum for damages with respect to TGN;\n\nii. 12.18% per annum for damages with respect to Total Austral; and\n\niii. the current six-month US Treasury bond rate for damages with respect to HPDA and Central Puerto;\n\n(vii) ORDER Argentina to pay compound interest, from the date of the Tribunal\u2019s Award to the date of Argentina\u2019s final payment to the Claimant, at the six-month US Treasury bond rate on any and all amounts of compensation ordered by the Tribunal;\n\n(viii) ORDER Argentina to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal and the Claimant, the fees and expenses of the Claimant\u2019s legal representation in respect of this arbitration, and any other costs of this arbitration, to be specified in the Claimant\u2019s costs submissions, to follow, plus interest; and\n\n(ix) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.\"6\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 1161.\n\n32.\n\nOn the basis of the facts and legal arguments set forth in its briefs, as well as the statements and reports made and documents submitted by its witnesses and experts, Argentina asks the Arbitral Tribunal to dismiss each and every one of Total\u2019s claims and to order the Claimant to pay all of the expenses and legal costs deriving from this arbitration,7 including Argentina\u2019s own costs amounting to US$1,215,222.99.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 664.\n\n***3. Applicable Law***\n-----------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 8(4) of the BIT provides the sources of law to be applied in this arbitration. However, they disagree as to the hierarchy or order of application of these sources of law. Article 8(4) of the BIT provides:\n\nThe ruling of the arbitral body shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the legislation of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law.\n\n34.\n\nTotal submits that international law and Argentina\u2019s law apply to distinct aspects of the dispute and at different analytical stages.8 Total sets its analysis out in the following way:\n\n(a) At the first stage, the tribunal must decide whether particular assets or rights constituting the putative investment exist. In this context, the law of the host state is naturally relevant, because the bundle of rights that constitute an investment is a creature of domestic law;\n\n(b) At the second stage, the Tribunal must determine whether or not those rights constitute an investment protected by the applicable Treaty. This issue has been already resolved by the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction, and is therefore not in question here;\n\n(c) Finally, at the third stage, the conduct of the host state must be examined on the basis of the substantive standards set out in the applicable Treaty, which must be complemented by the \"relevant principles of international law\". These standards are the basis on which the liability of the state must be assessed.9\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 152.\n\nSee TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, para. 152, footnotes omitted.\n\n35.\n\nTotal submits that Argentine law is only relevant as factual evidence of Total\u2019s investments, but that international law is relevant to the question of whether and how Total\u2019s investments are protected under the BIT and that Argentina\u2019s compliance with its duties of protection under the BIT must be analyzed exclusively under the BIT and relevant principles of international law. Total says its position is consistent with fundamental principles of international law, including Article 27 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\") and the International Law Committee Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\").10 Total maintains that Argentina cannot use its domestic law to avoid liability at international law and, in any event, that Argentine law is consistent with the BIT.11\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 155 and the sources cited there.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 159 - 175 and 389.\n\n36.\n\nArgentina submits that, pursuant to Article 8(4) of the BIT, Argentine law is not only relevant as factual evidence of Total\u2019s investments but is also a source of law, as are the BIT and the relevant principles of international law.12 According to Argentina, this implies that:\n\n\"in order to determine the scope and/or the violation of the international parameters and of the investor protection standards contemplated, it is essential to analyze the application of the internal law under consideration to the controverted issue, specially emphasizing the circumstances of each case, which is a universal law criterion.\"13\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 497, 499.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 501.\n\n37.\n\nArgentina suggests that Total\u2019s position that Argentina\u2019s Measures are incompatible with both Argentine law and international law contradicts Total\u2019s assertion that Argentine law is only relevant to determining questions of fact. Finally, Argentina submits that, because Argentine law is applicable to the merits of the dispute before the Tribunal, it could invoke a so-called emergency principle that exists in Argentina\u2019s legal system.14 Under this emergency principle, the Argentine Congress is empowered to enact emergency rules affecting property rights where a serious economic situation so requires. Argentina\u2019s legal system permits the application of such emergency rules to situations that it considers to be sufficiently serious (such as the economic emergency of 2001-2002).15 According to Argentina, this emergency principle, as developed and acknowledged by the Supreme Court of the Argentine Republic since 1920, is relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of whether the BIT has been breached.16 In conclusion, Argentina submits that since this emergency doctrine is firmly established in Argentina\u2019s legal system, Total could not (and should not) have ignored it.17 In Argentina\u2019s words:\n\n\"Total knew that under certain emergency conditions, the Argentine courts could legitimate the exceptional measures taken by the Argentine Congress to mitigate the circumstances. Therefore, it should have considered its legitimate expectations at the time of investing, based on the fact that the Argentine law acknowledges the validity of the emergency law provided that, of course, there is a situation serious enough so as to justify the adoption of that kind of measures.\"18\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 502 ff.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 507 ff. referring to the case-law of the Supreme Court of the Argentine Republic according to which emergency rules (such as the Emergency Law of 2002), enacted to cope with economic crises that are so serious as to justify their adoption, are compatible with Argentina\u2019s Constitution.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 504.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 511.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 505.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Argentina-France BIT sets forth directives to arbitral tribunals established under the BIT about the law applicable to disputes relating to investments made under the treaty, without providing for an order of application of these sources of law. Taking into account these arguments of the parties, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to distinguish two different questions.\n\n39.\n\nThe first question concerns the role of Argentina\u2019s domestic law in determining the content and the extent of Total\u2019s economic rights as they exist in Argentina\u2019s legal system. In this regard the Tribunal believes that Argentine law has a broader role than that of just determining factual matters. The content and the scope of Total\u2019s economic rights (in Total\u2019s words, \"Argentina\u2019s commitments to Total\")19 must be determined by the Tribunal in light of Argentina\u2019s legal principles and provisions. Moreover, the extensive reliance by the Claimant on Argentina\u2019s acts of a legislative and administrative nature governing the gas, electricity and hydrocarbons sectors, as well as the extensive discussion between the parties regarding the content and extent of Total\u2019s rights in respect of the operation of its investments, is a recognition that Argentina\u2019s domestic law plays a prominent role.20 Thus, the Tribunal shall determine the precise content and extent of Total\u2019s economic rights under Argentina\u2019s legal system in respect of Total\u2019s claims under the BIT, wherever necessary in order to ascertain whether a breach of the BIT has occurred.\n\nSee also Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 154.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes here that a number of legal authorities to which Total refers in its post-hearing brief supports the role of domestic law as not limited to determining factual questions. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 153 referring to the opinion of Prof. Schreuer according to which \"investment relationships typically involve domestic law as well as international law....\" See also ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina,***  ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award, 22 May 2007, paras 206-207. The above award is quoted by Total in relation to the question of the compatibility of Argentina\u2019s measures affecting the gas sector with Argentina\u2019s Constitution. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 175 ff.\n\n40.\n\nThe second question regards the relevance that Argentina claims the emergency doctrine under Argentine law to have in determining whether a breach of the BIT has taken place. In this regard the Tribunal makes the following observations. First, since Total complains of breaches of the BIT, the Tribunal must apply principally the BIT, as interpreted under international law, to resolve any matter raised. This means that the Tribunal must assess Argentina\u2019s responsibility under the BIT by applying the treaty itself and the relevant rules of customary international law. The Tribunal cannot accept Argentina\u2019s position that, by invoking the emergency principle as it exists under Argentine law, Argentina can avoid international responsibility for violation of the treaty. This would contradict the fundamental principle of international law according to which \"a party may not invoke its internal law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty\" (Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties).21 Secondly, the Tribunal notes that any complaint by Total that Argentina\u2019s measures are in breach of domestic law is not raised *per se* but is used by Total to support Total\u2019s claims under the BIT. Therefore the fact that any domestic measure challenged by Total might be legitimate in Argentina\u2019s legal system thanks to the emergency doctrine would not relieve the Tribunal from examining whether Argentina has nevertheless thereby breached the BIT.\n\nThis principle reflects the general principle of customary international law according to which, for the purpose of State responsibility for the commission of an internationally wrongful act, the characterization of an act as lawful under the State\u2019s internal law is irrelevant. This principle has been restated at Article 3 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts drafted by the International Law Commission and annexed to General Assembly Resolution A/RES/56/83.\n\n***Part II-Total\u2019s Claim in Relation to its Investment in TGN***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Total\u2019s Investment in the Gas Sector***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nAs to Total\u2019s investment in the gas transportation industry, Total explains in its Request for Arbitration that it owned an indirect 19.23% stake in Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A. (\"TGN\"). \"Of this 19.23 per cent stake, 19.19 per cent is indirectly held through Gasinvest, which currently holds a 70.44 per cent stake in TGN and in which Total has a stake of 27.24 per cent; the other 0,038 per cent is directly held by the Total group.\"22 TGN is one of two gas transportation companies established when the Republic of Argentina privatized Gas del Estado in 1992, which had been a \"Sociedad del Estado\", up to then. At that time TGN was granted a licence \"for the rendering of the public gas transportation utilities\"23 in northern and central Argentina for a term of 35 years, extendable at TGN\u2019s option for a further ten years, subject to compliance by TGN with the terms and obligations contained in the licence.24\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, footnote 76 at p. 27 (Exhibit C-275).\n\nSee Decree 2,457/92 (TGN Licence) Article 1 (Exhibit C-53(1)).\n\nSee Article 3.1. and 3.2. Basic Rules of the TGN License attached to Decree 2,457/92 (Exhibit C-53)..\n\n42.\n\nIn May 1992, Argentina enacted Law 24,076 (the \"Gas Law\") and Decree 1738/92 (the \"Gas Decree\"),25 which established the post-privatization legal framework of the gas sector. After an international bidding process, accompanied by an Information Memorandum of September 1992 prepared by Argentina\u2019s financial advisers,26 the government of Argentina sold a 70% share in TGN to Gasinvest (a Consortium of investors27) on December 28, 1992.28 The government of Argentina retained a 25% share in TGN until July 1995 when a second public bidding process took place on the basis of an Offering Memorandum prepared, on request of the government of Argentina, by its financial advisers.29 After having successfully participated in this second bidding process, CMS Gas Transmission Argentina (an Argentinean Company controlled by CMS Energy, a US company) acquired the remaining 25% stake in TGN from the government of Argentina on 26 July, 1995.30\n\nExhibits C-31 and C-48, respectively.\n\nSee Information Memorandum, Privatization of Gas del Estado S.E. dated September 1992 (Exhibit C-50).\n\nThe original members of the Gasinvest consortium are listed in Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration at footnote 95, p. 41.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration, para. 98 at p. 41; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 271-271.\n\nSee \"The Offering Memorandum\" of July 1995 (Exhibit A RA 97), presented by Argentina for the cross-examination of Mr. Charpentier. See also ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005, para. 58.\n\nIt is worth noting that on July 12, 2001, CMS Gas Transmission Company notified its consent to ICSID arbitration and the dispute regarding the freezing of US PPI tariffs adjustment of the gas tariffs, as of January 1, 2000, by Argentine Government under the Argentina-US BIT. On 26 July, 2001, the Centre received CMS\u2019s Request for Arbitration against Argentina.\n\n43.\n\nIn March 2000, one of the investors in the Gasinvest consortium, the TransCanada Group (which had merged with the Nova Group, another Gasinvest shareholder, in June 1998), decided to sell its share and Total made a non binding offer to buy it.\n\n44.\n\nAs to the history of Total\u2019s investment in the Argentine gas transportation sector, according to Total\u2019s own description:\n\n\"Several years after the privatization by Argentina of its Gas sector, Total decided to invest in Argentine gas transportation assets to complement its already significant investments in gas production. In reliance upon the (by then tried and tested) regulatory framework provided by Argentina for gas transportation, on 30 May 2000, Total agreed to purchase a 19.23 per cent stake in TGN from the TransCanada Group (TCPL) for an amount of US$230 million. This transaction was completed, and the shares in TGN were transferred to Total, on 23 January 2001.\"31\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief para. 273, where a diagram explains the corporate structure of Gasinvest and TGN (see also Total\u2019s Memorial para. 53).\n\n45.\n\nFinally, after TGN\u2019s debt restructuring in 2006, Total\u2019s stake in TGN decreased from 19.23% to 15.35%.32\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief para. 582.\n\n***2. Relevant Features of the Gas Regulatory System Invoked by Total***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nTotal\u2019s position is that the general legislation and the specific regulations and provisions in force in Argentina when Total bought its stake in TGN resulted in a legal framework (the \"Gas Regulatory Framework\") that included various types of \"promises\" or \"commitments\" on which Total had relied when making its investment and on which it was entitled to rely.\n\n47.\n\nTotal explains:\n\n\"[...] Total\u2019s decision to make an investment of US$230 million in TGN was based on a careful study of the specific and explicit commitments contained in the Gas Regulatory Framework and in particular:\n\n(a) the promise that the tariff would be sufficient to cover all reasonable costs of providing the service, taxes, amortisations and a reasonable rate of return, known as the \"economic equilibrium\". This economic equilibrium would be preserved by the regulator, ENARGAS, through the following mechanisms:\n\n(i) the tariff would be reviewed by ENARGAS every five years in accordance with certain pre-established criteria, ensuring the maintenance of TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium over the period of the Licence (the Five-Year Tariff Review);\n\n(ii) tariffs could be subject to a non-recurrent review by ENARGAS on \"objective and justified\" grounds (such as to reflect costs variations) or if those tariffs became \"inadequate, unduly discriminatory or preferential\", always ensuring a continued reasonable rate of return for TGN (the Extraordinary Tariff Review). This could be triggered by the Licensee or consumers;\n\n(iii) the tariff would be calculated in dollars and converted into pesos for billing purposes only, and would be adjusted every six months in accordance with variations in the US Producer Price Index (the US PPI);\n\n(b) the tariff would not be frozen or subject to regulation or price control without full compensation from the Government and the basic rules of the TGN Licence (which included the tariff regime) would not be changed without TGN\u2019s consent.\"33\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 274 [footnotes omitted].\n\n48.\n\nAll of Argentina\u2019s commitments listed by Total in its submissions are set forth in the Gas Law, the Gas Decree and an administrative act containing the TGN Licence, Decree 2,457/92 dated 18 December 1992 (the \"TGN Licence\"). Total claims that the changes, which Argentina unilaterally made to that legal framework, were in breach of those commitments and resulted at the same time in a violation of various BIT provisions to Total\u2019s prejudice.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined all of the legislation and the regulations referred to by Total. The Gas Law regulates the gas transportation and distribution activities which, pursuant to Article 1, are considered to be a \"national public service\". The Law establishes in Article 2 a series of paramount principles that govern the gas regime and ENARGAS *(\"Ente Nacional Regulador del Gas\",* the Regulatory Body in the Gas sector) enforcement activity. The protection of consumer rights is the first objective of the Law (Article 2(a)), followed by that of fostering investments for the purpose of guaranteeing the gas supply in the long term (Article 2(b)). The Law also states the principle that gas transportation and distribution activities are to be regulated to ensure just and reasonable tariffs (Article 2(d)) and to \"[c]ause the natural gas supply price to the industry be equal to the international price in force in countries with similar resources and conditions.\" (Article 2(g))\n\n50.\n\nThe Gas Law establishes at Article 38(a) the principle of guaranteeing to efficient Licensees sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable operational costs of the service, taxes, amortisations, and a reasonable rate of return according to the criteria of Article 39. More specifically, according to Article 38(a), \"[s]ervices rendered as to transportation and distribution will be offered at tariffs adjusted to the following principles: a) To provide transportation and distribution companies operating in an economical and prudent way with the chance to obtain sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable costs, including, taxes, amortization and a reasonable rate of return as set forth in the following Article; Article 39 provides that: \"In order to provide a reasonable rate of return to such efficient companies, the tariffs applied to transportation and distribution companies must entail: a) such revenue to be similar to the revenue of other activities with similar or comparable risk; b) a relationship between the efficiency and the satisfactory rendering of services.\"\n\n51.\n\nThe Gas Law provides for two mechanisms according to which ENARGAS has to review tariffs. Article 42 of the Gas Law provides for a periodic Five-Year Tariff Review (to be carried out by ENARGAS according to the principles of Articles 38 and 39), which will set out new maximum tariffs according to the rules contained in Article 39. Precisely, [e]very FIVE (5) years, the ENARGAS shall review the tariff adjustment system. Such review must be performed in accordance with the provisions of Articles 38 and 39 and will set new maximum tariffs as per Article 39 hereof.\"\n\n52.\n\nArticles 46 and 47 enable both Licensees and consumers to require ENARGAS to carry out an Extraordinary Review of tariffs, of \"charges, maximum prices, classifications or services set forth in the terms of the authorization to operate\", provided that their modifications are reasonably required by specific unforeseeable circumstances of an extraordinary character (Articles 46(2) and 47 of the Gas Law). According to Article 46(1), \"[t]ransportation and distribution companies, as well as users, may request the ENARGAS to modify the tariffs, charges, maximum prices, classifications, or services set forth in accordance with terms of the authorization to operate, considered necessary if the request is based on objective and justified circumstances.\"34 Furthermore, Article 46 of the Gas Decree specifies the nature of the \"objective and justified circumstances\" that shall support a request by consumers or Public utilities to modify tariffs under the Extraordinary Tariff Review. According to the Gas Decree (Article 46), \"the modifications provided for in Article 46 of the Law must be based on specific circumstances not provided for previously and cannot be recurrent. Such modifications do not include the readjustment set forth in Article 42 of the Law.\" According to Article 47 of the Gas Law: \"When ENARGAS deems, as a consequence of proceedings initiated ex officio or by private action, that there are reasons to consider a tariff, charge, classification or service of a transportation or distribution company is inadequate, unduly discriminatory or preferential, it shall notify such circumstance to the transportation or distribution company and it shall make it public by calling a Public Hearing for such purpose no later than FIFTEEN (15) days after such notice.\" According to the last sentence of Article 47: \"Once such hearing takes place, it shall decide within the term stated in Article 46 above.\"\n\nArticle 46(2) of the Gas Law provides that: \"Once the request for modification is received, ENARGAS must adopt a resolution within the term of SIXTY (60) days prior to the calling for Public Hearing which must be held no later than FIFTEEN (15) days after reception of said request.\"\n\n53.\n\nAs to the calculation of the tariffs in dollars of the United States of America. (\"US$\" or \"US dollars\"), Article 41(2) of the Gas Decree provides that: \"Tariffs for transportation and distribution shall be calculated in United States dollars. The resulting tariff chart shall be expressed in pesos to be converted according to Law No. 23,928, taking into account, for their reconversion to pesos, the parity set in Article 3 of Decree No. 2,128/91.\" The TGN Licence also contains a number of rules regarding the tariffs and their calculation. Section 9.2 of the TGN Licence provides that: \"Annex III of the Decree approving these Basic Rules contains the tariff to be perceived by the Licensee. Said tariff shall only be modified according to the provisions of this Law, the Regulatory Decree, these Basic Rules and the provisions of the tariff itself.\" Furthermore, \"[t]he tariff has been calculated in United States dollars. The adjustments of 9.3 shall be calculated in United States dollars.\" More precisely, \"[t]he resulting or recalculated Tariff Chart shall be expressed, at the time of its application for billing in pesos at the rate of convertibility set in Article 3 of Decree 2,128/91, implementing Law No. 23,928, and its eventual modifications.\" Annex III contains the Basic Rules regarding the TGN Licence and establishes that: \"Tariffs are expressed in pesos to be converted according to Law No. 23928.\"\n\n54.\n\nAs to the periodic adjustment of the US dollar tariffs, the first paragraph of Article 41 of the Gas Law does not provide any specific mechanism such as the US PPI adjustment on a semi-annual basis. Instead it provides in more general terms that: \"During the authorization to operate, tariffs shall be adjusted in accordance with a methodology based on international market indicators reflecting changes in assets and services value representing suppliers\u2019 activities. Such indicators shall be adjusted, in turn, in more or less, by a factor meant to stimulate efficiency and installations constructions, operation and maintenance investments at the same time. Such methodology shall reflect any tax variations on tariffs.\" According to Article 41(3) of the Gas Decree, \"The methodology to adjust the transportation and distribution companies\u2019 tariffs based on international markets indicators set in Article 41 hereof shall be included in the corresponding authorizations to operate. The ENARGAS shall determine the necessary information requirements to monitor the adequate application of the mechanism set forth in the terms of the authorization to operate, within the term and periods set forth therein. The ENARGAS shall not be able to suspend, limit or reject such tariff adjustments except in cases of error in calculation and/or applied proceedings.\" The reference to US PPI is found instead in Section 9.4.1.1 of the TGN Licence. This section provides that: \"Transportation tariffs shall be adjusted semi-annually in accordance with PPI variations.\"\n\n55.\n\nAs to the Gas Regulatory Framework described above, Total distinguishes between \u2018core commitments\u2019 and \u2018additional commitments\u2019. As to the \u2018core commitments\u2019, in Total\u2019s words:\n\n\"[...] The overarching promise of the Gas Regulatory Framework was that TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium would be maintained throughout the 35 to 45 years of its Licence. That is to say that Argentina promised that TGN\u2019s regulated tariff, which represented 98% of its revenue, was and would continue to be regulated so as to provide TGN with sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable costs, including taxes, amortizations and capital costs, and make a \"reasonable rate of return\" similar to activities of comparable risk.\"35\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20 [footnotes omitted].\n\n56.\n\nTotal submits further that:\n\n\"The Gas Regulatory Framework contained two additional commitments which supported the promise of economic equilibrium. It provided that TGN\u2019s tariffs could be automatically adjusted to ensure that its revenue would always be sufficient to cover its mainly dollar denominated costs:\n\n(c) First, Argentina promised that TGN\u2019s tariffs were and would be calculated in dollars, and converted to Argentine pesos for billing purposes only.  \n (d) Secondly, Argentina provided that TGN\u2019s dollar tariffs would be automatically adjusted every six months in accordance with variations in the US Producer Price Index (the US PPI), thereby preserving its dollar revenue in real dollar terms.\"36  \n Total further points out that: \"[...] the Gas Regulatory Framework provided two mechanisms designed to allow the regulator, ENARGAS, to set and restore TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium on both a recurrent and non-recurrent (extraordinary) basis. The Gas Regulatory Framework provided that:  \n (a) tariffs would be reviewed by ENARGAS every five years in order to set the tariffs for the next five-year period, taking into account TGN\u2019s planned investments and potential efficiencies, always ensuring sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable costs, including taxes, amortisations and capital costs, and a \"reasonable rate of return\" (the Five-Year Tariff Review);  \n (b) if TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium was disrupted, tariffs could be subject to a non-recurrent review by ENARGAS on \"objective and justified\" grounds (such as to reflect costs variations) or if the tariffs became \"inadequate, unduly discriminatory or preferential\", always ensuring sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable costs, including taxes, amortisations and capital costs, and a \"reasonable rate of return\" for TGN (the Extraordinary Tariff Review); Argentina further bolstered its promise of stable and sufficient revenues with several stabilisation clauses. Argentina promised that tariffs would not be frozen or subject to regulation or price control without full compensation from the Government, and that the basic rules of the TGN Licence (which included the tariff regime) would not be changed without TGN\u2019s consent.\"37\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21 [footnotes omitted],\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 22-23 [footnotes omitted],\n\n57.\n\nTotal also points to the terms of TGN\u2019s Licence and to the Bidding Rules38 enacted by Argentina in 1992, regulating the participation of interested parties in the international bidding process that was aimed at selling the privatized companies, notwithstanding that Total did not participate in this process.\n\n***Pliego de bases y condiciones para el llamado a licitaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica internacional para la privatizaci\u00f3n de Gas del Estado Go.*** 33-0150 (Exhibit C-49).\n\n58.\n\nTotal considers that three rules in the TGN Licence should be qualified as \"stabilisation clauses\".39 First, Section 9.8 establishes under the heading *\u2018Inaplicabilidad de Controles de Precios \u2019* that: \"The Licensee tariff regime shall not be subject to freezing, management and/or price control orders. If, in spite of this provision, the Licensee is obliged to adapt to a tariff control regime establishing a lower level than that resulting from the Tariff, the Licensee shall be entitled to receive equal compensation payable by the Grantor.\" Secondly, Section 9.1 provides that: \"The Service Rules may be periodically modified, after the effective date, by the Regulating Authority, to adapt it to the evolution and improvement of the Licensed Service. When such modifications are not due to the Licensee\u2019s initiative, it must be consulted previously. Said modifications cannot alter these Basic Rules and, should they alter the economic-financial equilibrium of the License, a tariff review shall be carried out as determined by the Regulating Authority.\" Finally, Section 18.2 provides that: \"The Grantor shall not modify these Basic Rules, in whole or in part, except by prior written consent expressed by the Licensee and prior recommendation of the Regulating Authority. Those provisions modifying the Service Rules and the Tariff adopted by the Regulating Authority shall not be deemed modifications to the Licence in force, notwithstanding the right of the Licensee to require the corresponding Tariff readjustment if the net effect of such modification alters, in a favourable or unfavourable sense, the economic-financial equilibrium existing prior to such modification.\"\n\nSee above para. 56, quoting Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22-23.\n\n59.\n\nTotal has also invoked the violation by Argentina of TGN Bidding Rules (Annex F). These Bidding Rules had been prepared by Argentina in 1992 for the international bidding process aimed at selling TGN stocks that occurred in November-December 1992. As also explained by the Information Memorandum on Privatization of Gas del Estado S.E., the Bidding Rules of 1992, which were approved by the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services (Ministerial Decree No. 874/92), prescribed \"the qualification, bidding and award process and the requirements which must be satisfied in order to submit a bid for one or more of the new companies\" and deadlines for interested parties to make their offer for the new companies.40 These Rules were, therefore, addressed to the parties who participated in the award process in November-December 1992.\n\nSee Information Memorandum, Privatization of Gas del Estado S.E., ***supra*** note 26 at p. 10 and the timetable for the bidding and award process at p. 12.\n\n***3. The Suspension of the PPI Tariff Adjustment in 2000***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nHaving described the legal regime for the gas transportation sector in place since 1992 on which Total relies, the Tribunal recalls that Argentina has pointed to two developments it considers to be relevant because they had taken place shortly before or while Total was proceeding to acquire the TGN shares. Argentina is of the view that these developments weakened the Gas Regulatory Framework and that Total should have considered this when it made its investment.\n\n61.\n\nFirst, Argentina points to Law No. 25,344 enacted on October 19, 2000 that had declared \"the emergency of the economic and financial situation and of the contracts by the Argentine public sector\". This Law, \"[...] specifically triggered extraordinary prerogatives in relation to administrative contracts, suspended all lawsuits against the Argentine Government and consolidated its debt (deferment of payments).\"41 Although Argentina recognizes that this law was not applicable to public service sectors, Argentina contends that the issuance of that law was a legal recognition that an \"economic and financial emergency\" was already in place in 2001, when Total made its investments in both the gas transportation and the electricity generation sectors, a fact that Total should have taken into account in evaluating the macroeconomic and regulatory risk involved.42\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 68-69 (as to this law in general, paras. 70-73).\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 68. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that Argentina had pointed to Law 25,344 for the first time at the Hearings on the Merits when witness Belluscio mentioned it.\n\n62.\n\nSecondly, Argentina points with repeated emphasis to a development that was specific to the gas sector. On January 6, 2000 (therefore before Total\u2019s offer to TransCanada Group dated 30 May, 2000 for the 19.23% stake in TGN) ENARGAS and the gas licensees (including TGN) concluded the first agreement to exceptionally (and just once) suspend the US PPI Adjustment of gas tariffs from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2000, and to defer its application up to June 30, 2000 (Article 1 *Acta Acuerdo)43* At the same time, Article 1 of the *Acta Acuerdo* provided for a full recovery by the Licensees of the suspended adjustments between July 1, 2000 and April 30, 2001. The *Acta Acuerdo\u2019* s reasons and its legal basis are stated in its Preamble and are connected with the severe recession taking place in Argentina\u2019s economy. The Preamble recalls that the *Seer etar ia de Energia del Ministerio de Economia* (the \"SoE\") had taken the initiative to ask Licensees to consider a temporary suspension of the US PPI adjustment in accordance with the objectives stated in Article 2 of the Gas Law and its implementing regulations.44 The Preamble mentions also that the SoE \"has expressed its concern as regards the current economic situation *[i.e.* the ongoing deep recession and deflation] and the need to provide solutions in accordance with the economic plan designed from time to time by the National Authorities, not affecting the compliance with the legislation of the regulatory framework in force.\" As to the Licensees\u2019 position, the Preamble stated that, on the one hand, the Licensees were \"conscious of the social needs which have arisen as a consequence of the general economic situation sustained by the country\"; on the other, they \"want to remark that such situation is not isolated from the economic integrity and its results, therefore, the full force of the public policies of privatization are essential.\" (fourth sentence).\n\nSee Exhibit C-II9.\n\nAs to the objectives of the Gas Law, see above para. 49. Taking into account the aim of the ***Acta Acuerdo*** to mitigate the negative effect of Argentina\u2019s economic recession and deflation on the general population, the Tribunal considers that the protection of consumer rights established in Article 2(a) Gas Law is particularly relevant here. This conclusion is expressly supported by Decree 669/00 containing the Second ***Acta Acuerdo*** (see Decree\u2019s Preamble eighth and ninth sentences).\n\n63.\n\nAs to this development concerning the Gas Regulatory Framework, Total has not denied that, while deciding to make its investments in TGN, it was aware of the above-mentioned *Acta Acuerdo.* Rather, Total contends that \"Given that this agreement was made on an \"exceptional and only once\" basis, as a favour to a new regime *[i.e.* Fernando De la Rua\u2019s new administration], and that the deferred US PPI was to be recovered six months later with interest, Total did not take the deferral into account in its valuation of TGN nor in the offer it made to TCPL.\"45\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 77.\n\n64.\n\nOn August 4, 2000, after the Total/TransCanada Group Share Purchase Agreement dated 30 May, 2000 (but prior to the completion of the sale), Argentina enacted Decree No. 669/00 (\"The application of the adjustment on the corresponding tariffs in 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.4 of the Basic Rules of the Gas Transportation and Distribution License in order to mitigate the economic impact caused by the application of international market indicators, affecting the general population and the industrial sector. Application of the adjustment related to the Producer Price Index, Industrial Commodities (PPI). Agreement signed by the Government and the Licensees.\")46 This decree of July 2000 approved the second agreement *(Acta Acuerdo)* between the government and the gas licensees (in this case including TGN) to further defer and suspend the US PPI adjustment of gas tariffs until June 30, 2002. The second *Acta Acuerdo* was premised on the existence of a \"deep crisis\" that made it necessary to mitigate the impact of the reference to international prices. The Decree\u2019s Preamble (eleventh sentence) stated that \"in order to understand in full the depth of this crisis, it is necessary that the State and the gas Licensees, with the sole and specific purpose of mitigating the impact on the economy generated by the application of international market indicators in tariffs to users of natural gas adopt measures to avoid a severely negative economic effect for the general population and the industry as well.\" Thus, the Decree contradicted the solemn statement in the first *Acta Acuerdo* that the first suspension would be exceptional and non-recurrent. The Tribunal notes that the Decree\u2019s Preamble included a significant reference to Argentina\u2019s commitments under its investment treaties: \"that the privatization process and the investments resulting from it find the legal protection of the rules in force, and, specifically, also in the Bilateral Investment Treaties entered into by the ARGENTINE REPUBLIC and ratified by several laws.\" (fourth sentence). In addition, the Decree\u2019s Preamble went on to state that \"[...] said adjustment system constitutes a basic statement, condition of the bids and offers awarded as a consequence of them, therefore, it entails a legitimately acquired right by the succeeding Licensees in each License.\" (fifth sentence)\n\nExhibit C-54.\n\n65.\n\nA few days later (on August 18, 2000), on request of the \u2018 *Defensor del Pueblo de la Nation\u2019* (the Ombudsman), Judge Clara Maria do Pico issued an injunction suspending the application of Decree 669/00.47 The Ombudsman disputed as contrary to the rights and interests of consumers the subsequent recovery in full of the US PPI adjustment with 8.2% interest after the period of suspension (after June 30, 2002), provided for in Decree 669/00 through the creation of a specific fund (el *Fondo de Estabilizaci\u00f3n del PPI).* According to the Ombudsman, this mechanism for recovering the deferred US PPI adjustment did not consider the prejudice to consumer interests and the radical change in the economic circumstances as of 1999. The Ombudsman referred to the deep recession taking place in Argentina\u2019s economy and the deflation experienced by Argentina since 1999 on the one hand, and to the unusual increase in prices in the United States of America (\"US\") on the other hand. The judge accepted this argument and found that the full recovery of the deferred US PPI adjustment provided for in the Decree was in contrast with the core principle that tariffs shall be just and reasonable not only for Licensees but also for consumers (Art. 9.1, Annex B, Decree 2255/92 *Reglamento del Servicio y Tarifas).* Moreover, according to the judge, these new economic circumstances could be qualified as \"justified objective circumstances\", thereby calling for an Extraordinary Tariff Review by ENARGAS and requiring the taking into account of consumer interests. According to the judge, the government and ENARGAS acted improperly and beyond the Gas Regulatory Framework by providing for the US PPI adjustment through Decree 669/00 without the intervention of consumers in public tariff review proceedings (such as the Extraordinary Tariff Review according to Article 47 of the Gas Law).\n\nSee Exhibit C-122.\n\n66.\n\nPromptly thereafter, on August 28, 2000, considering that this judicial suspension of Decree 669/00 breached the US-Argentina BIT, CMS Gas Transmission, a shareholder in TGN, sent a letter to the President of the Argentine Republic to start the 6-month period of negotiation required under the Argentina-US BIT prior to commencing ICSID arbitration. On September 22, 2000, ENARGAS, the Ministry of Economy and the Attorney General appealed this injunction but ultimately were without success.48 On January 23, 2001, Total closed the acquisition of TGN\u2019s 19.23% stake. As to these events, which occurred while Total was making its investment in TGN and were deemed by another foreign (US) shareholder to be a potential breach of the US-Argentina BIT, Total contends that: \"Given the government\u2019s own appeal against the decision, and the weak legal grounds on which it perceived the decision was based, TGN was confident that it would soon be overturned. As a result, this development did not impact the completion of the sale to Total.\"49\n\nSee Exhibit C-125. The Government\u2019s appeal was rejected by the Buenos Aires Court of Appeals on October 5, 2001. TGN and the other Licensees also appealed the injunction.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 81 (as these events generally para. 80).\n\n67.\n\nTo the contrary, Argentina contends that Law No. 25,344 was part of a chronology of emergency events, which started with the two Agreements *(Actas Acuerdo)* and were followed by the preliminary injunction suspending the inflation adjustment to account for the US PPI in the gas transportation sector. Moreover, Argentina points out that \"All these events are prior to the investment made by TOTAL in the gas and electricity generation sector.\"50 Given all of the above facts, and in contrast with Total\u2019s description in its Opening Statement at the Hearings, Argentina has described the context in which Total made its investments in both the gas transportation sector and the electricity generation sector in the following terms:\n\n\"[...] (a) instead of \"a conscious policy of the Argentine Government to attract foreign investments,\" there existed a desperate policy to save the economy; (b) instead of a State Reform Law implementing a \"massive privatization program,\" there was an Economic Emergency Law authorizing the intervention of administrative contracts; (c) instead of the recent signature of 39 BITs, there were two Agreements and a preliminary injunction with effects with respect to natural gas transportation and distribution licenses, and an investor (CMS) who resorted to the ICSID; and (d) instead of a recent currency pegged to the US dollar pursuant to the Convertibility Law as a measure against hyperinflation, there was a currency heading for a mega-devaluation, and an economic and social situation that was described in an emergency law as a \"deep depression process.\"51\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 75 [italics in original].\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\n***4. The Measures Challenged by Total: the Emergency Law***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nHaving reviewed the different legal provisions that the parties consider relevant to Total\u2019s investment, the Tribunal now turns to Argentina\u2019s Measures challenged by Total as having \"completely destroyed\" that framework in breach of the protection conferred by the BIT.\n\n69.\n\nAccording to Total, the Measures enacted by Argentina that breached its commitments towards Total are all contained in or took place pursuant to the Emergency Law of January 6, 2002. More specifically, in Total\u2019s words,52 \"[...] each and every one of the core commitments upon which Total relied on making its investment has been abrogated, as shown in the chart below:\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 37.\n\n70.\n\nBefore examining in detail the provisions challenged by Total and their effect on the legal framework on which Total relies, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recall the economic, social and political evolution of Argentina that led to the Emergency Law and to the major policy and legal initiatives taken by the authorities to cope with the crisis. This evolution and the emergency legislation are relevant also to the Tribunal\u2019s examination of the other issues raised by Total in this arbitration.\n\n***4.1 Argentina\u2019s Economic Evolution Leading to the 2001/02 Emergency***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Emergency Law, which Total challenges, was enacted by Argentina during the well-known economic, political and social crisis experienced by the country during 2001-2002, in response to that crisis and as an attempt to control and overcome it. This crisis has been defined both as one of the worst economic crises in its history and \"among the most severe of recent economic crises\" worldwide.53\n\nSee IMF Occasional Paper N\u00b0 236, ***Lessons from the Crisis in Argentina*** (2005) (hereinafter IMF, ***Lessons from the Crisis)*** (Exhibit C-454); IMF, ***The IMF and Argentina 1991-2001,*** IMF, Independent Evaluation Office, 2004 (hereinafter IMF ***Evaluation Report),*** 8. As stated in the Preface to the Report, the Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF (IEO), which authored the Report, \"was created in 2001 to provide objective and independent evaluations on issues relevant to the IMF. It operates independently of IMF management and at arm\u2019s length from the IMF Executive Board\". IMF ***Evaluation Report*** \"evaluates the role of the IMF in Argentina during 1991-2001, focusing particularly on the period of crisis management from 2000 to early 2002\", ***ibid*** 11. In its description of the crisis, the Tribunal relies on ***Lessons from the Crisis,*** the ***Evaluation Report,*** as well as on the summaries in previous ICSID awards dealing with the effects of Argentina\u2019s crisis, such as ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, available at **http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/ContinentalCasualtvAward.pdf**\n\n72.\n\nArgentina\u2019s crisis of 2001-2002 occurred after three years of deep recession and deflation. Nevertheless, Argentina\u2019s means to cope with this deep recession were constrained by the fact that the convertibility of pesos at par with the US dollar under its currency board system prevented recourse to devaluation.54\n\nThe IMF in hindsight attributes the origin of the crisis to a number of factors hitting Argentina in the second half of 1998. Among the external factors, IMF ***Evaluation Report*** (see ***supra*** note 53) identifies the appreciation of the US dollar and the devaluation of the Brazilian real. More specifically, the Report outlines that ***\"The convertibility regime ruled out nominal depreciation when a depreciation of the real exchange rate was warranted by, among other things, the sustained appreciation of the US dollar and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in early 1999. Deflation and output contraction set in, while Argentina faced increasingly tighter financing constraints amid investor concerns over fiscal solvency.\"*** After having criticized the IMF for supporting the country\u2019s weak policies too long -\"eve\u00ab ***after it had become evident in the late 1990s that the political ability to deliver the necessary fiscal discipline and structural reforms was lacking\"-*** the Report went on to affirm at p. 3 that: \"By ***the time the crisis hit Argentina in late 2000, there were grave concerns about the country\u2019s exchange rate and debt sustainability, but there was no easy solution. Given the extensive dollarization of the economy, the costs of exiting the convertibility regime were already very large.\"***\n\n73.\n\nAt the end of 2000 and in the course of 2001, Argentina passed several laws aimed at implementing or preserving the structural reforms that the IMF had asked Argentina to undertake in accordance with the conditions of the Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF of March 2000, while maintaining the convertibility regime.55 This was a fundamental element of the policy of stability pursued by the IMF in agreement with Argentina. From December 2000 to September 2001, the IMF provided exceptional financial support to Argentina amounting to US$ 17 billion. This IMF financial support continued until August-September 2001, \"[D]espite concerns about the lack of political support for the measures that would be needed to achieve the zero-deficit target... \"56 Notwithstanding the fiscal program for 2000 carried out to implement the Fiscal Responsibility Law approved by the Argentine Congress in September 1999 and aimed at reducing the public deficit, at the beginning of March 2001, the economic crisis worsened due to a further decline in economic activity that resulted in a major deterioration in fiscal performance and, consequently, a significant deterioration in the federal government\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Convertibility Law, adopted by Argentina in 1991, sought to counteract the hyperinflation that existed at the beginning of the 1990s, by pegging the peso to the US dollar at par and was part of a broader plan (the so-called Convertibility Plan) that reformed Argentina\u2019s economy. See below para. 137 ff.\n\nSee IMF ***Evaluation Report, supra*** note 53, 9.\n\n74.\n\nTo cope with the worsening crisis, at the end of March 2001, the government recalled Mr. Domingo Cavallo (the author of the Convertibility plan in 1991) as Minister of Economy and Congress granted him emergency powers. Shortly thereafter (on May 1), the new Minister publicly reaffirmed that Argentina would preserve the convertibility regime.\n\n75.\n\nOthers measures adopted by Argentina at the end of 2000, and during the course of 2001, included: the introduction of a financial transaction tax, together with more flexibility in the external pegging of the peso (through the addition in the Convertibility Law of the euro as a peg besides the US dollar); labour market reform and social security reform (both planned but not completed due to the widespread social opposition); a package of trade and tax measures aimed at improving the competitiveness of enterprises (the so-called competitiveness plan) in June 2001; the Zero Deficit Law of July 2001; a voluntary exchange of external government bonds of a face value of US$29.5 billion for longer-term instruments (the so-called megaswap); and the \"Intangibility Law\" of September 24, 2001 (declaring all deposits in pesos or in foreign currency \"intangible\"). In October 2001, after the rating agencies had downgraded Argentina\u2019s debt twice, Minister Cavallo announced that he would launch a further voluntary restructuring of all government debt (Decree 1387 of November 1, 2001).\n\n76.\n\nThe further development of the crisis was described by the ICSID Tribunal in the case *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina,* based on the official IMF documents, in the following terms:\n\n\"Withdrawal of deposits from the banks developed however at a growing pace and capital flight increased. While there had been a sustained inflow of foreign direct investment into Argentina in the years from 1997 to 2000, with a peak in 1999, the flow almost halted in 2001. The fall in official reserves continued downwards to a level barely enough to cover domestic currency in circulation. In the meantime the dollarization of the economy amplified even more, since the public sought refuge in dollar denominated deposits, savings and financial assets.\n\nThe spread between \"on-shore dollar\" and peso interest rate, which was no more than 1,5 to 2 percentage points on average prior to 2001 jumped to 40 points in the first part of 2001 while the sovereign debt spread skyrocketed.57\n\n123. The general economic situation deteriorated notwithstanding the IMF\u2019s assistance: actual GDP declined 4.5% in 2001 while the IMF program had forecasted an increase; unemployment rate grew at 18.3%. By the end of 2001 \"both the economy and the public finances were in deep crisis.\" The GDP would have dropped 4.5%; the primary and overall fiscal position ended up 3% weaker than anticipated in September; the debt-to-GDP ratio rose above 60%.\n\n124. On November 6, 2001, S&P lowered Argentina\u2019s long-term sovereign debt from CC to SD (Selective Default), thereby implying that the Government was already not in the condition to meet some of its financial obligations. A growing number of commentators outside Argentina, notably in the international financial press, hinted at the impossibility for Argentina to maintain the convertibility regime. At the end of this month the peso started to devalue in the free market of Montevideo. Facing a substantial run on deposits, on December 1, 2001 the Government enacted Decree 1570 (Corralito), freezing deposits in the banking system (only pesos 250 withdrawals per week were admitted) and prohibiting transfers out of the country.\"58\n\nData taken from the tables in IMF, ***Lessons from the Crisis, supra*** note 53, 25.\n\n***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 53, paras. 122-124 [footnotes omitted],\n\n77.\n\nIn early December 2001, the IMF announced \"that the pending review under the Stand-by Arrangement could not be completed under the circumstances\", thus withdrawing its financial support to Argentina.59\n\nSee IMF ***Evaluation Report, supra*** note 53, 5.\n\n78.\n\nThe *Corralito* (Decree 1570 of December 1, 2001) entailed the blocking of withdrawals from banks and was initially introduced as a temporary measure. However, it was the first of the Emergency Measures that Argentina took while the crisis was developing, which culminated in the devaluation of the peso, the pesification of dollar denominated assets in Argentina and the default on public debt and its rescheduling.\n\n79.\n\nThe crisis brought about a worsening of substantial social and personal hardship in the general population, already heavily burdened by three years of deep recession. In December 2001, the unemployment rate reached a record level of 18% and the indigence level increased by 358%, with most of the increase having taken place from May 2001 onward. Political demonstrations, riots and supermarket looting began in various locations and spread to major cities. At this point, the economic and social crisis acquired a political dimension. The government declared a state of siege and, at the end of December, after riots and demonstrations had caused tens of deaths, President De la R\u00faa resigned. The end of De la R\u00faa\u2019s government was followed by a *vacuum* in political power. After the resignation of President De la R\u00faa on December 20, 2001, and the unsuccessful appointment by Congress of three successive presidents between December 20 and December 30, Senator E. Duhalde was elected President by the Congress to complete the presidential term, and he assumed formal power on January 1, 2002. The regular functioning of the democratic institutions was re-established only with the general elections held on 25 May 2003, when N\u00e9stor Kirchner was duly elected president of Argentina.\n\n***4.2 Basic Features of the Emergency Law***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIt was in this context that Argentina passed the Emergency Law on January 6, 2002. The Emergency Law and Measures adopted thereunder provided for the official abolition of the convertibility regime and of the connected pegging of the peso at par with the US dollar, as well as the forced conversion into pesos of all dollar denominated financial instruments, indebtedness, contracts and all public utilities tariffs (\"pesification\") subject to Argentina\u2019s law.\n\n81.\n\nThe Emergency Law, having declared a \"public emergency in social, economic, administrative, financial and exchange matters\", directed the government at Article 1 to \"1. Proceed with the reorganization of the financial, banking and exchange market systems. 2. Reactivate the operation of the economy and improve employment and income distribution levels, with emphasis laid on a regional economies\u2019 development programme. 3. Create conditions for a sustainable economic growth, compatible with public debt restructuring. 4. Regulate the restructuring of continuing obligations, affected by the new exchange system implemented on article 2\", according to the rules specified in the following articles. According to Article 8, \"[a]s from the passing of this Law, all contracts executed by the Public Administration under the rules of public law, amongst them, those related to public works and services, dollar or other currencies adjustment clauses and indexatory clauses based upon price ratios from other countries and any other type of indexation system ceased to be effective, providing that prices and rates resulting from such clauses would be expressed in pesos at an exchange rate of one peso ($ 1) = one US dollar (USD l).\"60 Article 9 authorised the government to \"renegotiate contracts mentioned in Article 8. In the case of contracts having as their purpose the rendering of utilities, the following criteria must be considered: 1) impact of rates on the competitiveness of the economy and income distribution; 2) the quality of services and investment plans, whenever they are contractually provided for; 3) interest of users and the possibility of gaining access to such services; 4) safety of systems involved; and 5) company\u2019s profitability.\" According to Article 10, \"[t]he provisions of Articles 8 and 9 hereof shall under no circumstances authorize the contracting companies or companies rendering public services, to suspend or alter the fulfilment of their obligations.\" While providing for the pesification of public services tariffs and blocking the application of \"adjustment clauses pegged to US dollars or any other foreign currency and index clauses based on price indexes from other countries, as well as any other index mechanism\", Article 9 of the Emergency Law provided for a renegotiation of the licences of providers of public services and fixed the criteria according to which the renegotiation process should be dealt with. Among these criteria, were \"the interest of users and utility accessibility\" and \"companies\u2019 revenue.\"\n\nBesides the pesification and renegotiation of the tariffs in the public service sectors, the Emergency Law provides for the pesification of contracts subject to private law and at the same time for their renegotiation between the parties (Article 11). The measure is not at stake as to Total\u2019s claim in relation to TGN.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the above principles set forth in the Emergency Law did not derogate from but rather reflected and restated the fundamental criteria established by the Gas Law and the principal objectives of the Gas Regulatory Framework. These objectives and principles are enshrined in the Gas Law in the following terms: to guarantee prudent and efficient Licensees the ability to cover their costs and receive a reasonable rate of return (Article 38(a) Gas Law) and the protection of consumer rights (Article 2(a) Gas Law), taking into account that gas transportation and distribution activities are a \"national public service\" (Article 1). Finally, the Tribunal notes that neither the Emergency Law nor the subsequent implementing decree officially abolished, replaced or amended the text of the Gas Law and the Gas Decree. Both of these legal instruments have remained in force.\n\n***4.3 The Tariff Renegotiation Process Taking Place Pursuant to and Following the Emergency Law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Emergency Law of January 2002 limited itself to establishing a renegotiation process with the Licensees and the general criteria of that renegotiation. The Emergency Law did not indicate whether this renegotiation mechanism would be different than the one provided for in the Gas Regime. More generally, the Emergency Law did not establish whether the renegotiation process would consist of the various reviews and adjustment mechanisms specifically provided for in Argentina\u2019s legal system for each public utility sector or rather whether these mechanisms would be replaced by one or more new types of proceedings.\n\n84.\n\nIn any case, on February 12, 2002 Argentina, through Decree 293/02,61 created a single Commission tasked with renegotiating all of the concessions and licences having as their object \"to make public works and provide public services\" in accordance with Article 8 of the Emergency Law and the criteria in Article 9 of that law. Decree 293/02 established the renegotiation process for all public utilities\u2019 concessions and licences and stipulated that the process would last 120 days starting on March 1, 2002. By a subsequent Decree (Decree 370/02) enacted on February 22, 2002, the *\"Comisi\u00f3n de la Renegociaci\u00f3n de Contratos de Obras y Servicios P\u00fablicos\"* was placed under the control of the Ministry of Economy. On March 18, 2002, the Ministry of Economy with Resolution 20/0262 articulated rules regulating the renegotiation process and listed in Annex II all the Concessionaires and the Licensees involved in the process (including TGN). According to the Ministry of Economy (hereinafter \"MoE\") Resolution 20/02 (section 2.1.2.), \"...the NATIONAL EXECUTIVE, by way of the Commission created under the MINISTRY OF ECONOMY by Decree No. 293 dated 12 February 2002 and integration determined by Decree No. 370 dated 22 February 2002, shall proceed to renegotiate the Contracts for the Concession of Works and Public Utilities in execution, affected by the emergency and the new exchange regime, to the extent of such impact, with the scope set forth in Article 9 of the Emergency Law.\" As to the renegotiation\u2019s objectives, the Resolution stated at section 2.1.3.: \"Constitutes a primary objective of this process, to seek, as long as possible and with a criterion of shared sacrifice, to adapt by mutual consent the concession or licence contracts during the emergency period and as long as the situation can be overcome, without applying structural changes, in order to preserve the contract term and the original conditions with a view of future recovery.\" Section 2.1.4 went on to state that: \"The period covering the emergency shall require short term adjustment in order to adapt the execution of contracts to the economy, hoping that in a sustained recovery scenario within the next TWO (2) years - which is the duration of the emergency as set forth in Article 1 of Law No. 25,561- it is possible for the parties to assume medium and long term commitments.\" Finally, it concluded that: \"The tariff review process schedules currently applicable must be reorganized in parallel, where applicable. The short-term scenario features may demand periodic reviews of the parameters taken into account to readjust the contracting conditions during the emergency situation.\"\n\nSee Exhibit C-19.\n\nSee Exhibit C-57.\n\n85.\n\nMoE Resolution 20/02 (section 2.2. E) also provided for a generally applicable timetable for the renegotiation process: on the one hand, the Resolution restated the deadline of 120 days (as of March 1, 2002) set out in Decree 293/02; on the other, emphasizing that the renegotiation process involved several contracts, it gave warning that \"the commencement and ending terms for each phase may differ from case to case.\"\n\n86.\n\nTo enable the Commission at the Ministry of Economy to pursue the renegotiation process, on April 9, 2002, MoE Resolution 38/0263 blocked all public service tariff reviews that were pending at that moment pursuant to the legal regime for each sector. More specifically, the Resolution noted that \"the regulating organisms of the corresponding public services are developing their activities in accordance with their governing rules, among them, tariff reviews and other decisions affecting directly or indirectly utilities prices and tariffs.\" Taking account of this, the Resolution explained that \"it is convenient to avoid such decisions to materialize during the renegotiation process provided for in Law No. 25,561.\" Accordingly, the Ministry of Economy prevented regulators in the various public service sectors from adopting any decision or action directly or indirectly affecting service prices or tariffs and from carrying on any ongoing tariff review (Article 1 and 2). On June 26, 2002, Argentina enacted Executive Decree 1,090.64 On the one hand, this decree restated the Licensees\u2019 general obligation to maintain the quality of the public services that they provided according to their Licences (Article 2). On the other, it provided that the public utilities\u2019 new claims had to be included in the renegotiation process, eventually forming part of the *acuerdo* concluded with the Renegotiation Commission (Article 1 paragraph 1). As a consequence, public service providers submitting new claims against the government outside of the renegotiation process would be excluded from participating therein (Article 1 paragraph 2).65\n\nSee Exhibit C-25.\n\nSee Exhibit C-23.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 479.\n\n87.\n\nAs to the specific impact of the above provisions on TGN and the renegotiation process, according to Total:\n\n\"So as to prevent any recomposition of pesified tariffs whilst the \"renegotiation\" was scheduled to take place, the Government adopted MoE Resolution 38/2002 prohibiting regulators, including ENARGAS, from undertaking any review of the tariff [see MoE Resolution 38/2002, dated 10 April 2002], As a result, TGN\u2019s second Five-Year Tariff Review - which had already made significant progress with the calculation of the WACC in November 2001 - was aborted. In October 2002, with no sign of progress in the renegotiation process, TGN requested an Extraordinary Tariff Review on the basis of objective and justified circumstances (under Article 46 of the Gas Law). ENARGAS requested permission from the Ministry of Economy to carry out the tariff review [,..].\"66\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 477-478.\n\n88.\n\nAs requested by ENARGAS, on October 17, 2002 the Ministry of Economy issued MoE Resolution 487/02.67 The resolution specifically noted that gas tariff reviews had become necessary \"in order to facilitate the preservation of the rendering of public services,\" and exempted ENARGAS from MoE Resolution 38/02. Consequently, ENARGAS began the Extraordinary Tariff Review by calling a public hearing. On November 14, 2002, however, the Hearing\u2014namely, the first step in the Extraordinary Review in accordance with Article 46 of the Gas Law\u2014was suspended by the injunction issued by Judge Rodr\u00edguez Vidal in the case *Uni\u00f3n de Usuarios y Consumidores y Otros v. EN-M\u00b0 Econom\u00eda y Infraestructura.68* Finally, on February 3, 2003, by MoE Resolution 62/03,69Argentina extended the renegotiation process deadline of 60 days.\n\nSee Exhibit C-58.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 478.\n\nSee Exhibit C-21.\n\n89.\n\nAt the end of May 2003, Mr. N\u00e9stor Kirchner was elected President of Argentina in the general election. At this point the new government decided to establish a new mechanism to carry out the renegotiation process both outside of the Gas Regulatory Framework and separate to the Renegotiation Commission established in February 2002 by the previous Duhalde government. Following the re-organization and renaming of the *Ministerio de Econom\u00eda* and the *Ministerio de la Producci\u00f3n* (now called *Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Producci\u00f3n and Ministerio De Planificaci\u00f3n* *Federal, Inversi\u00f3n P\u00fablica y Servicios,* respectively), Decree 311 of 4 July 2OO370 created the *Unidad de Renegociaci\u00f3n y An\u00e1lisis de Contratos de Servicios P\u00fablicos* (\"UNIREN\"), placed under the control of both Ministries. The UNIREN replaced the Renegotiation Commission in undertaking the task of carrying out the renegotiation process. Moreover, according to the Preamble of the Decree, the UNIREN was charged with a broader task. This was \"the joint preparation of a project of the General Regulatory Framework for the public services corresponding to national jurisdiction.\" As is highlighted hereunder at paragraph 171 ff, the renegotiation process for the adjustment of TGN tariffs under the UNIREN mechanism lasted several years without producing any significant results. Finally, on April 17, 2007, the UNIREN proposed a Final Draft Agreement Act *(\"Acta Acuerdo\")* to TGN that TGN considered unacceptable.71\n\nSee Exhibit C-22.\n\nOn Total\u2019s position on the renegotiation process see Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 489-515.\n\n***5. The Parties\u2019 Arguments***\n-------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nTotal invokes principally the fair and equitable treatment obligation under Article 3 of the BIT in order to maintain its claim against Argentina.72 More specifically, Total claims that Argentina has violated Article 3 by breaching Total\u2019s legitimate expectations with respect to the stability of the Gas Regulatory Framework which were based on various commitments that Argentina had given to attract foreign investors in this sector upon privatization in 1992, and that Total reasonably relied on such stability when it made its investment in TGN. Total emphasizes that this domestic legal framework was \"fundamentally altered\" by the Measures, in breach of Argentina\u2019s own law, so that its legitimate expectations had been frustrated by those Measures.73\n\nTotal claims that the same measures that it alleges to be in breach of Article 3 of the BIT also constitute an indirect expropriation in breach of Article 5.2. Although Total addressed its claim under Article 5(2) before that under Article 3, the Tribunal considers it more appropriate to examine the latter first since Total argued its claim under Article 3 much more extensively.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 222 ff.\n\n91.\n\nThe thrust of Total\u2019s argument is that the fair and equitable treatment standard includes the protection of the \"legitimate expectations\" of a foreign investor regarding the stability of the legal regime. These expectations are legitimate and deserve protection under the BIT standard according to Total in as far as (i) such stability has been \"promised \" (to the foreign investor), and (ii) the foreign investor has \"relied\" upon such promises in making its investment.\n\n92.\n\nTotal points to different promises of varying specificity. From the broadest to the more specific, Total refers to the \"core commitments\" or \"overarching promise\" of the Gas Regulatory Framework \"that TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium would be maintained throughout the 35 to 45 years of its Licence\" so that the regulated tariff of TGN, which represented 98% of its revenue, was and would continue to be regulated so as to provide TGN with sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable costs, including taxes, amortisations and capital costs, and to make a \"reasonable rate of return\" similar to activities of comparable risk.\"74 As to the legal basis of these promises, Total refers to the Gas Law itself (art. 38(a) and 39) and to the Gas Decree (Article 2.4) of 1992.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\n93.\n\nTotal points to two additional, more specific, commitments \"which supported the promise of economic equilibrium\"75, namely:\n\n(i) the \"promise\" that TGN\u2019s tariffs were and would be calculated in US dollars and converted to Argentine pesos for billing purposes only\", in Article 41.2 of the Gas decree, Section 9.2 of TGN Licence, both of 1992;\n\n(ii) the automatic adjustment of the dollar tariffs every six months in accordance with the US Producer Price Index (US PPI) \"thereby preserving its [TGN] dollar revenue in real dollar terms\", as provided in Article 41 of the Gas Law, Article 41.3 Gas Decree, Section 9.4.1.1 of the TGN licence, all of 1992.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\n94.\n\nAs recalled before, Total points to two further mechanisms that were designed to allow the regulator, ENARGAS, to set and restore TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium on both a recurrent and non-recurrent (extraordinary) basis, namely: (i) the Five-Year Tariff Review provided for in Article 41 of the Gas Law, Article 41.3 of the Gas Decree and Section 9.4.1.1 of the TGN Licence; and (ii) the Extraordinary Tariff Review provided for in Article 42 of the Gas Law, Article 42 of the Gas Decree and Section 9.5.1 of the Licence, which was intended to be a non-recurrent review that was available on objective and justified grounds or if the tariffs became inadequate, unduly discriminatory or preferential.\n\n95.\n\nFinally, as already mentioned, Total points to Argentina\u2019s promises in the TGN Licence that tariffs would not be frozen or subject to regulation or price control without full compensation from the government, and that the basic rules of the TGN licence (which included the tariff regime) would not be changed without TGN\u2019s consent (found in Section 9.8 and respectively Sections 9.1 and 18.2 of the TGN Licence).\n\n96.\n\nWhile agreeing generally on the content of the instruments and of the specific provisions that Total invokes, Argentina objects to the legal significance that Total attributes to them. On the one hand, Argentina does not dispute that the most important principle in the Gas Law (\"the most important provision of the regulatory framework for the natural gas distribution utility\") is that \"tariffs must be *fair and reasonable\"76* Argentina specifically acknowledges that the \"governing principle\" of the Gas Law is that \"the tariff must cover operating costs, taxes and amortization, must allow a reasonable rate of return, assuring users the minimum cost compatible with supply security.\"77 Argentina, however, disputes the construction of the various provisions on which Total relies as being \"promises\" made to Total, and stresses that Argentina never \"induced\" Total to invest in TGN when Total did so nine years after the privatization \"under a totally private transaction.\"78 Argentina stresses that the terms \"promise\", \"guarantee\" or synonyms thereof do not appear in any of the Gas Law or, the Decree or the Licence. According to Argentina, Total has been unable to submit any instrument containing a promise or guarantee in respect of the currency and the automatic adjustment of the tariffs.79\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 255. Emphasis in the original.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 263.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 251-253.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, paras 58-59.\n\n97.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the instruments on which Total relies are \"of different legal hierarchy\".80 Even if they were labelled as \"guarantees\", Argentina believes that they are neither immune from changes in the case of events that threaten its stability nor can they result in wider rights than those enjoyed by the rest of the population when the common welfare of society is at stake, such as during the crisis of early 2002.81 On the contrary, Argentina\u2019s legislative and executive authorities have the right to exercise their powers in amending these instruments whenever public interest so dictates.82 This was indeed the case for the Emergency Law enacted within the framework of the dramatic crisis of late 2001 that affected all of the Argentine economy.83 Specifically, Argentina points out that the calculation of tariffs in US dollars is provided for by the Gas Decree and not by the Gas Law. Argentina submits that the main tariff parameter\u2014that the tariff must be at all times fair and reasonable\u2014would have been breached if the tariff calculation in US dollars had been maintained after the maxi-devaluation of the peso.84 Contrary to Total\u2019s view, Argentina submits that the reference to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars was linked to the Convertibility Law.85 Since the abandonment of the Convertibility regime at par was, according to Argentina, legitimate and necessary in the circumstances of the crisis at the end of 2001, the pesification of the tariffs as part of the pesification of all contracts, \"did not amount to an arbitrarily unjust treatment\", being part of \"a universal remedy that was applicable to all dollar-denominated legal relationships.\"86\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 264.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras 319-320.\n\nIn order to support this argument Argentina refers to Section 18.3 of the TGN Licence which provides that [NTD: Translate.] \"Si alguna disposici\u00f3n de esta Licencia fuera declarada inv\u00e1lida o inexigible por sentecia firme del tribunal competente ***[i.e.*** los tribunales en lo Contencioso Administrativo Federal de la Capital Federal under Section 16.1], la validez y exigibilidad de las restantes disposiciones de esta Licencia non ser\u00e1n afectadas. Cada estipulaci\u00f3n de la Licencia ser\u00e1 valida y exigible en la mayor medida permitida por la ley aplicable ***[i.e.*** Argentina\u2019s Law under Section 16.2].\" Argentina contends that this provision expressly covers Argentina\u2019s Measures (specifically the Emergency Law) and includes both judicial decisions and legislative acts. Consequently, according to Argentina, Section 18.3 allows Argentina to modify by law the TGN Licence, specifically as to the US PPI tariffs adjustment (see Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 188-193). Therefore, Argentina concludes at para. 193 that \"the Emergency Law in no manner could violate the BIT as applied to the Licence [...] because the legitimate expectations of any investor included the possibility that a law passed by the Congress may, lawfully, modify the Licence (even though this could not be done through an Argentine Executive\u2019s act).\"\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 293.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 266.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 267.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 306.\n\n98.\n\nAs to the Licence, Argentina stresses that the Licence is subject to Argentina\u2019s law (Section 16.1). Argentina draws a distinction between the limitations on the power of Argentina\u2019s Executive to amend the Licence without the Licensee\u2019s consent and the right of Argentina\u2019s Congress to lawfully modify the Licence.87 Argentina concludes that, under its own terms, the Licence, namely, the \"contractual instrument allegedly violated\"88 that is subject to Argentina\u2019s law, could be modified by a Law passed by the Argentine Congress, such that Total had to account for this possibility as part of its legitimate expectations.89\n\nIn this regard Argentina points out to Sect. 18.3 ***in fine*** of the Licence: \"Each provision of the Licence shall be valid and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.\" See Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 193 and Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 188.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 200.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 193.\n\n***6. Legal Evaluation by the Tribunal of Total\u2019s Claims***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe first issue for the Tribunal is to determine whether the legislation, regulation and provisions invoked by Total constitute a set of promises and commitments towards Total whose unilateral modifications entail a breach of the legitimate expectations of Total and, as a consequence, are in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT. The opposite view held by Argentina is that Argentina has not breached any promise or guarantee made to Total because \"[T]he Argentine State did not execute any contract with Total\"90 nor did it induce Total to invest in TGN.91 The provisions invoked by Total as \"guarantees\" are in Argentina\u2019s view nothing other than the totality of the regulatory framework effective from time to time.92\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 311.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 253.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 81.\n\n100.\n\nIt is undisputed that Total did not enter into a contractual relationship with Argentina\u2019s authorities in 2000-2001 when it acquired an indirect share in TGN by buying a share of Gasinvest from TransCanada, one of the various foreign shareholders of TransCanada. All of the laws and regulations, which Total invokes as a source of the promises that it relies upon (the Gas Law and the Gas Decree of 1992), are instruments of general application, enacted by the Congress or the Executive branch of Argentina pursuant to the powers vested in these bodies under the Constitution of Argentina. Further, Total does not submit that it had participated in any way in the privatization of the gas transportation utilities of Argentina in 1991-1992 through which the first private investors in TGN had become its shareholders.\n\n101.\n\nAs concerns Total\u2019s reliance on TGN\u2019s Licence as a contractual commitment undertaken by Argentina, it is clear that this instrument establishes the rights and obligations of the parties (namely TGN and Argentina\u2019s authorities) to that licence. Specifically, the TGN Licence sets forth the obligations of the Argentine authorities *vis-\u00e0-vis* the concessionaire. These obligations encompass details of how those authorities may (and should) exercise, with respect to the concessionaire, the regulatory powers granted to them by the Gas Law and Gas Decree in order to preserve the general interest underlying the performance of the public service. Since Total is not a party to the concession, a more accurate description of the situation would be that Total has invested in a public utility (namely TGN) which operated a public service activity regulated by a defined legal regime set forth (also) in the concession. Therefore TGN Licence cannot be regarded as a source of contractual legal obligations of a specific character assumed directly by Argentina towards Total. Accordingly, it is not correct to qualify and treat the TGN Licence provisions as stabilisation clauses agreed between Total and Argentina Stabilisation clauses are clauses, which are inserted in state contracts concluded between foreign investors and host states with the intended effect of freezing a specific host State\u2019s legal framework at a certain date, such that the adoption of any changes in the legal regulatory framework of the investment concerned (even by law of general application and without any discriminatory intent by the host State) would be illegal. For the reasons stated above, this characterization does not fit the relationship between Total and Argentina as to Total\u2019s investment in TGN.\n\n102.\n\nTotal submits that legitimate expectations with respect to the stability of the legal framework under which a foreign company makes an investment may derive not only from contractual undertakings, but also from legislation and regulation that was precisely meant to attract foreign investment. Total points out that the gas regulatory framework was devised and enacted in order to attract long term private foreign investments in utilities, which until then had been run by the State, that were badly in need of modernization through massive investment by competent operators and others, especially in view of the past record of high inflation in Argentina. This regime was based on a sound economic underpinning, an integral part of which was the overarching commitment to reasonable and fair tariffs for the operators and specifically the US dollar peg.\n\n103.\n\nSubjectively, Total submits that the existence of such a framework, which had been in place for almost nine years when it decided to become a shareholder of TGN, was a major consideration in carrying out such an investment.\n\n104.\n\nTo the contrary, Argentina points to the agreed suspensions of the PPI, which were in place when Total made its acquisition of the shareholding in TGN from TransCanada, that should have put Total on notice that the Gas Regulatory Framework was being undermined. Argentina also submits that Total was careless in making its investment in that it did not carry out the due diligence analysis that is commonly undertaken before making such a large direct investment abroad. Had Total carried out proper due diligence, it would have been aware of the looming economic difficulties of Argentina and of their possible impact on the future stability of the Gas Regulatory Framework.\n\n105.\n\nThe legal issue for the Tribunal is thus to determine whether the fair and equitable treatment standard of Article 3 of the BIT, in particular as far as it includes the \"protection of legitimate expectations\" of the foreign investor, has been breached by the unilateral changes of legislation and regulation effected by Argentina and challenged by Total.\n\n***6.1 Applicable Standard: the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in General***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe undertaking of the host country to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investors of the other party and their investments is a standard feature in BITs, although the exact language of such undertakings is not uniform. The generality of the fair and equitable treatment standard distinguishes it from specific obligations undertaken by the parties to a BIT in respect of typical aspects of foreign investment operations such as those concerning monetary transfers, visas, etc. At the same time, the fair and equitable treatment standard can be distinguished from other general standards included in BITs, namely the national and the most favoured nation treatment standards, which guarantee a variable protection that is contingent upon the treatment given by the host State to its own nationals or to the nationals of the best treated third state.\n\n107.\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment standard is, by contrast, an autonomous standard, although its exact content is not predefined, except in cases where a treaty provides additional specifications, which is not the case for the France-Argentina BIT.93 Since this standard is inherently flexible, it is difficult, if not impossible, \"to anticipate in the abstract the range of possible types of infringements upon the investor\u2019s legal position\".94 Its application in a given case must take into account relevant State practice and judicial or arbitral case law as well as the text of the BIT and other sources of customary or general international law.95\n\nFor instances of more specific content see the NAFTA Free Trade Commission Note of Interpretation of 31 July 2001 available at http://www.intemational.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/disp-diff/NAFTA-Interpr.aspx?lang=en and the US Model BIT of 2004 available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/l 17601.pdf\n\nC.

Some tribunals have started from the ordinary meaning of the term, in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), recalling the dictionary definitions of just, even-handed, unbiased, legitimate.96 On the other hand, one cannot but agree with Judge Higgins\u2019 observation in the *Oil Platforms* case, that \"the key terms \"fair and equitable treatment to nationals and companies\"... are legal terms of art well known in the field of overseas investment protection\".97\n\nSee ***MTD Equity Sdn.

Moreover, legally, the fair and equitable treatment standard is derived from the requirement of good faith which is undoubtedly a general principle of law under Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n***S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada,*** UNCITRAL, First Partial Award, 13 November 2000, paras. 263-264; ***Genin and others v.

Romania,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award, 12 October 2005, paras 177-178 stating that a legal proceeding that exists in virtually all legal systems, such as bankruptcy proceedings, cannot be regarded as arbitrary.\n\n112.\n\nUNCTAD has followed such an approach in its publication on the topic, besides referring to arbitral practice, in order:\n\n\"to identify certain forms of behaviour that appear to be contrary to fairness and equity in most legal systems and to extrapolate from this the type of State action that may be inconsistent with fair and equitable treatment, using the plain meaning approach. Thus, for instance, if a State acts fraudulently or in bad faith, or capriciously and wilfully discriminates against a foreign investor, or deprives an investor of acquired rights in a manner that leads to the unjust enrichment of the State, then there is at least a *prima facie* case for arguing that the fair and equitable standard has been breached\".107\n\nUNCTAD, ***Fair and Equitable Treatment,*** UNCTAD Series on Investment Agreements, 1999 UN Doc. UNCTAD/ITE/IIT/11, Vol. Ill, at 12.\n\n***6.2. The Notion of Legitimate Expectations of Foreign Investors***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nWe turn now to the more specific concept, which Total asserts forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard, of the protection of \"legitimate expectations\" on the part of an investor concerning the stability of the legal framework under which it has made its investment.\n\n114.\n\nTribunals have often referred to the principle of the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations, especially with reference to the \"stability\" of the legal framework of the host country applicable to the investment, as being included within the fair and equitable treatment standard. However, case law is not uniform as to the preconditions for an investor to claim that its expectations were \"legitimate\" concerning the stability of a given legal framework that was applicable to its investment when it was made. On the one hand, stability, predictability and consistency of legislation and regulation are important for investors in order to plan their investments, especially if their business plans extend over a number of years. Competent authorities of States entering into BITs in order to promote foreign investment in their economy should be aware of the importance for the investors that a legal environment favourable to the carrying out of their business activities be maintained.108\n\nSee M. Waibel, ***Opening Pandora\u2019s Box: Sovereign Bonds in International Arbitration,*** 101 ***American Journal of International Law*** (2007) 711, 750, according to whom the fair and equitable standard as developed in the case law protects \"legitimate commercial expectations\" and requires that \"governmental acts need to conform to international standards of transparency, non arbitrariness, due process and proportionality to the policy aims involved.\"\n\n115.\n\nOn the other hand, signatories of such treaties do not thereby relinquish their regulatory powers nor limit their responsibility to amend their legislation in order to adapt it to change and the emerging needs and requests of their people in the normal exercise of their prerogatives and duties. Such limitations upon a government should not lightly be read into a treaty which does not spell them out clearly nor should they be presumed.109 In fact, even in those BITs where stability of the legal framework for investment is explicitly mentioned, such as in the BIT between the United States and Argentina of 1991 (in accordance with the U.S. Model BIT of the time) such a reference appears only in the preamble.110\n\nIn applying the fair and equitable standard under Article 1105 (1) NAFTA the Tribunal in ***S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada, supra*** note 105, para. 263 considered that a determination of breach \"must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own border\", taking also into account any specific rule of international law.\n\nSee ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 53, para. 258, with reference to the U.S.-Argentina BIT of 1991 which includes the following preambular language, following the U.S. Model BIT of the time: \"Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources... \".\n\n116.\n\nIn various disputes between U.S. investors and Argentina under that BIT, tribunals have relied on the explicit mention in its preamble of the desirability of maintaining a stable framework for investments in order to attract foreign investment as a basis for finding that the lack of such stability and related predictability, on which the investor had relied, had resulted in a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.111 This reference is justified because, although such a statement in a preamble does not create independent legal obligations, it is a tool for the interpretation of the treaty since it sheds light on its purpose.112 However, the BIT between France and Argentina does not contain any such reference, following the French BIT model.113 This absence indicates, at a minimum, that stability of the legal domestic framework was not envisaged as a specific element of the domestic legal regime that the Contracting Parties undertook to grant to their respective investors.114 The operative provisions of the France-Argentina BIT must in any case be read taking into account, within the object and purpose of the treaty, the reference in the Preamble to the desire of the Parties to create favourable conditions for the investments covered.115\n\nSee ***LG&E v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, paras 124-125\u00a0citing similar findings by other tribunals \"in light of the same or similar language\"; ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina, supra*** note 20, para. 259. The Tribunal notes that the U.K.-Argentina BIT does not include any reference to such stability. See ***National Grid pic v. Argentina,***UNCITRAL, Award, 3 November 2008, paras. 168 ff. and in particular para. 170.\n\n***Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador,*** LCIA Case No. UN 3467, Final Award, 1 July 2004 relies explicitly on the language of the preamble in order to hold that \"the stability of the legal and business framework is thus an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\nThe BIT at issue here includes the obligation of each Party to extend \"full protection and security\" to covered investments of nationals of the other Party in its territory, \"in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment in Article 3 of this Agreement\" (Article 5(1) of the BIT). As to the scope of this kind of clause, some awards (see ***Azurix v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, para. 408; ***National Grid pic v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, para. 187) have considered that this protection is not limited to physical assets and that it encompasses the stability of the legal framework and legal security of the investment. Other awards have instead stuck to the original limitation of physical security ***(BG Group Pic v. Argentina,*** UNCITRAL, Award, 24 December 2007, para. 326).\n\nTotal has pointed out, however, the official statement made by the representative of the Government of Argentina to Congress in relation to the ratification of the BIT by Argentina: ***\"Bearing in mind that the main purpose of this type of agreements is to bolster genuine and productive investment, in consequence, certain situations or measures which may affect negatively the value or product of the investment are foreseen. Hence, by way of this agreement, the States agree to maintain the status, during the term of such, of certain rules concerning the treatment of investments and enshrines among the signatory States the commitment not to contravene rules which, being part of this subject, belong to the group ofprinciples common to all nations... This way, a stable and satisfactory environment is created which mitigates the concerns of foreign investors related to non-commercial risks \u2014called political risks- and promotes the international capital flow within in compliance with the laws of the host State.\"*** (Exhibit C-89, ***Mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo al Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n*** for Law 24,100/92, 10 June 1992). The Tribunal notes that this statement does not include a reference to stability, such as the one found in the corresponding message relating to the 1992 BIT of Argentina with the U.K. : ***\"By way of such [agreements], States accord to maintain during its term certain rules concerning investment treatment, in order to establish an environment of stability and trust to attract investments.\"*** (Exhibit C-87)\n\nConnected with this statement is the general obligation of Article 2 of the BIT, according to which each Contracting Party shall admit and promote investments made by investors of the other Party, however \"within the frame of its legislation and provisions hereof.\"\n\n117.\n\nIn the absence of some \"promise\" by the host State or a specific provision in the bilateral investment treaty itself, the legal regime in force in the host country at the time of making the investment is not automatically subject to a \"guarantee\" of stability merely because the host country entered into a bilateral investment treaty with the country of the foreign investor. The expectation of the investor is undoubtedly \"legitimate\", and hence subject to protection under the fair and equitable treatment clause, if the host State has explicitly assumed a specific legal obligation for the future, such as by contracts, concessions or stabilisation clauses on which the investor is therefore entitled to rely as a maher of law.116\n\nSee ***CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic,*** UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 September 2001, para. 611 concerning interference with contractual rights by a regulatory authority; ***T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A.***  v. ***United Mexican States,*** ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, para. 154 relating to the replacement of an unlimited licence by one of limited duration for the operation of a landfill. See also ***Waste*** ***Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States, supra*** note 98, where the claim of the investor under Article 1105(1) NAFTA was rejected. In particular the Tribunal considered at para. 98 that the fair and equitable standard would be violated by the \"breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied upon by the claimant.\"\n\n118.\n\nThe situation is similar when public authorities of the host country have made the private investor believe that such an obligation existed through conduct or by a declaration.117 Authorities may also have announced officially their intent to pursue a certain conduct in the future, on which, in turn, the investor relied in making investments or incurring costs.118 As stated within the NAFTA framework \"the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" relates [...] to a situation where a Contracting Party\u2019s conduct creates reasonable and justifiable expectations on the part of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer damages.\"119\n\nSee the case of assurances provided by senior government officials to an investor in ***Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award on Merits, 8 December 2000, paras. 59 ff.\n\nFor a review of such instances see M. Reisman and M.H. Arsanjani, ***The Question of Unilateral Governmental Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes,*** 19 ***ICSID review-foreign Investment Law Journal*** 328 (2004).\n\nSee ***International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico,*** UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, 26 January 2006, para. 147. This is defined as \"detrimental reliance\" by T.J. Grierson-Weiler and I.I. Laird, ***Standards of Treatment,***  Chapter 8 of P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino and C. Schreuer (Eds.), ***The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law,*** Oxford, 2008, 275.\n\n119.\n\nIn fact, when relying on the concept of legitimate expectations, arbitral tribunals have often stressed that \"specific commitments\" limit the right of the host State to adapt the legal framework to changing circumstances.120 Representations made by the host State are enforceable and justify the investor\u2019s reliance only when they are specifically addressed to a particular investor.121 \"Where a host State which seeks foreign investment acts intentionally, so as to create expectations in potential investors with respect to particular treatment or comportment, the host state should, we suggest, be bound by the commitments and the investor is entitled to rely upon them in instances of decision\".122\n\nSee ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, para. 27, holding that when general measures are challenged: \"A direct relationship can, however, be established if those general measures are adopted in violation of specific commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts. What is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments.\"\n\nSee ***International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico, supra*** note 119, para. 147. On the facts of the various cases some tribunals have, however, concluded that the legal order of the host State as it stood at the time when the investor acquired the investment grounded the legitimate expectations of the investor with respect to the stability of the relevant regulations: ***Gami Investments, Inc. v. Mexico,*** UNCITRAL, Final Award, 15 November 2004, para. 93; ***Leldman v. Mexico,*** ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l, Award on Merits, 16 December 2002, para. 128.\n\nConclusions by M. Reisman and M.H. Arsanjani, ***The Question of Unilateral Governmental Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes, supra*** note 118, 342.\n\n120.\n\nIn other words, an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations may be based \"on any undertaking and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host State. A reversal of assurances by the host State which have led to legitimate expectations will violate the principle of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is clear that this principle is not absolute and does not amount to a requirement for the host State to freeze its legal system for the investor\u2019s benefit. A general stabilization requirement would go beyond what the investor can legitimately expect.\"123\n\nSee C. Schreuer, ***Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice, supra*** note 94, 374.\n\n121.\n\nThe balance between these competing requirements and hence the limits of the proper invocation of \"legitimate expectations\" in the face of legislative or regulatory changes (assuming that they are not contrary to a contractual, bilateral or similar undertaking, binding in its own right) has been based on a weighing of various elements pointing in opposite directions. On the one hand, the form and specific content of the undertaking of stability invoked are crucial. No less relevant is the clarity with which the authorities have expressed their intention to bind themselves for the future. Similarly, the more specific the declaration to the addressee(s), the more credible the claim that such an addressee (the foreign investor concerned) was entitled to rely on it for the future in a context of reciprocal trust and good faith. Hence, this accounts for the emphasis in many awards on the government having given \u2018assurances\u2019, made \u2018promises\u2019, undertaken \u2018commitments\u2019, offered specific conditions, to a foreign investor, to the point of having solicited or induced that investor to make a given investment. Total itself described the acts of Argentina on which it relies in this way. As a result of such conduct by the host authorities, the expectation of the foreign investor may \"rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in light of the circumstances.\"124 When those features are not present, a cautious approach is warranted based on a case specific contextual analysis of all relevant facts.\n\nSee ***Saluka Investments BVv. The Czech Republic, supra*** note 103, para. 304.\n\n122.\n\nIndeed, the most difficult case is (as in part in the present dispute) when the basis of an investor\u2019s invocation of entitlement to stability under a fair and equitable treatment clause relies on legislation or regulation of a unilateral and general character. In such instances, investor\u2019s expectations are rooted in regulation of a normative and administrative nature that is not specifically addressed to the relevant investor. This type of regulation is not shielded from subsequent changes under the applicable law. This notwithstanding, a claim to stability can be based on the inherently prospective nature of the regulation at issue aimed at providing a defined framework for future operations. This is the case for regimes, which are applicable to long-term investments and operations, and/or providing for \"fall backs\" or contingent rights in case the relevant framework would be changed in unforeseen circumstances or in case certain listed events materialize. In such cases, reference to commonly recognized and applied financial and economic principles to be followed for the regular operation of investments of that type (be they domestic or foreign) may provide a yardstick. This is the case for capital intensive and long term investments and operation of utilities under a license, natural resources exploration and exploitation, project financing or Build Operate and Transfer schemes. The concept of \"regulatory fairness\" or \"regulatory certainty\" has been used in this respect.125 In the light of these criteria when a State is empowered to fix the tariffs of a public utility it must do so in such a way that the concessionaire is able to recover its operations costs, amortize its investments and make a reasonable return over time, as indeed Argentina\u2019s gas regime provided.\n\nSee T.J. Grierson-Weiler and I.I. Laird, ***Standards of Treatment, supra*** note 119, 277.\n\n123.\n\nOn the other hand, the host State\u2019s right to regulate domestic matters in the public interest has to be taken into consideration as well.126 The circumstances and reasons (importance and urgency of the public need pursued) for carrying out a change impacting negatively on a foreign investor\u2019s operations on the one hand, and the seriousness of the prejudice caused on the other hand, compared in the light of a standard of reasonableness and proportionality are relevant. The determination of a breach of the standard requires, therefore, \"a weighing of the Claimant\u2019s reasonable and legitimate expectations on the one hand and the Respondent\u2019s legitimate regulatory interest on the other.\"127 Thus an evaluation of the fairness of the conduct of the host country towards an investor cannot be made in isolation, considering only their bilateral relations. The context of the evolution of the host economy, the reasonableness of the normative changes challenged and their appropriateness in the light of a criterion of proportionality also have to be taken into account.128 Additional criteria for the evaluation of the fairness of national measures of general application as to services are those found in the WTO General Agreement on Trade of Services (GATS). The Tribunal recalls that Article VI of the GATS of 1994 on \"Domestic regulation\" provides that \"In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each member shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner \" (emphasis added). This reference concerning services (as undoubtedly Total\u2019s operations in the gas transportation and electricity were) in a multilateral treaty to which both Argentina and France are parties offers useful guidance as to the requirements that a domestic regulation must contain in order to be considered fair and equitable. The Tribunal refers to the requirements found in Article VI GATS just as \"guidance\" because it has not been submitted that the GATS is directly applicable here. This would require that Argentina had admitted Total\u2019s investment in the electricity sector on the basis of a specific commitment in respect of the opening of electricity generation to investors from other WTO Members.\n\nSee ***Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic, supra*** note 103, paras 305-306. See also ***Feldman v. Mexico, supra*** note 121, para. 112: \"[G]overnments, in their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change their laws and regulations in response to changing economic circumstances or changing political, economic or social considerations. Those changes may well make certain activities less profitable or even uneconomic to continue.\"\n\nSee ***Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic, ibid.*** See also D. Carreau, P. Juillard, ***Droit international \u00e9conomique,*** 2i\u00e8me \u00e9dition, 2005, 442, para. 1265 according to whom the \"equitable\" requirement of the standard implies that a satisfactory equilibrium be ensured between the interests of the investor, of its nationality State and of the host State.\n\nFor instance, see ***Genin and others v. Estonia, supra*** note 105, para. 348, where the Tribunal states that in considering the revocation of a banking license to a financial institution (Estonian Innovation Bank) in which a U.S. investor made its investments \"... the Tribunal considers it imperative to recall the particular context in which the dispute arose, namely, that of a renascent independent state, coming rapidly to grips with the reality of modem financial, commercial and banking practices and the emergence of state institutions responsible for overseeing and regulating areas of activity perhaps previously unknown. This is the context in which Claimants knowingly chose to invest in an Estonian financial institution, EIB.\"\n\n124.\n\nBesides such an objective comparison of the competing interests in context, the conduct of the investor in relation to any undertaking of stability is also, so to speak \"subjectively\", relevant. Tribunals have evaluated the investor\u2019s conduct in this respect, highlighting that BITs \"are not insurance policies against bad business judgments\" and that the investor has its own duty to investigate the host State\u2019s applicable law.129\n\nSee ***Maffezini v.

A detailed review of different opinions and statements on the issue is found in OECD, ***International Investment Law, A Changing Landscape,*** 2005, at 81-96.\n\nSeveral arbitral tribunals dealing with investment disputes have held that the law of the international protection of foreign investors (of which the fair and equitable treatment standard is part) has considerably evolved since the ***Neer*** decision of 1926 that was considered to restate the minimum treatment standard existing at that time (see ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, F.P. v.

Schreuer, ***Principles of International Investment Law,*** 2008, 128-130.\n\n126.\n\nIn order to elucidate the content of the treatment required by Article 3 in conformity with international law, a tribunal is directed to look not just to the BIT in isolation or the case law of other arbitral tribunals in investment disputes interpreting and applying similarly worded investment protection treaties, but rather to the content of international law more generally.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal will, therefore, proceed to further interpret the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard looking also at general principles and public international law in a non-BIT context. This approach is consistent with the interpretation of Article 3 of the France-Argentina BIT by the *\"Vivendi IF* tribunal which has expressed the view we have developed above, namely, that: \"The Tribunal sees no basis for equating principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment... the reference to principles of international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard\".134 The views expressed by commentators on the French model BIT, from which the phrase derives, are consistent with these conclusions.135\n\n***Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

Goldsong to the France-U.S.S.R. BIT of 1989, 29 ILM 317 (1990) on which Argentina relies, where the author expresses the view that the reference to international law \"qualifies\" the scope of the undertaking of fair and equitable treatment. This qualification rather directs the interpreter to take fully into account the protection afforded by international law, without going beyond that in the context of the BIT, but also without reducing it below that level.

While the scope and legal basis of the principle varies, it has been recognized lately both in civil law and in common law jurisdictions within well defined limits.136\n\nThe concept is considered to have originated in German law where it is extensively used, CF Forsyth, ***The Provenance and Protection of Legitimate Expectations,*** Cambridge L.J. 47, 241 (1988). As to civil law, see Argentina ***Industria Madera Lanin,*** Corte Suprema 1977, Fallos 298:223. The State was required there to compensate for the breach of ***la expectativa razonable*** of an enterprise to which a forest concession had been initially promised, but was thereafter revoked. In English law (leading case: ***Schmidt v Secretary of State for the Home Affairs*** [1969] 2 Ch 149, ***per*** Lord Denning) the House of Lords has stated that \"the doctrine of legitimate expectations is rooted in fairness\", ***R. v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex p. Preston*** [1985] 2 All E.R. 327, para. 835 ***per*** Lord Bingham. See also ***R. v North and East Devon Health Authority ex p. Coughlan*** [1999] LGR 703, para. 57, holding that where \"a lawful promise or practice has induced a legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural, authority now establishes that here too the court will in a proper case decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power\". Generally, as to the notion in administrative law of Common Law countries, see W. Wade and CF Forsyth, ***Administrative Law,*** OUP Oxford 2004, 372-376.\n\n129.\n\nIn domestic legal systems the doctrine of legitimate expectations supports \"the entitlement of an individual to legal protection from harm caused by a public authority retreating from a previous publicly stated position, whether that be in the form of a formal decision or in the form of a representation\".137 This doctrine, which reflects the importance of the principle of legal certainty (or rule of law), appears to be applicable mostly in respect of administrative acts and protects an individual from an incoherent exercise of administrative discretion, or excess or abuse of administrative powers.138 The reasons and features for changes (sudden character, fundamental change, retroactive effects) and the public interest involved are thus to be taken into account in order to evaluate whether an individual who incurred financial obligations on the basis of the decisions and representations of public authorities that were later revoked should be entitled to a form of redress. However it appears that only exceptionally has the concept of legitimate expectations been the basis of redress when legislative action by a State was at stake. Rather a breach of the fundamental right of property as recognized under domestic law has been the basis, for instance, for the European Court of Human Rights to find a violation of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights protecting the peaceful enjoyment of property.139\n\nC.

Wildhaber, ***The Protection of Legitimate Expectations in European Human Rights Law,*** M. Monti, N. Liechtenstein, B. Vesterdorf, L. Wildhaber, ***Economic Law and Justice in Times of Globalisation,*** Festschrift Baudenbacher, 2007, 253, at 263: \"the concept appears to have no meaningful autonomous existence as far as its applicability is concerned. Where the applicants can point to a possession, however, and to interference with their peaceful enjoyment of same, it is arguably the legitimacy of their claim more than their subjective expectations that will weight in the balance\". In a case involving the legitimate expectations of beneficiaries to future social benefits provided by legislation, the European Court of Human Rights found a breach of Article 1 of the Protocol in the later withdrawing of such benefits by governmental action, ***Doldeanu v. Moldova,*** Application 17211/03, Decision 13 November 2007.\n\n130.\n\nFrom a comparative law perspective, the tenets of the legal system of the European Community (now European Union), reflecting the legal traditions of twenty-seven European countries, both civil and common law (including France, the home country of the Claimant) are of relevance, especially since the recognition of the principle of legitimate expectations there has been explicitly based on the international law principle of good faith.140 Based on this premise, the Tribunal of the European Union has upheld the legitimate expectations of importers that the Community would respect public international law.141 According to the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"ECJ\") private parties cannot normally invoke legitimate expectations against the exercise of normative powers by the Community\u2019s institutions, except under the most restrictive conditions (which the Court has never found in any case submitted to it).142\n\nSee ***Opel Austria GmbH (formerly General Motors Austria GmbH) v. Council of the European Union,*** Case T-115/94, Judgment, 22 January 1997 stating that \"The principle of protection of legitimate expectations which according to the case law, forms part of the Community legal order, is the corollary of the principle of good faith in public international law.\"\n\nIn the case mentioned in the previous footnote, contrary to Article 18 of the VCLT (according to which signatories to a treaty not yet in force may not adopt measures that would defeat the treaty\u2019s object and purpose), the Community had increased a customs duty contrary to the treaty of accession of Austria to the EC due to enter into force shortly.\n\nUnder ECJ case law, a competent businessman cannot invoke legitimate expectations in respect of the stability of a regulation that the Commission has wide discretion to modify (see ***Di Lenardo Adriano Sri, Dilexport Sri and Ministero del Commercio con l'Estero,*** Case C-37/02 and C-38/02, Judgment, 15 July 2004, para. 63, 82). The liability of the EC for a legitimate normative act requires in principle, besides damage and causation, that the damage be \"unusual and special\". This is so if a particular category of economic operators are affected in a disproportionate manner in comparison with others (\"unusual damage\"), and if the damage (\"special damage\") goes beyond the inherent risk of a given economic activity, without the legislative measure that gave rise to the alleged damage being justified by a general economic interest. See ***Dorsch Consult Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH v. Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities,*** Case T-184/95, Judgment, 28 April 1998, para. 80, affirmed by the EC Court of Justice, Case C-237/98 P, Judgment, 15 June 2000.\n\n***6.5 Public International Law***\n----------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nUnder international law, unilateral acts, statements and conduct by States may be the source of legal obligations which the intended beneficiaries or addressees, or possibly any member of the international community, can invoke. The legal basis of that binding character appears to be only in part related to the concept of legitimate expectations\u2014being rather akin to the principle of \"estoppel\". Both concepts may lead to the same result, namely, that of rendering the content of a unilateral declaration binding on the State that is issuing it.143 According to the International Court of Justice, only unilateral acts that are unconditional, definitive and \"very specific\" have binding force, which derives from the principle of good faith. This fundamental principle requires a State to abide by its unilateral acts of such a character and to follow a line of conduct coherent with the legal obligations so created.144\n\nSee D.W. Bowett, ***\"Estoppel\" Before International Tribunals and its Relation to Acquiescence,*** 33 ***B.Y.I.I.*** 176 (1957): \"It is possible to construe the estoppel as resting upon a responsibility incurred by the party making the statement for having created an appearance of act, or as a necessary assumption of the risk of another party acting upon the statement\" referred to by M. Reisman and M.H. Arsanjani, ***The Question of Unilateral Governmental Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes, supra*** note 118, 340.\n\nSee ***Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France),*** Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 457, para. 46 at p. 472 and W. Fiedler, \"Unilateral Acts in International Law\", ***IV Encyclopedia of Public International Law*** 1018 (2000).\n\n132.\n\nThe recent \"Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations\"145 (\"the Guidelines\"), which were formulated by the International Law Commission in 2006 as a restatement of international (interstate) case law in the subject matter, are of interest here. We are aware that the Guidelines deal with the legal effects of unilateral acts of States addressed to other subjects of international law, and not with domestic normative acts relied upon by a foreign private investor. Still, we believe that the conditions required for unilateral declarations of a State to give rise to international obligations are of relevance here since the issue before the Tribunal has to be resolved by application of international law.146\n\nAdopted by the International Law Commission at its 58th session in 2006 together with commentaries thereto (ILC Report, A/61/10, 2006, Chapter IX), based on the analysis of the jurisprudence of the ICJ and pertinent State practice summarized in the eighth report of the Special Rapporteur (A/CN.4/557).\n\nThe preamble to the Guidelines states that \"it is often difficult to establish whether the legal effects stemming from the unilateral behaviour of a State are the consequence of the intent that it has expressed or depend on the expectations that its conduct has raised among other subjects of international law\" (4th sentence).\n\n133.\n\nRelevant provisions for our analysis are found in Article 7 of the Guidelines:\n\n\"A unilateral declaration entails obligations for the formulating State only if it is stated in clear and specific terms. In case of doubt as to the scope of the obligations resulting from such a declaration, such obligations must be interpreted in a restrictive manner. In interpreting the content of such obligation, weight shall be given first and foremost to the text of the declaration, together with the context and the circumstances in which it was formulated.\"\n\nAlso of relevance is the final article of the Guidelines. Article 10 on revocation provides that:\n\n\"[a] unilateral declaration that has created legal obligations for the State making the declaration cannot be revoked arbitrarily. In assessing whether a revocation would be arbitrary, consideration should be given to: (i) Any specific terms of the declaration relating to revocation; (ii) The extent to which those to whom the obligations are owed have relied on such obligations; (iii) The extent to which there has been a fundamental change of circumstances\".\n\n134.\n\nInternational law on the binding nature of unilateral commitments, as evidenced by the Guidelines, relies on concepts found in investment arbitral practice and in comparative law concepts, such as the importance of factual circumstances, the relevance of content and intent, non-arbitrariness in case of revocation and the restrictive interpretation of unilateral acts invoked as a source of commitments for the issuing party.147 The cautious approach that emerges appears to be consistent, *mutatis mutandis,* with that of domestic legal systems, European Union legal system and the European Court of Human Rights case law.\n\nSee Guidelines, Commentary to Article 7, ***supra*** note 145.\n\n***7. Application of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nWe turn now to apply the legal principles that we have highlighted to the facts of the case so as to evaluate Total\u2019s various claims of breach by Argentina. In this respect we find it appropriate to distinguish and sub-divide the three distinct claims made by Total, as follows:\n\n- the elimination of the calculation of the tariffs in US dollars;\n\n- the elimination of the automatic adjustments of the US dollar tariffs every six months in accordance with the US PPI, distinguishing in this respect the 6-month automatic adjustment in itself from its pegging to the US dollar based PPI;\n\n- the non-application or elimination of the promises of economic equilibrium and a reasonable rate of return through the ongoing suspension of the Five-Year and Extraordinary Reviews, thus freezing the tariffs since 2002.\n\n***7.1 The Elimination of the Calculation of Gas Tariffs in US Dollars***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the calculation of the gas transportation tariffs in US dollars was provided for by Article 41 of the Gas Decree as an element of the \"normal and periodic adjustment of the tariffs authorized by the body\" [ENARGAS], The provision established further that the tariffs (\"e/ *cuadro tarifario\")* would be expressed in convertible pesos in conformity with Law 23,928, that is, Argentina\u2019s convertibility law of March 1991 (the \"Convertibility Law\"), with the reconversion to pesos to be made in accordance with the parity established in Article 3 of Decree 2,198/91.148\n\nThe same rules were included in Article 9.2 of TGN Licence ***(Reglas B\u00e1sicas)*** which was subject to the Gas Regulatory Framework as provided in Article 1 of the Presidential Decree 2,457/92 granting the Licence to which the Licence was annexed.\n\n137.\n\nUnder the Convertibility Law and generally the Currency Board system that Argentina had adopted in 1991, the peso was pegged to the US dollar at par and there was free convertibility between the peso and the US dollar. As described by the IMF:\n\n\"The Convertibility Law, which pegged the Argentine currency to the U.S. dollar in April 1991, was a response to Argentina\u2019s dire economic situation at the beginning of the 1990s. Following more than a decade of high inflation and economic stagnation, and after several failed attempts to stabilize the economy, in late 1989 Argentina had fallen into hyperinflation and a virtual economic collapse [...]. The new exchange rate regime, which operated like a currency board, was designated to stabilize the economy by establishing a hard nominal peg with credible assurances of non reversibility. The new peso (set equal to 10,000 australes) was fixed at par with the U.S. dollar and autonomous money creation by the central bank was severely constrained, though less rigidly than in a classical currency board. The exchange rate arrangement was part of a larger Convertibility Plan, which included a broader agenda of market-oriented structural reforms to promote efficiency and productivity in the economy. Various service sectors were deregulated, trade was liberalized, and anticompetitive price-fixing schemes were removed; privatization proceeded vigorously, notably in oil, power, and telecommunications, yielding large capital revenues.\"149\n\nSee IMF ***Evaluation Report, supra*** note 53, 11 [footnotes omitted],\n\n138.\n\nAs described by another ICSID Tribunal:\n\n\"In more precise legal terms, the convertibility regime entailed that the national currency (the peso that replaced the Austral at one peso for each 10,000 Australes on January 1, 1992) was freely convertible with the U.S. dollar at 1:1, and the external value of the peso being pegged to the dollar under a currency board type arrangement. Transactions in convertible currencies were permitted. Authorized banks could open accounts in pesos or foreign currencies so that Argentines and foreigners in Argentina were allowed to hold and use any currency. This possibility led in time to the \"dollarization\" of Argentina\u2019s economy to a notable degree: contracts, especially medium and long term contracts such as rents, loans, supply contracts were expressed in dollars, rather than in pesos, and bank deposits were opened and maintained in dollars. Specifically, a large proportion of the banking system\u2019s assets and liabilities were denominated in dollars. The level of dollarization, which had been growing steadily since 1991, increased substantially in the second half of 2000: more than 70% of the private sectors deposits and almost 70% of the banking system credit to private sector were denominated in dollars by the end of 2000.\"150\n\nSee ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 53, para. 105 [footnotes omitted].\n\n139.\n\nHowever, as reported officially by the IMF, in legal terms \"the currency of Argentina is the Argentine peso,\" and only the peso. \"Transactions in convertible currencies are permitted, and contracts in these currencies are legally enforceable, although the currencies are not legal tender.\"151\n\nIMF Argentina, Status Under IMF Articles of Agreements: Article VIII, Position as of January 31, 1999 at p. 32: IMF Argentina, Status Under IMF Articles of Agreements: Article VIII, Position as of December 31, 1999, at p. 33: IMF Argentina, Status Under IMF Articles of Agreements: Article VIII, Position as of December 31,2000, at p. 34.\n\n140.\n\nAs outlined by the Tribunal above at paragraph 81, all calculation of public utility tariffs in US dollars, as well as their indexation to foreign currencies, was rendered ineffective by the Emergency Law. According to Article 8, all of those tariffs would be fixed in pesos at the conversion rate of 1:1. Other provisions of the same law abolished the convertibility at par of the peso with the US dollar provided for under the Convertibility Law, and provided that all private dollar-denominated contracts would be converted to pesos at 1:1, with the possibility of renegotiation of the indebtedness between the parties concerned. Through the various provisions of the Emergency Law, Argentina de-linked its currency and its economy from the US dollar. For the conversion, the law established generally the existing parity of 1:1,152 so that the existing nominal value of all monetary values would go on expressing those values in pesos, although the peso had ceased to be convertible at par to the US dollar.153\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that at the beginning of 2002 the exchange rate depreciated to 1.8 pesos per dollar. On June 25, 2002 the market value of the peso against the US dollar had jumped to almost 1 to 4. Later, the exchange rate stabilized around three pesos for one U.S. dollar.\n\nA major exception was that dollar denominated deposits and credits with banks were converted at 1:1.4 (Decree 471 of March 8, 2002) thus giving a limited protection to depositors, the cost for the banks being covered by Argentina\u2019s treasury.\n\n141.\n\nThe pesification of the gas tariffs, as well as the tariffs of all other utilities and public contracts, and the cessation of their adjustment according to foreign indices, was carried out via the Emergency Law as an integral part of the complete de-linking in legal terms of the peso from the US dollar (and, as a consequence, marked the end of the pegging at par that had been in force since 1991 under Argentina\u2019s currency board system) taking place after the run on Argentina\u2019s reserves and the massive devaluation of the peso in the international market.\n\n142.\n\nTotal submits that it is not challenging the pesification of Argentina\u2019s economy as effected by the Emergency Law. Total objects only to the pesification of the gas tariffs (and the connected abandonment of the PPI adjustment). Total claims that the pegging of the gas tariffs to the US dollar was neither connected with nor part of the convertibility system, and, accordingly, should not have been abolished as part of such pesification in view of the promises and assurances given by Argentina under the Gas Regulatory Framework about the stability of the tariff denomination in US dollars.154 According to Total, the calculation of the gas tariffs in US dollars and the automatic adjustment of the tariffs according to the US PPI were specific promises given by Argentina in order to maintain TGN\u2019s gas tariffs in real dollar terms.155 In other terms, these two \"additional commitments\" were stabilisation clauses exactly designed to operate in the event of a devaluation. On this premise, according to Total, even in the case of a massive devaluation (entailing a radical change in the Convertibility regime):\n\n\"the onus would be on the regulator to call an Extraordinary Tariff Review in order to reduce the dollar-calculated tariff to reflect the reduction in peso-based costs and restore the licensee\u2019s equilibrium. Therein lies the principal benefit of the dollar tariff: it protects the licensee whilst this review is carried out; whereas with a peso tariff, the licensee is exposed to a devaluation and there is no immediate incentive for the regulator to carry out a review promptly. However, in either case, the principal commitment in the Gas Regulatory Framework is that the licensee\u2019s economic equilibrium is maintained through an Extraordinary Tariff Re vie w.\"156\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 32.\n\nSee TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, para. 30.\n\n143.\n\nArgentina points out that, in terms of devalued post-2001 pesos, this would have meant an increase in tariffs of about 200-300%. In response, Total states that it would have been feasible to maintain those tariffs in US dollars through an Extraordinary Tariff review, notwithstanding that the rest of the economy had been pesified.157 According to Total, had Argentina not pesified the tariffs and had ENARGAS carried out the Extraordinary Review *sua sponte* on the consumers\u2019 request according to Articles 46 and 47 of the Gas Law, by taking into account the reduced value in US dollar terms of those components of the tariff that were incurred in (devalued) pesos, the tariff in US dollar terms would have decreased by almost 25% (equivalent in peso terms to a 130% tariff increase).158 More specifically, after the Extraordinary Review the tariffs of US$11 would have been equivalent to AR$33 (after the devaluation) and would have amounted to US$8.33 (equivalent to AR$25).159\n\nSee TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, para. 337.\n\nSee TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, para. 44 relying on the LECG Report on Damages, paras. 142-144.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 339 and the chart at p. 138.\n\n144.\n\nRecalling its previous legal analysis of the applicable principles regarding government promises and undertakings made to foreign investors, *i.e.* the requirement of specificity and the freedom that States generally have to amend their laws, particularly when a fundamental change of factual circumstances occurs, the Tribunal is not convinced by Total\u2019s arguments for the following reasons.\n\n***7.2 No \"Promise\" of Dollar Denominated Tariffs and Their Adjustment was Made to Total***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the provisions according to which the gas tariffs were to be calculated in US dollars and adjusted in line with the US PPI cannot properly be construed as \"promises\" upon which Total could rely, since they were not addressed directly or indirectly to Total. They were provided for in the Gas Decree and in TGN\u2019s license as a means of implementing the core principle of the Gas Law, namely, that of guaranteeing to efficient Licensees sufficient revenue to cover all reasonable operating costs and ensuring a reasonable rate of return (Articles 38 and 39), in accordance with the dollar-based convertibility system then in force in Argentina. Total contends that, under the Gas Regulatory Framework, dollar tariffs were not linked to the Convertibility Law and invokes section 9.2 of TGN\u2019s Licence, Article 41 of the Gas Decree and section 7.1, Annex F of the Bidding Rules of 1992.160 The Tribunal notes, however, that section 9.2 of TGN\u2019s Licence and Article 41 of the Gas Decree expressly refer to the Convertibility Law. This reference thus supports the opposite conclusion, namely, that the dollar denomination of the tariffs was closely linked to the Convertibility Law. In addition, another linkage is shown by the fact that the Convertibility Law prohibited indexation in pesos,161 in order to reinforce the stabilisation aim of the Convertibility regime,162 while indexation of dollar values through reference to foreign prices was instead not prohibited.163\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 321.\n\nAs part of this design the convertibility law, in strict adherence with the nominalistic principle, expressly prohibited any indexation mechanism for debts, including in cases of delayed payment by the debtor ***(mora del deudor).*** Article 7 of the Convertibility Law 23,928 of March 1991 provides that a debtor of a given amount in pesos satisfies his obligation by remitting at the date due that nominal quantity. See also ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 53, para. 106 and footnote 123.\n\nIn the IMF\u2019s words: \"The Convertibility regime was a stabilization device to deal with the hyperinflation that existed at the beginning of the 1990s, and in this was very successful.\" (see IMF ***Evaluation Report, supra*** note 53, 3)\n\nThis situation is not belied by Decree 669/00 Annex I (the act containing the Second ***Acta Acuerdo)*** where it stated that: \"the parties recognize that the application of the PPI does not entail an indexation within the terms of Convertibility Law No. 23,928 but it results from the adjustment following the international evolution of value changes for assets and services representing the activity, all this in accordance with Articles 95 and 96 of Law No. 24,076 determining public order for the Natural Gas Public Service.\"\n\n146.\n\nTotal claims that the denomination of the tariff in US dollars was meant to protect the distributors in case of devaluation. Total supports this argument by reference to the TGN Offering Memorandum of 1995 pursuant to which the shares still belonging to the government were offered for sale in the market. According to Total, the warnings to investors contained therein concerning the consequences of a peso devaluation on TGN\u2019s operation did not include a warning that the US dollar tariffs might be pesified.164 The Tribunal is, however, of the opinion that this document rather points in the contrary direction. The 1995 Offering Memorandum drafted for the sale of the 25% stake held by the government warned potential investors of the risk of a great devaluation under the heading \"Convertibility and risks of the exchange rate.\" More precisely, according to the Memorandum:\n\n\"Since the coming into force of the Convertibility Law in April, 1991, the peso/dollar exchange rate has suffered strict variations. The Central Bank, which in accordance with this Law is obliged to sell dollars to a price which does not exceed a peso per unit, has adopted the policy to buy dollars also at the rate of 1 peso per dollar. The persistence of the free convertibility of pesos into dollars cannot be ensured. In the event a great devaluation of the peso against the dollar takes place, the financial position and results of operations of the Company might be negatively affected, as well as its capacity to make payments in foreign currency (including cancellation of debt denominated in foreign currency) and dividend distribution in dollars at acceptable levels.\"\n\nIn the light of this text, the Tribunal is of the view that the Memorandum, besides warning potential investors of the general commercial risk of TGN\u2019s default and of decreasing demand for TGN caused by a devaluation of peso, also warned potential investors in TGN that a great devaluation of the peso and/or an abandonment of convertibility would affect the calculation of the tariffs in US dollar terms resulting in prejudice to \"the financial position and results of operations of the Company.\" This reflected the fact that, as Total points out, TGN\u2019s regulated tariffs represented 98% of its revenue.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 343.\n\n147.\n\nFinally, Total supports its argument that the US dollar tariffs and the PPI adjustment were \"commitments\" on which it could legally rely, invoking section 7.1, Annex F, Bidding Rules. We recall that with a view to obtaining foreign participation in the privatization of the various Argentine state-owned utilities, the government made specific commitments towards such interested foreign parties for the purposes of inducing them to participate in the bidding process and to bring additional capital, technical and other know-how to modernize and efficiently run those utilities. More specifically, Total refers to section 7.1 of the Bidding Rules. Under the heading *\"Ajuste Futuro de Tarifas\"* (Annex F section 7), section 7.1. provided that \"Tariffs are expressed in pesos, convertible as per Law No. 23,928 at par 1=1 with the United States dollar.... tariffs would be adjusted immediately and automatically in the event of a modification of the exchange rate. To all effects, the amount of Argentine currency necessary to buy one US dollar in the New York market shall be considered.\"165 Moreover, the Bidding Rules at section 7.5. went on to indicate that: \"The Distribution tariff... shall be adjusted semi-annually, from the Taking of Possession, in accordance with the variation operated in the wholesale price index of industrial commodities of the US, taken by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system, within the second month prior to the beginning of each semester after the Taking of Possession, as established in the corresponding licence and the remaining requirements established in the Tariff Rules and General Conditions of Service. The Regulating Authority shall determine the mechanism for adjustment.\"\n\nAccording to the Bidding Rules, Annex F, section 7.2, \"Variations of the gas price shall be applied to tariffs so as not to produce benefits nor losses to the Distribution or Transportation companies, as per Article 38 (c) of Law No. 24,076 and reglamentary provisions. Initial tariffs have been calculated on the basis of a gas price of $ 0,035 per m3 at 9,300 kilocalories or 38,93 megajoules, at a temperature of 15\u00b0 C and 1 bar pressure. In the case of propane/butane gas distributed by network, the initial tariffs have been calculated on the basis of a price of $ 142,50 per ton at separation plant exit. The Regulating Authority shall determine information requirements and necessary mechanisms to adjust tariffs according to variations in the gas price.\".\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to analyse the import of those provisions because Total did not take part in the bidding process in December 1992. Therefore, on the basis of the legal principles highlighted above, Total cannot invoke the Bidding Rules as a promise on which it could have relied when it invested in the gas sector in 2001. The situation of Total is, therefore, different from that of foreign investors who had participated in the privatization and, consequently, invoked their reliance on the bidding rules in other disputes.\n\n149.\n\nNo assurance about such stability\u2014that is the maintenance of the tariffs in US dollars and the associated US PPI adjustment, irrespective of the Convertibility Law being in force\u2014had been given by Argentina\u2019s authorities to Total when Total was considering the investment or was carrying out the transaction. Moreover, such assurances had not been sought by Total.166 In making its investment Total properly considered (or should have considered) the totality of the relevant legal regime as it existed in 2001 (including the suspension of the US PPI adjustment). Within this framework, the Gas Decree and TGN\u2019s Licence (to which Total was not party) incorporated as a matter of law and regulation the US dollar and US PPI pegs.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Total has not claimed that it had decided to invest in the gas distribution sector in Argentina, rather than hypothetically in some other country, in view of the fact that these tariffs were set in US dollars and adjusted to the US PPI.\n\n150.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal concludes that the denomination of the tariffs in US dollars was not the object of a promise or a commitment to Total but rather was an integral element of the Gas Regulatory Framework in place in Argentina when Total made its investment. The automatic adjustment of the tariffs to the US PPI was part of this framework and was closely linked to and reflected the denomination and calculation in US dollars of those tariffs, which in turn was correlated to the convertibility monetary system in force in Argentina since 1991.\n\n***7.3 Relevance of the PPI Adjustment Suspension Being in Place when Total Invested in TGN***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal now must examine the conduct of Total with respect to its alleged reliance on the stability of the operation of the gas regime in US dollars as was the case when Total made its investment, taking into account the suspension(s) of the US PPI adjustments that were in place at that time.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Total agreed to buy the shares of TransCanada Group in May 2000 and that it closed the deal in January 2001. Thus, on this second date, Total became a French foreign investor in Argentina whose investment in TGN was protected by the BIT. As recalled above at paragraphs 62 ff, at that time the PPI adjustments had been suspended twice by agreement between the ENARGAS (and the government) and the Licensees: first, in January 2000, for six months and subsequently, on August 4, 2000, for two years. Moreover, on August 18, 2000, a judge had suspended the application of the second adjustment and the subsequent recovery of the increases due to accrue during the suspension.167\n\nFor more details see para 65 above.\n\n153.\n\nArgentina submits that Total could not have legitimate expectations about the stability of the tariff regime as laid down in the Gas Regulatory Framework since it had been undermined by those suspensions. Argentina suggests that, in analysing the Gas Regulatory Framework, Total had not exercised the diligence that it should have done as a foreign investor intending to make a long-term investment in a country such as Argentina.168 In this regard, Total explained in its submissions that Total\u2019s management, even if aware of this development, \"... did not consider that TGN\u2019s right to the adjustment of its tariffs in accordance with the US PPI to be in jeopardy.\"169\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 201 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 361.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Total\u2019s management considered the *\u00efvcsX Acta Acuerdo* as a \"favour\" to Fernando De la R\u00fca\u2019s new administration; the second suspension for two years as immaterial because of the subsequent recovery provided for by Decree, and the suspension of the Decree by injunction as irrelevant because Total believed the injunction was based on weak legal grounds (the injunction had been challenged by the government), notwithstanding, however, the admission of Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Faur\u00e8s (one of Total\u2019s managers in Argentina and a witness called by Total) that \"there are always doubts in a legal dispute, since it depends on an independent power.\"170\n\nSee Cross-examination of Fran\u00e7ois Faur\u00e8s, Transcript of the Hearing in the merits (Spanish) Day 3, 796:2-11.This is also in connection with the provision of Section 18.3 contained in the TGN Licence. See ***supra*** note 84.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while all of these developments affecting the tariff adjustment based on the US PPI were considered as irrelevant by Total\u2019s management in making its investment in TGN, another foreign company (CMS Gas Transmission Company) that had already invested in TGN considered them relevant enough to start a dispute against Argentina under the U.S.-Argentina BIT based on the opposite conclusion that TGN\u2019s right to adjust its tariffs in accordance with the US PPI was in jeopardy.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, although the various *Actas Acuerdo* and judicial acts at the time were temporary, they affected the future existence of the PPI adjustment mechanism. From a business point of view, an experienced international investor such as Total could not have considered these developments as irrelevant to the future stability of the PPI-adjusted US dollar gas tariffs. An objective risk analysis of the situation should have alerted Total that the stability of the gas regime was being undermined in practice from various directions. This was happening at the very moment when, for the first time, the PPI would have provided greater protection to the utilities than if a peso-based adjustment had been in place. Expecting that, after a 2-year suspension, the government would have been willing and able to impose on the users *(usuarios)* an obligation to pay the PPI increase retroactively for that period appears contrary to common sense or experience. This is especially the case since a judge, at the request of the Ombudsman, issued an injunction in the interest of those users.\n\n157.\n\nTotal also claims that it did not weigh these negative developments because it was focusing on a long term perspective in making its investment, as stated by one of its managers in oral testimony. This is quite possible, but then Total contradicts itself when it complains that its legitimate expectations based on the stability of this very regime have been frustrated.\n\n158.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, the Tribunal is of the view that Total\u2019s alleged full reliance on the mechanism for adjusting tariffs based on the US PPI was misplaced, especially in light of the growing difficulties experienced by Argentina\u2019s economy that were at the root of the US PPI tariff adjustment suspension.\n\n***7.4 Reasons for Argentina\u2019s Abandonment of US Dollar Tariffs and Their Adjustment According to US PPI***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal has already highlighted above that the reasons for, and modalities and context of, a change to a national legal system (specifically, in this case, the change affecting the Gas Regulatory Framework) are also relevant and important in light of the requirement that a host State act in good faith, which underpins the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n160.\n\nIn this respect the Tribunal considers that Argentina\u2019s emergency at the end of 2001, taking into account its political and social fall-out, justified Argentina\u2019s abandonment of the convertibility regime, including the pesification of tariffs. Leaving utilities tariffs in US dollars, while the rest of the economy had been de-dollarized, would have lacked any reasonable basis and would have entailed a form of reverse discrimination or a privilege for the beneficiaries. This is particularly true taking into account that TGN\u2019s gas transportation activity is not an ordinary business operation but is qualified by law as a \"national public service\" (Article 1, Gas Law). The principle that the gas transportation and distribution activities are to be regulated so as to ensure that just and reasonable tariffs are applied (Article 2(d), Gas Law), which Total has specifically emphasized, cannot justify any one-sided interpretation in favour of public service providers. Rather, the Tribunal considers that a more balanced interpretation is called for, taking into account that consumer protection is one of the primary objectives of the Gas Law, which provides that the tariffs shall be just and reasonable for consumers and at the same time that ensure that utilities can earn a reasonable rate of return. Total suggests that while maintaining the tariffs in US dollars, an Extraordinary Review could have reduced the tariff to reflect the pesification of the local components of the costs. However, this would have transferred most of the impact of the peso devaluation to Argentina\u2019s consumers and only the gas tariffs would have remained in dollars, while the rest of the economy had been pesified.\n\n161.\n\nIn the case of a \"normal\" devaluation of the peso, the de-dollarisation of the gas tariffs would not have been economically justified nor socially necessary, and might thus be objectionable under the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT (Article 3). In contrast, the \"bankruptcy\" of Argentina in 2001-2002, the forced abrupt abandonment of the US dollar parity and the devaluation of the peso by more than 300%, support the conclusion that the pesification of the tariffs and their de-linkage from the US PPI were not unfair or inequitable.\n\n162.\n\nThe balancing test recalled above, requires an assessment of the existence of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard taking into account the purposes, nature and objectives of the measures challenged, and an evaluation of whether they are proportional, reasonable and not discriminatory. In other terms, the changes to the Gas Regulatory Framework brought about by the Measures have to be judged in the context of the severe economic emergency that Argentina was facing in 2001-2002.\n\n163.\n\nThe pesification was a measure of general application to all sectors of Argentina\u2019s economy and to all legal obligations expressed in monetary terms within the country. It was a devaluation and redenomination of the national currency within the monetary sovereignty of the State. Moreover, this measure was taken in good faith in a situation of recognized economic emergency of an exceptional, even catastrophic, nature. In this context, a series of harsh measures was imposed on the population (such as blocking withdrawals from banks - the *corralito)* to avoid a general collapse of the economy, and hence of the State and society, and to foster a progressive recovery. The complete reversal of Argentina\u2019s monetary policies and system was made inevitable by the impossibility for the country to maintain the exchange rate after having lost almost all of its reserves, leading to the massive, rapid devaluation of the peso on the free exchange markets, while the IMF had withdrawn its support.171 In this context, the pesification of the economy\u2014the elimination of the fixed link to the US dollar\u2014necessarily also entailed the de-dollarisation of the public utilities\u2019 tariff regimes on the same terms, so that all tariff related dollar-denominated debt as well as future prices were converted into pesos at the previously fixed and official exchange rate of 1:1. Utilities were treated the same as all other holders of contractual rights, salary holders, etc. in Argentina.172 The 1:1 rate reflected the impossibility for holders of debt in US dollars to pay the market rate for the US dollar when all of their claims, income, etc., had been converted forcibly and inevitably at the official rate. The de-dollarisation of the tariffs was thus a non-discriminatory measure of general application, parallel to those applied to other sectors of the economy and to all inhabitants of Argentina. The mechanism for tariff adjustment in accordance with the US PPI was also a part of the tariff dollarisation scheme connected with convertibility at par; accordingly, it was an exception to the prohibition of indexation of any peso-denominated obligations under the convertibility, reflecting the pegging of the tariffs to the US dollar rather than to the evolution of prices in Argentina. The US PPI adjustment was not abolished by cubing this link in isolation, but as part of the delinkage of the Argentine monetary system from the US dollar that was effected by the general pesification via the Emergency Law in the exercise of Argentina\u2019s monetary sovereignty.173\n\nSee above para. 72 ff.\n\nExcept that depositors obtained a preferential rate of 1:1,4, with the burden thereby imposed on banks refinanced by Argentina\u2019s treasury (a differential treatment challenged by Total under its claim that Argentina breached the national treatment provision in Article 4 of the BIT, see below para. 204).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that other international tribunals and authoritative scholarly works have also denied that in most instances of devaluation a breach of international standards of treatment and/or protection of private property is present, except in extreme situations of improper conduct by the State. This is the consistent jurisprudence of the ECHR under Protocol 1 to the ECHR protecting private property (see L. Wildhaber, ***The Protection of Legitimate Expectations in European Human Rights Law, supra*** note 139, p. 253 ff.). See, for the absence of any duty under international law as to obligations in domestic currency subject to the nominalistic principle, F. Mann, ***The Legal Aspect of Money,*** Fifth Edition, 1992, Oxford, 465 ff; G. Burdeau, ***L\u2019exercice des comp\u00e9tences mon\u00e9taires par les Etats,*** RC 1988-V, 261 (except for \"des conditions totalement arbitraires\"). See also I. Brownlie, ***Principles of Public International Law,*** Seventh Edition, 2008, at p. 532, according to whom \"State measures, ***prima facie*** a lawful exercise of powers of government, may affect foreign interests considerably without amounting to expropriation. Thus foreign assets and their use may be subjected to taxation, trade restrictions involving licences and quotas, or measures of devaluation.\" [italics in original]\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this measure and its application cannot be considered unfair in the circumstances, considering the inherent flexibility of the fair and equitable standard. Unfairness must be evaluated in respect of the measures challenged, both in the light of their objective effects but also in the light of the reasons that led to their adoption (subjective good faith, proportionality to the aims and legitimacy of the laher according to general practice). It is therefore not possible to share Total\u2019s view, developed especially in the LECG Report on Damages, that the pesification breached Total\u2019s treaty rights and that its effects must be included in the calculation of damages suffered by Total for which it claims compensation under the BIT.174 Such changes to general legislation, in the absence of specific stabilization promises to the foreign investor, reflect a legitimate exercise of the host State\u2019s governmental powers that are not prevented by a BIT\u2019s fair and equitable treatment standard and are not in breach of the same.175 The untouchability (\"intangibilidad\") of those foreign currency peg provisions invoked by Total cannot be the object of legal expectation in a case of monetary and economic crisis such as that experienced by Argentina in 2001-2002.176\n\nTotal complains that TGN was unable to meet its obligations in dollars undertaken outside Argentina. As a consequence, TGN defaulted on these obligations and had to negotiate a restructuring of such debt with its foreign creditors (thus transferring to them a share of the burden). The Tribunal is of the view that this was but a consequence of the devaluation of TGN\u2019s assets and revenues as a consequence of the monetary crisis in Argentina. The Tribunal further notes that TGN found itself in the same position as any other local company that had financed itself in hard currency outside Argentina - without entering into the debate between the parties whether TGN had not been prudent in so doing as ENARGAS had pre-warned TGN (in this regard see ENARGAS\u2019s Note 1906/99 and ENARGAS\u2019s Note 3735/99, Exhibits A RA 207 and A RA 208, respectively).\n\nAccording to the award of the ***LG&E*** Tribunal, this was the case of the obligations that were made by Argentina to foreign investors under the Gas Law and its implementing regulations because they were the basis on which the original investors relied during the privatization process to make investments in the gas sector. See ***LG&E v. Argentina,***cit. ***supra*** note 111, para. 175.\n\nWhile it can be said that the fair and equitable treatment standard should be understood as a pro-active standard that \"is conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment\" ***(MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Chile,*** cit. ***supra*** note 96, para. 113), we do not believe that a BIT may (and is meant to) insulate a foreign investor either from a major crisis such as the one at issue here or from the impact of general non-discriminatory measures taken by a host country to cope with such a crisis.\n\n165.\n\nThe general character, the good faith and absence of discrimination by Argentina, as well as the exceptional circumstance that \"forced\" Argentina to adopt the measures at issue, viewed objectively, preclude the Tribunal from finding that Argentina breached the fair and equitable obligations of treatment under the BIT with respect to the dollar denomination of the tariff and the six-month US PPI adjustment.\n\n***7.5 The Freezing of Tariffs Since 2002***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nHaving examined the measures taken by Argentina to address the crisis by enacting the Emergency Law *(i.e.,* the pesification of the tariffs and abolition of adjustments based on the variations of the US PPI), the Tribunal now addresses the *de facto* freezing of tariffs since 2002, which was caused by the failure of the renegotiation mechanisms proposed by Argentina after the enactment the Emergency Law.\n\n167.\n\nWe recall that the Tribunal has concluded above that pesification of the utility tariffs was reasonable in the circumstances due to the crisis in Argentina and the general de-dollarisation of Argentina\u2019s economy. No expectations could reasonably be maintained (even less \"legitimately\") that only the tariffs would be excepted from such a pesification, especially as Total was not a beneficiary of any specific promise. The situation is, however, different concerning the absence of any readjustment of the gas tariffs since 2002. We recall that the principle that tariffs of privatized gas utilities should be sufficient to cover their reasonable costs and a reasonable rate of return was enshrined in the Gas Regulatory Framework. As a means to ensure this \"economic equilibrium\", a variety of adjustments over time were provided for by the Gas Regulatory Framework. These included the 6-month US PPI adjustment, the 5-year Tariff Review and the Extraordinary Review. This framework is consistent with sound management of utilities in a market economy, where private entrepreneurs must be able to cover their costs and make a reasonable return in order to operate and to raise capital to provide an efficient service, especially considering that investments in such utilities are based on long term planning. The gas transportation tariffs were accordingly to be determined and adjusted in a way reflecting those criteria. The expectation of foreign investors in the gas sector about the long term maintenance of the above-mentioned principle was reinforced by the existence of Argentina\u2019s BITs. Irrespective of their specific wording, undoubtedly these treaties are meant to promote foreign direct investment and reflect the signatories\u2019 commitments to a hospitable investment climate.177 Imposing conditions that make an investment unprofitable for a long term investor (for instance, compelling a foreign investor to operate at a loss) is surely not compatible with the underlying assumptions and purpose of the BIT regime *(i.e.,* to create favourable conditions for French investments...\" in accordance with the Preamble to the Argentina-France BIT).178\n\nSee ***Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada,*** UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, 10 April 2001, paras 115-116; ***Saluka Investments BVv. The Czech Republic, supra*** note 103, para. 293.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 10 of the Emergency Law prevented public service providers from suspending or modifying their obligation to provide the service.\n\n168.\n\nAn operator-investor such as Total was entitled, therefore, to expect that the gas regime would respect certain basic features. This did not mean that Total could rely on BIT protection to ensure the stability of the gas law regime without any possibility of change to that regime by Argentina in the light of the dramatic developments. The basic principles of economic equilibrium and business viability enshrined in the Gas Law were protected from a forward looking perspective by the mechanisms of readjustment, namely the ordinary and extraordinary reviews whose benefits were not restricted to the participants in the initial privatisation.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these principles and mechanisms were restated forcefully in the Emergency Law and in the subsequent decrees of early 2002 that were based on that law, which established a single commission for all renegotiations of utilities contracts and set short deadlines to complete these processes.179\n\nThe Tribunal notes that under well-established principles of Argentina\u2019s law - which the Tribunal is empowered to apply as law under Article 8.4 BIT - rights deriving from a concession are \"acquired rights\" protected under the Constitution, see the leading\\_Borriz'ew decision of the Supreme Court of Argentina (1925) referred to by Total (see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 167). See also Section 9.8 TGN Licence which provides for the licensee\u2019s right to compensation in case of \"freezing, administration and/or price control.\" (Section 9.8 TGN Licence).\n\n170.\n\nMoreover, since this process was moving slower than anticipated, the Ministry of Economy authorised ENARGAS to proceed with an Extraordinary Review that had been blocked by the Emergency Law.180 Thus, while pesifying the tariffs and suppressing the US PPI adjustment, the Emergency Law restated the principle that tariffs could be readjusted, a future undertaking that gained special importance after the devaluation and the complete overturn of the US dollar basis of the gas regulatory regime. We note moreover that the Gas Law enshrining the fundamental principles mentioned above was not amended and is still in force.\n\nSee above para. 88.\n\n171.\n\nHowever, the Extraordinary Review, as well as a 7% tariff increase proposed by Argentina\u2019s Executive in December 2002 and January 2003 (Decrees 2,437/02, 146/03, and 120/03),181 were blocked by a judicial intervention.182 When President Kirchner took office in May 2003, no adjustment of TGN\u2019s tariffs had yet taken place. By this point, Argentina had emerged from the crisis as commentators, international organizations and other arbitral tribunals in investment disputes against Argentina have recognized.183 The failure of the renegotiation process in 2002 to lead to re-adjustments, notwithstanding the legal provisions enacted for that purpose, might be understandable in view of the political and economic emergency of that period.184\n\nSee Exhibits C-59, C-60 and C-61 and Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 91.\n\nAs to the blocking of ENARGAS\u2019s Extraordinary Tariff Review see above para. 88. The other injunctions that blocked the above-mentioned proposed 7% tariff increase are at Exhibits C-163, C-164 and C-179. See also Total\u2019s Memorial, footnote 144 at p. 42.\n\nSee ***inter alia,*** ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 53, paras 157-158 and references listed there. See also Total\u2019s Reply, para. 620 ff.\n\nThe judicial injunction of 14 November 2002 mentioned above blocking ENARGAS\u2019s extraordinary review and the other injunctions blocking the 7% tariff increase enacted by the Government are evidence of the difficulty during that period for the competent administrative authorities to carry out the process entrusted to them in an orderly way.\n\n172.\n\nThis is not true after President Kirchner\u2019s election and the creation through UNIREN of a general mechanism to carry out tariff re-adjustments. It is generally recognized that Argentina\u2019s economy quickly recovered from the crisis\u2014by the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004. Moreover, in February 2004 a 450% increase in the gas price was imposed on industrial users. This increase did not go, however, to the benefit of TGN, but rather financed the trust fund for new investments in the gas transportation network.185 Total has also submitted that the government treated the gas sector differently than other sectors in this respect.\n\nTotal pinpoints this 450% increase in the gas tariffs for the industrial users to underline that Argentina has treated TGN in an unfair and inequitable manner. As to the terms of the Government\u2019s offer after many years of renegotiation, Total points out that the offer included a \"paltry temporary tariff increase of 15% in peso terms to be applied from 1 January to 1 November 2008. This increase is dwarfed in comparison with 450% surcharges on TGN\u2019s pesified tariffs imposed on TGN\u2019s industrial customers to remunerate the Government-established trust fund for the expansions to TGN\u2019s network...\" (see Total\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41).\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls here that UNIREN was required to conclude the renegotiation process by 31 December, 2004, this being the new term set out after the ineffective expiration of the latest term fixed by MoE Resolution No. 62/03.186 However, this did not happen. Negotiations with utilities had been dragging. As late as April 2007, UNIREN proposed to TGN a Final *Acta Acuerdo* entailing a 15% staggered tariff increase, that would not have remedied the lack of readjustments in the past. Moreover, Article 17 of the proposal imposed on TGN, as a precondition for the agreement to come into force, the obligation to obtain from its shareholders: i) an immediate suspension of any claim against Argentina; and ii) their agreement to entirely withdraw those claims after the full tariff review was held and the new tariffs published. As outlined by Total, under Article 17, TGN needed to secure the relevant undertakings from 99.9% of its shareholders (including CMS and Total). Without the above-mentioned suspensions and withdrawals, the *Acta Acuerdo* would be terminated and thus TGN would not receive tariff increase, the Licence could be revoked and TGN would be obliged to indemnify the government for any damages payable as a result of a claim brought by a TGN minority shareholder. Total submits that these conditions represent an additional breach of the fair and equitable treatment required under Article 3 of the BIT.\n\nLaw 25,790 of 2003 setting out the criteria for renegotiation by UNIREN (Exhibit C-261).\n\n174.\n\nIn sum, from the passage of Emergency Law onwards, Argentina\u2019s public authorities repeatedly established new deadlines, causing protracted delays in the renegotiation of concessions and licences (the tariff regime included) in the public utility sector for almost six years. At the same time, any automatic semi-annual adjustment (such as the one originally provided linked to the US PPI) had been discontinued.\n\n175.\n\nAs mentioned above, the failure to promptly readjust the tariffs when the Emergency Law was enacted and during the height of the crisis could have been justified, provided that Argentina subsequently had pursued successful renegotiations to re-establish the equilibrium of the tariffs as provided by law. This, however, has not happened due to the inconclusive results of the renegotiation process entrusted by Argentina to UNIREN. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that, in this respect, Argentina is in breach of its BIT obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment to Total under Article 3 in respect of Total\u2019s investment in TGN.\n\n***7.6 Analysis of Previous Arbitral Decisions***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nAt this point, before concluding on this claim, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recall previous arbitral decisions that have dealt with the impact of the Emergency Law and related measures on Argentina\u2019s legal framework governing generally the public utilities sectors and, more specifically, the gas sector. The Tribunal shares the opinion that judicial consistency in the field of international investment law is as far as possible desirable, notwithstanding the absence of a rule of precedent.187\n\nThe Tribunal notes that settlement of investment disputes under BITs is not a centralized system, even within the context of ICSID, so that uniformity of solutions (even in cases presenting similarities and connections) may not necessarily be attained. Each Tribunal has to decide each case independently based on the assessment of the arbitrators operating to the best of their ability and guided by the specific BIT at issue. As a consequence, an arbitral tribunal applying a specific BIT may well reach decisions different from those of other tribunals in similar cases under similar BITs in light of the different factual contexts and the variable factual circumstances of, and the tribunal\u2019s consideration of the legal arguments submitted by the parties in, each case. The same position as to the role of precedents has been taken by other ICSID Tribunals. In this regard see ***AES Corp. v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 26, 2005, paras. 23-25, where the Tribunal noted at para. 25 that \"... striking similarities in the wording of many BITs often dissimulate real differences in the definition of some key concepts, as it may be the case, in particular, for the determination of \"investments\" or for the precise definition of rights and obligations for each party.\"; ***SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Gen\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines,***  ICSID Case No. ARB/02/06, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, January 29, 2004, para. 97; ***Enron v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (Ancillary Claim), August 2, 2004, para. 25. For a different approach to the role of precedents in investment treaty case-law, see ***Saipem S.p.A. v. The People's Republic of Bangladesh,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, para. 67 stating that: \"The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.\" [footnotes omitted]\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, among the disputes against Argentina raised by foreign investors in Argentina\u2019s public utilities sectors, those involving Enron (a U.S. investor in TGS, one of the two gas transportation companies subject to the privatization process of 1991-1992), British Gas (a U.K. investor in MetroGAS, one of the eight gas distribution companies subject to the privatization process of 1991-1992) and National Grid Transco pic (a U.K. investor in Transener, an electricity transmission company subject to the privatization process of 1992-1993) concerned investors who had been original participants in the privatization process.188 By finding that the enactment of the Emergency Law breached the relevant fair and equitable treatment clause by Argentina, these tribunals emphasize the Bidding Rules that regulated participation in the privatization of the various public utilities concerned (as well as the various related Information Memoranda prepared by Argentina\u2019s financial advisers for this purpose). In order to find that Argentina had breached the relevant BIT, these tribunals have referred explicitly to these rules as specific commitments of Argentina towards foreign investors and as specific promises made to them on which they had relied on in making their investment. According to these tribunals, Argentina (through the pesification of gas tariffs and the removal of the US PPI tariff adjustment mechanism as a consequence of the Emergency Law) frustrated the expectations of those investors who legitimately relied upon the provisions of the Bidding Rules and breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation of the relevant BIT.\n\nSee ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina, supra***note 20, para. 47 ff.; ***BG Group Pic v. Argentina, supra***note 113, para. 24 ff.; ***National Grid pic v. Argentina, supra***note 111, para. 56 ff, respectively.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the position of Total is different from that of the claimants in the above-mentioned cases who took part in the privatization process, as Total invested in Argentina\u2019s gas sector in 2001, almost ten years after the privatization process took place. We have explained above why this Tribunal believes that this different factual situation warrants different legal conclusions as to the presence or lack of \"specific commitments\" by Argentina and as to the issue of \"legitimate expectations\" based thereon.\n\n179.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunals in *Sempra, LG&E* and *CMS,189* have found breaches of the fair and equitable treatment standard because of the pesification of tariffs (and the connected abolition of tariff adjustments to the US PPI), where the investors involved had invested after the original privatization process. As Total did here, these investors had subsequently acquired their interests in the gas distribution and transmission utilities from Argentina itself,190 or from other investors. According to these tribunals, the US dollar denomination of gas tariffs and their automatic adjustment to the US PPI variations should have remained unaffected by the general pesification adopted by Argentina through the Emergency Law pursuant to the fair and equitable treatment standard protection under the relevant BITs. This Tribunal has explained above the basis upon which it reached the partly different conclusion that neither the pesification of gas tariffs nor the abolition of their linkage to the US PPI variations are in breach of the fair and equitable clause of the Argentina-France BIT. The Tribunal believes that its conclusions are firmly rooted in relevant international law, as reviewed above, taking into account the features of the Argentina-France BIT and the specific circumstances of Total\u2019s investment, and in the light of the exceptional nature of Argentina\u2019s crisis.\n\nSee ***LG&E v. Argentina, supra***note 111, para. 52 ff.; Sempra Energy International v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, para. 88 ff.; ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina, supra***  note 29.\n\nThis is the case of CMS which acquired its shares in TGN directly from Argentina pursuant to the second public bidding process of July 1995 by which Argentina sold its remaining 25% share in TGN. See above para. 42.\n\n180.\n\nAs explained above, in following this different approach, this Tribunal has distinguished the abandonment of the US dollar denomination of tariffs and their linkage to the US PPI (found not to be in breach of the BIT in view of their connection to the Convertibility Law and the exceptional crisis of Argentina that led to the pesification)191 from the subsequent failure to readjust the tariffs. The Tribunal has found that this latter conduct by Argentina constitutes a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, also because it is contrary to the very principles spelled out by Argentina\u2019s law and authorities, both before and after the Emergency Law. This Tribunal thus shares the view of previous Tribunals that have found Argentina to be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard because of the persistent lack of any tariff readjustment.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the ***CMS*** Tribunal has concluded that the measures complained of (which were the same ones at issue in the present case, namely pesification of the tariffs, suspension of the PPI and suppression of periodic reviews of the tariffs, since CMS was a shareholder of TGN like Total) \"did in fact entirely transform and alter the legal and business environment under which the investment was decided and made.\" ***(******CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 29, para. 275) As a premise of its reasoning and conclusion, having stated that \"[t]here can be no doubt... that a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment\", the same Tribunal considered the fair and equitable treatment standard as an \"objective requirement\" and, therefore, unrelated to the reasons for the challenged measures. See ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 29, paras 274 and 280, respectively. To the contrary, for the reasons given above, we have concluded that the requirement of \"fairness\", and specifically the evaluation of whether \"legitimate expectations\" on which the investor was entitled to rely and did in fact rely, had illegally been affected by legislative changes to the legal framework made by the host state, cannot ignore the reasons for those changes and their modalities. This is consistent with the flexible nature of this standard and the need to apply it on a case-by-case approach, as stated by academic commentary and other international case law (see above paras 106 ff.). We recall that the Annulment Committee in the ***CMS*** case severely criticised the ***CMS*** Award\u2019s application of Article XI of the BIT (the non-precluding measures clause in the Argentina-US BIT), without distinguishing its scope, nature and conditions of applicability from those of the state of necessity under customary international law. (see ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Annulment Decision, 25 September 2007, para. 128 ff.) In addition, the Annulment Committee annulled the ***CMS*** Award for failure to state reasons where the Tribunal found a breach of Article 11(c)(2), that is the so-called umbrella clause, (see ***ibidem,***  para. 96 ff.).\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the arbitral awards in ***Sempra v. Argentina*** and ***Enron v. Argentina*** have been annulled in 2010 for not having properly examined the applicability of Art. XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT on non-precluded measures (***Sempra Energy International v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Annulment Decision, 19 June 2010, paras. 194 ff.) and for not having dealt adequately with the plea of necessity under customary international law raised by Argentina (***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P v. Argentina,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Annulment Decision, 30 July 2010, paras. 367-395).\n\n181.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that many of the previous awards dealing with the same matter, while following a different approach, mitigated the impact of their holdings that Argentina acted in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, by giving weight, on different bases, to the emergency situation of Argentina that brought about the pesification of public service tariffs. In this respect, such tribunals have relied on the defence of necessity under customary international law,192 or on specific provisions in the relevant BITs,193 and have considered that Argentina\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard did not occur when the measures challenged were taken through the Emergency Law on January 6, 2002, but rather at a later date (such as June 2002), recognizing that the BIT protection could not have insulated an investor completely from the emergency situation of Argentina in 2001-2002.194\n\nSee ***LG&E v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, para. 226 ff.\n\nAs the non-precluding measures clause of Article XI US-Argentina BIT, see ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra***note 53, para. 160 ff.\n\nSee ***National Grid pic v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, para. 180.\n\n***8. Consequences of the Tribunal\u2019s Findings for Total\u2019s Damages Claim***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal thus only partially upholds Total\u2019s claim concerning TGN under Article 3 of the BIT. The Tribunal has found that some of Argentina\u2019s measures challenged by Total were not in breach of Article 3 of the BIT (pesification and suppression of the US dollar link for the semi-annual automatic adjustments), while other measures or aspects thereof are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under Article 3 of the BIT (lack of readjustment). Therefore, the Tribunal cannot determine the damages suffered by Total, since the calculations submitted by Total regarding quantum are based on different premises for Argentina\u2019s liability. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to postpone the quantification of damages to a separate quantum phase.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate at this point to give some general indications concerning the criteria, based on the above findings on liability, according to which those damages should be calculated in the quantum phase, both as to the time period to be considered, and the basis of the calculation. Based on the analysis conducted above the Tribunal considers that the freezing of the tariffs was in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause as of 1 July, 2002 *(i.e.,* the first 120-day deadline established by Res. 20/2002 for the completion of the renegotiation process).195 Since Argentina has not remedied this block by any of the renegotiation mechanisms that it introduced after the Emergency Law or by operation of the previous mechanisms that nominally remained in force, the Tribunal believes that a six-month periodic readjustment of the tariff, as provided for in the Gas Regime but based on the evolution of local prices, would be appropriate to calculate the damages caused to Total.196 The calculation of these damages should take into account the difference between the revenues actually received by TGN *(pro-rata* according to Total\u2019s share) and those which TGN would have obtained if the tariffs in pesos in force on 1 July, 2002 had been readjusted on a semi-annual basis to reflect the variation of prices in Argentina.197\n\nSee the detailed description of the various Decrees at paras 84-89.\n\nAt this stage the Tribunal is of the opinion that by calculating Total\u2019s damages on this basis, the damages suffered by Total by the lack of reviews both ordinary and extraordinary (excluding the effects of the pesification) will also be made good. The parties may however submit further evidence in this respect in the quantum phase, which the Tribunal will then take into account.\n\nAs mentioned in para. 203 below, Total has pointed to a 95.5% increase from January 2002 to March 2007 of the consumer price index (IPC) and to an increase of 189% of the wholesale price index (IPIM) for the same period.\n\n***8.1 The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions About Total\u2019s Claims Concerning its Investment in TGN under Article 3 of the BIT***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nOn Total\u2019s claims concerning its investment in TGN under Article 3 of the BIT, the Tribunal, based on the above reasoning and findings,\n\n(i) concludes that Argentina breached its obligation under Article 3 of the BIT to grant fair and equitable treatment to Total by not periodically readjusting TGN\u2019s domestic tariffs in force in pesos in January 2002 from 1 July, 2002 onwards;\n\n(ii) concludes that the damages thereby suffered by Total must be compensated by Argentina;\n\n(iii) rejects all other claims by Total related to its investment in TGN; and\n\n(iv) defers the determination of the above damages to the quantum phase.\n\n***9. Total\u2019s Claim that Argentina has Breached Article 5(2) BIT With Respect to its Investment in TGN (Total\u2019s Claim of Indirect Expropriation)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***9.1 Parties\u2019 Arguments***\n----------------------------\n\n185.\n\nIn its claim under Article 5(2) of the BIT, Total complains that it has suffered an indirect expropriation without compensation in breach of the said provision.198 More specifically, Total claims that the same measures amounting to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3 of the BIT, alternatively \"constitute an indirect expropriation as they substantially deprive Total of the value and economic benefit of its investment in TGN, contrary to Article 5(2) of the Treaty. TGN has lost approximately 86% of its value as a direct result of Argentina\u2019s Measures - this goes beyond a \u2018substantial deprivation\u2019 as it amounts to a virtual obliteration of the value of Total\u2019s investment in TGN.\"199 Total submits that this loss of value of its investment in TGN (for which Total paid US$ 230 million in 2000) was due to the Measures in their totality *(i.e.,* the pesification and freezing the gas tariffs as well as the creation of the trust fund system to expand TGN\u2019s network).200\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT states that: \"The Contracting Parties shall not take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession, expect for reasons of public necessity and on condition that the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\"\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 57.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 157.\n\n186.\n\nBesides the substantial deprivation of the value of its investment, Total complains that the establishment of the trust fund, financed by the surcharge on the tariffs paid by industrial users not to TGN but to the fund, is a form of partial expropriation. This is because the fund will finance the upgrading of TGN\u2019s network thus becoming a kind of co-owner of assets that were supposed to be owned only by TGN. Total complains that, besides the substantial loss of value, the trust Fund mechanism has impaired its control of TGN.\n\n187.\n\nSumming up, Total explains its claim that Argentina has breached Article 5(2) in the following terms:\n\n\"It is a well-established principle that a substantial deprivation of the value and economic benefit of an investment constitutes expropriation. Thus the Measures go beyond a \u2018substantial deprivation\u2019; they constitute an obliteration of the value of Total\u2019s investment in TGN. By focusing on the effect of the Measures, Article 5(2) of the Treaty codifies the position under general international law that an expropriation need not involve the loss of control or use of an asset. However, even on the basis of this criteria, Total would succeed in its claim for expropriation considering the extent to which the Measures have emasculated TGN\u2019s role as a manager and investor in the gas transportation network. Between 1993 and 2001, TGN invested more than US$1 billion dollars in expanding and upgrading the gas transportation network. With the pesification and freeze of its tariffs, TGN is unable to fund investments in the network. With the creation of the trust-fund system to conduct expansions of the network, the Government has usurped TGN\u2019s role in making investment decisions - decisions overseen and steered by Total as the \"Technical Operator\" of TGN - relegating it instead to the role of a mere operator.\"201\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 584-585 [footnotes omitted],\n\n188.\n\nArgentina opposes Total\u2019s claim under Article 5(2) of the BIT. Relying on the *Pope & Talbot* case,202 as well as cases such as *Feldman203 CMS,204 Methanex205 Azurix,206 LG&E,207 Enron208* and *Sempra,209* Argentina suggests that the Tribunal has to apply the (loss of) control of the investment criterion in order to judge whether the interference with Total\u2019s property rights brought about by the Measures, is substantial enough to constitute an indirect expropriation. Because Total (together with the other shareholders) is still in full control of TGN and continues to manage its investment, Argentina argues that the alleged interference, not being substantial, cannot be regarded as an indirect expropriation.210 Furthermore, relying on the *Saluka* award,211 Argentina points to \"the principle according to which bona fide non-discriminatory regulatory measures within the police power of the State do not require any compensation.\"212 In accordance with this principle, the negative effects on the value of foreign investments caused by the changes introduced by the Emergency Law (even if they had led to a significant devaluation of foreign assets) are not compensable under either customary law or the BIT. Therefore, Argentina\u2019s measures, being regulatory measures of general application enacted to face the 2001-2002 emergency, cannot be regarded as effecting a compensable expropriation.213\n\nSee ***Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada,*** UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 26 June 2000, para. 100.\n\nSee ***Feldman v. Mexico, supra*** note 121, paras 142, 152.\n\n***CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

In the first place, Total maintains that a loss of control of the management and enjoyment of an investment is not required or decisive in order to find an indirect expropriation under international law and in light of the specific wording of the Argentina-France BIT. Total\u2019s view is that Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT covers a wider range of measures than those \"having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation\" (Article 5 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT) or \"tantamount to expropriation or nationalisation\" (Article IV(1) of the Argentina-U.S. BIT).214 More specifically, Total contends that \"[T]he words \u2018similar effect\u2019 encompass a wider range of measures than \"tantamount to\" and the non-technical term \"dispossession\" covers the loss of value of an asset, in addition to the loss of the title, control or use.\"215 Hence it is Total\u2019s position that the above measures implemented by Argentina have an effect similar to dispossession and constitute an indirect expropriation under the specific wording of Article 5(2) of the BIT, irrespective of whether they are equivalent to an expropriation or nationalisation.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 193-195 (see also Total\u2019s Reply paras 439-441). These provisions have been applied in the ***BG*** and ***National Grid*** cases (the Argentina-UK BIT) and in ***CMS*** and ***Enron*** cases as well as in other such as ***Sempra*** and ***Azurix*** (the Argentina-U.S BIT). In all of these cases, arbitral tribunals rejected investors\u2019 claims of indirect expropriation.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 195.\n\n190.\n\nIn the second place, Total submits that, even if Argentina was correct that the severe loss of value was caused by a regulation of general application without any intent or even effect of dispossession, this would not prevent a finding of indirect expropriation (regulatory taking). On the one hand, Total submits that: \"[I]n any event, even on a valid invocation of police powers, Argentina would not be exempted from the obligation to provide Total with prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\"216 On the other, Total points out that Argentina\u2019s Measures, even if regarded as regulatory or police power measures, constitutes an expropriation because they contradict the specific undertakings Argentina gave to Total and are therefore in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT, last sentence. These specific undertakings or assurances are identified by the Claimant as:\n\n\"(a) the commitment to preserve TGN\u2019s economic equilibrium through recurrent and extraordinary tariff reviews with the aim of ensuring that tariffs remained sufficient to cover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return; and, in support of this commitment (b) the promise to calculate tariffs in dollars and adjust them in accordance with the US PPI;... \"217\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 586.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 587.\n\n***9.2 Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions***\n--------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nBefore discussing the legal issues, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recall the evidence concerning Total\u2019s position as a major shareholder of TGN and its role as \"Technical Operator\". On the basis of the evidence and the arguments of the parties in their Post-Hearing Briefs it is uncontested that Total is in full control of its investment in TGN. Conversely, TGN operates under the management of its shareholders and carries on its daily activities. It is listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. The government\u2019s decision in 2004 to establish a trust fund system in order to finance expansions of the network by imposing surcharges on the tariffs paid by industrial users does not entail either loss of control by Total over its investments nor TGN\u2019s loss of control over its business operations. The trust fund finances the expansion of the network (which TGN is unable to do due to the lack of adequate revenues caused by freezing the tariffs), while TGN operates the network as licensee,218 besides managing the expansion projects.219 Total has not shown that the trust fund interferes with the ability of TGN shareholders to manage TGN. Based on the evidence, the Tribunal considers that Total has not been precluded in any way from exercising its rights as a shareholder in TGN, as it was able to go on managing TGN\u2019s business together with the other shareholders in TGN. The Tribunal concludes that Total \"is in control of the investment; the Government does not manage the day-to-day operations of the company; and the investor has full ownership and control of the investment\", as the ICSID Tribunal dealing with *CMS* claim - another foreign investor in TGN - found in May 2005.220\n\nSee Argentina Rejoinder, paras 452-457 and TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, para. 519. The parties agree that a small part of the expansion was financed by TGN and that the cooperation between the trust fund and TGN is governed by agreement between them.\n\nSee TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, para. 519.\n\nSee ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 29, para. 263.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine Article 5(2) of the BIT, interpreting it in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties.221 As mentioned above, Article 5(2) states that:\n\n\"The Contracting Parties shall not take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\"222\n\nArticle 31 VCLT states that: \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\nIn the French original: \"Les Parties contractantes ne prennent pas, directement ou indirectement, de mesures d\u2019expropriation ou de nationalisation, ni tout autre mesure \u00e9quivalente ayant un effet similaire de d\u00e9possession, si ce n\u2019est pour cause d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique et \u00e0 condition que ces mesures ne soient ni discriminatoires, ni contraires \u00e0 un engagement particulier.\" In the Spanish original: \"Las Partes Contratantes se abstendr\u00e1n de adoptar, de manera directa o indirecta, medidas de expropiaci\u00f3n o de nacionalizaci\u00f3n o cualquier otra medida equivalente que tenga un efecto similar de desposesi\u00f3n, salvo por causa de utilidad p\u00fablica y con la condici\u00f3n que estas medidas no sean discriminatorias ni contrarias a un compromiso particular.\"\n\n193.\n\nThe key expression as to indirect expropriation is the protection from \"any expropriation or nationalisation measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession.\" Therefore, besides expropriations and nationalisations, Article 5(2) covers measures which are \"equivalent\" to expropriation and nationalisation, as far as they have a \"similar effect of dispossession.\"223 Contrary to Total\u2019s position, the term \"dispossession\" is not a \"non-technical term.\" The term \"dispossession\" refers to a precise legal concept under civil law systems to which both France and Argentina belong. Possession is a factual relation between a thing, object or asset and a person who exercises factual control over it. Possession in Roman and civil law is independent in part from legal property.224 While a lawful owner or acquirer is entitled to obtain and exercise possession, possession, as a factual matter, may exist without or irrespective of a title. Indeed, property may derive from protracted undisturbed possession over a thing by a non-owner. The term \"dispossession\" therefore refers necessarily to the loss of the control which is characteristic of \"possession\".\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 542 where Argentina points out that: \"...,the Argentina-France BIT also makes reference to measures equivalent to expropriation, as the Argentina-U.S BIT and the NAFTA, which the Claimant fails to mention....\"\n\nSee G. Cornu, ***Vocabulaire Juridique,*** Presses Universitaires de France, 2000, p. 651, according to whom \u2018possession\u2019 is a ***\"pouvoir de fait exerc\u00e9 sur une chose avec l\u2019intention de s\u2019en affirmer le ma\u00eetre (animus domini), m\u00eame si \u2014 le sachant ou non \u2014 on ne Test pas;\"*** and the term ***\"posse sio rei\" \"signifiant \u00abpossession d\u2019une chose\u00bb*** ***servant aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 d\u00e9signer la possession qui correspond au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\"*** See also, ***ibid.*** p. 278 where the term ***\u2018d\u00e9possession \u2019*** is defined as ***\"(pjerte de la possession, soit par violence ou voie de fait, soit \u00e0 un titre juridique (gage, antichr\u00e8se, s\u00e9questre);*** privation effective de la d\u00e9tention mat\u00e9rielle d\u2019une chose. \" As to this notion under Argentina\u2019s legal system see the entry ***\u2018poseer\u2019*** in Ana Maria Cabanellas de las Cuevas, Diccionario Jur\u00eddico Universitario, Editorial Heliasta, ira Edici\u00f3n, 2000, Tomo II: poseer is defined as ***\"tener materialmente una cosa en nuestro poder. Encontrarse en situaci\u00f3n de disponer y disfrutar directamente de ella...***\n\n194.\n\nThe use of the terms *\"d\u00e9possession\"* or *\"mesures dont l\u2019effet est de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der\"* to characterise indirect expropriation is typical of French BITs. As stressed by two authoritative French commentators *\"dans son acception habituelle, la mesure de d\u00e9possession est celle qui prive l\u2019investisseur de ses droit essentiels sur l\u2019investissement au profit de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 publique, quelles que soient les modalit\u00e9s de cette d\u00e9possession\"225* Contrary to Total\u2019s position, in requiring a loss of material control over the investment, the term \"dispossession\" in Article 5(2) appears somehow to be more restrictive than the parallel provisions in the Argentina-U.S. (\"tantamount to expropriation\") and the Argentina-UK BIT which refer only to \"equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation\". Since Total has not been dispossessed of its TGN holding nor of the management of its business, the Tribunal concludes that the requirement of dispossession under Article 5(2) has not been met.\n\nSee D. Carreau, P. Juillard, ***Droit international \u00e9conomique,*** lere \u00e9dition, 2003, para 1376, at p. 508. The two authors, discussing the use of term ***\"d\u00e9possession\"*** in the French model BIT, go on to state that ***\"[m]ais d\u2019autres instruments, notamment le mod\u00e8le am\u00e9ricain et...l\u2019ALENA, utilisent l\u2019expression, qui parait mieux appropri\u00e9e, de mesures \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 une mesure d\u2019expropriation ou de nationalisation.\"*** (see para. 1377 at p. 509)\n\n195.\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal will also address Total\u2019s argument that it is well-established that a substantial deprivation of the value of an investment constitutes indirect expropriation. Hence, Total requests the Tribunal to find *in casu* that Argentina\u2019s measures, having caused such a loss, are in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT. Looking beyond the specific wording of Article 5(2), the Tribunal considers that under international law a measure which does not have all the features of a formal expropriation could be equivalent to an expropriation if an effective deprivation of the investment is thereby caused. An effective deprivation requires, however, a total loss of value of the property such as when the property affected is rendered worthless by the measure, as in case of direct expropriation, even if formal title continues to be held.226 This is supported by the general direction of the case law under BITs,227 other international jurisprudence228 and scholarly legal opinions.229\n\nThus, an expropriation could be found even where control remains in the hands of the foreign investor provided that economic profitability of the investment has been totally destroyed in some other way.\n\nSee ***Sempra Energy International v. Argentina, supra*** note 189, para. 285 where the Tribunal stated that \"a finding of indirect expropriation would require more than adverse effect. It would require that the investor no longer be in control of its business operation, or that the value of the business have been virtually annihilated.\" As to Argentina\u2019s Measures see also ***LG&E v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, para. 191 where it is stated that \"[interference with the investment\u2019s ability to carry on its business is not satisfied where the investment continues to operate, even if profits are diminished. The impact must be substantial in order that compensation may be claimed for the expropriation\"; ***BG Group Pic v. Argentina, supra*** note 113, paras 258-266 and ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina, supra*** note 20, para. 245. See also ***Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Schreuer, ***supra*** note 133, at p. 96-101.\n\n196.\n\nIn light of the above legal principles, the Tribunal turns to examine the merits of Total\u2019s claim that it is the victim of an indirect expropriation. The Tribunal considers that Total has not shown that the negative economic negative impact of the Measures has been such as to deprive its investment of all or substantially all its value. Therefore the Tribunal rejects Total\u2019s claim of indirect expropriation in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT. We note that this conclusion is consistent with all of the previous arbitral precedents dealing with indirect expropriation claims brought by foreign investors in the utility sector under various BITs in respect of the same or similar measures of Argentina in 2001-2002. According to this uniform arbitral case law, Argentina\u2019s Measures have been considered to not give rise to an indirect expropriation under various BITs,230 in the absence of an effective deprivation of the value of the foreign investment in the above-mentioned meaning *(i.e.,* total deprivation of the investment\u2019s value or total loss of control by the investor of its investment, both of a permanent nature).\n\nSee ***LG&E v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, para. 200 where the Tribunal stated that: \"the effect of the Argentine State\u2019s actions has not been permanent on the value of the Claimants\u2019 share, and Claimants\u2019 investment has not ceased to exist. Without a permanent, severe deprivation of LG&E\u2019s rights with regard to its investment, or almost complete deprivation of the value of LG&E\u2019s investment, the Tribunal concludes that these circumstances do not constitute expropriation.\" See also ***BG Group Pic v. Argentina, supra*** note 113, para. 268-270; ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina, supra*** note 20, para. 246.\n\n197.\n\nBefore concluding on this claim, the Tribunal recalls that the Claimant challenged a number of distinct measures under Article 5(2) of the BIT: the pesification and the freezing the gas tariffs and the creation of the trust-fund system to expand TGN\u2019s network. The Tribunal recalls here that, by analysing the pesification under Total\u2019s claim of breach of Article 3, it has already judged the said measure as a *bona fide* regulatory measure of general application, which was reasonable in light of Argentina\u2019s economic and monetary emergency and proportionate to the aim of facing such an emergency. Therefore, the Tribunal has concluded that in the absence of specific stabilization promises to the Claimant, the pesification does not amount to a breach of Article 3 of the BIT.231 For the same reasons, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the pesification also does not amount to a measure equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation,232 that is an indirect expropriation entailing Argentina\u2019s obligation to compensate Total. Moreover, contrary to Total\u2019s submissions, the pesification was not contrary to any specific undertaking given by Argentina to Total. In this regard the Tribunal recalls its finding under Total\u2019s claim of breach of Article 3 of the BIT that the provision according to which the gas tariffs were calculated in US dollars and adjusted in accordance with US PPI variations cannot be properly construed as \"promises\" or \"specific undertakings\" given by Argentina to Total since they were not addressed directly or indirectly to Total.233\n\nSee above paras. 159 ff.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the current international debate on the issue of whether, by judging changes in national legal systems introduced by legislative measures under bilateral investment treaties \"... one should only take into account the effects produced by the measure or if one should consider also the context within which a measure was adopted and the host State\u2019s purpose\" ***(******LG&E v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, para. 194). When foreign investors complain of State regulatory actions under a BIT, in order to decide whether the measures also amount to an indirect expropriation (a so-called regulatory taking) a tribunal must take into account their features and object so as to assess their proportionality and reasonableness in respect of the purpose which is legitimately pursued by the host State. These regulatory measures, when judged as legitimate, proportionate, reasonable and non-discriminatory, do not give rise to compensation in favour of foreign investors. The Tribunal shares the dominant approach followed by international tribunals, that is to take into account also the purpose and the causes of the measures taken by a State (together with their adverse effects on the foreign investment). In this regard see R. Dolzer, C. Schreuer, ***supra***  note 133, at p. 104, referring to the opinion of ***Fortier*** (Fortier, Drymer, ***Indirect Expropriation in the Law of International Investment: I Know It When I See It, or Caveat Investor,*** 19 ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal 293 (2004)), ***the Oscar Chinn Case*** and ***Sea-Land Service Inc. v. Iran,*** 6 Iran-US Cl. Trib. Rep. 149, 166 (1984).\n\nSee above paras 145 ff. The Tribunal recalls that Article 5(2) of the BIT prohibits measures \"contrary to a specific undertaking.\" The Tribunal notes that the BIT contains a further reference to \"specific undertaking\" in Article 10: \"Investments which have been the subject of a specific undertaking by one Contracting Party vis-\u00e0-vis investors of the other Contracting Party shall be governed, without prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement, by the terms of that undertaking, in so far as its provisions are more favourable than those laid down by this Agreement.\" Based on Article 5(2), Total submits that the Measures enacted by Argentina, even if considered legitimate as an exercise of its police powers, give rise to an obligation to compensate Total, because Argentina has made specific undertakings to Total. However, Total has not invoked a breach of Article 10, although it has argued that the \"core commitments\" of the Gas Regulatory Framework should be qualified as \"specific undertakings\" under Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is unable to sustain Total\u2019s claim that the failure to readjust the tariffs would constitute also an indirect expropriation in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT. This is because this *de facto* freezing of the gas tariffs implied neither a deprivation of the investment nor a total loss of its value. The Tribunal further notes that damages under the heading of indirect expropriation would not be different from damages due to breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In no case could the Tribunal award double recovery for the same damages to the same assets hypothetically caused by the breach of two different BIT provisions.234\n\nThis would be so even if the methods of calculation were different under the two Articles of the BIT.\n\n199.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina has not indirectly expropriated Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n***10. Total\u2019s claim that Argentina has breached Article 4 of the BIT (Non-discrimination)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***10.1 Total\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------\n\n200.\n\nTotal contends that Argentina\u2019s Measures *(i.e.,* the pesification and freezing of gas transportation tariffs) discriminated against Total\u2019s investment, transferring wealth from TGN and other energy companies predominantly owned by foreign interests to industry, commerce and agriculture predominantly owned by domestic investors. Accordingly, since the Measures entail discriminatory treatment against the energy sector as a whole and TGN in particular, they are not only in breach of Article 3 of the BIT but also in breach of Article 4 \"which obliges Argentina to treat Total\u2019s investment on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to investments of its own nationals\".235\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 369. Article 4 of the BIT reads as follows: \"Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory and maritime zone to investors of the other Party, in respect of their investments and activities in connection with such investments, treatment that is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or the treatment accorded to investors of the most-favoured nation, if the latter is more advantageous... \"\n\n201.\n\nIt is Total\u2019s position that this discriminatory treatment against the energy sector and TGN:\n\n\"not only constitutes further evidence of Argentina\u2019s unfair and inequitable treatment of Total in breach of Article 3 of the Treaty, it also amounts to a further breach of the national treatment provision in Article 4 of the Treaty, for which Total should receive full compensation.\"236\n\nAccording to Total, Argentina\u2019s duty to guarantee to French investors treatment no less favourable than that accorded to national investors does not operate only within the confines of the same sector. A breach of the national treatment clause in the Treaty could be found by the Tribunal comparing investors in different sectors. As a consequence, Total submits that:\n\n\"Under the test of Article 4, therefore, measures of general application can be discriminatory where they have practically resulted in different treatment being accorded to investors in different sectors or of different nationality. The relevant criterion here is whether a sector has been singled out for differential treatment in order to grant an advantage to other sectors.\"237\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 371.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 257 (referring to ***Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador), supra note*** 112 and 259.\n\n202.\n\nTotal develops two legal arguments to support its claim of breach of Article 4 of the BIT. First, Total points out that Article 4 does not textually include any reference to the \"in like circumstances\" criterion found in national treatment provisions in other investment treaties (for example, the NAFTA or the U.S.-Egypt BIT). Accordingly, Article 4 of the Treaty would not require comparison between investors \"in like circumstances\". Secondly, Total relies on *Occidental v. Ecuador* at paragraph 173, where the tribunal states that, because the purpose of national treatment is to protect investors as compared to local producers, \"... this cannot be done by addressing exclusively the sector in which that particular activity is undertaken.\"238\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 255-258.\n\n203.\n\nAs to the alleged discriminatory conduct of Argentina, Total contends that by having maintained gas tariffs basically unchanged since 2002, while allowing prices in all other sectors to increase, Argentina\u2019s Executive provided:\n\n\"a cross-subsidy to producers who have benefits from exceptionally low energy tariffs while being able to export their goods in dollars, or to charge inflation-adjusted prices in the domestic market.\"239\n\nIn this respect, Total points out that, on the one hand, prices for most sectors of the economy have increased significantly in accordance with the balance between supply and demand (from January 2002 to March 2007, the consumer price index (IPC) and the wholesale price index (IPIM) increased by 95.5% and by 189%, respectively); on the other hand, Argentina has accorded preferential treatment to domestic investors in some other cases or sectors either by guaranteeing tariff increases in line with inflation by law or decree or by providing subsidies.240 More specifically, Total has complained that certain public service companies have been authorised to keep all or some of their tariffs denominated in US dollars or pegged to the US dollar. This authorisation was granted by Argentina in the case of airport-dues tariffs for international flights, port tariffs and fees, and toll charges for the use of the Parana River Waterway for international transportation.241 The Tribunal notes here that Total has not denied that this \"preferential treatment\" *(i.e.,* to maintain their tariffs in US dollar terms) also concerned gas transportation tariffs for export customers (including those of TGN).242\n\nSee TotaPs Memorial, para. 368.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, para. 22 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, para. 23(v).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, footnote 25 at p. 11. At the very beginning, the Emergency Law did not distinguish as to the \u2018pesification\u2019 of tariffs between Argentina\u2019s consumers and those concerning gas exports supplied to foreign customers. As a result, the pesification also concerned the tariffs payable by customers located abroad from January to May 2002. As outlined by Total itself, ***\"However, following an outcry from TGN and other public utilities, in May 2002, tariffs charged to foreign customers were exempted from the pesification by Decree 689/2002. As a result, these tariffs (representing about 20% of TGN\u2019s revenue prior to the Measures) continue to be calculated in dollars and adjusted by the US PPI in accordance with the Gas Regulatory Framework***...\" (see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 470-471 [footnotes omitted])\n\n204.\n\nFurthermore, Total points out the following forms of relief/compensation that Argentina accorded to several other sectors predominantly owned by national interests - but not the energy sector predominantly owned by foreign interests: (i) the government subsidies to train and underground transportation companies in order to compensate for the loss caused by the pesification; (ii) the issuance of government bonds to compensate banks for the loss resulting from the asymmetric pesification *(i.e.,* the pesification of private individuals\u2019 bank deposits in US dollars at the rate of 1.4 pesos per US dollar, plus inflation adjustment from February 2002 in accordance with CER variations); (iii) the review of tariffs and prices for public-works construction contracts in order to reflect cost increases in line with inflation; and (iv) the increase of local salaries and employers\u2019 contributions in both public and private sector.243\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, para. 22-23.\n\n205.\n\nAccording to Total, all of these measures, together with the freezing of energy tariffs at the 2001 level, were part of a deliberate policy of Argentina\u2019s government to help domestic industry and agriculture and to favour domestic interests by a supply of abnormally low-priced gas and electricity.244 More specifically, according to Total:\n\n\"Although the text of the Emergency Law and the subsequent Measures adopted by Argentina are nationality-neutral on their face, their effects and their implementation by the Argentine authorities were unmistakably favourable to domestic interests in the industrial and export sectors, at the expense of foreign investors in the energy sector. This policy of transferring resources from one sector [sic] another was acknowledged by Chief of Cabinet Alberto Fernandez and Minister De Vido at a press conference in 2003 [sic]:\"...we have achieved the use of a redistributive criteria [in connection with the tariff increase] Those who consume more have been benefited all this time by an increase in their revenues. This was is no way counterbalanced, to express it somehow, by the increase in tariffs.... During all this time, [exporters] have been able to export their products in dollars and continued with a very low gas and electricity tariff in pesos. I understand that they have had enough profit during all this time....\"\"245\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, para. 10.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 60 and Transcript of Press Conference of the Chief of Cabinet Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the Minister of the General Planning, Public Investment and Services Julio de Vido and the Secretary of Energy Daniel Cameron held in the Government Office, dated 13 February 2004, at Exhibit C-195.\n\n206.\n\nFinally, Total suggests that the process of renegotiating public service tariffs has favoured those public service companies, which are predominantly owned by domestic interests, that do not have significant sunk investments. Moreover, in carrying out the renegotiation process with energy companies, Argentina further intends to promote the \"re-Argentinisation\" of the energy sector.246 In this respect, Total has complained that Argentina accorded a preferential treatment in the renegotiation process to two energy companies with domestic ownership, Transener and Transba. According to Total, the World Bank has also noted the discrimination against companies owned by foreign interests and in favour of national ones.\n\n\"(...) this was the conclusion of a draft report issued by a World Bank delegation that went to Argentina in 2003 to study the renegotiation process and provide technical assistance: the tariff adjustment and renegotiations have proceeded more quickly in railroads, inter-urban roads, dredging, mail and airports which coincides with an ownership, debt and asset ownership pattern that is noteworthy (see Table l)\u2019.\"247\n\nTotal has produced an extract of \"Table 1\", to which the World Bank delegation referred in the excerpt above,:248\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Public service** | **Ownership** | **Status of negotiation** |\n| Electricity transport | Foreign | Marginal increase (on hold) |\n| Electricity distribution | Foreign | Marginal increase (on hold) |\n| Gas transport | Foreign | Marginal increase (on hold) |\n| Gas distribution | Foreign | Marginal increase (on hold) |\n| Railroads | Domestic | Incr. Subsidy approved |\n| Inter-urban roads | Domestic | Incr. Subsidy approved |\n| Dredging | Domestic & Foreign | Redollarised |\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 13-16. Total has referred to two public speeches by President Kirchner and one speech by the Minister of the General Planning, Public Investment and Services, Julio de Vido to evidence Argentina\u2019s policy to promote the \"re-Argentinisation\" of the energy sector (that is to push foreign investors in the energy sector to sell their investments at depressed prices to Argentine interests). These are at Exhibits C-453, C-626 and C-670, respectively.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 495 and World Bank Draft Aide M\u00e9moire, Technical Assistance on the Renegotiation of Infrastructure and Public Service Concessions, dated 17-23 February 2003 at Exhibit C-438 (see also para. 253).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 254 and 496.\n\n207.\n\nSumming up, Total points out that:\n\n\"the renegotiation process has also operated more swiftly for companies with domestic ownership: (a) This is the case for railroad and inter-urban road companies, who, as shown in the table below, have benefited from Government subsidies. This has also been the case for public transportation companies that have benefited from subsidies of up to AR2$ billion per year, (b) Other locally owned companies have seen their pesified tariffs redollarised. This has been the case for dredging companies, as shown in the table above, as well as for airports. (c) It is noteworthy that the remaining two companies (out of the twelve mentioned above) with approved renegotiated agreements - the electricity transportation companies Transener and Transba - concluded those agreements shortly after foreign shareholders sold their stakes to a local investor, Marcelo Mindlin, widely known to be close to the Government. Incidentally, both electricity companies received unusually generous one-off tariff increases of 31 and 25%, significantly higher than the 15% increase over twelve months that is on offer to TGN. Marcelo Mindlin\u2019s purchase of Electricit\u00e9 de France\u2019s 65% stake in electricity distribution company Edenor also coincided with the swift conclusion of its renegotiation process and implementation of a 15% tariff increase retroactive to November 2005... \"249\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 500.\n\n***10.2 Argentina\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nArgentina opposes Total\u2019s allegation as to the discriminatory character of the Measures relying on the following arguments. First, the Measures were addressed to the population in general, not discriminating between nationals and foreigners, and were of general application. Accordingly, Argentina alleges that:\n\n\"The acts challenged are of general nature and apply to Argentine economy or to the power generation, production, hydrocarbon exploitation and gas transportation sectors as a whole, irrespective of the nationality of the parties affected by them. There is no regulation limiting its effect to foreign or national subjects or pursuing discriminatory purposes.\"250\n\nAll sectors of Argentina\u2019s economy were affected by the Measures. Moreover, Argentina contends that:\n\n\"TOTAL was not treated different from any other company in a significantly similar situation. Unequal treatment is only discriminatory among parties under similar circumstances within the same business or economic sector.\"251\n\nAs to Total\u2019s argument that by maintaining gas tariffs unchanged since 2001 Argentina provided a cross-subsidy to the industry, commerce, agriculture and banking sectors predominantly owned by local investors, Argentina presents two arguments. In the first place:\n\n\"the difference in treatment which might have existed between the electricity sector and the sectors with which the Claimant makes the comparison cannot give rise to discrimination, because it implies that investors compared are not in an arms length situation, since they belong to different economic sectors... In that regard, since differences among the different sectors which were affected are quite significant, it is not surprising that different solutions were tried or are being tried for each of them.\"252\n\nIn the second place, Argentina contends that, on the one hand:\n\n\"it is not true that foreign investors in the energy sector had been larger than in manufacturing, commercial or banking sectors...foreign direct investment in the industrial, commercial and banking sectors between 1992 and 2002 was not much smaller than in the energy sector.\"253\n\nOn the other hand, Argentina points out that one of the main TGN shareholders is TECHINT, an Argentine company.254 Moreover, Argentina outlines that:\n\n\"[M]any companies of the TOTAL group, such as Hutchinson Argentina, TMP *(terminales mar\u00edtimas patag\u00f3nica),* among others, belong to the industrial sector that TOTAL affirmed that received benefits because it was a sector of companies mainly belonging to local capitals. Moreover, TOTAL Austral Sucursal Argentina holds 99.99% of a company called TOTAL GAZ, engaged in the commercialization of liquified gas or \"bottle gas\", which sector allegedly received benefits from the Argentine Government.\"255\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 479.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 481.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 484, where Argentina refers to the ***Enron*** and ***Sempra*** cases. Both Tribunals rejected the investors\u2019 claim of discrimination. In this regard, the ***Enron*** Tribunal stated at para. 282 that: \"There are quite naturally important differences between the various sectors that have been affected, so it is not surprising either that different solutions might have been or are being sought for each, but it could not be said that any such sector has been singled out, in particular either to apply to it measures harsher than in respect of others, or conversely to provide a more beneficial remedy to one sector to the detriment of another. The Tribunal does not find that there has been any capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation in the treatment accorded to the Claimants as compared to other entities or sectors.\" ***(******Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina, supra*** note 20, para. 282). See also with almost the same wording ***Sempra Energy International v. Argentina, supra***  note 189, para. 319.\n\nSee Argentina Rejoinder para. 655 and Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief para. 486.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 487.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 488.\n\n209.\n\nFinally, according to Argentina, even if the Tribunal finds that Argentina accorded Total differential treatment as compared to that granted to other entities or sectors:\n\n\"the alleged differentiation in treatment given to the Claimant would not be capricious, irrational or absurd. The measures challenged by TOTAL were addressed to solve a serious economic, political, social and institutional crisis. Such measures were reasonable and proportionate to their purpose. Consequently, they cannot be considered discriminatory.\"256\n\nTherefore, Argentina concludes that:\n\n\"there existed no discrimination against TOTAL since the measures challenged were all general measures and no differential treatment was given in view of its nationality, nor a treatment less favourable that the one given to any other company in a relatively similar situation.\"257\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 490.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 492.\n\n***10.3 Tribunal\u2019s conclusions***\n---------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nIn order to determine whether treatment is discriminatory, it is necessary to compare the treatment challenged with the treatment of persons or things in a comparable situation. In economic matters the criterion of \"like situation\" or \"similarly-situated\" is widely followed because it requires the existence of some competitive relation between those situations compared that should not be distorted by the State\u2019s intervention against the protected foreigner.258 This is inherent in the very definition of the term \"discrimination\" under general international law that:\n\n\"Mere differences of treatment do not necessarily constitute discrimination...discrimination may in general be said to arise where those who are in all material respects the same are treated differently, or where those who are in material respects different are treated in the same way.\"259\n\nThe elements that are at the basis of likeness vary depending on the legal context in which the notion has to be applied and the specific circumstances of any individual case.\n\nThis is but an application of the fundamental, traditional principle that a finding of discrimination ***(i.e.,*** of an inferior treatment applied in respect of a relevant regulation) presupposes a comparison between persons, things or activities that are \"eiusdem generis\" (of the same species), See International Law Commission, ***Draft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses with Commentaries,*** Y.B. ILC 1978, Vol. 11(2), 8-72. There is no reason why this precondition should not apply equally in investment protection as in trade matters, where the requirement of \"likeness\" is spelled out as to products in Article 1.1 and II.2 of GATT and in Article II. 1 and XVII of GATS as to services, (that include direct investments in the service sectors under Article 1.2 (c) GATS)\n\nSee R. Jennings, A. Watts (eds.), ***Oppenheim\u2019s International Law,*** 9th ed. (Longman, 1992), Vol. I, p. 378. Argentina refers also to the definition of discrimination developed by the European Court of Human Rights: \"Discrimination... is treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in \u2018relevantly\u2019 similar situations. For a claim of [discrimination] to succeed, it has therefore to be established, inter alia, that the situation of the alleged victim can be considered similar to that of persons who have been better treated.\" (see ***Fredin v. Sweden*** (No.l), 1991 Eur. Ct. H.R. 2, para. 60)\n\n211.\n\nUnder international investment agreements, both national treatment and most favoured-nation treatment require such a comparative analysis. Moreover, the national treatment obligation does not preclude all differential treatment that could affect a protected investment but is aimed at protecting foreign investors from *de iure* or *de facto* discrimination based on nationality.\n\n212.\n\nTherefore a claimant complaining of a breach by the host State of the BIT\u2019s national treatment clause: (i) has to identify the local subject for comparison; (ii) has to prove that the claimant-investor is in like circumstances with the identified preferred national comparator(s); and (iii) must demonstrate that it received less favourable treatment in respect of its investment, as compared to the treatment granted to the specific local investor or the specific class of national comparators.\n\n213.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the absence of the term \"like\" in Article 4 of the BIT is not decisive since this element is inherent in an evaluation of discrimination.260 To succeed in its national treatment claim Total therefore has to prove that Argentina accorded it less favourable treatment, in respect of its investments, than that accorded to national investors in like circumstances or situations to Total. The Tribunal cannot accept Total\u2019s statement that, under Article 4 of the BIT, measures of general application that have practically resulted in different treatment being accorded to investors in different sectors and irrespective of their different nationality can be considered *per se* discriminatory without any \"in like circumstances\" analysis. Moreover, different treatment between foreign and national investors who are similarly situated or in like circumstances must be nationality-driven. Accordingly, a foreign investor who is challenging measures of general application as *de facto* discriminatory under Article 4 of the BIT has to show a *prima facie* case of nationality-based discrimination. The Tribunal believes that the allegations brought by Total have evidenced neither that the sectors are comparable nor that the differential treatment is motivated by nationality or results in a worse treatment for foreigners.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached by the Tribunal in the ***Parkerings-Companiet*** case in interpreting a Mostfavoured-nation clause that does not include any reference to the \"in like circumstances\" requirement. See ***Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania,*** ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, para. 369 where the Tribunal states that: \"The essential condition of the violation of a MFN clause is the existence of a different treatment accorded to another foreign investor in a similar situation. Therefore, a comparison is necessary with an investor in like circumstances.\"\n\n214.\n\nFor the above-stated reasons, to find a breach of the national treatment obligation the relevant criterion is not just whether a sector has been treated differently, that is worse, than some other. Maintaining low energy prices by a hydrocarbon producing nation in order to bolster other sectors of its economy seems to be a widely practiced economic policy. It cannot be labelled by itself as discriminatory even if foreign investors are more heavily engaged in that natural resources sector. On the contrary, it is generally recognized that governments have considerable discretion in deciding how to treat and regulate different sectors of the economy in view of political and economic expediency. A finding of *de facto* discrimination in such a context would require that the claimant present a *prima facie* case of nationality-based discrimination without the host State proving that such different and less favourable treatment is not unreasonable.\n\n215.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that Total has failed to present a *prima facie* case of discrimination in various respects. First, as to pesification, this measure was applicable and hit all sectors of Argentina without distinction.261 The allegations made and examples given by Total in support of its national treatment claim do not lend themselves to consideration as like sectors or situations. As to the differential treatment of different sectors of Argentina\u2019s economy (even if an inter-sector comparison would be admissible), Total failed to prove that such differential treatment was nationality-based. In this respect, the Tribunal notes that a national investor such as TECHINT (an investor in TGN like Total) was accorded the same treatment by Argentina in respect of its investment in TGN, as Total was accorded.\n\nThe preferential treatment of depositors (see ***supra*** note 153) was applicable to all depositors. Also TGN benefits from the maintenance of dollar tariffs for supplies to foreign clients. In this regard see ***supra*** note 243.\n\n216.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that the measures which Total complained of under Article 4 are also alleged by Total as a breach of Article 3. The Tribunal recalls the conclusion reached above that Argentina is in breach of Article 3 by not having made any adjustment to TGN\u2019s tariffs since July 1, 2002, and having failed to conclude the renegotiation process with TGN positively after more than seven years. Even if such conduct had been discriminatory, this would not add an additional element of illegality to conduct already found by the Tribunal to be unreasonable and in breach of the BIT, nor would this additional finding be relevant for the determination of damages.\n\n217.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina has not breached Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n218.\n\nHaving so concluded, the Tribunal considers that the various acts referred to by Total as evidencing discriminatory conduct by Argentina in keeping the gas tariffs at non-remunerative levels while other sectors were not so constrained reinforce the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Argentina acted unfairly and unreasonably, in breach of Article 3. They may even cast doubt on whether Argentina\u2019s authorities acted in good faith in not affirmatively concluding renegotiation through UNIREN since 2004.\n\n***11. Argentina\u2019s Defences***\n------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nBefore concluding, the Tribunal must address Argentina\u2019s defences with respect to any findings by the Tribunal Argentina breached the BIT in respect of Total\u2019s investment in TGN. These are (i) the plea of Argentina based on \"state of necessity\" under customary international law;262 and (ii) Argentina\u2019s defence based on Article 5(3) of the BIT.263\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 876 ff.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 675 ff.\n\n***11.1 Argentina\u2019s Defence of Necessity under Customary International Law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that customary international law imposes strict conditions in order for a State to successfully avail itself of the defence of necessity. Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility is generally considered as having codified customary international law in the matter, as also accepted by both parties in this case.264 Article 25 recognizes necessity as a \"ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation\" and sums up the fundamental conditions of applicability of necessity as follows:\n\n\"Article 25-Necessity\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act: (a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and (b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if: (a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or (b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\"\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 887 ff.; Total\u2019s Reply, para. 547 ff. ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina,***Annulment Decision, ***supra*** note 191, para. 129;***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina,\u00a0supra***note 53, footnote 238 at p. 72; ***Sempra Energy International v. Argentina,***Annulment Decision***, supra*** note 191, para. Ill; ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P v. Argentina,*** Annulment Decision, ***supra*** note 191, para. 356.\n\n221.\n\nThe customary international law defence of necessity acts to excuse an otherwise wrongful act and, thus, only becomes relevant once a breach of the BIT has been found. As a positive defence, it is for the party that raises necessity as a justification for its non-compliance, here Argentina, to prove that the elements required under Article 25 are met. In respect of Total\u2019s claim concerning its investments in TGN, the Tribunal has found that the pesification of the gas tariffs and their de-linking from variations in the US PPI not to be in breach of the BIT. Conversely, the Tribunal has found that the *de facto* freezing of the gas tariffs, and the lack of any readjustment thereof since July 1, 2002, breach Article 3 of the BIT. More specifically, the Tribunal has concluded that since Argentina has not remedied the blockage of the tariffs by any of the renegotiation mechanisms that it introduced after the Emergency Law or by operation of the previous mechanisms that nominally remained in force, a six-month periodic readjustment of the tariff, as provided for in the Gas Regime but based on the evolution of local prices, would be appropriate to calculate the damages caused to Total.265 Therefore the Tribunal has to evaluate the applicability of the defence of necessity under customary international law only in respect of the failure by Argentina to readjust the gas tariffs as specified above. More specifically, this entails, first, ascertaining whether the protracted freezing of the gas distribution tariff as of 2002 in breach of the BIT was necessary to safeguard Argentina\u2019s essential interests in preserving its people and their security in face of the economic and social emergency of 2001.266 Second, the Tribunal must determine whether such freezing, if necessary, was the only way to safeguard such alleged essential interest.\n\nSee para. 183 above.\n\nSee ILC Commentaries to Art. 25, para. 14. In this regard, the Tribunal considers that a State can invoke necessity also to protect the security and safety of its people in face of a severe economic emergency. See ILC Report on the work of its thirty-second session, Yearbook of the ILC, 1980, II, 2, p. 35 stating that necessity may consist \"a grave danger to existence of the State itself, to its political and economic survival\"; see also ***LG&E v. Argentina,***cit. ***supra*** note 111, paras. 246, 251; ***Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina, supra*** note 53, para. 175 and sources cited there.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled in the previous paragraphs that the principle of readjustment of the tariffs to ensure that public service providers could make a reasonable return and provide the service, is enshrined in the Gas Law and that this principle is still in force. Moreover, the Tribunal underlines that this fundamental principle has not been abrogated nor suspended during the crisis. To the contrary, it was restated by Argentina at the peak of the economic emergency of 2001/2002. Article 9 of the Emergency Law provided for the renegotiation of the pesified tariffs taking account of various criteria, of which the \"interest of users and the possibility of gaining access to such services\" was just one. This legislative enactment undermines Argentina\u2019s position that the protracted freezing of the gas distribution tariffs at issue here was necessary to safeguard Argentina\u2019s essential interests in preserving \"its own existence and that of its population\" against an imminent and grave peril.267 The Tribunal notes that on October 17, 2002, pursuant to a request by ENARGAS, the Ministry of Economy by MoE Resolution 487/02 exempted ENARGAS from its previous Resolution 38/02 of April 10, 2002, which had prohibited regulators, including ENARGAS, from undertaking any review of tariffs.268 Contrary to the position advanced here by Argentina, Resolution 487/02 specifically noted that gas tariff reviews had become necessary \"in order to facilitate the continuance of public services.\" Resolution 487/02 reflects the fact that in the second part of 2002 Argentina was emerging from its crisis.269\n\nThis is how Argentina has characterized its essential interests in its Counter-Memorial, para. 917. Similarly, Argentina suggests that its essential interests were \"the preservation of economic, political, social and institutional life of the Argentine Government\" and that the general measures enacted were necessary to safeguard its essential security interests in \"maintaining social stability and preserving the access to the essential services, which were vital for the health and welfare of the population.\" (Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 543 and 545, respectively)\n\nSee para. 88 above.\n\nSee above at footnote 53.\n\n223.\n\nArgentina has not shown that the economic security of the gas users would have been imminently and gravely threatened if the gas tariffs would have been adjusted in mid-2002 as Argentina\u2019s own legislation provided for.270 Even if such would have been the case, Argentina has not shown that the freezing of the tariffs would have been \"the only way for the State to safeguard\" such an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Argentina discussed the lack of any reasonable alternatives to the emergency measures actually taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis principally in respect of the pesification of the economy that the Tribunal has found not in breach of the BIT. According to Argentina, the pesification was the only way for Argentina to safeguard its own economic and political survival as well as that of its people, also as a means to ensure \"fair and reasonable rates\" of public utilities.271 Argentina has not discussed nor did it provide evidence, as it was its burden, that there were no reasonable alternatives to the freezing of the tariffs. Not only did Argentina fail to submit any evidence to support its position that its measures were necessary, it also failed to respond to Total\u2019s submission to the contrary. For example, Total referred to the introduction of subsidies to low-income households (as Argentina did in other utilities and public services) and reducing tax burden on the utility bills for low-income households.272\n\nIt appears moreover factually unlikely that the relative limited re-adjustment of the tariffs to the variation of prices in Argentina (see para. 183 above) could have impaired \"an essential interest\" of Argentina \"against a grave and imminent peril\". This has, in any case, not been proved by Argentina.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 899-913 and Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 553-557\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-hearing Brief, paras. 1047 ff..\n\n224.\n\nThus Argentina has failed to prove the defence of necessity under customary international law as concerns the measures adopted in relation to Total\u2019s investments in TGN found to be in breach of the BIT. It is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine whether the further conditions required under customary international law for Argentina to avail itself of the defence of necessity have been fulfilled. Nor does the Tribunal have to analyse Total\u2019s counter-arguments in respect of those conditions. The Tribunal concludes that Argentina\u2019s defence based on the state of necessity under customary international law is groundless.\n\n***11.2 Argentina\u2019s Defence based on Article 5(3) of the BIT***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nArticle 5(3) of the BIT provides that:\n\n\"Investors of either Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses as a result of war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising in the territory or maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Party treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of the most-favoured nation.\"\n\n226.\n\nIt is Argentina\u2019s position that \"there are not doubts that Article 5(3) of the Treaty is a rule that establishes an escape clause for an emergency case, and this rule prevails over the rest of the Treaty. [... ]\"273\n\nMoreover, according to Argentina, Article 5(3) covers emergency cases, including economic emergencies.274 Argentina contends that:\n\n\"[T]he BIT expressly provides for the adoption of emergency measures by a State that may provoke losses to the investments of the other contracting party. It does not only provide for such possibility, but it also legitimizes the actions of the Government provided the following requirements are complied with: a) that investors suffer losses in the territory or maritime zone of the other contracting party due to a national emergency situation, among other circumstances; b) that they receive from the authorities of the contracting State, in whose territory such events happened, a not less favourable treatment than the one afforded to its own investors or to nationals from other States, as regards measures adopted concerning such circumstance.\"275\n\nIn addition, Argentina argues that the provision grants the State such a broad discretion to determine what constitutes a state of national emergency that the Tribunal is limited to considering only whether Argentina acted in good faith in applying this BIT clause.276\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 519.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 522.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 677. [emphasis original]\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 702.\n\n227.\n\nTotal strongly opposes Argentina\u2019s defence. More specifically, according to Total:\n\n\"... Article 5(3) cannot excuse Argentina\u2019s liability under the Treaty, for the following reasons: (a) The Purpose of Article 5(3) is to create an entitlement to compensation where none would otherwise exist under the general rules of international law. (b) In any event, Argentina\u2019s focus on the word \"emergency\" in Article 5(3) is misplaced. The terms preceding and following it make it clear that Article 5(3) as a whole applies only in circumstances of physical strife and destruction (\"war\", \"armed conflict\", \"uprising\" etc). It is not concerned with economic \"emergencies\", (c) Article 5(3) is relevant only to the losses suffered as a direct result of war, armed conflict, etc. Total\u2019s losses were caused not as a result of economic \"crisis\" but by Argentina\u2019s own Measures.\"277\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 984 and more extensively TotaPs Reply, para. 519 ff.\n\n228.\n\nHaving summarized the position of the Parties on Argentina\u2019s defence based on Article 5(3) in the above paragraphs, the Tribunal will deal with the interpretation of Article 5(3) of the BIT in accordance with Article 31 VCLT. In this respect, the plain reading of Article 5(3) clearly indicates that each Party shall grant to investors of the other Party a treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its investors or to investors of the most-favoured nation in case of losses affecting investments made in its territory by the other Party\u2019s investors \"as a result of war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising\".\n\n229.\n\nContrary to Argentina\u2019s position, the ordinary meaning of the terms used in Article 5(3) do not support the conclusion that this clause is an escape clause for emergency cases. This is not a so-called \"non precluded measures\" clause contained in other Bilateral Investment Treaties concluded by Argentina with other States (for instance Article XI of Argentina-US BIT). Article 5(3) envisages and regulates the situation of losses suffered by investments made in the territory of one Party by investors belonging to the other Party in case of \"war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising\" and is thus more properly classified to a \"war and civil disturbance\" clause, or a \"losses due to war\" clause.278 Contrary to Argentina\u2019s arguments, Article 5(3) is not applicable to an economic emergency, unless the economic emergency, which hits one of the Parties, has led to a \"national emergency\" where losses have occurred such as those that are a result of war, uprising or any other kind of civil disturbance. The Tribunal can find no basis on which to uphold Argentina\u2019s argument that the provision legitimizes the government of the host country taking measures that in time of national economic emergency inflict losses on foreign investors. The losses suffered by Total were not \"a result of... national emergency\" but, rather, a result of regulatory measures passed by Argentina. In any case, the provision operates only when compensation of losses has been granted by a Party to its own investors or to a third Party\u2019s investors. In such an event, Article 5(3) imposes the duty to treat investors protected by the BIT no less favourably than other investors. The provision is thus inapplicable from all points of view in the context at issue.\n\nUNCTAD Survey, ***Bilateral Investment Treaties in the Mid-1990s*** (1998) at 73, referred to in Total\u2019s Reply, para. 534, Exhibit CL-129.\n\n230.\n\nIn view of the above, by invoking this clause Argentina could not be exonerated from liability for having breached the BIT. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that this clause has an opposite purpose to that of an exculpatory clause. In fact, this clause is aimed at granting to the investments made in the territory of one Party by the investors of the other Party an additional guarantee in respect of situations in which the host State, even if not internationally obliged to do so, has provided for compensation for the losses suffered due to certain events to its own nationals or investors of third States\n\n231.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina\u2019s defence based on Article 5(3) of the BIT is groundless.\n\n***Part III - Total\u2019s Claim as to its Investments in Power Generation***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Total\u2019s investments***\n----------------------------\n\n232.\n\nIn the power generation sector, Total invested in two major power generation companies, Central Puerto S.A. (\"Central Puerto\") and Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Piedra de Aguila S.A. (\"HPDA\").\n\n233.\n\nCentral Puerto is a large dual-fuel electricity generator, having the capacity to produce 2,165 megawatts, which represents 9.5% of Argentina\u2019s total installed capacity. Central Puerto was created in 1992 as part of the privatization of Servicios El\u00e9ctricos del Gran Buenos Aires S.E. (\"SEGBA\"), a state-owned enterprise, whose power generation business was split into four thermal power generation companies. At the time of privatization, approximately 63.93% of the total stock of Central Puerto was acquired by three Chilean companies. Eventually, one of these companies, Compania Chilena de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica (later renamed \"Gener\") acquired the interest of the other two companies. In July 2001, Total acquired all of the shares in Central Puerto held by Gener (which had been acquired in 2000 by AES Corporation). Total says it paid approximately US $255 million and subscribed to US $120 million of debt to acquire the shares of Central Puerto.279\n\nSee Exhibit C-70 for a diagram of Total\u2019s shareholdings in Central Puerto and Exhibit C-44 for a copy of an extract from Central Puerto\u2019s share register.\n\n234.\n\nHPDA is said to be the largest private hydroelectric generation company in Argentina. It was created in 1993, as part of the privatization of Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Norpatag\u00f3nica S.A., the state-owned hydroelectric generation company which was split into five separate business units for the purposes of privatization. At the time of privatization in 1993, a number of foreign investors created an Argentine company, Hidroneuqu\u00e9n S.A., for the purposes of bidding for and acquiring 59% of HPDA\u2019s shareholding. Hidroneuqu\u00e9n S.A. remains the owner of the shares. In September 2001, Total, through Total Austral, acquired 70.03% of Hidroneuqu\u00e9n from Gener for the payment of US $72.5 million plus the acquisition of approximately US$57 (or 5O.42)280 million of subordinated debt in the form of bonds. As a result, Total indirectly owned a 41.3% shareholding in HPDA.281 After privatization, HPDA expended significant sums to acquire equipment and services (US $161.7 million) and has assumed existing debt (US $405 million). According to Total, HPDA\u2019s hydroelectric plant currently comprises four units with an aggregate installed capacity of 1,400 megawatts. These units entered into service in 1993-1994 and represent 6.13% of Argentina\u2019s installed electricity capacity.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 87 at pages 44-45.\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, paras 158-160 and Exhibits C-72, a diagram showing Total\u2019s participation in HPDA, and Exhibit C-44, a copy of HPDA\u2019s share register.\n\n235.\n\nIn 2001, Total spent a total of US$327.45 million to acquire Central Puerto\u2019s and HPDA\u2019s shares.282\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 98.\n\n236.\n\nIn November 2006, while the arbitration was pending, Total sold its investments in Argentina\u2019s power generation sector and received US$35.0 million for its 63.79% equity stake in Central Puerto and US$145.0 million for its 41.22% equity stake in HPDA.283\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 133 at p. 66.\n\n***2. Relevant features of the electricity regime in Argentina when Total made its investment***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nIn parallel with the Convertibility regime, Argentina also pursued a liberal economic policy with respect to the electricity sector, through privatisation of state-owned companies that had been operating in the sector. The reform of the electricity sector was carried out by opening the sector to private investors and deregulation. The Electricity Law of 1992,284 which has remained continuously in force since enacted, and reflected this new approach, \"was a clean break with the past.\"285\n\nLaw 24,065 entered into force on January 16, 1992 (Exhibit C-84).\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 104.\n\n238.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Total has explained the general functioning of the system in economic terms (as existing until the end of 2001) from the perspective of the generators as follows:\n\n\"166. In summary, the income of power generators consists of three principal types of payments, all of which were set by the Procedures, directly or indirectly, in US dollars until 2002. These are payments for electricity dispatched in the spot market, \"capacity\" payments, and payments reflecting the \"cost of unsupplied energy\".\n\n167. These three revenue streams will be briefly outlined below....[...]\n\n*(b) The uniform price mechanism in the spot market*\n\n170. Under SoE Resolution 61/1992, the price of electricity in the spot market was to be determined in accordance with the \"economic cost\" of production of electricity. Such price was to be uniform and calculated, as is explained below, in a way that rewards the most efficient (ie, most economical) power generators in terms of variable production cost.\n\n171. In accordance with the Electricity Law and the Procedures, both thermal and hydroelectric generators declare to Cammesa their variable cost of production of electricity in US dollars, twice a year. The Procedures provide that this variable cost must be \"expressed as equivalent fuel units ('US$/fuel-unit')\", which means that it is a function of, principally, the fuel cost of each unit multiplied by its efficiency in generating electricity by utilising that fuel.\n\n172. As already explained, it was -and still is -the cost of gas, the principal fuel used by thermal generators in Argentina, that on the whole determines the variable cost declared not only by thermal units (which overwhelmingly use gas to produce electricity), but also by hydroelectric units (which have to declare costs after thermal units, and seek to remain competitive vis-\u00e0-vis the thermal units, in the way described at paragraph 61 above).\"\n\n173. Cammesa, in turn, determines the price of electricity in the spot market on an hourly basis, calculating the demand and supply of electricity based on the relevant data, which is being provided by generators. Cammesa then calls upon generators to dispatch electricity until demand is met, in an ascending order of the variable cost declared by each generator. As a result, a generator who is able to declare low variable cost should be able to sell all of the electricity that it can make available.\n\n174. In this mechanism, the uniform price of electricity is equal to the cost of the unit of electricity that is required to meet the next unit of demand. Each generator is to be remunerated for its dispatches on the basis of this uniform price, making a margin out of the difference between the uniform price and its own declared variable cost, in order to cover its fixed costs and make a return. This is illustrated in the diagram below.\n\n*(c) The concepts of \"capacity\" and \"unsupplied energy\" payments*\n\n175. The Electricity Law and the Procedures provided (until 2002) that electricity generators are also to receive a \"capacity\" payment at the amount of US$10/MWh. This is a payment for electricity not actually dispatched in the spot market but available to be dispatched at times of high demand. It was calculated on the basis of a certain amount of MWh dispatched by each generator in the spot market within a defined period of every month.\n\n176. The economic purpose behind the capacity payment is to encourage investment in \"peaking\" units that are called to dispatch electricity only at \"peak\" times of high demand: these units are the safety valves of the generation network, and ensure that no power cuts should occur.\n\n177. The rate of the capacity payment described above was always fixed in US dollars: the SoE has consistently expressed the capacity payment as a US dollar value and Resolution 137/1992 deliberately fixed its amount per MWh in US dollars.\n\n178. Allied to the remuneration for capacity outlined above is the amount referred to as the \"cost of unsupplied energy\", ie a price that applies in hours of unsupplied demand to signal the value of electricity to its demand in the market. This price was fixed at US$l,500/MWh in the Procedures, and remained at this level until 2002. Under the same rules, this US dollar amount is to be determined by the SoE based on a study of the social and economic value of the demand for energy that cannot be satisfied.\"286\n\nTotal\u2019s Request for Arbitration, paras. 166-178, footnotes omitted. In its further briefs Total appears to have modified various points of this description.\n\n239.\n\nBefore examining the merits of Total\u2019s claim in relation to the aforementioned investments, the Tribunal considers it useful to give a detailed overview of the legal regime governing Argentina\u2019s power generation sector, as understood from the parties\u2019 submissions in this arbitration. In order to give this overview, the Tribunal has relied extensively on the reports prepared by the parties\u2019 experts (Mr. Abdala and Mr. Spiller for the Claimant and Mr. Gallino and Mr. Sruoga for the Respondent), as well as on the parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n240.\n\nThe Electricity Law establishes the general framework governing Argentina\u2019s electricity sector, assigning to specialized authorities (mainly, the SoE) the task of putting it into effect through highly technical regulations. The Tribunal will deal first with the relevant provisions of the Electricity Law and the Decree which implemented it (mainly, Decree 1,398/92).287\n\nExhibit C-35.\n\n241.\n\nThe Electricity Law provides for a regulator, namely the *Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad* (hereinafter also \"ENRE\"), established within the SoE \"which shall implement all the necessary measures to comply with the objectives established in Article 2 hereof\u2019 (Article 54). The objectives of ENRE are spelled out in Article 2.1 of the Electricity Law. These objectives are as follows: \"a) To adequately protect the rights of users; b) To promote competition in the electricity production and demand markets, and to foster investments for the purpose of guaranteeing the gas supply in the long term; c) To promote the operation, reliability, equality, free access, non discrimination and widespread use of services and installation of electricity transportation and distribution; d) to regulate the electricity transmission ensuring that the tariffs applicable to the services are fair and reasonable; e) To encourage supply, transportation, distribution and efficient use by setting appropriate rate methodologies; f) To encourage private investments in production, transportation and distribution, thus ensuring market competitiveness where possible\". Furthermore, ENRE \"shall be subject to the principles and provisions hereof, and shall control conformity of the electric sector activity to such principles and provisions\" (Article 2.2). Article 4 of the Electricity Law identifies as players in the electricity market: \"a) Power plants or producers; b) Transportation companies; c) Distribution companies; d) Large users.\"\n\n242.\n\nIn implementing reform of the sector, the electricity activity was divided into three different sectors, namely generation, transmission and distribution. Under the Electricity Law these three sectors are classified differently. While the Electricity Law defines electricity transmission and distribution activities as *\"public service\"* (Article 1.1), power generation activity is regarded as *\"service of \u2018general interest. \u2019\"*\n\n243.\n\nMore precisely, Article 1.2 of the Electricity Law states that: \"The generation activities, in any of its modalities, which are totally or partially devoted to the supply of energy for the service are declared to be of \"general interest\", the activities of which are deemed affected to such public service and are governed by the legal rules and regulations which allow for its normal operation.\"288 Annex I, Article 1.3 of Decree 1,398/92 clarifies that: \"As the electric power generation activity is related to the free relationship between supply and demand, it should be regulated only in those aspects and circumstances affecting the general interest.\" Accordingly, \"[t]he electric power generation activity of a thermal origin does not require prior authorization of the National Executive for its exercise; however, the one of hydroelectric origin shall be subject to an exploitation concession,....\" (Decree 1,398/92, Annex I, Article 5).289\n\nSee also Decree 1,398/92 at Article 1; ENRE, ***Informe Annual 1993/1994,*** point 3.1.b at Exhibit C-316.\n\nSee also Article 14 point a) Law 15,336, as amended by the Electricity Law (Article 89), which lists hydroelectric power generation, among the activities requiring a concession from the Executive. LTnder the Procedures, thermal plants may instead operate in the WEM upon authorisation by the Authority. In this regard see below at para. 276.\n\n244.\n\nAs to the power generation sector, the Electricity Law lays down the following. The SoE290 \"shall determine the rules applicable to the DNDC *[Despacho Nacional de Cargas}* for the performance of its duties, which shall guarantee the transparency and fairness of decisions, according to the following principles: a) To allow the execution of contracts freely agreed upon by the parties thereto, which parties shall be power plants [...], large users and distribution companies (forward market); b) To dispatch the demand required, based on the acknowledgment of prices of energy and power set forth in the following section, to which market agents shall expressly commit, in order to be entitled to supply or receive electricity not freely agreed upon by the parties [...]\" (Article 35.2 of the Electricity Law). According to Article 35.1, the DNDC is the body entrusted with managing the Wholesale Electricity Market (hereinafter also \"WEM\" or in Spanish, the *Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista* or \"MEM\"), composed of both the term (Article 35.2 a)) and spot markets (Article 35.2 b)). The DNDC had to be organised as a corporation *(\"sociedad an\u00f3nima\")* in accordance with the same article. To this end, Decree 1,192/92 established the *Compa\u00f1\u00eda Administradora del Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista S.A.* (hereinafter also \"CAMMESA\"), a not-for-profit company in which the main actors of the Wholesale Electricity Market participate together with the State.\n\nThe SoE has the authority to implement the Law by enacting Resolutions.\n\n245.\n\nThe Electricity Law provides that generators may sell the power they produce in two ways. First of all, they may participate in the \"term electricity market\" in accordance with Article 35.2 a) of the Electricity Law by concluding contracts with other generators, distribution companies and large-scale consumers. To this end, the same law provides that \"generators can enter into supply contracts directly with distributors and large users. Said contracts shall be freely negotiated between the parties\" (Article 6). Secondly, Article 35.2 b) provides that by participating in the spot electricity market, generators may sell the power they produce \"based on the acknowledgment of prices of energy and power set forth in the following section\" *(i.e.,* Article 36.1 of the Electricity Law).\n\n246.\n\nAs to the regulation of the spot market, Article 36.1 of the Electricity Law states that: \"The Secretary of Energy shall pass a resolution on the economic dispatch rules for energy and power transactions provided for [in Article 35.2 b)] to be applied by DNDC.\" The same Article goes on to state that: Such resolution shall provide that generators receive for the power sold a uniform rate for all en each delivery location established by the DNDC, based on the economic cost of the system. In order to determine such rate, the cost that the unsupplied energy represents for the community must be taken into account. \" [emphasis added]. This is the key provision of the Electricity Law upon which Total relies.\n\n247.\n\nFurthermore, according to Article 36.2 of the Electricity Law, the SoE shall also: \"... determine that those who demand electricity (distribution companies) pay a uniform rate, stabilized every ninety (90) days, and measured at the receipt points. Such rate shall include the amounts received by power plants for the items indicated in the paragraph above, and the transportation costs between the supply and receipt points.\"\n\n248.\n\nBy referring to these provisions, Total stresses the difference between transportation and distribution, which are qualified as public services and regulated as tariff-based sectors, and generation, which is organized as a free market with minimal regulation. Based on the aforementioned legal provisions, as well as on other documents,291 Total contends that:\n\n\"power generation was henceforth to be an open and free market. The state was to sell its power plants, and more plants would be built and run in accordance with the free-market rules of supply and demand.\"292\n\nTotal submits that power generation was thus organized as a free market \"trusting that competition among efficient private companies would drive costs down\"293 and \"the philosophy of the Electricity Law was that end-user tariffs were to be determined according to the economic cost of producing electricity.\"294 As a consequence, under the Electricity Law and Decree 1,398/92, the State has a limited role as to the regulation of power generation activities.\n\nMore specifically, Total refers at para. 864 of its Post-Hearing Brief to a document prepared by ENRE ***(Informe Annual 1993/1994,*** Exhibit C-316, at Point 3.1.b, ***supra*** note 280) and a conference paper by Mr. Legisa (former President of ENRE) presented at a conference on Regulation in Infrastructure Services, New Delhi 2000, Exhibit C-369. See also Total\u2019s Post Hearing Brief, para. 865.\n\nElectricity transportation and distribution were also privatized. The concessionaires were, however, remunerated by tariffs, as in the gas-transportation sector. See Total\u2019s Post Hearing Brief, para. 104.\n\nAccording to Total \"the cost of power generation fell drastically immediately after the 1992 reforms and by 2001 had decreased by 40%.\" See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 104.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 105.\n\n249.\n\nMore precisely, it is Total\u2019s position that:\n\n\"[I]n the power-generation sector, the discretionary powers of the SoE are expressly limited. By contrast with highly regulated sectors such as electricity transportation and distribution (which are tariff-based sectors), according to Decree 1,398/1992, the power generation sector is organized as a free market and therefore it should be minimally regulated.\"295\n\nAccording to Total:\n\n\"[T]here is therefore a fundamental difference between a public-service sector (like electricity transportation and distribution) and a public-interest sector (like power generation). This difference was described by ENRE in its 1993/1994 Annual Report: \"Power Generation is declared as a single \"general interest\" service, while the rest retain the attributes of a single \"public service\", on the consideration that power generation can operate in a competitive market.\"296\n\nBased on the considerations above, Total concludes that:\n\n\"[T]he limits to the scope of the SoE\u2019s authority result from the explicit will of the legislator, who wanted the regulations to be essentially limited to technical aspects and the administration of the system. Principally, the system would be governed by free-market rules. The role of the SoE is limited to the implementation of the rules and objectives set forth in the Electricity Law.\"297\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 863. In order to support this argument Total refers to Decree 1,398/92, Article 1.3, already quoted by the Tribunal at para. 243.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 864.\n\nSee Total's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 866.\n\n250.\n\nArgentina opposes Total\u2019s arguments. Moreover, Argentina suggests that, under the Electricity Law, the SoE has a right to modify and adapt the regulation of generators in order \"to search a more efficient or competitive market, enabling the continuity of the public services.\"298 According to Argentina:\n\n\"the above-mentioned regulations establish that the government intervention is mandatory through measures aimed at ensuring the normal operation of electric power services and protecting the general interests.\"299\n\nTherefore, Argentina says that the SoE has the right to modify the regulations applying to generators on grounds of general interest because generators mainly supply energy to public utilities.300 Argentina argues that this right of the SoE comes from the wide powers to adjust the rules of operation of the MEM reserved to it by the Electricity Law (Articles 35 and 36 of the Electricity Law).301 According to Argentina, two further elements support its position. First, these broad powers are demonstrated by the SoE\u2019s practice, which modified the functioning of the MEM over 130 times from 1992 to 2001, before Total\u2019s investments in the sector took place.302 Second, everyone was aware of the extent of the SoE\u2019s powers, as it has been the object of much criticism. In this regard, Argentina stresses that:\n\n\"[A]s from the academic and regulatory point of view, some people criticized the extension of such powers. That was the position adopted, among others, by Spiller, already in 1996, before TOTAL made investments in electricity. At the hearing, Abdala pointed out that he shared such Spiller\u2019s statements. In their book published in 1999, Spiller and Abdala stated that: \"[a]t the SE level, the Argentine Government has reserved the greatest portion of discretional power.\" At the hearing, Abdala acknowledged that the Secretary of Energy \"had reserved an important discretional power for setting rules of the game in this sector.\"\"303\n\nBased on these arguments, Argentina concludes that:\n\n\"[A]ny sophisticated investor includes (or should include) in its legitimate expectations the wide powers of the Secretary of Energy to adjust the rules of operations of the WEM. In the present context of the current case, TOTAL suggests that the legitimate participation of the Secretary of Energy entailed violating the core principles of the WEM. Thus, Total disregards the powers of the Department of Energy both in the design of sector regulatory policies as well as in the exercise of its powers in CAMMESA.\"304\n\nTotal agrees that there was a need for technical regulation of generators, but submits that the ability to regulate did not extend to subverting the fundamental principle established by the Electricity Law.305\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 402.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para 168 where, besides Article 1.2 of the Electricity Law and Article 1.3 of Decree 1,398/92, Argentina also refers to Law 15,336, Article 3, Part 2.\n\nSee generally Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras 164-174 and in particular para 169.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, paras 399-400.\n\nSee below footnote 311.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 344-345.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 403 and Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 346 where Argentina restated this argument in similar terms: \"..., any sophisticated investor, such as Total, would include (or should include) in its legitimate expectations the extensive powers of the Secretary of Energy to adjust the regulations governing the MEM operation.\"\n\nTotal\u2019s Reply Memorial, paras. 348-360.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal notes here that, on the one hand, the Parties agree that the SoE must respect the Electricity Law (especially Article 36) and Argentine Constitutional Law,306 when it exercises its regulatory powers; on the other hand, the Parties infer from the aforementioned rules different conclusions as to the extent of SoE\u2019s discretionary powers under Argentina\u2019s law. The Parties qualify differently the provisions contained in Article 36. According to Total, Article 36 contains \"pricing rules\" which should be regarded as promises made by Argentina to all generators.307 On the contrary, Argentina qualifies the provisions of Article 36 as \"general guidelines\"308 which the SoE has the authority to implement within its broad discretionary powers.309\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 320 at p. 79 and TotaPs Post-Hearing Brief, paras 861-862.\n\nSee Total's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 854. The Tribunal notes here that Total also qualified these provisions, such as \"explicit mandatory principles\" which \"the SoE does not have authority to trump\", \"price-determination rules\" (Total's Post-Hearing Brief paras 861 and 826, respectively), \"criteria for determination of prices\" (Total's Post-Hearing Brief para 859) and \"ground rules\" at the hearings on the merits (see Transcript (English), Monday, January 7, 2008, 174:6).\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 320 at 79.\n\nIn this regard, Total points out that the terms of HPDA\u2019s concession (see below at paras. 277-278) do not support Argentina\u2019s classification of the content of Article 36 of the Electricity Law as providing general guidelines. According to Total, HPDA\u2019s concession provides for a right to terminate the concession in case of a significant alteration of the \"criteria for the determination of prices contained in the Electricity Law\" (Article 56.1.4). Consequently, it is Total\u2019s view that \"[t]he operative word is \"criteria\" - not \"guidelines\" or \"general principles.\"\" (see Total Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 96 at p. 46)\n\n252.\n\nThe SoE has implemented the provisions of the Electricity Law (Article 36.1 included) by Resolution No. 61/1992 of 29 April 1992.310 This Resolution has been amended many times by subsequent Resolutions before Total\u2019s investments in the sector.311 All of these Resolutions are known in their consolidated form as the \"Procedures\" (in Spanish, *\"Los Procedimientos\"),* which contain the overall regulation of the MEM.312 The Procedures also establish the mechanism according to which CAMMESA, which is in charge of the administration of the wholesale market (as the Tribunal has outlined above at paragraph 244), determines spot prices.\n\nSee Resolution 61/92 of 29 April 1992, ***Organizaci\u00f3n del Sistema F\u00edsico del Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista. Agentes Reconocidos. Organizaci\u00f3n. Procedimientos para la Programaci\u00f3n de la Operaci\u00f3n, el Despacho de Cargas y el C\u00e1lculo de Precios. Sanciones por Falta de Pago. Disposiciones Transitorias. Ambito de aplicaci\u00f3n y vigencia*** (Exhibits C-36). See also Extracts From The Procedures at Exhibit C-37.\n\nMany changes in the Procedures had been introduced by the SoE as of 1992. For example, Total refers to Resolution 137/92 of 30 November 1992 (Exhibit C-74), by which the SoE improved the Procedures in order to adjust it to the \"criterios de regulaci\u00f3n de la actividad de transporte de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica y de Generaci\u00f3n hidroel\u00e9ctrica\" (see Request for Arbitration, para. 175 and footnote 150). There were also the modifications - in favour of generators - to the price setting mechanism (established by Resolution 62/92) introduced by Resolution 105/95 (in this regard see LECG Report on Electricity, para. 27 and footnote 13 at p. 17: Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 144; Gallino Report on Electricity, paras 180-184; and Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para 404 ff). As to these changes, Argentina points out that, \"In late 2001, with the outbreak of the crisis, the Procedures had already been modified by the Department of Energy on 131 occasions.\" (see Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 404)\n\nSee Updated Version of the Procedures with relevant Annexes (Exhibit C-278).\n\n253.\n\nIn describing this complex mechanism and its operation below, the Tribunal will refer to those aspects of the Procedures which are undisputed between the Parties and their experts.\n\n254.\n\nUnder the Procedures, electricity prices in the spot market are set by CAMMESA \"on an hourly basis set by the economic cost of production, represented by the Short Term Marginal Cost measured in the Load Center of the System.\" (Article 9(b) SoE Resolution 61/92). Every power generator has to inform CAMMESA of its variable cost of production twice a year to allow CAMMESA to make these price determinations. The variable costs declared by generators are mainly determined by the cost of the fuels used for generation in the MEM. The Procedures (Annex 13, Section 1) apply to the following fuels \"... gas, coal, fuel oil, gas oil and nuclear...\n\n255.\n\nEach generator was required to calculate its variable cost in accordance with the formulas provided for by Resolution 61/1992, depending on the type of fuel used for production of electricity and the type of generation unit. More specifically, thermal units (such as Central Puerto) have to calculate their variable costs according to a formula which was a function of, principally, the fuel cost of each unit (to be used in the following six months) multiplied by its efficiency.313 Annex 13, Section 2, of the Procedures provides that: \"The Variable Cost of Production (VCP) of a thermal, conventional or nuclear unit is the variable cost anticipated by the Generator for the production of power throughout a given period, and it includes the cost of fuels, the cost related to machine consumption, the cost of different variable inputs of the fuels, the start-up and halt costs for state-of-the-art and sub-base machines, and any other required variables.\" The same section goes on to state that: \"This cost is expressed per machined type installed in the unit, and there are four possible kinds (steamturbine, gas-turbine or engines, combined-cycle and nuclear), and for each type of fuel that the machine may consume, considering those established for the determination of fuel reference prices as type of fuels. The values defining the variable cost of production are expressed in equivalent fuel units for consumption in order to produce power (USD/fuel unit). The number of values defining the variable cost of production of a thermal unit, therefore, depends on the number of machines installed in the unit and the amount of different fuels that may be consumed\n\nSee also Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 190.\n\n256.\n\nUnder the Procedures, the variable cost declarations by thermal units were subject to price ceilings (the so-called *\"Valores M\u00e1ximos Reconocidos\")314* According to Annex 13, Section 3 of the Procedures, the reference prices of the various relevant fuels are also defined and regulated and seasonal and monthly reference prices are distinguished.315 As to the reference prices of fuels (the so-called *Precios de Referenda de combustibles),* Annex 13, Section 1 of the Procedures provides for the following definition: \"The fuel Reference Price shall be the price provided in the Wholesale Electric Market (WEM) for said fuel, which is calculated for each type of existing fuel with the methodology established herein.\"316 According to the same section, the reference price of gas \"is calculated with the prices in the local market\" and the reference price of the other fuels \"is calculated: a) for the gas, with the methodology indicated in point 5.3 herein; b) for coal and nuclear fuel, with the fuel reference price.\"\n\nIn this regard, see also Total\u2019s Memorial, para 191 where the Claimant refers to Annex 13, Section 3 and Section 5.3 of the Procedures as to the gas reference price. As to the reference prices of the other fuel costs, see Annex 13, Section 5.2 of the Procedures.\n\nMore specifically see Section 5.1 of the Procedures.\n\nAs to the various types of fuels considered by the Procedures see above para. 254.\n\n257.\n\nAs to the reference price of gas, Annex 13, Section 5.3 of the Procedure refers to the tariff set by ENARGAS in respect of the large-scale gas users. More specifically, Section 5.3 states that: \"The Gas Seasonal Reference price in the units is determined by the corresponding existing rates for a six-month period for the gas Transport and Distribution licensee who informs the ENARGAS for the interruptible supply (I) in the charts called \"Large Users - Charges per m3 consumed, ID or IT regime\". For each unit, the Reference Price shall be determined for the kind of relationship between the gas network, whether direct or indirect, with the Transportation (T) or Distribution (D) company. The Gas Reference price in the reference point is determined by the rate corresponding to the Capital. If a Generator submits an interruptible gas contract, the rate corresponding to the interruptible supply shall be applicable.\" Section 5.3 concludes that: \"Gas rates have a six-month duration, as from May and as from November. Therefore, the gas reference price per month shall be equal to the seasonal reference price for the Seasonal Period to which that month pertains.\"\n\n258.\n\nIn respect of the other fuels, Section 5.2, item 1, of the Procedures (under the Heading *\u2018Combustibles L\u00edquidos\u2019)* provides that: \"Liquid fuel reference prices are calculated considering the fuel price in the international Market, the registered prices and the future prices, plus: a) for imported fuel, the import cost of the product up to La Plata; b) for national origin fuel, a surcharge of the **FOB** value representing the commercialization costs.\" As to these fuels, Section 5.2.1. specifies the following:\n\n\"The reference price for each liquid fuel is calculated considering past prices registered in the International Market, the future tendency of the International Market and the transport up to La Plata, the reference point. The prices corresponding to the specific characteristics of fuels and to an international commercialization port, defined as New York shall be used. [...].\"\n\nSumming up, the reference prices of these fuels are generally based on their international prices in New York. Nevertheless, the Procedures reserve to the SoE the power to modify the method of calculation when extraordinary circumstances occur relating to the international prices of these fuels. According to Section 5.2, item 2 of the Procedures, \"[i]n extraordinary situations in which the conditions in the fuel markets are very far away from normal conditions, the calculation of liquid fuel reference prices may be modified by the *SECRETARY OF ENERGY of the MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND PUBLIC WORKS AND SERVICES. The SECRETARY OF ENERGY of the MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND P UBLIC WORKS AND SERVICES shall notify the DISPATCH BODY (OED) of said modification before the date on which Generators are to be informed of the reference prices.\"*\n\n259.\n\nAs to the variable costs declared by hydroelectric units (such as HPDA), Total and its experts, Mr. Abdala and Mr. Spiller, explain that the variable cost of generation for hydroelectric generators is given by the value of water, which corresponds to the opportunity cost of water.317 This opportunity cost is based on the value of the water in alternative uses (such as tourism activities or irrigation) and also taking into account the management of reservoirs in relation to other economic activities. For the purpose of calculating the opportunity cost of water, the Procedures provide for two standard models called OSCAR *(Optimizador Secuencial de Cuencas Argentinas)318* and MARGO.319 In this regard, Total\u2019s experts point out that,\n\n\"for run-of the river units this opportunity cost is almost zero. For the other kind of hydro units this opportunity cost is given by the expected future replacement cost of water, which in turn is given by the cost of thermal generation that may replace the use of water for electricity purposes. Thus, the allowed variable costs of hydroelectric plants are linked to the allowed variable costs of thermal,generators.\"320\n\nSee Chapter II, Sections 2.3.1.2.2., 2.3.1.2.3, 2.3.1.3., 2.3.2. of the Procedures and Annex 22.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, footnote 48 at p. 29.\n\nSee Section 2.2 of the Procedures at p. 9.\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, para. 61 and LECG Report on Electricity, para. 26.\n\n260.\n\nTurning back to the spot price formation mechanism, CAMMESA calls for dispatch of all the power generators that have declared costs lower than those of the marginal unit (that is the unit that sets the spot price). The marginal unit is the unit next-in-line to the last plant dispatched in order to satisfy the hourly demand of electricity.321 More specifically, CAMMESA prepares an ascending order (the so-called merit order) calling for dispatch first from the generators that have declared the lowest costs. The spot price, which is hourly-determined, is equivalent to the variable costs declared by the marginal unit, that is, the least expensive generator excluded by CAMMESA from the merit order.322 All of the generators dispatched receive the same spot price from CAMMESA but do not obtain the same margin. Their individual margin depends on their efficiency.323\n\nUntil the enactment of Resolution 105/95, the marginal unit was the last one called upon by CAMMESA for dispatch, as explained above at footnote 311.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, paras 25 and 27; Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 421.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 810 point (h).\n\n261.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the price of natural gas is the key element determining electricity prices in Argentina.324 Most of the time, the marginal unit (that is the unit that sets the spot price), used to be a thermal plant burning gas except in cases of peak demand. In cases of peak demand, more costly generators such as liquid fuel units are also utilized to meet the increased demand.\n\nSee Total's Request for Arbitration para. 172; LECG Report on Electricity, para. 29; and Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras 188-189.\n\n262.\n\nAs to the place of hydro units and HPDA in the merit order, Total points out the following. Historically, hydro units were not the marginal units. Hydroelectric units were (and are) generally able to declare to CAMMESA low variable costs and, as a consequence, to dispatch large quantities of electricity in the spot market so as to have significant cash flows and repay sunk costs.325 In this respect, the Tribunal notes that even after the enactment of the measures challenged by Total, hydroelectric units declare variable costs lower than the \"AR$120/MWh spot price cap\" introduced by SoE Resolution 2/02.326\n\nSee Request for Arbitration para. 62 and Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 810 point (i) where Total states that \"for technological reasons, more efficient generators have much higher sunk costs than less efficient generators: the most efficient technology ***(i.e.,*** hydroelectric and combined-cycle plants) requires greater amounts to be invested upfront.\" In this regard, Mr. Petrochilos, one of Total\u2019s lawyers, stated in his Opening Statement at the Hearings on the Merits that: \"... when you have a hydro plant, it will be dispatching large amounts of the electricity because it is a baseload and efficient plant...\" (see Transcript (English), Monday, January 7, 2008, 177:21-22 and 178:1-2).\n\nLEGG Report on Electricity, Graph IX at p. 55.\n\n263.\n\nTotal submitted, in the course of its opening statement at the hearings on the merits that:\n\n\"[T]his [that is hydroelectric units being the price setters] is not the typical situation, but it can happen at times of low hydrolicity when the opportunity cost of water is more expensive, more dear, than the cost of gas, and this applies in particular to plants which are very expensive to build; like Piedra del Aguila, about which you will hear more later, that can store energy. So they're not run-of-the-river plants, but they can store energy for months, weeks, or even a season and then sell it at times when there is a lot of demand and there is not a lot of hydropower in the market.\" [see Transcript (English), Monday, January 7, 2008, 180:11-21],\n\nSumming up, while being able to declare low variable costs, hydro units require an amount of upfront investment for their construction three times larger than that required by an average thermal unit with the same installed capacity.327 According to Total, this is particularly true for HPDA. On the one hand, HPDA is a seasonal plant which can store electricity; on the other \"... it is a classic baseload plant, a plant that requires large margins\"328 because it is very expensive to build.\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, para. 62.\n\nSee the Opening Statement by Mr. Petrochilos on behalf of Total at the Hearings on the Merits, Transcript (English), Monday, January 7, 2008, 190: 16-19.\n\n264.\n\nFurthermore, in order to understand the functioning of the system, other activities of CAMMESA as administrator of the MEM are worthy of note. CAMMESA collects the payments made by distributors and large users for electricity acquired in the spot market and pays the spot-price revenues due to generators for the electricity sold in the spot market. Distributors do not pay for electricity at the spot prices (which are hourly-determined and, therefore, variable) but pay at a \"seasonal tariff\u2019, which the SoE fixes every six months.329 The \"seasonal tariff\u2019 is, therefore, the price to be paid by distributors during a six-month period330 and is calculated by CAMMESA on the basis of various factors. Among these different factors are the variable costs and the demand for electricity projected by generators and distributors, respectively, and the market data for the first three months of the relevant season. In fact, CAMMESA must review the seasonal tariff after the first three months of the seasonal period has elapsed.331 This quarterly review is carried out by CAMMESA (under the control of the SoE) in order to adjust the seasonal tariff, particularly taking into account the variations between the actual demand by distributors in the first three months of the seasonal period and their projected demand. In fact, the demand for electricity by distributors is one of the main factors which contributes to the determination of electricity prices.332\n\nSee Chapter II, Section 2.12 of the Procedures.\n\nSee Chapter II, Section 2.4.6.3 of the Procedures.\n\nThis review is called \"QUARTERLY RESCHEDULE.\"\n\nOn this aspect see Chapter II, Section 2.11.1 of the Procedures.\n\n265.\n\nSumming up, the \"seasonal tariff\u2019 is a projection by CAMMESA of the spot prices for the next season. Because there can be differences between the actual spot prices and the \"seasonal tariff\u2019 to be paid by distributors, Resolution 61/92 provides for a \"[q]uarterly stabilization system of the prices for the Spot Market, intended for the purchase from distributors.\" (see Article 9 point c) below). More specifically, according to Article 9 of Resolution 61/92, \"The Wholesale Electric Market is composed of: a) a Term contract market, [...]. b) A Spot Market, with prices determined on an hourly basis based on the economic cost of production, represented by the Short-Term Marginal Cost measured in the Load Center of the System, c) A quarterly stabilization system of the prices for the Spot Market, intended for the purchase from distributors.\"\n\n266.\n\nTo finance and cover any difference between the spot prices and the seasonal tariff, the Procedures establish the so-called \"Stabilization Fund\", managed by CAMMESA.333 Under the Heading *\"PRICE STABILIZATION SYSTEM\"* the Procedures at section 5.7 provide that:\n\n\"The difference arising from the amounts to be paid by debtors, considering that the Distributors pay such amounts based on a system of seasonal prices, and the amounts to be received by creditors, resulting from spot price transactions, shall be absorbed by a stabilization system based on the existence of a provisional deposit fund called STABILIZATION FUND. In this fund, the amounts produced in the months in which there is a positive balance obtained from the application of the seasonal price system with respect to the Spot Market shall be deposited. Furthermore, this fund shall provide the necessary financial resources to complete the credit amount of the sellers in those months when the results are different. This Stabilization Fund shall not be used to compensate default payments.  \n In case the financial resources which are available in the Stabilization Fund are not enough to raise the complete credit amount in a given month, the OED *[i.e.,* Dispatch Body, that is, Cammesa] shall require the necessary financial assistance to the SEE. To these ends, the SEE shall provide for the grant of a repayable automatic loan and without interest using resources of the Unified Fund [...].\"\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 1074 at p. 352 and Total\u2019s Memorial, footnote 323 at p. 90.\n\n267.\n\nBoth the parties and their experts agree that \"the economic cost of the system\", upon which the uniform rate due to generators shall be based in accordance with Article 36 of the Electricity Law, has two elements.334 Moreover, they agree that the spot price formation mechanism based on the marginal costs (hourly determined) reflects only one of these elements, that is, the short-term economic cost of production of electricity.335 Accordingly, both parties have outlined that, in order to reflect also the cost of non-supplied energy for the community as required by Article 36 of the Electricity Law, the mechanism includes other components. In addition to the spot price, the Procedures provided for two additional payments due to generators which reflect the cost of non-supplied energy for the community (which in turn reflects the long-term costs of production of electricity). These two additional payments are the capacity payment (technically termed \"remuneration of available capacity\") and *\"el sobreprecio por riesgo de falla* (SPRF)\" (the so-called \"risk of failure\" price). The Tribunal will deal first with capacity payments and then with the \"risk of failure\" price.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, para 23; Gallino and Srouga Supplementary Report on Electricity, para 5.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, para 23-24; Gallino and Srouga Supplementary Report on Electricity, para 6.\n\n268.\n\nCapacity payments are revenues paid by CAMMESA to generators (in addition to spot price revenues) in order to remunerate generators for their (proven) generation capacity. Spot price payments and capacity payments (as well as other ancillary sources of revenue) constitute what industry practitioners in Argentina call the \"monomic price\", that is, the average remuneration per MWh received by generators.336\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, para. 277 and LECG Report on Electricity, para. 38, where it is stated that \"the monomic price, then, consists simply of the overall industry revenues from spot and capacity sales (as well as ancillary sources of revenues for generators) divided by total spot sales (in MWh)\".\n\n269.\n\nMore specifically, the capacity payment due to each generator is calculated by CAMMESA on the basis of the capacity dispatched by each generator in the past six months.337 According to Section 2.4.2.1 of SoE Resolution 137/92, the capacity payment was established by the SoE in an amount equivalent to US$5/MW, increasing to US$10/MW in 1994.338\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 816 and footnote 941 at p. 308 (the sources listed therein); and Gallino and Srouga Supplementary Report on Electricity, para. 62 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 817.\n\n270.\n\nThe Parties have extensively disputed the functions of capacity payments in the price determination system described above.339 In this regard, the Parties seem to agree that the capacity payment is set by the SoE so as to be an incentive to new investments in the MEM when available capacity is not meeting demand (or, conversely, to be a signal to halt investments in the opposite situation).340 However, the parties have not pointed to any specific parameter or criterion on the basis of which the rate of the capacity payment had been set at US$10/MW.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 818 ff. and Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 513 ff.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, para. 3.b at p. 30 and Gallino and Srouga Supplementary Report on Electricity, paras 5, 7 and 64 ff. See also Total\u2019s Reply, para. 297.\n\n271.\n\nFurthermore, Total and its experts emphasize that capacity payments are also aimed at recovering the investment costs of generators.341 On the contrary, Argentina and its experts strongly oppose Total\u2019s position on this further function of capacity payments. More specifically, Mr. Gallino and Mr. Srouga in their Supplementary Report suggest that \"there is no rule supporting the assertion that the purpose of capacity payments is mainly the coverage of capital costs or investment recovery.\"342 In order to support this statement, Argentina\u2019s experts point out that capacity payments were (and are) to be determined by the SoE on the basis of the actual capacity dispatched by each generator in the spot market during the previous six months. Accordingly, \"if the intention had been to remunerate the invested capital, it would have been logic [sic] to pay per capacity regardless of dispatch.\"343 Summing up, Argentina suggests that,\n\n\"[C]apacity payments were not created as a guaranty [sic] to cover capital or recovery [sic] costs of the investments, and such circumstance was acknowledged by Abdala at the hearing: \"In addition, capacity payments of $4 are a significant departure from the commitments that the investors would have an opportunity to recover their investments. An opportunity is not a guarantee, but an opportunity.\" Such relationship is not made in the provisions.\"344\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, para. 36.\n\nSee Gallino and Srouga Supplementary Report on Electricity, para. 71.\n\nSee Gallino and Srouga Supplementary Report on Electricity, para. 73.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 358.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the second additional payment, namely the \u2018risk of failure\u2019 price determined by the SoE to reflect the cost of unsupplied energy. The range of this price varies depending on the risk of blackout projected by CAMMESA at a given time. The range was fixed by the SoE from US$120/MWh at times of lowest risk (up to 1.6% risk) to US$l,500/MWh at highest-risk times (greater than 10% risk).345 These prices operate in the system \"as maximum prices applicable at times of risk of blackout\"346 and, as stressed by both Parties, are quite common in countries with systems similar to those in Argentina (such as the U.K. and Chile).347\n\nSee Chapter II, Section 2.4.3.3.2 of the Procedures.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 194 and Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 822 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnotes 952 at p. 311 and Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 369.\n\n273.\n\nAs to this \u2018risk of failure\u2019 price, the Tribunal notes that it is not clear from Total\u2019s submissions exactly how this price operates in the spot market. In its Memorial, Total explains that:\n\n\"Allied to the concept of the capacity payment is the payment referred to as the \"cost of unsupplied energy.\" This is the spot price of electricity paid to all generators at times when Cammesa determines that the available capacity in the market is not sufficient to meet demand fully. In such periods of time the marginal cost of electricity is no longer defined by the marginal cost of supply (ie, the declared variable cost of the least efficient unit) but by the cost that would be necessary to meet the demand that cannot be met on the capacity currently available...\"348\n\nArgentina\u2019s experts also contend that this \u2018risk of failure\u2019 price, which has different ranges depending on the risk of outage anticipated by CAMMESA, operates as a cap on spot prices.349 On the contrary, in their report Total\u2019s experts explain that the \u2018economic cost of the system\u2019,\n\n\"..., must include a component that remunerates generators for providing system reliability, that is, to maintain enough reserves to avoid the extreme costs of outages. Such remuneration component for the provision of reliability, in Argentina was thought of as a margin over the short-run marginal cost of the system whenever there were risks of outages; plus a \"capacity payment\" (technically termed \"remuneration for available capacity\"), regardless of the level of the presence of outage risks... \"350\n\nIn this regard, Total\u2019s experts refer to Article 2.7.2 of Annex II in SoE Resolution 38/1991.351 This Article states that: \"The overall capacity remuneration will be computed based on the seasonal planning considering in the period: a) the overvaluation of energy in case of outage risks, based on the expected value of energy deficit and the pre set cost of non delivery energy; b) the remuneration for capacity made available in the absence of outage risks.\"352\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 194 and also Total\u2019s Reply, para. 295.\n\nSee Gallino and Sruoga Supplementary Report on Electricity, paras 59 ff.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, para. 23.\n\nSee Exhibit C-297.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, footnote 4 at p. 15.\n\n274.\n\nWhile Total repeatedly refers to these prices as \"maximum prices applicable at times of risk of blackout\" in its Post-Hearing Brief,353 at the hearings on the merits, Mr. Abdala, one of Total\u2019s experts, rather describes the risk of failure price as a surcharge to the spot price.354 More precisely, Mr. Abdala testified at the hearing as follows:\n\n\"This price [the \"risk of failure\" price] is accommodated through two ways. First is the one that we already described as capacity payments, $10 per megawatt that we had before, the $4 that we have today. The second one, which is equally important is that it is what is called a surcharge to the spot price. Whenever Cammesa anticipates that there is a risk of deficit, then it will tell, look, you know what, generators? You are going to get a surcharge, and this surcharge will be a function of the risk that we have of outages and what is called the cost of unsupplied energy, which is a price that is set also by the Secretary of Energy which, for 10 years, was between $120 to $1,500 per megawatt.... Cammesa will determine, say, there\u2019s a 10 percent risk of deficit [of supply], well, the cost of unsupplied energy is said to be $1,500 per megawatt horn, and that [i]s the reference that Cammesa will use to pay a surcharge to the generators that are producing under this risk situation.\"355\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 822.\n\nSee also Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 823.\n\nSee Direct Examination of Mr. Abdala, Transcript of the Hearing on the Merits (English), Day 5, 1342:17-1343:18.\n\n275.\n\nIt is worth noting here that Resolution 38/91, to which Total\u2019s experts refer to in their report, preceded both the Electricity Law and the Procedures.356 The Electricity Law and its implementing regulations *(i.e.,* in particular the Procedures) were enacted by Argentina in 1992 and replaced previous regulations (Resolution 38/91 included). Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Electricity Law and the Procedures constituted the legal regime in force when Total made its investments in Central Puerto and HPDA in 2001. For this reason, the Tribunal accepts both Parties\u2019 description of the risk of failure price as maximum price, which was set based on the risk of blackout anticipated by CAMMESA.\n\nThis is also admitted by Total in its Reply, footnote 378 at p. 116.\n\n276.\n\nUnder Argentina\u2019s law, while thermal generators may operate in the MEM with an authorisation, hydroelectric generators, such as HPDA, may operate in the MEM only on the basis of a concession agreement with Argentina\u2019s government. Total refers to the provisions of HPDA\u2019s concession agreement as further elements supporting the legal basis of its claim,357 that is Argentina\u2019s promise to maintain a stable pricing system in accordance with Article 36 of the Electricity Law.358 The Tribunal will accordingly review here the relevant provisions of HPDA\u2019s concession in order to complete its analysis.\n\nSee HPDA Concession Agreement at Exhibit C-710.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 855-859.\n\n277.\n\nArticle 9.1 of HPDA\u2019s concession states that:\n\n\"General modifications to regulations and procedures related to the generation of electric power, the WEM operation and Environmental Protection shall not entitle the CONCESSIONAIRE to Claim any indemnification or compensation for damages, except with regard to substantial modifications of the price determination criteria when said modifications are arbitrary and cause compliance with the agreement extremely burdensome for the Concessionaire according to the provisions under Article 1198 of the Civil Code. In this last case of exception Chapter XV of the Contract shall apply.\"\n\nAccordingly, Article 56 of the concession provides for as follows:\n\n\"Article 56.1. The Concessionaire will be entitled, subject to the procedures established in subsection 56.2 below, to terminate the Agreement due to the Concession Grantor\u2019s fault whenever the latter:\n\n\u2026\n\n56.1.4. Established significant modifications to the price determination criteria contained in Law No. 24,065 *[i.e.,* the Electricity Law] and such modifications were arbitrary and caused the compliance with the Agreement to be excessively burdensome for the Concessionaire according to the provisions under section 1198 of the Civil Code.\n\nArticle 56.2 of HPDA concession continues to establish that:\n\n\"Should the Concession Grantor perform any of the acts mentioned in subsection 56.1 above, causing an actual damage to the Concessionaire, the latter will request it to adopt, within a reasonable period depending on circumstances, the measures required to amend the conditions claimed and, as the case may be, to rectify its consequences. In addition, the Concessionaire will require the Concession Grantor to offer a public hearing, before the maturity of such term, to disclose and document the grounds for its request. Should the Concession Grantor fail to adopt the requested measures after such term has elapsed, the Concessionaire will demand it in due manner to do so in a term not exceeding 15 (fifteen) days, under the admonition of termination. After such term has elapsed with no favourable outcome, the Concessionaire may declare the Agreement terminated on the Concession Grantor\u2019s fault.\"359\n\nBy referring to the latter provision of HPDA\u2019s concession, Argentina points out that HPDA did not avail itself of this remedy. See Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para 241.\n\n278.\n\nThus, by the aforementioned provisions, HPDA\u2019s concession grants to the Concessionaire a right to terminate the Concession and to claim damages under Argentina\u2019s civil code in case of substantial modifications of the criteria to determine prices contained in the Electricity Law when they are arbitrary and make performance too onerous.\n\n***3. Total\u2019s Complaint Concerning the Alteration of the Electricity Sector\u2019s Legal Framework I***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***3.1 General***\n-----------------\n\n279.\n\nTotal\u2019s claim with respect to HPDA and Central Puerto is based on Argentina\u2019s alleged commitments in the Electricity Law and the HPDA Concession (there is no concession or any other contractual arrangement as to Central Puerto), upon which Total says it relied when making its investments,\n\n280.\n\nMore precisely, Total submits that,\n\n\"Argentina\u2019s promise was therefore that SoE would act as a fair and neutral regulator in a free market and give effect to the rules in the Electricity Law, that is: (a) that all payments to generators would be at a uniform rate; (b) that one of those payments would be a payment for capacity, as distinct from electricity actually dispatched in the system (Article 35(b)) of the Electricity Law); (c) that the prices paid to generators would be based on the economic cost of producing electricity; and (d) that this economic cost includes the long-term cost of producing electricity\".360\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 113.\n\n281.\n\nAccording to Total, \"Argentina was committed to the stability of the pricing rules in the Electricity Law.\"361 More specifically, it is Total\u2019s view that,\n\n\"Argentina\u2019s promises to power generators were set out in the Electricity Law. That is the controlling text here. Those promises constituted legally enforceable rights in Argentine law. [...] the Electricity Law remains on the statute books, without amendment. Argentina\u2019s argument that *\"[t]he evolution of host State\u2019s laws is part of the context where investments and investors act\"* is of academic interest here: the Electricity Law did not change. And it is clear under international law that promises enshrined in statute are promises that may be relied upon by foreign investors, and in this way generate legitimate expectations protected by the Treaty.\"362\n\nAs to the protection of its legitimate expectations that the price determination system provided by Argentina would remain stable, Total relies on various international and domestic legal authorities.363\n\nSee Total\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 858.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 102.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 867-874.\n\n282.\n\nIn other words, according to Total,\n\n\"[I]n short, the pricing rules in the Electricity Law were a commitment that Argentina expressly made to power generators and investors in such companies, like Total here. The existence of the commitment is beyond question. It follows from several considerations, each of which would of itself be sufficient:\n\n(a) the presentations that we saw Argentina made to prospective investors prior to the passage of the Electricity Law;\n\n(b) the fact that the commitments were set forth, not in administrative regulations, but an Act of Congress - which is still on the statute books;\n\n(c) ten years of successful, consistent, and faithful implementation of the Electricity Law by the SoE;\n\n(d) the rule of Argentine Law according to which the pricing rules in the Electricity Law constitute enforceable rights vested in the power generators (paragraph 826 above); and (e) the express written commitment that all power generators made, on entry in the market, to abide by the Electricity Law, including its pricing rules.\"364\n\nAccording to Total, the above-mentioned \u2018considerations\u2019, include the provisions contained in HPDA\u2019s concession,365 as already recited by the Tribunal.366\n\nSee Total\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 854.\n\nSee Total\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, paras 855-859.\n\nSee above, paras 276-278.\n\n283.\n\nTotal alleges that a number of measures taken by the Argentine Executive breached or revoked the commitments given to attract investment in the power generation sector that were contained in the Electricity Law (especially Article 36), and upon which Total relied in making its investments.367 The measures complained of by Total are the Emergency Law (Article 8) and a number of Resolutions adopted by the Secretariat of Energy, some of which were specifically based on, and others which just followed, the Emergency Law. According to Total, through the Emergency Law and these SoE Resolutions, Argentina has altered the basic principles of the electricity legal regime in such a manner as to breach the fair and equitable treatment clause in the BIT.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 33.\n\n284.\n\nA connected but distinct argument by Total is that these measures were in breach of Argentina\u2019s law, namely the Electricity Law (Article 36). Total argues that the core issue for the Tribunal is whether the measures adopted by the SoE comport with the Electricity Law, *i.e.,* do these Measures respect the promise of remuneration to generators at a uniform rate, based on the economic cost of the system, which takes account of the cost of unsupplied energy?368 In this regard, it is Total\u2019s position that all of the regulations adopted by the SoE during and after the state of emergency are in conflict with Article 36 of the Electricity Law (which is still in force) because they\n\n\"resulted in: (a) generators no longer receiving a uniform rate; (b) prices no longer reflecting the economic cost of the system; and (c) prices no longer reflecting the cost that unsupplied energy represents for the community, ie, no longer encouraging investment in capacity to satisfy peak demand, and no longer promoting long-term investment to satisfy future demand.\"369\n\nSee Total's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 880.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 881.\n\n***3.2 Specific Measures Complained of by Total and Their Impact***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nTotal identifies what it terms \"radical alterations\" of the existing regime for the power generation sector resulting from the various measures taken by Argentina through the SoE, which it submits constitute a breach of the BIT.\n\n286.\n\nTotal complains of the following measures:\n\n(i) the pesification of the spot price, and any other payments to which power generators were entitled, specifically the capacity payments and the payment of unsupplied energy, at a one to one rate; (ii) the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism in the power generation market through violation of the uniform rate rule and the introduction of a fixed price cap; and (iii) the \"refusal\" to pay power generators their dues even at the dramatically reduced values resulting from the measures,370 followed by the \u2018forced\u2019 conversion of Total\u2019s existing and future receivables (that CAMMESA is not able to pay) into participations in new power plants, *(i.e., \"Fondo para Inversiones Necesarias que Permitan Incrementar la Oferta de Energia El\u00e9ctrica en el Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista\",* hereinafter also \"FONINVEMEM\")\n\nThis list is contained in para. 33 of Total\u2019s Memorial. A more detailed description of the measures complained of and their specific impact is found in Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration, paras 104-116, 135-140, 180-198.\n\n287.\n\nAs to (i), the pesification of the spot price and of any other payments to which power generators are entitled (specifically the capacity payments and the payment of unsupplied energy) at a one to one rate was effected through SoE Resolution 2/02 based on the Emergency Law. In this respect, Total also complains about Article 8 of the Emergency Law and MoE Resolution 38/02 of April 9, 20 02371 in that they effected the pesification and freezing of electricity tariffs and, indirectly, led to the pesification of the wellhead natural gas price on which the price structure for electricity was based.372\n\nSee Exhibit C-25.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, paras. 46 and 50 ff.; Total\u2019s Memorial, paras 332 and 279; Request for Arbitration, paras 179-181; Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 209 where Total explains that \"Since (a) for the purpose of variable cost declarations, the cost of gas was subject to a ceiling equal to the gas reference price; and (b) this gas reference price was frozen and pesified by the Emergency Law and subsequently allowed to increase only incrementally and still remain far from their 2001 values, the spot price is now mainly determined by the artificially low gas reference price,...\". See also Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief para. 123(a), where Total points out that \"First, the ENARGAS price that served as a cap for the cost of gas that generators could declare was converted to pesos at a 1:1 nominal rate (\"pesification\") and frozen... \".\n\n288.\n\nAs to (ii), the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism in the power generation market occurred through the violation of the uniform rate rule and the introduction of a fixed price cap. This alteration was effected through the enactment of SoE Resolution 240/03. Furthermore, in 2006, the SoE enacted Resolution 1,281/06373*(Energia Plus* Program) to foster new investments in the sector. To this end, this resolution allowed new plants or upgrading of existing plants to receive higher capacity payments than the existing plants, which continued to receive capacity payments amounting to AR$12 per MW,374 thereby discriminating between existing and new capacity.\n\nSee Exhibit C-565.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, paras 97 ff.\n\n289.\n\nIn this respect, Total claims that, beginning in 2002, Argentina breached the following three basic principles of the Electricity Law, which Total regards as promises or commitments.375\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 881; Total\u2019 Memorial, paras. 206-345; Total\u2019s Reply, paras 330-345; LECG Report on Electricity, paras 3 and 46-100.\n\n290.\n\nFirst, Total says that generators no longer received a uniform rate, contrary to Article 36 of the Electricity Law *(\"tarifa uniforme\").* Total explains that the system under Article 36 was implemented (though this was not provided for explicitly in the law) by a uniform spot price (a \"monomic\" price that changed seasonally) that was equivalent to the variable costs of the marginal unit.376 Instead, under Resolution 240/03, the spot price was set by units of burning natural gas. Liquid-fuel (petrol) units which have higher variable costs, are not taken into account for setting the price for all units, so that the spot price is lower than it would have been under the initial system. Generators burning more expensive liquid fuel units receive additional \"transitory dispatch costs.\"377 As a result, generators are no longer paid the same price for the electricity that they produce.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 810 (f).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 809, 884-885, and footnote 933 at p. 304.\n\n291.\n\nSecond, Total submits that prices no longer reflect the economic cost of the system (also contrary to Article 36 of the Electricity Law). Total makes two arguments in this regard. Contrary to sound market pricing theory, the price is no longer set by the marginal plant.378 Further, the (highest) spot price, which previously were variable to reflect the risk of failure, has been capped at AR$120/MWh,379 thereby disregarding the \"risk of outages\",380 which previously was taken into account to encourage additional investments in capacity building through the \"risk of failure\" variable price. It is worth noting here that before the measures were taken, this price varied between US$120/MWh at lowest risk times and US$l,500/MWh at highest-risk times (see above paragraph 272). Moreover, Total says that this cap was below the variable costs of the marginal unit 40% of the time: thus it is an administrative price not reflecting the cost of the system.381 According to Total,\n\n\"[T]o make matters worse, ENARGAS\u2019s intervention to reduce artificially the price of gas [...] compounds the effect of Resolution 240/2003. Without this intervention, the free-market price of gas would be much higher. The spot price, which is based in large part on the price of gas most of the time (especially after Resolution 240/2003), would have been correspondingly higher.\"382\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 811, 891.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 892.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 892.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 822, 893-895 and table at p. 338. Witness Sruoga called by Argentina has explained that this cap was set to reflect the normal cost of a gas-burning plant and stated that the marginal cost was only exceptionally above this cap. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 896.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 898 (and also para. 899). As to this ENARGAS\u2019 intervention on the gas price, Total also refers to the arguments that support its claim related to the investments in exploration and production. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 694-695 as to the pesification of the reference price of gas and paras 695 ff. as to the freezing of the maximum reference price for the well-head price component of the gas tariffs.\n\n292.\n\nThird, Total submits that prices no longer \"reflect the cost that unsupplied energy represents for the community\", *i.e.,* no longer encourage investment in capacity to satisfy peak demand, and no longer promote long-term investments to satisfy future demand (with respect to the capacity payments). This concerns the \"capacity payments.\"383 That amount was set in 1994 at US$10/MW and remained at that level until the end of 2001. At the beginning of 2002, the capacity payments were pesified at a rate of one-to-one, from US$10/MW to AR$10/MW. The capacity payments were increased to AR$12/MW in July 2002,384 thus not compensating for the impact of the decrease of value in terms of US dollars due to the pesification,385 nor reflecting the actual economic and social cost of unsupplied energy for the community\"386.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 816.\n\nSee SoE Resolutions 246/02 of July 4, 2002 (Exhibit A RA 112) and 317/02 of July 4, 2002 (Exhibit C-425). By the enactment of these Resolutions, the SoE also changed the criteria according to which capacity payments had been calculated until then. The new method of calculating capacity payments de-linked capacity payments to the actual dispatch of electricity by each generator in the previous six months. According to these new criteria, each generator is remunerated for its individual capacity, regardless of whether it was actually dispatched. See LECG Report on Electricity, para 89 and footnote 113.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 817.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 816 ff. and 905 ff.\n\n293.\n\nThe third complaint by Total listed in paragraph 286 (iii) above concerns the \"refusal\" to pay power generators their dues even at the dramatically reduced values resulting from the implementation of the measures,387 and also the \"forced\" conversion of Total\u2019s existing and future receivables (that CAMMESA is not able to pay) into participations in new power plants (FONINVEMEM). Total explains that Resolution 943/03,388 reflects the inability of the Stabilization Fund389 to pay the amounts owed to the generators, since both past and future receivables would be paid only when the fund was able to do so, at a date that the SoE would determine in the future. According to Total and contrary to the arguments of Argentina,390 participation in FONINVEMEM was only on its face voluntary. It was the only way for generators to be paid 35% of their receivables while contributing to FONINVEMEM with, and thus potentially recovering, the other 65%.391 Moreover, according to Total, the fair valuation of those contributions in 2006 (pursuant to an independent valuation) amounted at most to only 50% or 60% of the nominal value corresponding to the receivables converted into contribution.392 The alternative would have been to suffer even greater losses since non-participating generators were to be paid at an uncertain date to be determined in the future by SoE.\n\nSee above para. 286.\n\nSoE Resolution 943/2003 of 27 November 2003, Exhibit A RA 150, discussed in Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para 934.\n\nAs to the Stabilization Fund, see above paras. 265-266.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para 231.\n\nPursuant to Resolution 406/03 and Resolution, 826/04 at Exhibit A AR 160. Total points out that HPDA and Central Puerto became the largest shareholders of the new plants because they were the largest power-generators in Argentina and thus the largest creditors of the Stabilization Fund. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 941.\n\nSee Direct Examination of J. Chambert-Loir, transcript, Day 3, 816, 5-17 and Exhibit C-554; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 937. In case of sale, the buyer might not be available to value the participation at more than 30%, ***ibidem*** and para. 970.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that from September 2003, CAMMESA was unable to pay generators for the electricity that they were supplying, since the tariffs paid by the consumers were not adequate to cover the payments owed by electricity distributors to the generators. In fact, since 2002 Argentina has been using the money accumulated in the Stabilization Fund to pay generators their dues and this fund has been depleted.393 Since the Stabilization Fund is in deficit, it became impossible to cover \"the difference between Prices and Charges invoiced to demand agents and, the amounts to be paid to creditors of the WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET (MEM)\"394 To cope with this problem, the SoE enacted Resolution 406/03 on September 8, 2003.395 On the one hand, this Resolution (Article 2) authorised CAMMESA to resort to the \"unified fund\" *(\"F'ondo Unificado\"),* to make it possible to access the necessary financial assistance pursuant to Section 5.7 of the Procedures.396 On the other hand, it established a temporary mechanism \"for the assignment of the scarce and insufficient resources to face the credits of the Wholesale Electric Market (WEM)...\" (Preamble, third paragraph). To this end, the same resolution set forth a priority system according to which CAMMESA had to make partial payments to generators for their sales of electricity in the spot market. According to the new system, CAMMESA had to first pay all generators (both thermal power and hydroelectric generators) their short-term variable costs and, in addition, to pay thermal units any \"transitory dispatch costs.\" Any funds available thereafter had to be assigned *pro rata* among all generators (Article 4(e)). However, because of the grave deficit of the stabilization and unified funds, the resolution provided that any generators\u2019 receivables that could not be covered by the limited cash available became a debt of the Stabilization Fund towards generators, which in turn became unsecured creditors thereof. As a result, according to Total and its experts, \"A total of AR$19.7 million is owed to Central Puerto and HPDA as \"sales credits\"397 and, practically, \"... the Government ended up withholding, through Cammesa, approximately 65% of the generator\u2019s gross margins.\"398 In addition, according to Article 5, on the one hand, all payments made to generators under this system entail \"the creditors\u2019 commitment to pay providers for the necessary fuel, inputs and human resources for the operation and maintenance...\"; on the other hand, CAMMESA and the SoE precluded generators from declaring that their units were unavailable due to the lack of funds necessary to operate, under penalty of withholding the payments due to them.399 Moreover, on November 27, 2003, Article 1 of SoE Resolution 943/03 qualified generators\u2019 receivables in two items:\n\n- \"one with certain due date, which is based on the available resources to face them, and\n\n- another one with uncertain due date, to be determined by the Secretary of Energy, according to the provisions of the corresponding rule.\"\n\nIn addition, the same Article made it clear that those receivables that would be paid at a date to be determined by the SoE \"do not constitute a liquid and payable debt according to the provisions of Article 819 of the Civil Code.\" Moreover, in July 2004, through SoE Resolution 712/04, Argentina created the FONINVEMEM to finance the building of two new generators.400 The building of these new generators, to be operational by 2007, was to be financed by generators, with \"voluntary\" contributions consisting of those receivables, to be paid at a date to be determined by the SoE that \"do not constitute a liquid and payable debt according to the provisions of Article 819 of the Civil Code,\" pursuant to SoE Resolutions 406/03 and 943/03.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 217 ff.; LECG Report on Electricity, para. 76 and footnote 89.\n\nSee SoE\u2019s Resolution 406/03, Preamble, second paragraph (Exhibit C-80).\n\n***Ibidem.***\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 218 and footnote 325, where Total points out that several successive loans were granted to the Stabilization Fund by a number of decrees: Decree 1,181/03 of December 5, 2003 (AR$150 million); Decree 365/04 of March 31, 2004 (AR$200 million); Decree 512/04 of April 27, 2004 (AR$200 million); Decree 962/04 of August 2, 2004 (AR$300 million); and Decree 1672/04 of December 7, 2004 (AR$300 million).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 219.\n\nSee LECG Report on Electricity, para. 76.\n\nIn this respect, see also LECG Report on Electricity, para. 77.\n\nSoE Resolution 712/04 at Exhibit C-218.\n\n295.\n\nAccording to the Preamble of Resolution 712/04, the creation of the FONINVEMEM aimed to add new capacity to Argentina\u2019s power generation sector and was made necessary by a number of facts. Among these were the \"constant increase in the demand of electricity due to the growth in the Argentine economy and the gas scarcity for the generation\" (eighth paragraph) as well as \"the evident financing difficulties for the sector\" (twelfth paragraph). This was due to the current situation in the MEM that made it impossible to resort to private capital. As the same Resolution acknowledges, the new system of allocation of payments to generators for their sales introduced by Resolutions 406/03 and 943/03 resulted in an accumulation \"of vast amounts of money\" (Preamble, fourth paragraph) being owed by the Stabilization Fund to generators; and at the same time, it allowed generators only to cover \"the Minimum Maintenance and Operation Costs\" (Preamble, fifth paragraph).\n\n296.\n\nIn order to carry out the two projected investments the SoE had to \"invite\" generators to make the contributions required more than once.401 As outlined above, Total explains that under Resolution 943/2003, both past and future receivables would be paid only when the fund was able to do so, at a date to be determined by the SoE in the future.402 Based on the above evidence, Total submits that through the aforementioned Resolutions, Argentina effected a \u2018forced\u2019 conversion of Total\u2019s existing and future receivables (that CAMMESA is not able to pay) into participation in new power plants (FONINVEMEM).\n\nSee SoE Resolution 826/04 dated 11 August 2004 (Exhibit C-223), Article 1; SoE Resolution 948/04, dated 20 September 2004, Article 1 (Exhibit C-477).\n\nSee above para. 293 ff.\n\n***4. BIT Breaches Alleged by Total***\n--------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nTotal claims that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3 of the BIT was breached by the measures discussed, since the obligation to provide such treatment protects investors against fundamental alterations of the regulatory framework on which they legitimately relied in making their investment. Total considers that the Electricity Law contained specific promises, and submits that, although a breach of domestic law does not in itself amount to a breach of international law in every case, here it does. The administration\u2019s failure to comply with fundamental investment framework frustrated Total\u2019s reasonable and legitimate expectations. At the same time, Total submits that the issue of whether Argentina had promised legislative stability and whether Total had reasonably assumed such stability is moot, because the Electricity Law had not been amended since its promulgation and Argentina had not observed it.403\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 962-966 referring to ***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina, supra***  note 29, paras 275-276 ***and*** ***LG&E v. Argentina, supra*** note 111, paras 133 and 139.\n\n298.\n\nTotal claims that the conduct of Argentina also breached the obligation found in Article 5(1) of the BIT that \"Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded... in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in Article 3 of this Agreement\", either as part of fair and equitable treatment or as a self standing obligation.404 Under this standard, according to Total, Argentina was required to take positive steps to protect Total\u2019s investments. Instead, Argentina did the very opposite. It adopted measures that directly contradicted the applicable statute (the Electricity Law) - fully aware that this would destroy Total\u2019s investments. Argentina\u2019s conduct - coercing Central Puerto and HPDA to accede to the terms of FONINVEMEM - further violates its duty under the Treaty.405\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 240 ff, 967 ff.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 969.\n\n299.\n\nAccording to Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration, through the various measures Argentina also failed to observe the obligation not to take measures equivalent to expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT and that of refraining from discriminating against Total (Article 4).406\n\nSee Request for Arbitration, paras. 229-232 and 233-238, respectively.\n\n300.\n\nIn its subsequent submissions, and specifically in its Post-Hearing Brief, Total focused only on the breaches of the fair and equitable treatment clause (Article 3 BIT)407 and of the duty to accord to foreign investments full security and protection under Article 5(1).408 For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will also deal with Total\u2019s claims under Article 4 and Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 961-966.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 967-971.\n\n***5. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n301.\n\nAs to the changes in the domestic regulation of electricity generation and market set up under the Electricity Law, Argentina denies that the modifications adopted by the SoE were in breach of the law and exceeded its competence. As mentioned above, Argentina maintains that the SoE had broad powers to regulate generation activities on grounds of general interest (see above at paragraph 250). The measures adopted from 2002 onwards complained of by Total were legitimate and reasonable in view of the economic and social reality affecting Argentina.409 The measures adopted in the power generation sector took into account the seriousness of the crisis and were proportionate to the changes that had taken place, such as increases in certain prices and the lack of certain inputs (e.g., natural gas since 2003). While respecting the legal regime established by the Electricity Law, the measures were effective in avoiding major interruption in electricity supply. In view of the above, Argentina submits that no breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has taken place. A foreign investor must anticipate that circumstances may change and accordingly, must take into account the possibility of normative modifications. Such transformations do not entail legal responsibility in the absence of specific commitments that Argentina did not stipulate.410\n\nSee Argentina Post-Hearing Brief, para. 352 ff.\n\nSee Argentina Post-Hearing Brief, para. 442-456. Argentina relies on ***Parkerings-Companiet v. Lithuania, supra***  note 260, para 332-333 and ***SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Gen\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines, supra*** note 187, para 121 : \"The host State must have assumed a legal obligation, and it must have been assumed ***vis-\u00e0-vis*** the specific investment - not as a matter of the application of some legal obligation of a general character.\"\n\n302.\n\nAs to the pesification of the capacity payments and other monetary parameters, Argentina submits that the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate that led to the pesification of the whole economy was reasonable and proportionate to the aims and to the context of these measures.411\n\nSee Argentina Post-Hearing Brief, para. 447.\n\n303.\n\nAs to the impact of its various measures on the rights invoked by Total under the BIT, Argentina submits that none constitute a breach thereof.\n\n***6. Damages Claimed by Total***\n---------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nDue to the total impact of the measures, the Claimant complains that it has suffered damages to its investment in HPDA and Central Puerto and that Argentina has to compensate it for these damages under the BIT regime. Using the discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method, Total\u2019s experts evaluated the damages suffered by Total to be in an amount of US$147.1 million for Total\u2019s investment in HPDA412 and US$235.4 for Total\u2019s investment in Central Puerto (corresponding to a total amount of US$382.5 million).413 Alternatively, to reflect Total\u2019s sale of its equity participations in November 2006, Total\u2019s experts have proposed to assess Total\u2019s damages in the power generation sector using the transaction approach. Under this method, Total\u2019s damages amount to US$215.4 as to its investment in HPDA and US$295.9 as to its investments in Central Puerto (corresponding to a total amount of US$511.3).414 Total contends that it has written off US$364.5 million in its financial statements in order to reflect the economic impact of the measures on the value of its participations in Central Puerto and HPDA.415 Total submits that \"absent Argentina\u2019s Measures, those participations would have been worth US$655 million at the time of the sale.\"416\n\nSee LECG Addendum on Damages, at p. 10.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, at p. 65.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, at p. 69. The higher amount of damages under the transaction approach is because Total\u2019s experts estimate the actual value of Total\u2019s shares in Central Puerto to be US$95 million and in HPDA as US$195 million, while Total sold its equity stakes in the two generators for US$35 and 145 million, respectively. See LECG Report on Damages, at p. 66.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 88 at p. 45. The Tribunal recalls that, in 2001, Total had spent a total amount of US$327.45 to acquire its two investments in HPDA and Central Puerto and had subscribed debt of approximately of US$177 million.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 98 and footnote 87 at p. 44-45, where Total has clarified that it also sold the debt subscribed in the two generators when it sold its shares in 2006. Total makes clear that it \"makes no claim in respect of those participations.\"\n\n***7. Evaluation of Total\u2019s Claim of Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***7.1 General Considerations***\n--------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nAs mentioned above, Total\u2019s claim as to HPDA and Central Puerto is based on Argentina\u2019s \"commitments\" regarding the stability of the electricity regime and Argentina\u2019s obligation to comply with the Electricity Law, upon which Total had legitimately relied when making its investments. Beyond the claim that Argentina\u2019s overall conduct in the sector from 2002 onwards breached its promises and commitments in violation of the BIT, Total alleges that the various measures which it challenges have specifically breached the BIT standards that it invokes.\n\n306.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will deal with each distinct claim of breach by Total, as set forth in paragraph 286 above, and thereafter examine these claims in their entirety. Before so proceeding, the Tribunal notes that Total relies heavily on the alleged breaches of the Electricity Law by the SoE, because it did not act as a \"fair regulator\" as it was supposed to do under the basic pricing rules of the Electricity Law (Article 36), which have remained unchanged: \"Argentina was committed to the stability of the pricing rules in the Electricity Law.\"417\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 858.\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates that a breach of the BIT can be found irrespective of a breach of domestic law, as Total itself recognizes. On the other hand, a breach of domestic law may entail a breach of international law.418 In any case, Total has not challenged the legality of the SoE administrative resolutions in Argentina nor has Total asked that the Tribunal decide these issues based on Argentina\u2019s law, notwithstanding the reference to Argentina\u2019s law in Article 8(4) of the BIT. Total states, moreover, that \"the Law could have been changed or abrogated. But it was not... It is still the controlling text. Argentina has not observed it.\"419\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, para. 962 Total submits that: \"[...] Although a breach of domestic law does not in itself amount to a breach of international law in every case, here it does.[... ]\"\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 965.\n\n308.\n\nTotal bases its claims on those commitments and promises of stability as the basis on which its legitimate expectations have been frustrated, pointing to previous case law that considered \"an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations of stability of the basic parameters of the operative regulatory framework\" as protected by the fair and equitable treatment obligation of a BIT.420\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 867-871 with reference to ***Sempra Energy International v. Argentina, supra***  note 189, para. 299: ***Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina, supra*** note 20, para. 107: ***Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador, supra*** 112, para. 183; ***MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. &*** ***MTD Chile S.A. v. Chile, supra*** note 96, para. 114. The Tribunal notes that not all of those quotations refer to factual or legal circumstances comparable to those at issue here.\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal has extensively discussed this issue, and the relevant concepts in general and as they present themselves under the Argentina-France BIT, when it applied them to Total\u2019s claim relating to TGN, so that there is no need for further discussion here. However, the Tribunal recalls briefly its basic considerations and conclusions above, namely that:\n\n(a) on the one hand, stability, predictability and consistency of legislation and regulation are important for investors in order to plan their investment, especially if their business plan extends over a number of years;421\n\n(b) on the other, signatories of BITs do not thereby relinquish their regulatory powers nor limit their prerogative to amend legislation in order to adapt it to change, new emerging needs and requests of their people in the normal exercise of their prerogatives and duties;422\n\n(c) the BIT between France and Argentina does not contain any reference to stability of the legal framework, not even in the preamble;423\n\n(d) the legal regime in force in the host country at the time of making the investment is not *per se* covered by a \"guarantee\" of stability due to the mere fact that the host country entered into a BIT with the country of the foreign investor. A specific provision in the BIT itself or some \"promise\" of the host State, are required to this effect so rendering such an expectation legitimate,;424\n\n(e) when relying on the concept of legitimate expectations, arbitral tribunals have often stressed that \"specific commitments\" limit the right of the host State to adapt the legal framework to changing circumstances. Representations made by the host State are enforceable and justify the investor\u2019s reliance only when they are made specifically to the particular investor;425\n\n(f) legislative provisions, regulations of a unilateral normative or administrative nature, not so specifically addressed, cannot be construed as specific commitments that would be shielded from subsequent changes to the applicable law. The Tribunal has found that this is the situation in the case of the Gas Regime applicable to TGN. The Tribunal notes that the various provisions of the Electricity Law set forth above and invoked by Total are not different as to the absence of specific promises. A similar view was expressed by Judge Higgins:\n\n\"In my view the right distinctions are here being drawn: governments may indeed need to be able to act qua governments and in the public interest. That fact will prevent specific performance (including restitution) from being granted against them. But that is not to liberate them from the obligation to compensate those with whom it has entered into specific arrangements. That is the reasonable place to strike the balance between the expectations of foreign investors and the *bona fide* needs of governments to act in the public interest.\"426\n\n(g) Absent such promises, changes to the regulatory framework applicable to capital intensive long term investments and the operation of utilities can be considered unfair if they are contrary to commonly recognized financial and economic principles of \"regulatory fairness\" or \"regulatory certainty\" applied to investments of that type (be they domestic or foreign);427\n\n(h) The host State\u2019s right to regulate domestic matters in the public interest has to be taken into consideration as well. Therefore the circumstances, reasons (importance and urgency of the public need pursued) and modalities (non-discrimination, due process, advance notice if possible and appropriate) for carrying out a change impacting negatively on a foreign investor\u2019s operations on the one hand, and the seriousness of the prejudice caused on the other hand, compared in accordance with a standard of reasonableness and proportionality, are relevant. Thus an evaluation of fairness must take into account the evolution of the host economy, the reasonableness of the normative changes challenged and their appropriateness in the light of a standard of reasonableness and proportionality;428 and\n\n(i) the conduct of the investor is also \"subjectively\" relevant since BITs \"are not insurance policies against bad business decisions.\"429\n\nSee above para. 114.\n\nSee above para. 115.\n\nSee above para. 116.\n\nSee above para. 117.\n\nSee above para. 119.\n\nSee Higgins, Taking of Property by the State: Recent Developments in International Law, (1982) Recueil Des Cours III, 338-339, quoted by Total (CL-189) in its Post-Hearing Brief para. 773.\n\nSee above para. 122.\n\nSee above para. 123.\n\nSee above para. 124.\n\n310.\n\nIn light of the above principles, the Tribunal does not agree with Total\u2019s argument that the legal regime (the pricing rules) that Argentina changed was the object of a \"promise\" by Argentina that was binding on Argentina, and on which Total was entitled to rely (\"legitimate expectations\") as a matter of international law. It is immaterial in this respect whether or not the \"radical\" changes in the Electricity Law regime that Total complains of are also in breach of Argentina\u2019s law and/or represent a use by SoE of its power in disregard of the Electricity Law.\n\n311.\n\nWith respect to \"capacity payments\", Article 36 of the Electricity Law does not explicitly provide for such payments; it is telling that the cost of unsupplied energy is an element considered in determining the uniform energy rate. Total submits the economic explanation that capacity payments are essential to ensure that: (i) upfront investments can be amortized; and (ii) new investments are made.430 Argentina\u2019s experts dispute this purpose.431 The Tribunal notes that the SoE\u2019s regulatory powers to fix a capacity payment are so broad that the authority could even abolish such payments. This was meant to happen in June 2001 (shortly before Total entered the electricity sector, convertibility was abandoned and the later enactment of measures challenged by Total) by Decree 804/01, later abrogated by Law 25,468, as pointed out by both parties.432\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 818.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 358 where Argentina submits that: \"Capacity payments were not created as a guaranty to cover capital or recovery costs of the investments, and such circumstance was acknowledged by Abdala at the Hearing: \u2018In addition, capacity payments of $4 are a significant departure from the commitments that the investors would have an opportunity to recover their investments. An opportunity is not a guarantee, but an opportunity\u2019 [...].\" In response, Total answers that the margins recognized by the spot price would be insufficient to make a return on investment by private operators and \"the capacity payment was an incentive to invest... \". (see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 119 and 122)\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 120 and Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 351.\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the rules concerning tariffs in the Gas Regime were not in the nature of specific commitments. In view of the freedom that States generally enjoy to amend their laws, laws could be changed in light of subsequent developments and needs. The Tribunal notes that the various provisions of the Electricity Law set forth above and invoked by Total are not different from a formal point of view from those invoked by Total in respect of the gas sector. They were and are regulation of a general nature, organizing a certain public interest sector in which private companies operate and setting forth the conditions of their operation. No guarantee of stability was included in those provisions. If anything, they were in many respects less rigid rules than those applicable to gas distribution. The Secretariat of Energy appears to have broader powers to regulate the electricity sector under the law than ENARGAS has for the gas sector. In light of the legal principles on which the Tribunal relied with respect to the TGN claim above, the changes made in the pricing structure, including specific parameters, are not *per se* in breach of promises or legitimate expectations of the investors.\n\n313.\n\nThis does not mean that any change or alteration of the regime, negatively affecting the operations of the private generators and their economic equilibrium, is shielded from the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard guaranteed by the BIT. The respect for economic equilibrium principle entails that, in normal situations and from a long term perspective, the private generators are able to cover their costs and make a return on their investment, while providing their services to the market and consumers as required under the Electricity Law. If this was not the case due to the changes made to the electricity pricing principles after 2002, Argentina would have breached its obligations under Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n314.\n\nTotal quotes a public statement by the head of ENRE in November 2000 to the effect that Argentina\u2019s legislation recognizes the long-term nature of the investments in electricity so that \"the companies should get a return on their capital investment such that it will guarantee maintenance of the infrastructure required to provide the service.\"433 This is a relevant acknowledgment of a standard of treatment that conforms to sound management principles for the electricity sector for evaluating subsequent changes. This statement does not elevate, however, the specific pricing rules in the Electricity Law to an express commitment by Argentina on which Total could base legitimate expectations.434 Moreover, what Total labels as \"pricing rules\" are better defined as \"principles\", as textually mentioned in Article 35.2 of the Electricity Law *(\" atendiendo a los siguentes principios*...\"), concerning not just prices but a regulatory method of calculation of tariffs (Article 36.1).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 836.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 828 and 854.\n\n***7.2 Evaluation of Specific Measures***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*7.2.1 The pesification of the capacity payments and of the spot price*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe specific change relating to capacity payments about which Total complains is basically their redenomination in Argentine pesos, which transformed the US$10/MW rate to AR$10 (equivalent to US$4), subsequently increasing to AR$12.435 Another effect of pesification complained of by Total is that the spot price was indirectly affected by pesification of gas tariffs in that \"the ENARGAS price that served as a cap for the cost of gas that generators could declare was converted to pesos at a 1:1 nominal rate (\"pesification\") and frozen.\"436\n\nSee Total's Post-Hearing Brief, paras 123 and 910 ff. with reference to Resolution 2/02 of 14 March 2002 at Exhibit C-81.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123(a). See also above para. 287.\n\n316.\n\nThese changes resulted in a consistent reduction in dollar terms of those prices as a direct consequence of Argentina\u2019s abandonment of the free convertibility system at par with the dollar at the end of 2001 - beginning of 2002 in response to the major economic crisis that the country was then facing. The reasons for and the way in which the convertibility regime was abandoned are well known and have been described above.437 Values expressed in dollars, into which the peso had until then been freely changeable at a 1:1 rate, were converted into pesos at that same par value (and not readjusted according to the devaluated free exchange rate of the peso against the dollar, except partially for bank deposits). Values expressed in pesos remained so expressed since the peso was and remained the official currency of Argentina. It is therefore inaccurate to describe the process as the result of a \"decision to reduce the capacity payment rate by 60% without any justification\" as Total asserts, quoting its expert Dr. Abdala.438 The Tribunal recognizes at the same time that the subsequent increase of the capacity payment in June 2002 (from AR$10 to AR$12), which was not, however, followed by any further adjustment, reflected an administrative decision by the SoE. The grounds for this decision have not been explained by Argentina in these proceedings.439 On the other hand, as pointed out above at paragraph 270, the amount of the capacity payment was not legally linked to any definite parameter.\n\nSee above paras 71-79.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 911.\n\nSee in this respect Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 1056 at p. 346 quoting Mr.Adbala\u2019s testimony. (Transcript (English) Day 5, 1352:7-1353:7)\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal has already explained why the abolition of the convertibility of pesos assets, value and tariffs, which were interchangeable with their expression in dollars (the dollar being in free circulation in Argentina, accounts being freely available in dollars, etc.) under the convertibility regime, was within the competence of Argentina and not barred by the BIT clauses invoked by Total. The Tribunal has also justified its conclusion that even tariffs specifically fixed in U.S. dollars and the periodic readjustments to be made based on a U.S. price index (PPI) could be pesified in the circumstances at issue without breaching the BIT. This is because of the major economic, monetary and social crisis that forced Argentina to cease pegging the peso to the dollar. The Tribunal has found that the pesification affected all sectors of the economy and was carried out in a non-discriminatory way.440\n\nSee above paras 159-165.\n\n318.\n\nThat reasoning is also applicable in respect of the values, parameters and prices prescribed in the electricity system. If anything, reliance on the continuous application of dollar values or re-valued equivalent values in pesos was even less tenable in this sector for the following reasons.\n\n319.\n\nFirst, there was no legal provision mandating that the prices and parameters on which Total relies be expressed in dollars and/or linked to foreign parameters (such as the link to the US PPI in respect of gas transport tariffs). In fact, Total does not suggest the contrary. The evidence indeed shows that it was common practice under the convertibility regime for peso and dollar currency denominations to be interchangeable. Accordingly, the denomination of a price or parameter in pesos rather than in dollars did not signal that a different regime was being applied.\"441\n\nMost values set forth or fixed under the Procedures (Resolution 61/92) are expressed in pesos, as evidenced either by the use of the symbol or of the word \"pesos\". Some values are expressed in dollars (such as by using \"u$s\"). More precisely, sometimes in the Procedures the same value expressed in pesos is later referred to with the symbol of u$s. Compare Article 33 of Resolution 61/92, where capacity payment is expressed in pesos (5 $ (cinco pesos) per MWh), with Section 2.4.2.1 of Resolution 137/ 92, where the same value is expressed at p. 72 in US dollars (5 u$s/Mw hfv). Similarly, compare Article 34 of Resolution 61/92, where the ***\"Costo de la Energia no Suministrada\"*** is fixed at \"0,75 $ (setenta y cinco centavos) por KILOVATIO-HORA\", with Section 2.4.2.4 of Resolution 137/92, where the same amount is expressed at p. 74 in u$s. This confirms that under the general convertibility regime no difference was made in referring to one or the other currency that were for all purposes interchangeable.\n\n320.\n\nThus Total\u2019s reference to individual elements of electricity prices that were specifically expressed in dollars is not supported by the evidence. Nor has Total pointed to particular features of such elements that would justify them being shielded from the devaluation and the abandonment of the convertibility regime.\n\n321.\n\nSecondly, the monetary values determined by and used in the electricity law, such as the capacity payment, the variable spot price, the monomic price and the caps were applicable across the electricity sector to all generators, other entities and consumers. It is difficult to see how Argentina - even if it had wished to do so -could have maintained unchanged the previous values and prices in dollars in favour of some foreign-owned generators only. Even more so since some of those values were in turn derived from the costs of components produced in other sectors of the economy (such as the gas and other reference prices used in the calculation of the costs of the generators).\n\n322.\n\nAdditionally, Total\u2019s claim must be evaluated in the light of the \"subjective\" conduct of Total in making its investment. It is uncontested that Total acquired its shares in the two generators in September 2001. It is common knowledge, supported by the parties\u2019 exhibits in the present case, that at that date the economic and financial troubles of Argentina were already substantial; they were of domestic and international concern, not just within the business community and financial circles. This was just a few months before the explosion of the crisis and the ensuing currency devaluation, the enactment of the Emergency Law and the abandonment of the convertibility regime. The deterioration had accelerated in the first half of the year, with the abrupt replacements of the Minister of Economy and the Governor of the Central Bank, the modification of the peso\u2019s parity regime, and a major international bond swap. The assistance of the IMF under a Stand-By Arrangement launched at the beginning of the year had increased, notwithstanding growing doubts both about the ability of Argentina to respect the agreed upon conditions and the sustainability of the convertibility regime that the program was meant to support. When Total made its investment in Argentina, the country was suffering from a sustained capital flight (which would have almost completely drained the country\u2019s reserves within another few weeks) and foreign investors were taking measures to protect the monetary value of their funds in Argentina.442\n\nSee IMF, ***Lessons from the Crisis, supra*** note 53, 35-38, and Appendix II, Chronology of Key Developments in 2001-2 pointing to the lowering of Argentina\u2019s debt rating between July and October 2001. For an account of the development of Argentina\u2019s crisis in 2001 see above paras. 71-79 and sources quoted there. On capital flight from July 2001, see IMF ***Evaluation Report, supra*** note 53, 5, 13, 50-51.\n\n323.\n\nIn view of this context, it cannot be overlooked that Total made a long term investment in Argentina, of more than US$300 million, at a moment where the maintenance of the convertibility of the pesos with the US dollar at par was being put in doubt, irrespective of the soundness of the operation from an electricity business point of view.443 On the one hand, as Total points out, the specific legal regime was well established and investor-friendly, when Total made its investment. On the other hand, the financial and currency conditions of Argentina had already deteriorated markedly and steadily throughout 2001. As stated by the IMF:\n\n\"[...] at the end of July, spreads between peso- and US dollar-denominated interest rates had reached 1,500-2,000 basis points, rendering the option of a zero deficit both increasingly unlikely and ineffective in maintaining the currency board. Indeed, the resumption, in July, of a large scale withdrawals of the deposits from Argentine banks were perhaps the clearest sign of the system\u2019s impending collapse absent any dramatic changes in economic policies or circumstances\"444\n\nTotal points out that electricity prices were at the time low because of over-capacity and that their increase had been forecasted following an expected increase in demand, so that the investment at that time made economically sense. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 841ff, with reference to the testimonies of Mr Abdala and Montmayeur. On the other hand Argentina submits that the situation described was due to the recession that was affecting the country\u2019s economy.\n\nSee IMF, ***Lessons from the Crisis, supra*** note 53, 36.\n\n324.\n\nThe possibility of abandoning the 1:1 fixed parity with the US dollar, which would have affected the value of Total\u2019s investments and its future revenues in dollar terms, should therefore have been taken into account by a prudent and experienced international investor such as Total. The Tribunal considers that this context should have influenced Total\u2019s expectations when making its investments.445\n\nThis may well have been the case and have been reflected in the price paid by Total (US$327.45 million for Central Puerto\u2019s and HPDA\u2019s shares) since this price amounts to a fraction of the but-for value of Total\u2019s shares in the aforementioned generators (US$655 million) calculated by Total\u2019s experts six years later at the end of 2006 (see above para. 304). The Tribunal notes that this but-for value of Total\u2019s investments at the end of 2006 did not include any consideration of the above context.\n\n*7.2 2 The Alteration of the Uniform Marginal Price Mechanism*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal has already described the alterations complained of by Total and their impact on the conduct of the generators\u2019 business (see above 286 ff). The main feature is the abandonment of the uniform spot price, which was based on the variable cost of the marginal unit (namely the least expensive producer excluded by CAMMESA from the merit order), in favour of a reference to the costs of the units burning natural gas. Moreover, a fixed cap of AR$120/MWh replaced the previous variable \"maximum price mechanism\" that reflected the anticipated cost of failure. According to Total, the new price mechanism did not reflect the economic cost of the system and made it impossible for generators to operate with a reasonable margin and to cover their investment costs.446 This is why, in 2002, both Central Puerto and HPDA defaulted on their foreign currency loans even though the amount of those loans was reasonable.447\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 911\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para 122 referring to the testimony of Dr. Montamayeur.\n\n326.\n\nAs to the general economic impact of the price changes (both spot and capacity), Total points out that there were shortages and a lack of new investments. This compelled Argentina to start importing electricity and, moreover, to resort to new programmes such as *Energia Plus* and the FONINVEMEM scheme in order to increase electricity supply.448\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 912 ff.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its findings that the various features of the price structure described by Total, which were in place when Total made its investments, were not the object of specific promises by Argentina. The law spells out the general principle that the uniform price should reflect the economic cost of the system. It does not directly provide that such price be determined by the mechanism of a spot price based on the marginal unit. It is conceivable that a different system might have equally respected the principle of the economic equilibrium allowing generators to cover their costs and make a reasonable return on their investment as mentioned in general terms at paragraph 313 above. This requirement would have been met had the spot price been fixed on the basis of the costs of the marginal unit (uniform marginal price mechanism), without a cap of AR$120, according to the principles in force in 2001 (since that mechanism was indisputably fair and no different fair mechanism had been put in place nor proposed by Argentina as an alternative benchmark).\n\n328.\n\nIt cannot be disputed however, that the pricing system the SoE progressively put in place after 2002 is at odds with those principles as spelled out in the Electricity Law, even leaving pesification out of consideration. After 2002, the market has been characterized by unreasonably low tariffs.449 These, in turn, have massively reduced the returns of the generators, barely permitting them to cover their variable costs, contrary to sound economic management principles for power generators operating within a regulated system of public utilities450. The low prices encouraged a substantial increase in consumption that could not be matched by a parallel increase in supply, since the producers could not finance new investments under the rigid administrative pricing system in place.451 The unsoundness of such a policy in light of practices generally followed in modem societies to ensure electricity supply, when this is left to private companies, is demonstrated by the subsequent lack of investment, power failures and the need to import electricity to Argentina (while the country was previously self-sufficient or even an exporter to neighbouring countries).452\n\nThe 2004 average price of residential electricity in Argentina was a fraction of prices in all industrial countries, around 20% of those in Germany, Japan, Italy; less than one third of those in France and the U.K.; and less than half of those in the US. In this regard, see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 133 and table therein from Energy Information Administration, 2007, Exhibit C-706. Total emphasizes that the price of electricity in Argentina was already one of the lowest in the world in 2001: new investments in the sector since 1992 had more than doubled installed capacity, had eliminated power shortages and had brought the prices steadily down to the benefit of consumers, see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 831-833 and tables there.\n\nAccording to Prof. Spiller and Dr Abdala, the current spot price is one third of the marginal cost, based on Cammesa figures, see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 123(a) and graphic therein. Moreover, the fixed price cap of AR$120/MWh operates 40% of the time. In this regard, see Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 123(c), 893-895 and graphic therein; LECG Report on Electricity, para. 73.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 877, based on the data contained in the LECG Report on Electricity that have not been challenged by Argentina: \"Argentina is on the brink of an energy crisis, as it was in the late 1980s. Electricity demand has grown 30% since 2002 [footnote 1015: Gallino and Sruoga, at para 66]; the economy has grown 8.8% annually [footnotel016:MoE, ***\"Informe Econ\u00f3mico\"*** A\u00f1o 2006, Exh. C-605, at 24.]; yet there has been no investment in new capacity\". Total contrasts this evolution with the situation from 1999 to 2001, when lower growth in the demand for electricity had been due to the reduction in GDP. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 847 referring to Abdala cross-examination, Transcript (English) Day 5, 1411:8-l412:11.\n\nSee Total\u2019s evidence mentioned supra at notes 442 and 444. The same evaluation has been expressed in the international press. See The Economist, August 23, 2008, 42-43 ***\"Argentina - Clouds gather again over the Pampas.\"***\n\n329.\n\nThe *Energia Plus* program and the FONINVEMEM scheme (to finance new generators through the use of unpaid receivables of existing generators) show that the pricing mechanisms put in place after 2002 were not economically sustainable. The Tribunal recalls that new electricity producers are to be remunerated at higher prices under the *Energia Plus* program so as to encourage new investments since existing generators lacked resources to expand due to the default of CAMMESA and the Stabilization Fund. This mechanism is in contrast with the principle of the uniform price, which should reflect the economic cost of the system and ensure that new investments are made according to the demand.453\n\nReference should be made not only to Article 36 but also to Article 2 (b) \"... foster investments for the purpose of guaranteeing the gas supply in the long term\" and (f) \"encourage private investments in production... ensuring market competitiveness where possible\" as recalled by Total in its Post-Hearing Brief, para. 879.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this situation, brought about by the SoE with full awareness of its negative impact on affected generators operating under sound economic principles, cannot be reconciled with the fair and equitable treatment standard of Article 3 of the BIT. As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that Argentina has violated the BIT in this respect.\n\n331.\n\nThe disregard of the basic principles of the Electricity Law is relevant irrespective of whether the changes introduced were in violation of Argentina\u2019s domestic legal system, an issue that the Tribunal does not need to resolve. This finding of unfairness is reinforced by the fact that the complete overhaul of the electricity regime established by the Electricity Law which remained on the books, was effected through acts of administrative authorities.\n\n332.\n\nThe security that a regime established by law offered to investors, who necessarily plan on a long-term basis, was thereby severely undermined. This evolution goes beyond the normal regulatory risk that could be anticipated under the Electricity Law since the SoE operated from 2002-2003 with \"unfettered discretion.\"454\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 849. This holds true regardless of the correctness or relevance of the distinction that Total emphasizes (at paras 849, 863 ff) between \"public interest sectors\" such as electricity generation, governed by free-market rules that limit regulatory discretion, and distribution, which Total describes as a tariff-based sector, where prices are completely regulated.\n\n333.\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT has been objectively breached by Argentina\u2019s actions, in view of their negative impact on the investment and their incompatibility with the criteria of economic rationality, public interest (after having duly considered the need for and responsibility of governments to cope with unforeseen events and exceptional circumstances), reasonableness and proportionality. A foreign investor is entitled to expect that a host state will follow those basic principles (which it has freely established by law) in administering a public interest sector that it has opened to long term foreign investments. Expectations based on such principles are reasonable and hence legitimate, even in the absence of specific promises by the government. Hence, the fair and equitable standard has been breached through the setting of prices that do not remunerate the investment made nor allow reasonable profit to be gained contrary to the principles governing the activities of privately owned generators under Argentina\u2019s own legal system. This is especially so in the utility or general interest sectors, which are subject to governmental regulation (be it light or strict), where operators cannot suspend the service, investments are made long term and exit/divestment is difficult.\n\n334.\n\nAn additional element that supports the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is the qualification of generators\u2019 rights under Electricity Law regime. Their right to respect for the price determination rules set forth under the Electricity Law have been considered \"acquired rights\" of property under Argentina\u2019s Constitution \"in a sector which, by operation of law, does not consist of a public service but a public interest activity\". These rules are \"the legal standards which should be considered to effectively determine administratively set prices.\"455\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 873 based on the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of Appeals of 11 March 2004 ***AGEERA c EN-PEN-Resol 8/02 SE y Otros s/Amparo Ley 16,986*** at Exhibit AL RA 215.\n\n335.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds further support for its conclusion in the terms of HPDA\u2019s concession. Article 56 of the concession grants a right of termination to the concessionaire in case of substantial modifications to the criteria for determining prices set forth in the Electricity Law, when those modifications are arbitrary and make performance too onerous \"under section 1198 of the Civil Code.\"456 The Tribunal is mindful that this provision is not directly applicable here. This is because HPDA has not acted on this clause in Argentina nor has Total invoked it directly. Still, the Tribunal considers it significant that radical changes in electricity pricing rendering the concessionaire\u2019s contractual obligation an \"excessively onerous performance\" would be a just cause for termination of the concession by the concessionaire. This provision shows that administrative authorities do not have such broad discretion to make radical changes to the system under the Electricity Law, as Argentina claims.\n\nSee above para. 277; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 856.\n\n*7.2.3 The \"Refusal \" to Pay Power Generators Their Receivables and the Conversion of Receivables Into a Stake in FONINVEMEM*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Total that the measures discussed at paragraph 293 ff. resulted in a *de facto* refusal by Argentina to pay power generators their receivables, even at the reduced values resulting from the measures.\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Argentina\u2019s argument that generators who decided to participate in FONINVEMEM (among those Total\u2019s generators) did so on a voluntary basis. On the contrary, based on the evidence submitted, the Tribunal agrees with Total that the conversion offered by Argentina as of August 11, 2004 cannot be defined as \"voluntary\". If not \"forced\", it was certainly strongly induced by putting generators in a situation where they had no choice other than to accept the scheme or otherwise risk suffering higher losses. First, generators were faced with a situation in which the institution (CAMMESA), which was appointed by the public regulator to manage the market efficiently, was unable to pay for the electricity produced and distributed to consumers because consumers were charged an insufficient tariff. Second, the generators were put in the position of choosing either to contribute 65% of their past and future receivables to FONINVEMEM and become shareholders of the generators that were to be built with the corresponding funds, or to hold unpaid receivables, payment of which was legally and factually uncertain in regards to when, how, and how much would be paid.457\n\nSee SoE Resolution 826/04, Preamble seventh paragraph (Exhibit C-223). In its Post-Hearing Brief Total points out at para. 970 (b) that under the subsequent SoE Resolution 1,193/05 (Exhibit A RA 288) \"the Government ultimately used the receivables of those generators that refused to participate to FONINVEMEM to finance the construction of the two new plants, and prevented them from becoming shareholders in the new plants.\"\n\n338.\n\nThis scheme must be considered as a kind of forced, inequitable, debt-for-equity swap, not due to unfavourable market conditions or a company\u2019s crisis (as is usually the premise of such swaps in the private market), but due to governmental policy and conduct by Argentina. As such, in the view of the Tribunal it represents a clear breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation of the BIT for which Argentina is liable to pay damages. The liability of Argentina is not excluded by the fact that the shares resulting from the conversion have a market value as adduced by Argentina, since the generators have been or are being installed. The determination of the value of these shares is relevant to the valuation of damages and will have to be taken into account in the quantum phase.\n\n***8. Consequences of the Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Total\u2019s Claim for Damages***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nIn view of the above findings, the calculation of damages proffered by Total cannot be accepted by the Tribunal since the ambit and basis of the breach found here is different and considerably more limited than that assumed by Total. A quantum phase is, therefore, necessary for the parties to elaborate and document their respective positions as to damages. More specifically, the quantum phase shall deal with the determination of the losses suffered by Total because of the negative impact of Argentina\u2019s actions on HPDA and Central Puerto that have been found to be in breach of the BIT.458\n\nThis includes determining the proper \"but for scenario\", the actual scenario and the possible influence of both the purchase price paid by Total in 2001 and the sale price of its equity stakes in Central Puerto and HPDA at the end of 2006.\n\n***9. Examination of Total\u2019s Claims under Articles 4, 5(1) and 5(2) of the BIT***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Total\u2019s claim concerning the pesification of the capacity payments and the spot price does not involve a breach of the expropriation and full security standards, since the conclusion above at paragraphs 315-324 was that the pesification was a lawful measure by Argentina in the circumstances. As to Total\u2019s claim regarding the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism, which the Tribunal has in large part accepted at paragraphs 325-335, the findings of breach were based on the unfairness of Argentina\u2019s conduct.\n\n341.\n\nAs is evident from the analysis above, the various measures did not amount to, nor entail an expropriation of Total\u2019s investments in the power generation sector in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT notwithstanding that they resulted in a consistent decrease in value of the assets due to decreased revenues caused by the actions of Argentina\u2019s authorities in the sector. This is because, as the Tribunal has clarified at paragraph 191 ff. above, the mere loss of value of an investment due to host State measures without deprivation of control is not a sufficient basis to find an unlawful indirect expropriation. This conclusion is reinforced in view of the text of Argentina-France BIT, as stated at paragraph 194.\n\n342.\n\nThe \"refusal\" to pay power generators their dues and the forced conversion of receivables into participation in FONINVEMEM, which the Tribunal has found in breach of Article 3 of the BIT, might be considered also an expropriation in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal believes, however, that damages under a finding of expropriation would not be different from those to be determined in the quantum phase under the finding of breach of the fair and equitable standard made above at paragraph 339 so that the Tribunal finds unnecessary to examine Argentina\u2019s conduct further under Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n343.\n\nUnder Article 5(1) of the BIT investments made by nationals of one Party in the territory of the other Party benefit from full protection and security in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment in Article 3 of the BIT (In the Spanish version of the BIT: *\"protecci\u00f3n y plena seguridad en aplicaci\u00f3n del principio del tratamiento justo y equitativo mencionado en el articulo 3 del presente Acuerd\u00f3\".* In the French version of the BIT: *\"d\u2019une protection et d\u2019une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pleines et enti\u00e8res, en application du principe de traitement juste et \u00e9quitable mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 du pr\u00e9sent Accord\").* A plain reading of the terms used in Article 5(1) of the BIT, in accordance with Article 31 VCLT, shows that the protection provided for by Article 5(1) to covered investors and their assets is not limited to physical protection but includes also legal security. The explicit linkage of this standard to the fair and equitable treatment standard supports this interpretation. This appears to be consistent with the interpretation of differently worded BIT clauses adopted by other tribunals, even if not uniformly.459 Total\u2019s claim under Article 5(1) is rooted in the alleged violation by Argentina of its obligation to extend legal security (rather than physical protection) to Total\u2019s investments.460 As already outlined above, the regime for generators established by Argentina after 2002 was characterized by a marked difference between the principles in the Electricity Law and the regulation resulting from SoE enactments, so that, according to Total, Argentina breached also its duty to grant to Total\u2019s investments legal security and protection. Argentina opposes this argument and points to the broad powers granted to the SoE under Argentina\u2019s legal system. The Tribunal is of the view that an analysis in depth of Total\u2019s claim under Article 5(1) of the BIT is unnecessary. In fact, the obligation set forth in Article 5(1) forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard, so that a finding of breach of that obligation would form part of the breach of Article 3 rather than be an independent finding of breach. The Tribunal has already found such a breach in respect of the same facts so that no additional finding of breach of Article 5(1) is warranted. Moreover, no further damages would result from following a different approach.\n\nSee ***supra*** note 113.\n\nSee above at paras 279-284.\n\n344.\n\nFinally, as to the prohibition of discrimination in Article 4 of the BIT, Total has emphasized that the severe limitations on the price of electricity were imposed by Argentina in order to subsidize other sectors of the economy, including the export industry, at the cost of the generators. This may well be the case, but such a policy would not *per se* represent a breach of the non-discrimination standard. This standard requires, as a rule, a comparison between the treatment of different investments, usually within a given sector, of different national origin or ownership, as stated above in respect of the TGN claim.460 The purpose is to ascertain whether the protected investments have been treated worse without any justification, specifically because of their foreign nationality. The similarity of the investments compared and of their operations is a precondition for a fruitful comparison. The alleged crosssector subsidisation does not comply with such a condition. Such a policy choice should clearly be made at the expense of foreign investors in order to breach Article 4.461*In casu,* Total has not shown that its power generators were treated differently from others, nor specifically that this would have reflected a nationality bias. This claim cannot therefore be accepted.\n\nSee ***supra*** para. 210 ff.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Total has not shown a ***prima facie*** case of discrimination based on foreign nationality as to the power generation sector.\n\n***10. Argentina\u2019s State of Necessity Defence***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nBefore concluding, the Tribunal must address the plea of Argentina based on the defence of \"state of necessity\" under customary international law in order to excuse its breaches of the BIT found by the Tribunal in respect of Total\u2019s investments in power generation. The Tribunal recalls in this respect its analysis of the issue in respect of Total\u2019s TGN claim, and specifically the rigorous conditions that are required to sustain such a defence in light of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.462 In respect of Total\u2019s claim concerning its investments in power generation, the Tribunal has found the pesification of capacity payments, spot price and any other parameters and/or values prescribed in the electricity system not to be in breach of the BIT. On the contrary, the Tribunal has found the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism (discussed at paragraph 325 ff. above) and the refusal to pay power generators their receivables and their conversion into a stake in FONINVEMEM (discussed at paragraph 336 ff. above) to be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. As a consequence, the Tribunal must address Argentina\u2019s state of necessity defence in respect of these two measures only. The above analysis of the electricity sector in Argentina from 2002 onward clearly shows that the infringing measures were in no way necessary to safeguard Argentina\u2019s essential security interests in preserving its people and their security of energy supply. More specifically, Argentina has not shown that the alteration of the price mechanism to the detriment of generators was necessary to ensure the supply of energy. On the contrary, the Tribunal recalls its finding (at paragraph 328) that the pricing system that the SoE put in place after 2002 resulted in unreasonably low tariff and encouraged a substantial increase in consumption that could not be covered. This caused shortages in the supply of electricity and power cuts to the detriment of the entire population and economy, exactly the opposite of safeguarding \"an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril\", as required by Article 25.1(a). In any case, even accepting Argentina\u2019s position as to the existence of a grave and imminent threat to its essential interest in ensuring electricity at affordable prices, the above pricing mechanism was not \"the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril.\" (Article 25.1(a)). As pointed out by Total, alternatives not in breach of the BIT, such as targeted subsidies, were available to Argentina in order to keep electricity tariffs at affordable levels for consumers in need.463 As to the non payment of the generators\u2019 receivables and their forced conversion, Argentina has not explained nor provided any evidence as to which essential interest was being safeguarded by the measures.. The Tribunal recalls that the inability of CAMMESA to pay the electricity supplied by generators was due to CAMMESA\u2019s insufficient revenues which has been caused, in turn, by the pricing mechanism established by the SoE after 2002. Since the receivables of generators were caused by Argentina\u2019s conduct in breach of the BIT, and were not justified by necessity, their subsequent forced conversion cannot be justified either. In any case, this forced conversion took place in 2004 when Argentina was not facing any \"imminent and grave peril\" to its essential interest. The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Argentina\u2019s defence based on the state of necessity under customary international is groundless.\n\nSee para. 220 ff. above.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 1047 ff.\n\n***11. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions as to Total\u2019s Claims in Power Generation***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal, based on the above reasoning and findings,\n\n- concludes that Argentina has breached its obligations under Article 3 of the BIT to grant to Total fair and equitable treatment, in respect and as a consequence of:\n\n(a) the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism, as specified in the preceding paragraphs;\n\n(b) the non-payment of receivables arising from energy supplied in the spot market by HPDA and Central Puerto and the conversion of such receivables into shares in new generators under the FONINVEMEM scheme.\n\n- concludes that the damages thereby suffered by Total must be indemnified/compensated by Argentina in the amount to be determined in a separate quantum phase of these proceedings;\n\n- rejects all other claims by Total related to its investment in HPDA and Central Puerto under Articles 4 and 5 of the BIT;\n\n- defers the determination of the above damages to the quantum phase; and\n\n- rejects any other plea and defences by Argentina, including those premised on the \"state of necessity.\"\n\n***Part IV- Total\u2019s Claim as to its Investments in Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Total\u2019s Investments in Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nTotal\u2019s original investment in Argentina was with respect to the exploration and development of an area in and around the Austral Basin in Tierra del Fuego known as Area 1 De La Cuenca Austral, also known as Cuenca Marina Austral - 1 (\"CMA-1\"). The terms of Total\u2019s investment were set out in a contract between *Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Sociedad del Estado* (\"YPF\") and Total Exploration S.A. and its other Consortium members who had been successful in the competitive bidding process for the contract. The *Contrato Para La Exploraci\u00f3n y Explotaci\u00f3n Del Area No. 1 De La Cuenca Austral - Tierra del Fuego* (\"Contract 19,944\") was approved by Decree 2853/78, dated 1 December, 1978. It was executed on 24 April, 1979.464 Pursuant to the terms of Contract 19,944, the Consortium was required to explore and develop CMA-1. In exchange, YPF was required to buy all of the hydrocarbons the Consortium extracted (including crude oil and natural gas) at a price calculated on the basis of free-market prices as reflected by the price of Nigerian bonny light crude oil.465\n\nSee Exhibits C-63(1) and C-63(2). At the time of the award of Contract 19,942, the members of the consortium (the \"Consortium\") were Total Exploration S.A., Deminex Deutsche Erdoelversorgungsgesellschaft mbh, Bridas S.A.P.I.C. and Arfranco S.A. As described by Total\u2019s witnesses, the composition of the Consortium changed somewhat over time. Total\u2019s investment came to be held by Total Austral S.A. In July 1999, Deminex changed its name to Wintershall Energia S.A. In 1998, after a reorganization process, Bridas, which had previously acquired Arfranco\u2019s interest, transferred its rights in the Consortium to Panamerican Sur SRL, a joint venture between Bridas (40%) and Amoco, now BP Amoco (60%); see Contie WS1, para. 13. The respective interests in the Consortium for the purposes of this arbitration are: Total 37.5%; Deminex 37.5%; and Panamerican 25%.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 126 and the sources cited there; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 626-628; Contie WS1, Tfl 5. Pursuant to the Contract, YPF was required to calculate the energy equivalent in natural gas of a barrel of Nigerian bonny light crude oil and then pay the Consortium the portion of that price necessary to generate one million BTUs of natural gas.\n\n348.\n\nContract 19,944 was approved by Decree 2853/78 pursuant to Article 98(g) of the *Ley de Hidrocarburos,* Law No. 17,319, adopted on 23 June, 1967.466 Pursuant to that law, the National Executive Power was responsible for setting national policy with respect to the exploitation, industrialization, transport and commercialization of hydrocarbons and had the power to grant exploration permits and concessions for the exploitation and transportation of hydrocarbons. Article 6 of the *Ley de Hidrocarburos* provided as follows:\n\n*Art. 6.* Permit holders and concessionaires shall have ownership of the hydrocarbons which they extract and, consequently, they shall be able to transport, sell and industrialize them pursuant to the regulations adopted by the National Executive on reasonable technical-economical bases which addressed the needs of the internal market and stimulated exploration and production of hydrocarbons. When national production of liquid hydrocarbons is not sufficient to cover internal needs it shall be mandatory for all such hydrocarbons of national origin to be used in the country, except where legitimate technical reasons make this unadvisable. Consequently, new refineries or extensions shall adapt to the rational use of national petroleum.  \n If, in the said period, the Executive set the sale prices for crude petroleum products in the internal market, such prices shall be equal to those established for the relevant State company, but, in any event, they shall not be less than the prices for imported petroleum of similar condition. In the event the price of imported petroleum increases significantly due to exceptional circumstances, those prices are not to be considered for the setting of sale prices in the internal market. Rather, the latter could be set on the basis of the actual cost of production of the State company, the technically applicable depreciation rate and a reasonable rate of return on the investments made by the said State entity. Any prices fixed for sub-products were required to be compatible with those set for petroleum.  \n The Executive shall permit the export of hydrocarbons or derivatives not required to adequately meet internal needs, provided that such exports are carried out at reasonable commercial prices. Further, the Executive is empowered to set rules for the internal market in order to ensure rational and equitable access to it by all producers in the country.  \n Natural gas production may be used in the exploitation requirements of the fields extracting them and of other fields of the area, whether or not they belong to the concessionaire and pursuant to the provisions in Article 31. The State company rendering public gas distribution services shall have preference for acquiring, within the acceptable terms, the amounts exceeding the prior use for agreed upon prices, which ensure a fair rate of return of the corresponding investment, considering the special characteristics and conditions of the field.  \n With the approval of the applicable authority, the concessionaire shall decide the destination and the availability conditions of gas which is not used in the previously indicated form.  \n The commercialization and distribution of gas hydrocarbons is subject to the regulations of the National Executive.\n\nSee Exhibit C-64.\n\n349.\n\nWhen Total and the other Consortium members entered into Contract 19,944, Law 19,640 of 2 June, 1972 exempted exports from Tierra del Fuego from export taxes.467\n\nSee Exhibit C-292. Subsequently, the Customs Code confirmed the validity of the Tierra del Fuego exemption by providing for a distinction between general customs areas and confirming Tierra del Fuego\u2019s status as a special customs area. See Exhibit C-293.\n\n350.\n\nAfter Contract 19,944 was signed, Total conducted exploratory drilling and obtained positive results. In 1987, Total and the Consortium members arranged for US$250 million in financing to develop the main oil field in the CMA-1 region, Hi dra. Production from the Hi dra field commenced in July 1989. By the beginning of 1990, the Hi dra project consisted of two production platforms that produced approximately 27,000 barrels per day. In addition, following the discovery that there was a connection between another field in the CMA-1 area (the ARA Field) and an onshore field owned by YPF known as Canadon Alfa, YPF agreed to accord the Consortium the right to production in the Canadon Alfa Field according to the terms of Contract 19,944 (the \"Unitization Agreement\"). Total and the Consortium made substantial investments in the Canadon Alfa Field such that, by 1994, Canadon Alfa had 71 gas wells that, on average, delivered to YPF approximately 6.3 million cubic metres of natural gas per day.468 In 1993, Total announced the discovery of substantial additional offshore gas reserves.469\n\nSee, generally, Contie WS1, paras. 16-20.\n\nContie WS1, para. 21. This new discovery referred to reserves at drill sites named Carina, \"Carina e-3\" and \"Carina e-4\". These were similar to discoveries Total had made in the early 1980s at Carina e-1 and e-2.\n\n351.\n\nIn 1989, Argentina undertook a process of reform and privatization of many aspects of its economy. Argentina sought to increase private investment in the exploration, production and distribution of hydrocarbons, through privatization of YPF, the divestment of a number of YPF\u2019s concessions; the break-up and privatization of Gas del Estado and the creation of a concession system that provided for the production of hydrocarbons by private enterprises. These goals, among others, were implemented by way of a number of legislative measures.\n\n352.\n\nOne of the first steps taken by Argentina was the adoption of Decree 1212/89 which called for the renegotiation of existing contracts between foreign investors and YPF. Decree 1212/89 was intended to increase production of hydrocarbons and to support progressive deregulation; replace State intervention with free market mechanisms and the principle of free disposal of crude petroleum and its derivatives; permit the prices for hydrocarbon products of national origin to reflect international prices; and replace rules that limited the free commercialization of crude oil and its derivatives. Decree 1212/89 provided in relevant part as follows:\n\nArt. 3. EXTENSION OF THE FREE MARKET. *YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO* is hereby instructed to negotiate in a mutual agreement, within a term of six (6) months, with holders of pre-existent hydrocarbon extraction work, export and production contracts, whereby *YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO* is bound to receive the extracted hydrocarbons, the reconversion of said contracts into the concession system or association of the Law No. 17,319 and its regulations. In every case, the contracts reconversion shall be subject to the approval of the National Executive after the opinion issued by the Secretary of Energy.  \n The contracts emerging from the regime established by the Decree No. 1443/85, as amended by the Decree No. 623/87, shall be exempted from the aforementioned provisions. The Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services shall establish the policies governing said contracts in a term of one hundred and eighty (180) days, which policies shall be compatible with the principles established in the Decree No. 1055/89 herein.  \n After the six (6) months mentioned in the first paragraph in this article, *YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO* shall submit the proceedings to the Secretary of Energy, which shall propose the measures it considers adequate to the contractors in order to re-establish the financial economic balance. In case that is not possible and that there are justified public interest and/or fiscal reasons preventing the continuity of said contracts, the Secretary of Energy shall provide the legal measures that may be adopted to those ends.  \n \u2026  \n Art. 4. FREE AVAILABILITY. The oil produced by the new concessionaire and the percentage related to the private partner will be freely available as per Art. 15 of Decree No. 1055/89.  \n \u2026  \n Art. 6. FREE IMPORT AND EXPORT. Prior authorization is not needed for the import of crude oils and its by-products, which shall be exempt from import fees until the condition or term established in article 5 hereof is complied with.  \n As from that moment, the import of crude oil and its by-products shall be subject to the general fee policies.  \n For the export of crude oil and its by-products, the Secretary of Energy shall make a decision regarding the authorization of the export within a maximum term of seven (7) working days as from request, after which it shall be deemed automatically granted.  \n \u2026  \n Art. 9. PRICE FREEDOM. After the transition period, the price of oil will be agreed upon freely. The prices of all oil by-products at all the stages shall be freed.470\n\nSee Exhibit C-65(2).\n\n353.\n\nTwo other decrees were issued in conjunction with Decree 1212/89. These were Decrees 1055/89 and 1589/89.471 Together these Decrees were referred to collectively by the Claimant as the \"Deregulation Decrees\". Decree 1055/89 provided in relevant part as follows:\n\nWHEREAS:  \n\u2026  \n There are hydrocarbons fields operated by *YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO* where a low level of production is registered as a consequence of the long lasting inactivity and/or semi-exploitation state.  \n Such fields, for its marginality characteristic, require the application of an exploitation scheme that permits the active and direct participation of investments deriving from private capital for its reactivation and increase of production.  \n It is also necessary, in those fields operated by *YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO* registering a greater level of production, to achieve a better recovery of the resource applying assisted production techniques.  \n Such techniques require the contribution of modem technology and financial-economic capacity concurring to the development of the fields together with *YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO.*  \n \u2026  \n The objective of the national Government is to replace State intervention in the setting of prices, margins and quotas with market mechanisms and the free play of offer and demand.  \n It is the Government\u2019s policy to deregulate the sector to permit effective and free competition as quickly as possible in order to reflect international values and, therefore, it was necessary to permit the free disposition of hydrocarbons both in the internal market and the export market.  \n Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Law No. 23,696 and sections 2, 6, 11, 95 and 98 of the Law No. 17,319 confer related powers to the National Executive.  \n \u2026  \n Article 1. Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Law 23,696 and articles 2, 6, 11, 95 and 98 of the Law No. 17,319 are regulatory. The promotion, development and execution of plans intended to increase the national production of liquid and gas hydrocarbons, including its by-products, are of top priority need in order to ensure the internal self-supply and an adequate margin of reserves, to reach the full development of the petrochemical industries and to obtain exportable balances, giving privilege to the industrialization of the resources in their place of origin.  \n \u2026  \n Art. 14. FULL RIGHT OF DISPOSITION OF HYDROCARBONS. Hydrocarbons produced from concessions governed by the National Mining Code would benefit from a full right of free disposition, as from the one hundred and eighty (180) days from the due date hereof.  \n Art. 15. The free availability of hydrocarbons referred to in sections 5(d), 13 and 14 of this Decree, shall be governed by the following provisions:  \n a) The products can be sold freely in the internal and the external markets, within the terms of the applicable legal framework  \n b) The companies shall be ensured access to the systems and means of treatment, movement, storage, and dispatch at rates compatible with international prices.  \n c) The payment of royalties on freely available hydrocarbons shall be borne by the companies, in conformity with the provisions set by the SECRETARY OF ENERGY.472\n\nSee Exhibits C-65(1) and C-65(3).\n\nDecree 1055/89, Exhibit C-65(1).\n\n354.\n\nDecree 1589/89 provided in relevant part as follows:\n\nWHEREAS:\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Decree No. 1212/89 exempted the contracts deriving from the regime of the Decree No. 1443/85, as amended by Decree No. 523/87 from the regime, and established that the Ministry of Economy, Public Works and Services shall set the polices for such contracts, in a compatible way with the principles established in the Decree No. 1055/89, setting a term of one hundred eighty (180) days to those ends.\n\nThe Government has an interest in establishing clear and definite rules which guarantee the stability and legal security of existing contracts in the petroleum sector.\n\n\u2026\n\nArt. 3. EXPORT AND IMPORT OF HYDROCARBONS: The export and import of hydrocarbons and its by-products is hereby authorised, which will be exempt from any present or future tariffs, rights or duties. They shall not be entitled to any present or future reimbursements or rebates, falling due as from the effectiveness of the current decree.\n\nThe export documentation shall be authorised with as provided for in article 6(2) of Decree No. 1212/89. The related requests may relate to singular transactions or term exports programs which, in the case of liquid hydrocarbons, may not exceed 1 (one) year.\n\n\u2026\n\nArt. 5. ON THE FREE AVAILABILITY: The producers with free availability of crude oil, natural gas and/or liquefied gases as defined in articles 6 and 94 of Law 17319, 14 and 15 of Decree No. 1055/1989, articles 3 and 4 of Decree 1212/1989 and the producer that agree thus in the future shall have the free availability of currencies established in the competitive biddings and/or renegotiations, or agreed upon in the related contracts, whether the hydrocarbons are exported, in which case they would not have to bring into the country the foreign currency related to such percentage or are sold on the domestic market, in which case they will be entitled to the foreign currency related to such percentage. In all the cases, the maximum freely available percentage on the free foreign exchange market may not exceed 70% (seventy percent) of the value of each transaction.\n\nArt. 6. ON EXPORT RESTRICTIONS: In the event the National Executive proceeds to establish on the exportation of crude petroleum and/or its derivatives, Article 6 of the Law No. 17,319 shall become enforceable, by virtue of which producers, refiners, and exporters shall receive, per product unit, an amount not less than that of petroleum, and derivatives of a similar nature.\n\nIn the event of restrictions on the right of free availability of gas, the price of a thousand cubic meters (1,000 m3) of gas of nine thousand three hundred calories (9,300 kilocalories) shall not be less than thirty five per cent (35%) of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian Light petroleum of 34 API.\n\nThe National Executive shall notify the decision of restriction to exports of crude and/or other derivatives twelve (12) months before the restriction application date. For the purposes hereof, the currency equivalence shall be determined applying the rate of exchange established in Article 4 hereof.473\n\nDecree 1589/89, Exhibit C-65(3).\n\n355.\n\nIn 1991, Argentina adopted Decree 2411/91 (the \"Reconversion Decree\") which authorised YPF to renegotiate its service contracts that had been adopted under the previous legislative regime, including Contract 19,944, and to convert these into new agreements consisting of two parts: exploration permits and exploitation concessions. The Reconversion Decree specifically referred to the Deregulation Decrees, which established as guiding principles of the national government\u2019s policy for the hydrocarbon sector: the promotion of [free] market rules in fixing prices and [the production] quantities of hydrocarbons; and the right of free disposal and free commercialization, domestically and internationally, of the hydrocarbons produced by the concessionaires.474 With respect to the reconversion of the service contracts into concessions, the Reconversion Decree provided the following rights for the holders of the new concessions:\n\nArt. 5. Holders of the exploitation permits and concessions deriving from the reconversion provided for herein shall enjoy full property rights over hydrocarbons they produce in their areas, pursuant to Article 6 of the Law 17,319 and shall also enjoy the free availability of said products pursuant to Article 15 of the Decree No. 1055 dated 10 October, 1989; Article 4 of the Decree No. 1212, dated 8 November, 1989 and Articles 5 and 6 of the Decree No. 1589 dated 27 December, 1989, which terms are incorporated in the permit and/or concession title for its whole term of duration.\n\nArt. 6. Holders of the exploitation concessions deriving from the reconversion established herein, shall have the free availability of seventy per cent (70%) of the currency deriving from the commercialization of hydrocarbons extracted in the area, pursuant to the provisions of Article 5 of the Decree No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989, unless another rule authorizes a higher percentage or there is no obligation of entering the currency.\n\nArt. 7. Every restriction to the free availability referred to in the previous Articles shall empower concessionaires of the exploitation to receive, for the time of the restriction, a value that is not lower than the one established in Article 6 of the Decree No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989.\n\nArt. 8. The provisions established in Articles 5, 6 and 7 above shall apply to the exploration permits deriving from the reconversion set forth in this Decree.\n\nArt. 9. Holders of the exploration permits or exploitation concessions shall be subject to the applicable general fiscal legislation; the provisions that may be imposed in a discriminatory way on, or specifically in relation to the person, the judicial condition, or the activity of the permit holder or the assets intended for the execution of the respective areas shall not be applicable.\n\nPermit holders or concessionaires shall pay the fee established in Article 57 and 58 of the Law No. 17,319, as it may correspond.\n\nArt. 10. Concessionaires shall be responsible for the direct payment to the province where the concession they hold is located, on behalf of the National State, of the royalties resulting from the application of Articles 59 and 62 of the Law No. 17,319, paying up to twelve per cent (12%) of the production valued on the base of the prices effectively obtained in the operations of commercialization of hydrocarbons from that area, with the deductions established in Articles 61,62 and 63 of the Law No. 17,319.\n\n\u2026475\n\nSee Exhibit C-66, Preamble, which reads as follows:  \n Decree No. 1055, dated 10 October, 1989 and Decree No. 1212, dated 8 November, 1989, establish two governing principle of the National Government Policy for the hydrocarbons sector, to wit: the privilege conferred on the market rules in the determination of prices and amounts of hydrocarbons and its free availability on the part of the concessionaires, and the associates to the former ***YACIMIENTOS PETROL\u00cdFEROS FISCALES SOCIEDAD DEL ESTADO,*** which implies its free internal and international commercialization.\n\nExhibit C-66.\n\n356.\n\nIn 1992, Argentina adopted a new law regulating the transport and distribution of natural gas (the \"Gas Law\").476 The general goals of the new Gas Law were stated to be as follows:\n\nArt. 2. The following objectives for the national policy on electricity supply, transportation and distribution of natural gas are hereby established. They shall be executed and controlled by the ***Ente Nacional Regulador del Gas,*** created under Art. 50 hereof:\n\n(a) To adequately protect the rights of users;\n\n(b) To promote competition in the electricity production and demand markets, and to foster investments for the purpose of guaranteeing the gas supply in the long term;\n\n(c) To promote the operation, reliability, equality, free access, non-discrimination and widespread use of services and installation of electricity transportation and distribution;\n\n(d) To regulate activities connected with electricity transportation and distribution, by ensuring that applicable services be fair and reasonable;\n\n(e) To promote efficiency in the transport, storage, distribution and use of natural gas;\n\n(f) To promote the rational use of natural gas, looking after an adequate protection of the environment;\n\n(g) To intend that the price of the supply of natural gas to the industry be equivalent to the one in foreign countries having similar resources and conditions.\n\nExhibit C-31.\n\n357.\n\nIn 1993, YPF conducted an initial public offering in the United States of America in order to issue tradeable debt in that country. In this connection, YPF, which was still a publicly-owned entity, issued a prospectus regarding the issuance of American depository shares in which it described the regulatory regime as follows:\n\n*Market Regulation*\n\nUnder the Hydrocarbons Law and the Oil Deregulation Decrees, holders of production concessions have the right to produce oil and gas, and own and are allowed to dispose of such production in the market without restriction. As a result, the Company, as well as private companies producing oil and gas under service contracts with YPF following conversion of such contracts to concessions, may sell their production in domestic or export markets, and refiners may obtain crude oil from suppliers within or outside Argentina.  \n The Hydrocarbons Law authorizes the National Executive to regulate the Argentine oil and gas markets and prohibits the export of crude oil during any period in which the National Executive finds domestic production to be insufficient to satisfy domestic demand. In the event the National Executive restricts the export of oil and petroleum products or the free disposition of natural gas, the Oil Deregulation Decrees provide that producers, refiners and exporters shall receive a price, in the case of crude oil and similar imported petroleum products, and in the case of natural gas, not lower than that 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34 API.\n\n*Taxation*\n\nHolders of exploration permits and production concessions are subject to federal, provincial, and municipal taxes and regular customs duties on imports. The Hydrocarbons Law grants such holders a legal guarantee against new taxes and certain tax increases at the provincial and municipal levels. Holders of exploration permits and production concessions must pay an annual surface tax based on area held. In addition, \"net profit\" (as defined in the Hydrocarbons Law) of holders of permits or concessions accruing from activity as such holders is subject to a special 55% income tax. This tax has never been applied. Each permit or concession granted to an entity other than the Company has provided that the holder thereof is subject instead to the general Argentine tax regime, and a decree of the National Executive provides that the Company also is subject instead to the general Argentine tax regime.477\n\nYPF \"Prospectus, YPF Sociedad Anonima, 105 American depository shares representing 105 million Class D shares\", dated 28 June 1993, Exhibit C-308, pp. 69-70.\n\n358.\n\nIn 1993, after the adoption of the Reconversion Decree, YPF requested that Total and the members of the Consortium agree to convert Contract 19,944 into a concession agreement pursuant to the terms of the Reconversion Decree. As the operator of the Consortium, Total represented the Consortium in negotiations with the Argentine authorities.478 After several months of negotiations, Total and Argentina reached agreed terms for the conversion of Contract 19,944 into the new concession agreement regime.479 On 23 November 1993, Total and YPF signed a document known as the *\"Acta Acuerdo\"* which set out the parties\u2019 agreement for the reconversion of Contract 19,944 into a production concession and an exploration permit under the new concession agreement regime.480 This *Acta Acuerdo* provided for the conversion of Contract No. 19,944 into an exploration permit with a term until 1 May, 1996 and a production concession *(concesi\u00f3n de explotaci\u00f3n)* with a term of 25 years (plus a possible extension pursuant to Article 35 of Law 17,319) in return for the rescission of Contract No. 19,944 and the extinguishment of the rights and obligations assumed by the parties pursuant to that contract. The *Acta Acuerdo* referred specifically to the Deregulation Decrees and the Reconversion Decree and the rights granted to the holders of the new concessions pursuant to those instruments.481\n\nSee Contie WS1, paras. 28 and following. Total was represented by Patrick Rambaud, Total Austral\u2019s general manager at the time and Michel Contie, vice-president of Total Latin America at the time. Argentina was represented generally by YPF and, on several occasions, by the Argentine Secretary of Energy.\n\nSee Contie WS1, paras. 29-31. According to Mr. Contie and Total, there were two preconditions for the conversion of Contract 19,944 into a concession. These were that the replacement concession agreements would have to guarantee Total\u2019s right to freely dispose of the hydrocarbons it produced in Argentina, both in the domestic and international markets and that Total would be free from restrictions on the export of hydrocarbons, including export fees and duties without prior notice of one year and full compensation. Second, the replacement concession agreements could not result in losses to Total. At the time, Total performed a calculation to estimate the difference between the discounted cash flows expected to be generated under Contract 19,944 and the discounted cash flows that would be generated over the same period of time under new concession agreements. The estimated difference was approximately US$410 million. As stated by Total in its Memorial at para. 140, to compensate the loss caused by the conversion of the Contract into a concession agreement, YPF agreed to transfer to the Consortium, of which Total was a member, certain assets and interests in new fields that YPF had not developed for technological reasons or that it had left undeveloped. These were a participating interest in the San Roque and Aguada Pichana exploitation concessions, the concession for a natural gas field called Aries Norte and the oil reserves in the area of Ca\u00f1adon Alfa in the Austral Basin.\n\nExhibit C-92.\n\nSee Article 8-11 of the ***Acta Acuerdo.***\n\n359.\n\nThe terms of the above *Acta Acuerdo* and the provisions of the Deregulation Decrees were specifically referred to, approved and adopted in Decree 214/94 (the \"Concession Decree\") adopted on 15 February, 1994. The Concession Decree provided, in part, as follows:\n\nThat the reconversion of Contract No. 19,944 implies for its holders, a substantial juridical change for the abandonment of its position as contractor of *YPF SOCIEDAD AN\u00d3NIMA,* preserved, to a great extent, from the economic risk of exploitation once the mining risk phase had been overcome. The important change in their economic position is also relevant for them upon the extinction of *YPF SOCIEDAD AN\u00d3NIMA* \u2019s obligation to receive the hydrocarbons produced and to pay higher prices than the ones established by the National Executive for them.\n\nTherefore, it becomes necessary to implement agreements tending to maintain the economic balance of the project for the Companies which are holders of the Contract No. 19,944 in the light of the damage that they may otherwise sustain and the new risks that they may assume due to the reconversion.\n\n\u2026\n\nArt. 6. Holders of the Exploration Permit, of the Exploitation Concessions and of Joint Venture Agreements celebrated between *YPF SOCIEDAD ANONIMA,* according to the attributions conferred by Articles 3 and 4 of the Law No. 24,145 and their Bylaws and *TOTAL AUSTRAL SOCIEDAD ANONIMA, DEMINEX ARGENTINA SOCIEDAD ANONIMA* and *BRIDAS AUSTRAL SOCIEDAD ANONIMA* for the complementary exploitation, development and exploration of the Areas \"AGUADA PICHANA\" and \"SAN ROQUE\", emerging from the conversion of the Contract No. 19,944 established in Article 1 hereof, shall have the ownership and the free availability of the hydrocarbons that are produced in the respective areas, pursuant to the provisions of the Law No. 17,319 and Decrees No. 1055, dated 10 October, 1989; No. 1212, dated 8 November, 1989; No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989 and No. 2411, dated 12 November, 1991, whose terms are in full force and effect as from 23 November, 1993, shall be incorporated in the titles of the corresponding Exploitation Concessions and the Exploration Permit and the aforementioned Joint Venture Agreements for the validity term thereof.\n\n\u2026\n\nArt. 8. Every restriction to the free availability referred to in Article 6 hereof shall empower holders of the Exploration Permits, the Exploitation Concessions and the Joint Venture Agreements mentioned in Article 6 of this Decree, to receive a value not lower than the one established in Article 6 of the Decree No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989, for the duration thereof.\n\nArt. 9. Holders of the exploration permits or exploitation concessions shall be subject to the general fiscal legislation which applies to them; the provisions that may be imposed in a discriminatory way on, or specifically in relation to the person, the judicial condition, or the activity of the permit holder or the assets intended for the execution of the respective areas shall not be applicable..\n\n\u2026\n\nArt. 17. In case that, as a consequence of the facts or the acts deriving from the Public Powers, the holders of the Exploration permit, of the Exploitation Concession and of the Joint Venture Agreements mentioned in Article 6 of this Decree are prevented from exercising the rights emerging hereof, despite their intention to do so, they shall have the right to cause the National Executive Power to instruct the Application Authority or whoever it may correspond to receive the hydrocarbons produced pursuant to Article 6 of Decree No. 1589, dated 27 December, 1989, for the duration of the restriction, pursuant to the terms of the Exploration Permit, of the Exploitation Concessions and of the Joint Venture Agreements. The National Executive shall be responsible for the applicable damages and compensations pursuant to Article 519 of the Civil Code.482\n\nConcession Decree, Exhibit C-67.\n\n360.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Concession Decree, Total expanded its exploration and hydrocarbon production activities in Argentina.483 The production opportunities, in which Total and the other members of the Consortium invested included, the following:\n\n- Development of the Aguada Pichana field;\n\n- Increased participation in the CAA 35 Consortium and becoming operator of the off-shore area;\n\n- Acquisition of interests in the Sierra Chata Exploitation Block;\n\n- Acquisition of a participating interest in CNQ-37 \"Veta Escondida\" and CNP-38 \"Rincon de Aranda\";\n\n- Investment of approximately US$400 million in Carina and Aries; and\n\n- Investment of approximately US$100 million in the debottlenecking of the San Roque and Aguada Pichana fields.484\n\nTotal also made a number of investments in several exploration properties in order to locate new reserves.485\n\nSee, generally, Contie WS1, paras. 31-42; Contie, Transcript (English) Day 4, 1003-1004.\n\nSlide III. 17 of Total\u2019s Opening Statement; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 668 and the sources cited there.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 671; Slide III.18 of Total\u2019s Opening Statement.\n\n361.\n\nTotal entered into long-term contracts with local distributors for the sale of natural gas.486 Total also entered into export contracts for natural gas with Chilean customers, which were approved by the Argentine authorities.487 In general terms, production in the Argentine market for natural gas increased significantly such that Argentina became a regional exporter of natural gas.488\n\nAccording to Mr. Grosjean of Total, over 95% of the natural gas produced by Total was sold under long-term contracts of ten years or more. The price of the gas was freely agreed between Total and its customers and was expressed in US dollars. This was done both on the domestic and on the export market. See Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 882-887. See Grosjean WS1, para. 12 for a list of Total\u2019s long-term sales contracts for natural gas for first delivery dates between 1995 and 2005.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 672 and the sources cited there. Exports of natural gas were subject to resolutions issued by the Secretary of Energy. Essentially, the criterion for approval of exports of natural gas was the ability to confirm that adequate reserves existed to ensure the natural gas supply needed for the domestic market. See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 672-674 and the sources cited therein. Prior to 1998, Total\u2019s contracts to export to Metro Gas, a Chilean customer, were approved pursuant to Law 24,076 and Decree 1,738/92, as amended. Resolution 131/01 provided for the automatic approval of export contracts provided that current gas reserves exceeded certain levels (see SoE Resolution 131/01, dated 9 February 2001, Exhibit C-133; Grosjean WS2, para. 22). According to the terms of the resolution, this automatic approval of export contracts was appropriate in view of regional gas reserves, the confirmation that adequate reserves continued to be available, as well as the existence of a reasonable relationship between reserves and production after accounting for export volumes granted on the basis of sufficiency of supply of the domestic market. Among the long-term contracts approved pursuant to the applicable regulations were the following: Metro Gas (SoE Resolution 200/97, Exhibit C-330); Colbun S.A. (SoE Resolution 353/99, Exhibit C-341); Colbun (SoE Resolution 3/02, dated 3 September 2002, Exhibit C-427); Methanex (SoE Resolution 41/02, dated 11 September 2002, Exhibit C-428). The last two contracts referred to were approved on the basis of meeting the requirements set out in SoE Resolution 131/01 and authorised the long-term export of natural gas in amounts of 1,650,000 m3/day for a term of 14 years and three months (to a total of 8,580 million m3 of natural gas and one million m3/day for four years and 2,200,000 m3 for 16 years to a total of 15,022 million m3 of natural gas, respectively.\n\nSee YPF \"Prospectus\", dated 28 June 1993, Exhibit C-308 at 13; Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 888-889.\n\n362.\n\nUnlike natural gas sales, oil and LPG sales were not subject to approval and Total freely agreed sales agreements with its customers on both the domestic and international markets.489 Total\u2019s crude oil production came primarily from the Hidra field in Tierra del Fuego. Pursuant to the terms of Law 19,640, crude oil exports from Tierra del Fuego were exempted from export taxes.490\n\nGrosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 880-883.\n\nSee Law 19,640, Exhibit C-292. See also C\u00f3digo Aduanero, Article 600-607, Exhibit C-293; MoE general instruction 19/02, 26 May 2002, Exhibit C-406; Legal and Technical Customs Deputy Director\u2019s Opinion, 128/04, dated 21 September 2004, Exhibit C-478.\n\n363.\n\nBy the end of 2001, Total\u2019s share of overall production of natural gas in Argentina was approximately 22%. Among the exploration and production companies operating in Argentina, Total had the highest percentage of its production (in energy equivalent terms) in gas.491 Of its total production, the large majority (82%) was natural gas and the remainder (18%) represented crude oil and LPG.492 Of Total\u2019s gas production, the majority was sold in the domestic market to distribution companies and large industrial customers, including power generation plants. Total also entered into a significant number of long-term export contracts for the sale of natural gas, primarily to purchasers in Chile.493\n\nSee Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 900 - 901.\n\nSee Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 900-902, 989-990.\n\nSee Grosjean WS1, para. 12; Transcript (English) Day 3, 880-883. According to Mr. Grosjean, approximately 95% of its natural gas sales were pursuant to long-term contracts. See also ***supra*** note 479.\n\n***2. Measures Taken by Argentina***\n------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nIn response to its financial crisis and other situations that arose in the Argentine energy market, Argentina passed a number of general and more specific laws, regulations and other measures that had an impact on investors involved in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons.\n\n365.\n\nAs already discussed, in January 2002, Argentina enacted the Emergency Law494 together with a series of implementing measures. The Emergency Law eliminated Argentina\u2019s convertibility system, which had pegged the Argentine peso to the US dollar at a one to one ratio.495 Further, the Emergency Law redenominated all private law contracts, including dollar denominated long term sales contracts, at the exchange rate of one peso to one US dollar.496 At the time of the redenomination of private law contracts, the peso was trading at a rate of approximately three pesos to the US dollar.497\n\nSee Exhibit C-13, Law 25,561/02 dated 7 January 2002.\n\nSee the Emergency Law, Articles 1-4; see also Grosjean WS1, para. 15.\n\nSee Emergency Law, Article 11 at Exhibit C-13.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 686.\n\n366.\n\nThe redenomination, or \"pesification\", of private law contracts implemented by the Emergency Law, Article 11, changed the price terms of a number of contracts between Total and various refineries for the sale of crude oil.\n\n367.\n\nThe pesification of private contracts also affected the price Total received pursuant to gas sales contracts.\n\n368.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of Article 8 of the Emergency Law, the tariffs payable for transportation and distribution of natural gas were pesified at the rate of one peso to one dollar. Then, commencing in May 2002, ENARGAS established a maximum reference price distributors could charge for the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff498 The effect of this measure was to freeze the level of the Consumer Gas Tariff at the same level as in 2001, but pesified, *i.e.,* at the same peso value but, in US dollar terms, at approximately one-third of the amount that it had been in 2001. The Consumer Gas Tariff comprises the well-head gas price, the gas transportation tariff and the gas distribution tariff. Before the measures, the well-head gas price was negotiated between the producers and distributors and passed through to customers as a component of the Consumer Gas Tariff. The Emergency Law pesified the reference price component (which notionally represents the well-head gas price) of the Consumer Gas Tariff499 This had the effect of \"suppressing\" the price that producers\u2019 customers could pay for natural gas, as distributors could not charge their customers more than the pesified Consumer Gas Tariff500\n\nENARGAS Resolution 2612/02 dated 24 June 2002 at Exhibit C-155; ENARGAS Resolution 2665/02 dated 15 August 2002 at Exhibit C-34(1); ENARGAS Resolution 2653/02 dated 22 August 2002 at Exhibit C-34(2); ENARGAS Resolution 2654/02 dated 22 August 2002 at Exhibit C-34(4); and ENARGAS Resolution 2663/03 dated 22 July 2002 at Exhibit C-34 (5).\n\nSee Grosjean WS2 at paras. 11 - 16.\n\nSee Grosjean WS1, para. 19.\n\n369.\n\nIn October 2002, the Ministry of Economy adopted Resolution 487/02 to exempt ENARGAS (and ENRE, the *Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad)* from the freeze on tariffs in order to undertake tariff revisions to maintain conditions that would ensure the continuity of public services.501 However, any revision of the tariffs was blocked by way of injunctions in the Argentine courts.502\n\nMinistry of Economy, Resolution No. 47/02, Exhibit C-58; see also above para. 88.\n\nSee, for example, injunction dated 25 February 2003 In the Matter of ***Uni\u00f3n de Usuarios y Otros c/Ministerio de Econom\u00eda e Infraestructura -*** Exhibit C-178; see also above para. 88.\n\n370.\n\nThe Emergency Law also provided the executive with the authority to impose export withholding taxes on hydrocarbons. Pursuant to this authority, in February 2002, Argentina imposed a 20% export tax on crude oil503 and a 5% export tax on LPG.504 These taxes were not applied to exports from Tierra del Fuego and the legal and technical customs deputy director (of the Federal Administration of Public Income) issued opinions in 2002 and 2004 confirming that exports from Tierra del Fuego were exempt from the new measures.505\n\nDecree 310/02 dated 14 February 2002 at Exhibit C-149; also see Grosjean WS1, para. 25.\n\nMoE Resolution 11/02 dated 5 March 2002 at Exhibit C-150; also see Grosjean WS1, para. 25.\n\nMoE General Instruction 19/02 dated 26 March 2002 at Exhibit C-406; Legal and Technical Customs Deputy Director Opinion 128/04 dated 21 September 2004 at Exhibit C-478.\n\n371.\n\nIn February 2004, the SoE designed an agreement with producers of natural gas (the \"Price Path Recovery Agreement\")506 that would return domestic prices to a level capable of sustaining the hydrocarbon production industry. Total Austral agreed to the Price Path Recovery Agreement by signing it in the beginning of April 2004. The Price Path Recovery Agreement was approved by means of Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investments and Services Resolution 2O8/O4.507 The agreement set July 2005 as the intended date for industrial and other large consumer prices to return to free market pricing,508 and 31 December, 2006 as the date for a return to free market pricing for residential and small commercial consumers.509 Argentina agreed to increase well-head prices applicable to industrial consumers of natural gas, supplied either by distributors or the producers, by 35% in May 2004, and then by 16% in each of October 2004, May 2005 and July 2005. Argentina\u2019s factual witness described the Price Path Recovery Agreement in this way:\n\nThat the purpose of the price recomposition agreement was to take internal prices to levels that permit to sustain hydrocarbon producers, in particular producers of natural gas; yes, I agree with that concept.510\n\nExhibit A RA-269\n\nExhibit A RA-23.\n\nSee Grosjean WS1, para. 42.\n\nDecree 181/04 dated 16 February 2004 at Exhibit C-197; Ministry of Planning Resolution 208/04 dated 22 April 2004 at Exhibit C-208; Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 893: 7-9.\n\nCross-examination of Diego Guich\u00f3n, Transcript (Spanish) Day 5, 1340:17 - 22.\n\n372.\n\nIn March 2004, in response to the energy shortage expected for the winter of 2004, the Secretary of Energy passed Resolution 265/04 and Undersecretary of Fuels passed Disposition 27/04, which are referred to collectively as the \"Gas Rationing Program\".511 The Gas Rationing Program limited exports of natural gas by producers to the volume of natural gas exported during the same month in 2003 unless a special exemption was granted by the Secretary of Energy, and gave the Undersecretary of Energy the power to suspend the export of natural gas not otherwise restricted and to redirect that gas to specific consumers on the local market.512\n\nSoE Resolution 265/04 dated 26 March 2004 at Exhibit C-205 and Undersecretary of Fuels Disposition 27/04 dated 31 March 2004 at Exhibit C-206.\n\nSoE Resolution 265/04 dated 26 March 2004 at Exhibit C-205 and Undersecretary of Fuels Disposition 27/04 dated 31 March 2004 at Exhibit C-206; see also Grosjean WS1, paras. 46 - 47.\n\n373.\n\nIn June 2004, the Gas Rationing Program was replaced with a new program, the *\"Programa Complementario de Abastecimiento al Mercado Interno de Gas Natural.\"513* It required exporting producers to supply additional volumes of natural gas to the local market to meet any unsatisfied demand of protected customers as determined by the SoE, before complying with their export commitments. There was no limit on the amount of additional natural gas that the SoE could require from exporting producers for the domestic market.514\n\nSoE Resolution 659/04 dated 18 June 2004 at Exhibit C-215.\n\nSoE Resolution 659/04 dated 18 June 2004 at Exhibit C-215; also see Grosjean WS1, para. 50.\n\n374.\n\nAlso in 2004, Argentina twice increased the value of the export tax on crude oil.515 In May 2004, the rate of the withholding tax on crude oil was increased to 25%.516 In August 2004, Resolution 532/04 was passed and it introduced a sliding scale of export taxes based on increases in the West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") price of crude oil.517 The withholding tax was increased to 45% when the WTI crude price exceeded US $45 per barrel.518\n\nMoE Resolution 337/04 dated 12 May 2004 at Exhibit C-211; MoE Resolution 532/04 dated 5 August 2004 at Exhibit C-222; MoE Resolution 335/04 dated 12 May 2004 at Exhibit C-210.\n\nSee Grosjean WS1, para. 25.\n\nMoE Resolution 532/04 dated 5 August 2004 at Exhibit C-222.\n\nSee Grosjean WS1, para. 25.\n\n375.\n\nIn 2004, Argentina imposed a 20% withholding tax on the export of natural gas519 and increased the amount of the withholding tax on LPG from 5% to 20%.520\n\nDecree 645/04 dated 27 May 2004 at Exhibit C-212.\n\nMoE Resolution 335/04 dated 12 May 2004; see also Grosjean WS1, para. 25.\n\n376.\n\nIn late 2004, the SoE passed Resolution 1679/04, which required that crude oil made available for export first be offered on the domestic market.521\n\nSee Grosjean WS1, para. 51.\n\n377.\n\nIn April 2005, Argentina set a hard cap on LPG prices for units sold in the domestic markets to residential users, and a cap for the remaining sales equal to the average price of LPG sold in the previous 24 months (the \"LPG Law\").522\n\nLaw 26,020 dated 8 April 2005 at Exhibit A RA 170.\n\n378.\n\nIn May 2005, Argentina set gas prices under the same price reference stated by Resolution 659/04, which introduced a protection mechanism called \"Additional Permanent Injections\".523 It is argued that these two measures abandoned the commitment to return to free market pricing contained in the Price Path Recovery Agreement for large consumers, by extending the set volumes agreed with the industry and imposing lower prices than those that had been agreed with the natural gas production sector.524\n\nSoE Resolution 752/05 dated 23 May 2005 at Exhibit C-497.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para. 708.\n\n379.\n\nAs already discussed, Law 19,640, passed in 1972, had established a special customs regime for Tierra del Fuego, including an exemption from export withholding taxes. Total\u2019s witnesses testified that the benefits of Law 19,640 were critical to Total\u2019s decision to invest in the harsh Tierra del Fuego region.525 This region had limited pipeline capacity (TGS pipeline) and high transport costs to Buenos Aires.526 Much of the gas from this region was exported into Chile under long-term contracts, rather than sold into the domestic market.527 In late 2006, Argentina passed Resolution 776/06, which retroactively imposed export taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego.528 This action was codified into law with the passage of Law 26,217/07.529\n\nCross-examination of Michael Contie, Transcript (English) Day 4, 1050:7 - 1051:1; Contie WS2, paras. 18-23.\n\nContie WS2, para. 18.\n\nGrosjean WS1, para. 12.\n\nMoE Resolution 776/06 dated 11 October 2006 at Exhibit C-575.\n\nLaw 26,217 dated 16 January 2007 at Exhibit C-613.\n\n380.\n\nIn November 2007, Resolution 394/07 again increased the export taxes on crude oil and fuel.530 These taxes were a direct tax on exports paid by the exporter. The effect was to prevent producers from receiving more than US$42 per barrel of oil produced (any and all amounts in excess of this amount is retained by Argentina). One of the purposes of Resolution 394/07 was stated to be the protection of the economy and consumers from increases in the price of crude oil and to capture for the state the profits otherwise receivable by producers. The sixth recital of Resolution 394/07 states:\n\n[T]he modification of the export rights, which are applicable to a group of those products, is deemed convenient, in order to ensure competitiveness of the national economy.531\n\nMoE Resolution 394/07 dated 16 November 2007 at Exhibit C-708 (d).\n\nMoE Resolution 394/07 dated 16 November 2007 at Exhibit C-708 (d).\n\n***3. Impact of the Measures Alleged by Total to be in Breach of Article 3 of the BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nIn this arbitration, Total claims that these measures impacted its investments in the exploration and production sector and seeks damages for what it says is a breach of its rights under Argentina\u2019s legal system and, as a consequence, a breach of its legitimate expectations based on those rights. In other words, Total contends that the fair and equitable treatment clause contained in the Argentina-French BIT clause covers Total\u2019s expectations that Argentina would not act contrary to the rights that it had guaranteed to Total under both its own general legal enactments and such a specific instrument as Total\u2019s concession.\n\n382.\n\nThe thrust of Total\u2019s argument is that Argentina\u2019s measures (listed and described in the previous pages), by eviscerating Total\u2019s rights under the relevant legal framework and, consequently, frustrating Total\u2019s legitimate expectations with respect to its investments in the exploration and production sector, breached Argentina\u2019s obligation to treat Total fairly and equitably under the BIT.532 For the purpose of discussion, Total divides the numerous measures by their alleged impact on each expectation that it identifies in relation to its investments in the exploration and production sector: expectations with respect to the domestic sale of natural gas; expectations with respect to the export of natural gas; expectations related to the sale of crude oil; expectations related to taxes on crude oil exports; and expectations related to pricing of LPG.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 61; Total\u2019s Memorial, para. 372 ff.\n\n383.\n\nAll Total\u2019s expectations were, therefore, based on the following rights which Total is entitled to as a holder of a production concession: full property rights over the hydrocarbons produced, including the right freely to dispose of all of those hydrocarbons set out in Article 6 of the Concession Decree and the right to be compensated by the government for limitations of those rights pursuant to Article 8 of the Concession Decree. Furthermore, Total lists its rights under its concession, referring to the (domestic and international) sale of the different products: as to the domestic sale of crude oil, full property rights over the hydrocarbons produced, including the right freely to dispose of all of those hydrocarbons (Article 6 of the Concession Decree and Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law); as to the international sale of crude oil, the right freely to export crude oil without restrictions (Article 6 of the Concession Decree which incorporates by reference Decree 1589/89); as to the domestic sale of natural gas, full property rights over hydrocarbons produced, including the right freely to dispose of all of those hydrocarbons under Article 6 of the Concession Decree and Article 5 of Decree 2411/91 (the so-called Reconversion Decree); and the right to receive compensation for government-imposed limitations on these rights, enshrined in Article 8 of the Concession Decree.\n\n384.\n\nIn this respect the Tribunal considers it useful to briefly recall the content of Article 8 of the Concession Decree. This provision incorporates by reference Article 6 of Decree 1589/89. As to the restrictions to the export of petroleum, Article 6 of this Decree incorporates by reference Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law. More specifically, Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 provides that in the case of restrictions on the export of crude oil and/or its derivatives, under Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law compensation should be equivalent to an amount per product unit that is not below that of petroleum and petroleum by-products of a similar nature. As to the limitations on the right freely to dispose of natural gas, Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 provides for compensation amounting to a price not below 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API (see also Article 17 of the Concession Decree).\n\n***3.1 Domestic Sale of Natural Gas***\n--------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nMany of the measures complained of in this section have already been considered by the Tribunal in its review of the claim with respect to Total\u2019s investment in gas transportation. However, in this portion of the Decision, the Tribunal reviews the alleged impact of these Measures on Total\u2019s investments in the exploration and production sector. Total\u2019s claims with respect to the domestic sale of natural gas relate to what it refers to as manipulation of the gas prices.\n\n386.\n\nThe first measure of which Total complains is Argentina\u2019s decision to redenominate all private law contracts at the artificial exchange rate of one US dollar to one peso (the \"redenomination\").533 Total submitted that it and its counterparties had expressed the price of their long-term contracts in dollars instead of pesos even for domestic sales because they wanted a \"stability reference price... [A] price well-defined which would not be exposed to variation in the local currency\".534 After this measure was adopted, the exchange rate for the peso fluctuated and was at one point trading at a rate of approximately three pesos to the US dollar. Thus, the price that Total received under its long-term contracts was approximately one-third of the value of the price negotiated with its counterparties. Total submits that the net effect of the measures was to eviscerate Total\u2019s property rights over the hydrocarbons produced.535\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 686; Law 25,561/02 dated 7 January 2002 at Exhibit C-13, Article 11. It is important to note that Total does not complain that the other Measures (abolishment of the convertibility system and the ***\"corralito\" -*** restrictions on the ability to withdraw funds from banks) violated its treaty rights.\n\nGrosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 889:13 - 16.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 689.\n\n387.\n\nThe second measure that Total claims to have impacted its rights was the forced conversion at a rate of one US dollar to one peso *(^pesification\")* of the reference price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff, which Total asserts compounded the effects of the redenomination.536 Total alleges that the gas regulatory structure was designed to ensure that ENARGAS passed through the well-head price (freely negotiated between the producer and distributor) to the consumer through the Consumer Gas Tariff. However, according to Total, the pesification of the well-head prices paid for natural gas in 2001 artificially suppressed the price that Total\u2019s customers could pay for natural gas.537 Distributors could not pay producers, like Total, more than the pesified well-head gas price.538\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 690 - 694.\n\nLECG Report on Damages dated 15 May 2007 at Annex R (i) to the Reply, paras. 198 - 200.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 692.\n\n388.\n\nThe third measure allegedly affecting Total\u2019s right to freely dispose of the natural gas that it produced, and the measure claimed by Total to be the critical step, was Argentina\u2019s decision in May 2002 to freeze the maximum reference price that natural gas distributors could charge to consumers for gas at the 2001 pesified levels.539 Total argues that this step codified the depressed well-head price of gas created by the measures. When ENARGAS later indicated a willingness to review tariffs, the Argentine courts enjoined ENARGAS from revising upward the Consumer Gas Tariff540 Total submits that: the ENARGAS resolutions suggest that ENARGAS was aware of the difference between the cost of producing natural gas and the price consumers would have been required to pay for it under the Gas Law; ENARGAS felt unable to take the costs of producers into account; and ENARGAS felt the existing situation was incompatible with a truly competitive market for natural gas.541 Total says that these measures resulted in hydrocarbon producers shouldering the cost of the recovery of Argentina\u2019s economy by having them subsidize low energy prices.542 Finally, on this point, Total submits that Argentina\u2019s measures were not necessary - its goals of relieving the effects of the crisis could have been more efficiently met by providing impoverished residential consumers with a direct subsidy.543\n\nENARGAS Resolution 2612/02 dated 24 June 2002 at Exhibit C-155; ENARGAS Resolution 2665/02 dated 15 August 2002 at Exhibit C-158; ENARGAS Resolution 2614/02 dated 24 June 2002 at Exhibit C-34(1); ENARGAS Resolution 2653/02 dated 22 August 2002 at Exhibit C-34(2); ENARGAS Resolution 2654/02 dated 22 August 2002 at Exhibit C-34(3); ENARGAS Resolution 2660/02 dated 22 August 2002 at Exhibit C-34(4); and ENARGAS Resolution 2663/03 dated 22 August 2004 at Exhibit C-34(5).\n\nInjunction issued by Judge Rodr\u00edguez Vidal, File No. 162,765/02 dated 25 February 2003, \"Union de Usuarios y Consumidores y Otros v.

Total argues that Argentina changed the price under its contracts and that this amounted to a direct measure against Total in violation of the Concession Decree.545 Total says that the pesification of the reference price in connection with ENARGAS\u2019s calculation of the Consumer Gas Tariff also violated Total\u2019s rights of free disposition.546 Total submits that even Argentina\u2019s fact witness on the exploration and production sector pointed out that an extensive study of the effects of the measures on producers like Total concluded that the natural gas prices in Argentina were unsustainable and incapable of allowing producers to receive an acceptable rate of return.547 Total argues that, despite Argentina\u2019s knowledge of the impact of the measures on gas producers, Argentina refused to compensate the producers for past losses, agreeing only to a gradual return of market prices within the context of the Price Path Recovery Agreement, which not only failed to compensate producers, but also was not implemented by Argentina.548\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para. 702 - 703.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para. 704.\n\nCross-examination of Diego Guich\u00f3n, Transcript (Spanish) Day 5, 1339:5 - 1343:7.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at paras. 705 -709.\n\n391.\n\nIn response to Argentina\u2019s argument that Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law relieves Argentina of its obligations toward Total because it was entitled to regulate hydrocarbons sales when domestic supply is threatened, Total submits that the measures listed in paragraph 386 ff. above were not enacted to ensure the domestic supply of natural gas.549 Total also submits that the Hydrocarbons Law does not immunize the state from liability for regulation,550 and the obligation to compensate is a basic principle of Argentine law.551 Total also submits that by virtue of the Concession Decree, Total enjoys all the rights provided for by the Hydrocarbons Law in accordance with the Deregulation Decrees and the Conversion Decree.552\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 712.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para. 713.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para. 714.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at para. 715; Cross-examination of Diego Guich\u00f3n, Transcript (Spanish) Day 5, 1367:20 - 1368:5; Concession Decree, Exhibit C-67.\n\n392.\n\nFinally, Total confirms its position that it did not waive its claims to damages for Argentina\u2019s manipulation of the price of natural gas by signing the Price Path Recovery Agreement. Total submits that such a waiver was initially requested by Argentina, but that no such waiver was included in the final agreement.553\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at paras. 717 - 718.\n\n***3.2 Export of Natural Gas***\n-------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nTotal submits that the restrictions on Total Austral\u2019s natural gas exports also frustrated its legitimate expectations. Total states that the Concession Decree conferred on Total \"full property and full disposition\" rights with respect to natural gas,554 and that Argentina promised compensation to Total if the National Executive restricted the export of oil and petroleum products or the free disposition of natural gas.555 Total says that Argentina\u2019s fact witness confirmed that the regime established in the Deregulation Decrees, further incorporated by reference in the Concession Decree, required Argentina to compensate Total in the event that the National Executive restricted exports.556 Total submits that its right to export was limited only by the requirement that contracts for the export of natural gas be reviewed in advance by the state.557 Total says that it signed various export contracts after the Concession Decree was issued and that the requests for exports under each of those contracts was reviewed and approved by the Argentine Secretary of Energy. Total considers that these approvals constituted express guarantees by the state that Total\u2019s export rights would be respected.\n\nConcession Decree (Exhibit C-67), Article 6.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 719.\n\nCross-examination of Diego Guich\u00f3n, Transcript (Spanish) Day 5, 1367:20 - 1368:5.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 720.\n\n394.\n\nTotal submits that the Gas Rationing Program imposed limits on all natural gas exports by automatically limiting exports from producers for amounts that exceeded the volume of natural gas exported during the same month in 2003, and arrogated the power to suspend any export of natural gas not otherwise restricted and to redirect that gas to specific consumers on the local market. In June 2004, the Gas Rationing Program was replaced with a new program, which required that producers exporting natural gas supply additional volumes of natural gas to the local market to meet any unsatisfied demand of protected customers before being permitted to comply with their export commitments.558 Total claims that the result of this resolution was to fully restrict exports.559\n\nSecretary of Energy Resolution 659/04; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 725.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 725.\n\n395.\n\nAs a result of Undersecretary of Fuels Disposition 27/04, Total says that Total Austral had to suspend its exports to Colbun SA, a power generation facility in Chile, under the terms of a contract known as Colbun 2, because the automatic export limitation limited the amounts permitted to be exported to the levels exported in the same month of 2003. In 2003, Total had not exported substantial amounts under the new contract.560 Total submits that it suffered losses with respect to the natural gas, which was originally destined for export to Chile, that instead was sold to specific consumers in the domestic market below export price.561 Total states that Argentina put Total in a position where it had no choice but to breach the contracts with its Chilean counterparties and receive as much as two-thirds less for its natural gas.562\n\nGrosjean WS1, para. 48.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 726.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 726; also see Grosjean WS1 at para. 49 et seq.\n\n396.\n\nTotal submits that Argentina\u2019s defences with respect to its refusal to compensate Total for its losses are inadequate. Total submits that Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law, even if applicable, does not release Argentina from the obligation to compensate Total for its losses. Second, in response to Argentina\u2019s argument that Total had suffered no damages because it was granted relief in the Sierra Chata arbitration against AES Gener, Total submits that this arbitration was of no consequence as it related only to Total\u2019s very small Sierra Chata interest.563\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 728 & 732; see also Cross-examination of Pablo Spiller and Manuel Abdala, Transcript (English) Day 8, 2432:20 - 2433:9.\n\n***3.3 Sale of Crude Oil***\n---------------------------\n\n397.\n\nTotal also claims losses with respect to mandatory renegotiation of its crude oil contracts. Total states that Article 11 of the Emergency Law, which pesified all private contracts at a one to one ratio, changed the price terms of a number of short term contracts between Total and various refineries for the sale of crude oil. Total notes that it never signed an agreement with the Argentine government concerning the production of crude oil and that it, therefore, had the unrestricted rights of free disposal and exemption from export duties under the Concession Decree.564 Total submits that it was unable to recover the full value of the altered price terms and that it claims for those losses occasioned by Argentina\u2019s direct actions.565\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 733 - 735; Cross-examination of Yves Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 4, 981:19-982:1.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 736.\n\n***3.4 Taxes on Crude Oil Exports***\n------------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nTotal submits that Argentina imposed export taxes on crude oil, which had the purpose of manipulating and reducing the domestic price of oil. Total says that Resolution 397/07 effectively prevented Total from receiving more than US$42 per barrel of oil produced, despite the then-current prices that exceeded US$100 per barrel.566 The export taxes were taxes payable by Total to Argentina.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 737.\n\n399.\n\nTotal submits that the export taxes violated the export guarantees of the Concession Decree and the Deregulation Decrees, which required one year\u2019s notice of, and compensation for, any restriction or duty imposed on the export of liquid hydrocarbons.567 Total says that the export taxes damaged it in two ways. First, the export taxes impacted the price it received for its exports of crude oil. Second, the export taxes impacted the domestic price of crude oil by limiting the amount that local refineries would pay: the export price less the export tax. Total refers to this as the export parity issue.568\n\nDecree 310/02 dated 14 February 2002 at Exhibit C-149; Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 739.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 740; Direct Examination of Yves Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 3, 896:17 -899:19.\n\n400.\n\nTotal also submits that the export taxes constitute unlawful restrictions of Total\u2019s full property and free disposal rights under the Concession Decree. Total submits that Argentina breached this promise. Further, Total submits that the reference within that Section 17 of the Concession Decree to Article 519 of the Argentine Civil Code created an additional, express promise to compensate Total in the event that Argentina prevents Total from enjoying its full property rights.569\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 752 - 753.\n\n401.\n\nAs already discussed, Argentina first imposed export taxes in 2002, and then increased those taxes in 2004 and again in 2007. Total submits that the purpose of these taxes was to insulate the domestic market for crude oil from the impact of free market price movement, and to take, for the benefit of the government, the \"extraordinary\" profits enjoyed by exporters as a result of the rise in the price of crude oil.570\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 741; Cross-examination of Yves Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 4, 979:17 -20.\n\n402.\n\nArgentina points out that Article 9 of the Concession Decree states that concessionaires are subject to the general fiscal regime applicable in the country. With respect to this defence, Total asserts that this interpretation of Article 9 is incorrect. According to Total, Article 9 provides that the general fiscal regime does not apply when the fiscal legislation is discriminatory, *i.e.* when it applies only to hydrocarbons producers for the purpose of restricting the price of their product. Second, according to Total, while Article 9 is very general, the prohibitions on limitations of exports and on restrictions on full ownership and free disposal are quite specific; any potential conflict between the provisions should be resolved in favour of the specific provision.571 Third, Total submits that an agreement to subject oneself to a general tax regime is not a waiver of rights under international law with respect to the imposition of a particular tax or taxes, if the tax was (or the taxes were) adopted in bad faith or for unlawful purposes.572 Total argues that the export taxes are discriminatory, confiscatory and their purpose is the manipulation of the national hydrocarbons market.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 758.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 759.\n\n403.\n\nTotal claims that it suffered similar losses in its LPG and gas export businesses as a result of the export taxes introduced by Argentina.573\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 763; MoE Resolution 11/02 dated 2 March 2002 and effective 30 September 2002 at Exhibit C-150; and Decree 645/04 dated 27 May 2004 at Exhibit C-212.\n\n404.\n\nTotal also submits that Argentina exacerbated the effects of the export taxes by eliminating the long standing exemption from such taxes applicable to Tierra del Fuego. Initially, the general export taxes imposed on oil and gas did not apply to exports from Tierra del Fuego. In late 2006, Argentina retroactively (to 2002) imposed export taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego. Total says that its decision to invest in Tierra del Fuego depended on the tax exemption for exports from this region, as it planned to export much of the gas from this remote and geographically extreme area to closer, more easily accessible markets.574 As a result, it says the decision to impose export taxes from this region violated the promises contained in Law 19,640, as confirmed by the 1981 Customs Code575 and violated Total\u2019s rights under Article 3 of the BIT.576\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 764 - 768.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 766.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 770 - 773.\n\n***3.5 Pricing of LPG***\n------------------------\n\n405.\n\nIn its final claim related to the exploration and production sector, Total submits that through the LPG Law, Argentina intervened in LPG market prices and damaged Total. The LPG Law set a hard cap on LPG prices for units sold in the domestic markets. For residential users, prices could not exceed US$32 for a typical 45 kilogram LPG unit. For the rest of the sales, a cap was set equal to the average price of LPG sold in the previous 24 months.577 Total argues that this law violated the promise in the Concession Decree of free disposition.578 Total states that it has not waived its rights to compensation and that Argentina should compensate it for the damages flowing from the LPG Law.579\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 778; Law 26,020 dated 8 April 2005 at Exhibit A RA 170.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 779.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 780.\n\n***4. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n406.\n\nThrough the description above of Total\u2019s allegations with respect to the impact of Argentina\u2019s measures on its investments in exploration and production of Hydrocarbons, the Tribunal has already set forth Argentina\u2019s position concerning Total\u2019s claims. This notwithstanding, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will briefly sum up Argentina\u2019s arguments in the following paragraphs.\n\n407.\n\nIn respect of Total\u2019s claim as to its investments in this sector, the thrust of Argentina\u2019s defence is that all of Total\u2019s rights under the concession, which are described by Total in its submissions as absolute and unrestricted, are instead subject to the fundamental principle of the priority of domestic market supply enshrined in the Hydrocarbons Law.580 In this respect Argentina argues that:\n\n\"... Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides for that:\n\n(a) liquid hydrocarbons export is subject to prior supply to the domestic market;\n\n(b) the Argentine Executive may allow the export of hydrocarbons or by-products not required to satisfy the domestic market, provided that such exports are performed are [sic] reasonable commercial prices; and\n\n(c) in the event of allowing the export, the Argentine Executive may establish the criteria governing transactions in the domestic market to assure self-supply and an equitable participation of all producers in such supply.\"581\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 563.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 100.\n\n408.\n\nThe same is true also as to the export of gas and LPG pursuant to the Gas Law and to the LPG Law, respectively.582 It is Argentina\u2019s position that \"... Presidential Decree No. 214/94 establishes that the members of the Consortium (TOTAL among them) enjoy title to and free availability of hydrocarbons but always pursuant to the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law.\"583 Under Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law (that the Concession Decree explicitly incorporates) broad powers are granted to the Executive such as those of establishing restrictions on exports, quotas and domestic prices.584\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 103.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 104-106.\n\n409.\n\nMoreover, Argentina argues that Total is not entitled to receive compensation for the restrictions on gas exports provided for Article 8 of the Concession Decree, in light of the Executive\u2019s ability under Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law, to delink domestic prices of hydrocarbons from international prices \"when oil international prices are significantly increased due to exceptional circumstances... \".585 According to Argentina, \"[T]hen, if the crude oil international price does not serve to fix domestic market prices, it can neither serve as a reference to fix prices of gas sale to the domestic market.\"586 Furthermore, the conclusion in April 2004 of the *Acta Acuerdo* between producers and the Executive, with the objective of restoring the natural gas price, supports the fact that Argentina could fix the domestic price of gas without having regard to its international price. In fact, the determination of domestic prices of natural gas agreed under the *Acta Acuerdo* of 2004 took actual exploitation costs of producers (rather than gas international price) as a benchmark. In turn, actual exploitation costs were based on a SoE\u2019s study on producers\u2019 costs for exploration and production of natural gas.587\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 109-113.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 114.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 115-116.\n\n410.\n\nAs to the tax exemption claimed by Total, Argentina argues that there was no tax stability agreement with Total and its partners. On the contrary, in accordance with the terms of the concession, Total and its partners were subject to the general tax system.588 It is Argentina\u2019s position that the export duties introduced by Article 6 of the Emergency Law were lawful and a legitimate exercise of State sovereignty not giving rise to an obligation to compensate.589 Moreover, according to Argentina, the charges on hydrocarbons export are reasonable in the context of Argentina\u2019s crisis during 2001/02, and also taking into account various surrounding circumstances. Among these were the abandonment of the currency board system, the severe devaluation of the Argentine peso and the extraordinary increase of the crude oil price in the international market.590\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 131-136.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 137-143 and Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 591 ff.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 144-149.\n\n411.\n\nAs to the elimination of Tierra del Fuego\u2019s tax exemption, Argentina first objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis of the \"fork-in-the-road\" provision contained in Article 8(2) of Argentina-France BIT.591 In the event that the Tribunal asserts jurisdiction to hear Total\u2019s claim, Argentina suggests that the claim has to be rejected for the following reasons. First of all, Law 19,640 expressly set forth the possibility that a successive law could eliminate the exemption concerning Tierra del Fuego. This occurred in 2007 through the enactment of Law no. 26,217. Second, there was no tax stability agreement with Total that guaranteed against the elimination of the tax exemption on exports from Tierra del Fuego such that its actual elimination could not have frustrated Total\u2019s legitimate expectation.592\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 150-159\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 160-166.\n\n***5. Tribunal\u2019s Legal Evaluation***\n------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nTotal claims that it has been treated in an unfair and inequitable manner contrary to Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT insofar as, by enacting the measures referenced above, Argentina limited Total\u2019s right to freely dispose of all hydrocarbons produced.\n\n413.\n\nIn Total\u2019s view, Argentina had specifically guaranteed this general right, and all of the above-mentioned rights invoked by Total, in various instruments of general and specific character, that is, the Concession Decree, which incorporates the terms of the *Acta Acuerdo* agreed between Total and Argentina, the Deregulation Decrees, the Reconversion Decree and the Gas Law. All of these rights (including Total\u2019s right to be compensated for limitations on its right to freely dispose of all hydrocarbons that it produced) are enshrined in Argentina\u2019s general enactments, as well as in a specific bilateral arrangement agreed by Argentina with the investor, namely the Concession Decree.\n\n414.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentina - under its own legal system - promised that these rights would be respected. Therefore, all of Argentina\u2019s \u2018promises\u2019, contained in the Concession Decree, which in turn incorporates the relevant provisions of Argentina\u2019s law related to the Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons mentioned above, created Total\u2019s legitimate expectations that this regime would remain stable during the lifetime of its investment, and that any detrimental change would be compensated as was provided for by Argentina\u2019s legal system.593\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 681,684.\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the measures enacted by Argentina as of January 2002 limit rights guaranteed to Total under Argentina\u2019s own legal system and specifically under the Concession Decree. Because the Claimant had relied upon these rights (including the right to be compensated in the event of their limitation) when it made its investment, these measures are in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in the BIT since they impaired Total\u2019s investment without compensation for Total.\n\n416.\n\nDue to the totality of the measures affecting its investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons, Total complains that it has suffered damages amounting to a total net of US$575.4 million. The total net losses that Total claims to have suffered are articulated in the LECG Addendum Report as follows: a) as to natural gas US$192.9 million (up to December 2006); b) as to crude oil U.S.$260.6 million (up to December 2006 and projections of future damages to 2012); and c) as to LPG US$121.9. million (up to 2006 plus projections of future damages until 2012).594\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, at p. 33-58; LECG Addendum on Damages, Table II at p. 8.\n\n417.\n\nAs already emphasized in relation to Total\u2019s claim concerning TGN, the import of the Argentina\u2019s law is crucial for at least two reasons. On the one hand, according to Article 8(4) of the BIT, Argentina\u2019s domestic law is part of the law to be applied by the Tribunal, which accordingly has jurisdiction to interpret that law. On the other hand, the Tribunal has to identify the precise content of Total\u2019s pre-existing rights under the Concession Decree, as governed by Argentina\u2019s relevant legislation and its amendments from time to time, in order to establish whether the measures were in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, having frustrated Total\u2019s legal expectations based on those rights.\n\n***5.1 The Content of Argentina\u2019s Law***\n----------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe task of interpreting the key elements of the Argentine legal regime applicable to Total\u2019s investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons is not easy, due to the intricacy of the relationship between different successive enactments. This task involves interpretation of the rights invoked by Total in its claims, namely the oil producers\u2019 right freely to dispose of all hydrocarbons produced, both domestically and internationally, and the right to be compensated for any government imposed limitations.595\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 636.\n\n419.\n\nThe Hydrocarbons Law is dated 1967 and covers all hydrocarbons (both liquid-oil and non liquid-gas). It was intended to regulate a state-run or controlled sector, reflecting that, at the relevant time, the state owned YPF, had the monopoly in the sector. The successive decrees of 1989 (from which the privatization proceeded and on which Total\u2019s concession was based) reversed the system, without however abrogating the Hydrocarbons Law. On the contrary, the \"Deregulation decrees\" of 1989 and, in particular, decree 1589/89 refer to various articles of that law. After the Emergency, Argentina again enacted stricter regulations, weakening the liberalized regime created in 1989. Argentina invokes its powers under the Hydrocarbons Law to sustain the legality of the measures challenged by Total.596\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, by making its investments in Argentina\u2019s gas sector, Total was aware that the Hydrocarbons Law was the fundamental regulation of the natural gas industry. The Information Memorandum dated September 1992 in respect of the IPO of Gas del Estado, submitted to the Tribunal by Total as Exhibit C-50, made clear during the privatization process that \"... The Hydrocarbons Law continues to be the primary legislation governing the upstream industry... \" (para. 1.3 at page 6)\n\n420.\n\nA core question which the Tribunal has to deal with is whether, under Argentina\u2019s legal system as it existed up until 2002, the producers\u2019 right to freely dispose of crude oil and natural gas entails both the right to sell these commodities to anyone they choose and the right to freely fix their prices. The starting point of this analysis is an examination of the content of the Concession Decree in which Total\u2019s right of free disposal of hydrocarbons and the right to be compensated are specifically enshrined.\n\n421.\n\nThe Concession Decree stated that Total, as one of the holders of the hydrocarbons exploration and production concession in Tierra del Fuego, holds \"the ownership and the free availability\" of the hydrocarbons produced \"under\" the Hydrocarbons Law and the Deregulations Decrees *(i.e.,* Decrees No. 1055/89, No. 1589/89, and No. 2411/91). According to the Concession Decree (Article 6), the rights of the holders of the concession are explicitly made subject to the Hydrocarbons Law and the above referenced decrees. Moreover, according to Article 8 of the Concession Decree, every restriction on the \"free availability\" of the hydrocarbons produced, granted to the holders of the concession pursuant to Article 6, entitles them to receive for the time of the restriction an amount that shall not be less than that determined under Article 6 of Decree No. 1589/89.\n\n422.\n\nIn turn, Article 6 of Decree No. 1589/89 envisages two different types of restrictions on producers\u2019 rights, each of which entails a different amount of compensation. In the case of government imposed restrictions on the export of crude oil, compensation is due to oil producers, refiners and exporters in accordance with Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law. The text of Article 6, paragraph 1 of Decree No. 1589/89 (quoted above at paragraph 354) provides that this compensation shall be equivalent to an amount, per product unit, not less than that of petroleum and petroleum by-products of a similar nature. By contrast, according to Article 6, paragraph 2 of the same decree, in the case of government imposed restrictions on the right freely to dispose of natural gas (which is not restricted to cases of shortages in the domestic market), compensation shall be an amount not less than that of 35% of the international price of a cubic meter of Arabian Light Petroleum of 34\u00b0 API.\n\n423.\n\nThe Concession Decree refers, therefore, to different regulations and standards of compensation under the Hydrocarbons Law and the applicable Deregulation Decrees. On the one hand, it refers to limitations on the export of petroleum and petroleum byproducts, and, on the other hand, to restrictions on the right of free disposal of natural gas.\n\n424.\n\nAs to government imposed restrictions to the export of crude oil and its byproducts, Article 6 of Decree No. 1589/89 provides that: a) the Executive has to give 12 months\u2019 notice of projected restrictions prior to their coming into force (paragraph 3); and b) in case of such a restriction, Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law shall be applicable \"by virtue of which producers, refiners, and exporters shall receive, per product unit an amount not less than that of petroleum, and derivatives of similar nature.\"597 However, Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law, to which Article 6 of Decree No. 1589/89 specifically refers, actually provides for more detailed regulation. According to Article 6, paragraph 3, first sentence of the Hydrocarbons Law, (quoted above at paragraph 348) when national production does not cover domestic needs, the Executive may fix the crude oil price in the domestic market to be equal to that established for crude oil produced by the state owned company, which, in any case, cannot be lower than the price of imported crude oil of a similar condition (\"\u00bffe *condiciones similares\").* However, this rule shall not be applied when imported crude oil prices significantly increase due to exceptional circumstances (Article 6, para 3, second sentence). In this case, international crude oil prices shall not be taken into account when fixing the price in the domestic market. Instead domestic prices shall be based on the actual exploration costs, any amortization and a reasonable interest on updated and depreciated investments.\n\nThe meaning of this phrase is obscure and has not been clarified by the parties during the arbitration. In any case, as specified hereafter at paragraph 434, the Tribunal has found that this provision is not applicable ***in casu.***\n\n425.\n\nPursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, \"the hydrocarbon exploration, production, transport and commercialization activities shall be carried out by oil companies pursuant to the provisions contained therein and the further regulation set out by the Executive (Article 2). According to the same law, Argentina\u2019s Executive is charged with the following tasks: a) establishing the appropriate national policy regarding hydrocarbon exploration and production activities, taking into account as a primary objective the country\u2019s need for hydrocarbons, maintaining the appropriate reserves required for this purpose (Article 3); b) establishing regulation based on such reasonable technical and economic parameters as necessary in order to take account of the domestic market\u2019s interest and to promote hydrocarbon exploration and production (Article 6, paragraph 1). Moreover, as clearly stated by the same Article 6, paragraph 1, \"oil companies may exercise their property right over exploited hydrocarbons and, accordingly, transport and commercialize them, work and commercialize hydrocarbons by-products\" in conformity with further regulation set out by the Executive. In addition, when national hydrocarbon production does not cover domestic needs \"the use of all availabilities of national origin of said hydrocarbons shall be mandatory\" (Article 6, paragraph 2). Conversely, the Executive shall authorise the export of hydrocarbons and their by-products provided that they are not required to satisfy domestic needs (Article 6, paragraph 4). Finally, Article 6 paragraph 3, which is expressly incorporated in Total\u2019s concession, grants the government the power to fix the domestic sale price of crude oil in case of domestic supply problems, without regard to the international price of crude oil.\n\n426.\n\nSome conclusions can be drawn from this overview. It is true that Article 9 of Decree No. 1212/89 provided that \"oil prices shall be freely agreed upon\" and also that the regulation implementing Articles 2 and 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law contained in Decree No. 1055/89 was aimed at replacing governmental intervention in price setting with a market-oriented mechanism of setting prices based on supply and demand. However, it is also true that Article 6 of Decree No. 1589/89 expressly incorporates the rule contained in Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law. Therefore, even after the enactment of the Deregulation Decrees, the government reserved to itself the power to restrict producers\u2019 rights freely to dispose of petroleum and petroleum by-products both domestically and internationally. Thus, under Argentina\u2019s legal regime (as it existed when Total acquired the concession), the government could fix the domestic price of those products (even without having regard to the international price in certain circumstances). Further, it was required that the petroleum produced be used to meet domestic needs first, such that petroleum could be exported only if the domestic market did not need it.\n\n427.\n\nIn light of the above, Total\u2019s right freely to dispose of petroleum does not entail the right freely to fix its prices or to export it without limitations. Contrary to Total\u2019s statements that \"the Concession Decree lays out the guarantee of export without restriction as set out in Decree No. 1589, which is incorporated by reference in Article 6 of the Concession Decree\"598 and that \"[I]n the Concession Decree, Total was promised the right to full ownership and free disposal of the crude oil it produced under the relevant concessions,\"599 there was no guarantee that oil could be exported or absolute freedom to negotiate the commercialization price under the concession.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 748.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 733.\n\n***6. Measures Challenged by the Claimant Relating to Crude Oil***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***6.1 Domestic Sales of Crude Oil***\n-------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nWith regard to the domestic sale of crude oil and crude oil by-products, the Tribunal notes that the measures challenged by Total are the pesification of its longterm contracts with distributors (Article 11 of the Emergency Law)600 and the imposition by Argentina of export taxes on crude oil starting from January 2002.601\n\nTotal refers to pesification and its effects when it claims that its freedom to negotiate domestic prices with distributors was suppressed, see above para. 390.\n\nSee Total\u2019s claim as set forth above paras. 397-404.\n\n429.\n\nAs concerns pesification, the Tribunal recalls its findings in respect of Total\u2019s claim concerning TGN.602 The pesification was a measure of general application to all sectors of Argentina\u2019s economy and to all legal obligations expressed in monetary terms within the country. It was a devaluation and redenomination of the national currency within the monetary sovereignty of the State. Moreover, this measure was taken in good faith in a situation of recognized economic emergency of an exceptional nature. In this context, a series of measures, having harsh effects on the population (such as the blocking of withdrawals from banks - *corralito),* was taken in order to avoid a general collapse of the economy, and hence of the State and society, and to foster a progressive recovery. As already stressed by the Tribunal, this measure and its application cannot be considered as being unfair in the circumstances, considering the inherent flexibility of fair and equitable treatment standard. Unfairness must be evaluated in respect of the measures challenged, in the light of both their objective effects and the reasons that have led to their adoption (subjective good faith, proportionality to the aims and legitimacy of those aims according to general practice). It is, therefore, not possible to share Total\u2019s view, developed in particular in the LECG Report, that pesification was a breach of Total\u2019s treaty rights, the effects of which must be factored for in the calculation of damages suffered by Total for which it claims compensation under the BIT. Such changes in general legislation, in the absence of specific stabilization promises to the foreign investor, reflect a legitimate exercise of the host State\u2019s governmental powers that are not prevented by, and do not breach, the fair and equitable treatment obligation under a BIT. The general character, good faith and absence of discrimination by Argentina, as well as the exceptional circumstances that led Argentina to adopt the measures at issue, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, objectively preclude a finding that Argentina thereby breached the fair and equitable treatment obligations incumbent on it under the BIT.\n\nSee above paras. 163-165.\n\n430.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the pesification of the economy, that is the elimination of the fixed link to the US dollar, necessarily also entailed the de-dollarisation of private contracts and public service tariffs The 1:1 rate reflected the impossibility for holders of debt in US dollars to pay the market rate for the US dollar when all of their claims, income, etc., had been converted forcibly and necessarily at the official rate while the peso had devaluated by two-thirds. The de-dollarisation of contracts was thus a non-discriminatory measure of general application applied to all the sectors of the economy and to all inhabitants of Argentina. The Tribunal notes that the Emergency Law, while having pesified all private contracts, provided that they could be renegotiated to mitigate negative effects. In fact, Total renegotiatied existing crude oil contracts with its customers as reported by the LECG Report on Damages.603\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 170 at p. 89.\n\n431.\n\nTherefore the Tribunal is of the view that, contrary to Total\u2019s claim, the pesification of oil domestic sale contracts does not entail a breach of the fair and equitable standard treatment by Argentina. As a consequence, Total\u2019s claim of indemnification of losses due to the pesification of the domestic oil prices must be dismissed.\n\n***6.2 Export Taxes on Crude Oil***\n-----------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nAs to the export taxes on crude oil imposed by Argentina as from January 2002, Article 6 of the Emergency Law authorised the government to increase the direct taxes on the export of hydrocarbons to increase the government revenues needed to address the emergency in the banking and financial sector. According to the Claimant, following Argentina\u2019s enactment of successive measures (implementing Article 6 of the Emergency Law), \"[d]epending on the international price of oil, the nominal rates of export withholding taxes now range from 25% to 45%\".604\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 175 at p. 92.\n\n433.\n\nTotal complains both of the direct effects of the imposition of crude oil export taxes on its exports and of their indirect effects on its domestic sales. According to Total, the export taxes on crude oil had the general effect of curtailing exports and were \"in violation of the export guarantees of the Concession Decree and the Deregulation Decrees requiring one year\u2019s notice and compensation for any restriction or duty imposed on the export of liquid hydrocarbons\".605 However, Total has not alleged that the imposition of those export taxes has actually interfered with or restricted existing or planned crude oil export contracts. Total rather complains *in abstracto* of the general effect of those taxes as limiting exports and claims that Argentina\u2019s introduction of the export taxes amounts to an export \"restriction\" that is in breach of its rights under the Concession Decree.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 739.\n\n434.\n\nIn any case, as already outlined above at paragraphs 426-427, Argentina did not grant Total absolute freedom to export crude oil under the concession. Total has not proved (nor in fact claims) that Argentina has actually enacted \"restrictions\" on exports of crude oil that specifically and in concreto have impaired Total\u2019s crude oil exports. The export taxes challenged cannot be considered as \"restrictions\" under Argentina\u2019s relevant regime. They are rather fiscal measures (to which oil producing and exporting countries normally have recourse) that are generally applicable to crude oil exporters (and not addressed specifically to Total nor especially affecting Total's export contracts). Moreover, these export taxes are part of \"general fiscal legislation\" to which Total is subject in accordance with Article 9, first sentence, of the Concession Decree. Total\u2019s argument that the export taxes are contrary to Article 9, second sentence of the Concession Decree appears to be groundless. According to this provision, Total is not subject to \"the provisions that may be imposed in a discriminatory way on or specifically in relation with the person, the judicial condition, or the activity of the permit holder or the assets intended for the execution of the respective areas.\". This means that Total cannot be subject to taxes and duties imposed only on its operations or specifically linked to the areas to be exploited by Total under the relevant concession, such as local and provincial taxes. By contrast Total may be subject, in accordance with Article 9, first sentence, to state taxes of general application, as are crude oil export taxes, which are not contrary to Article 9, second sentence of the Concession Decree. Therefore, by imposing them Argentina has not acted in breach of its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to Total\u2019s investments to which Total is entitled under Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n435.\n\nThe principal complaint of Total as to crude oil export taxes is, rather, the alleged indirect negative effect of such taxes on the domestic price of oil. Total contends that the measures imposing export taxes on crude oil had the effect of reducing its domestic price, limiting Total\u2019s right to sell crude oil (and crude oil by-products) at a freely negotiated price in the domestic market.606 Also this argument is not convincing for the following reasons. First, the imposition by Argentina of crude oil export taxes does not prevent Total from selling crude oil (and crude oil by-products) in the domestic market (or abroad) or from choosing its counterparties. Secondly, even if it were accepted that the export taxes had the indirect effect of reducing the domestic price of oil as Total alleges, this is not contrary to Total\u2019s right of free disposal of crude oil (and crude oil by-products). This is because this right was subject to the potential for government intervention in accordance with Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law. This law provided explicitly that the Executive may fix the domestic price of crude oil in case of a significant increase in the price of imported crude oil (which obviously reflects international prices) due to exceptional circumstances. Thirdly, the crude oil export taxes imposed by Argentina had the purpose (as stated in the Emergency Law) of providing additional resources to the State in the crisis situation taking place in 2002. The further increase in 2007 was intended to recoup resources from the extra profits of exporters and specifically to disconnect the domestic oil market from the extraordinary increase in international prices.607 Total asserts that this last tax \"is discriminatory, confiscatory and has its purpose the manipulation of the national hydrocarbons market\".608 Absent any evidence that this \"disconnection\" was arbitrary or confiscatory, this alleged purpose is irrelevant.609 Nor can Total invoke any promise by Argentina to be exempt from application of its general fiscal legislation because the concession does not promise such fiscal stability. Additionally, the Tribunal notes that such \"windfall profit taxes\" on oil are currently common and have been introduced in many oil producing countries including in the industrialized world.610\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 740 ff. and LECG Report on Damages, para. 178 ff. See the text of Article 9 of the Concession Decree at paragraph 359 above.\n\nSee the Preamble of Resolution 394/07, at Exhibit C-708(d).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 759.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial (at p. 157), Argentina has supplied a graphic (shown also as a slide at the Hearings in the merits) which indicates that, when the export tax was introduced in 2002, the price of oil was around $20. In 2006, the price increased to more than $60, of which about $20 went into taxes.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 617 listing a number of oil producing and exporting countries which have adopted such increases in recent years. See also ***The Economist,*** 20 Sept. 2008, Special Report on Globalization, p. 18. See T. W\u00e4lde, A. Kolo, ***Investor-State Disputes: The Interface Between Treaty-Based International Investment Protection and Fiscal Sovereignty,*** 35 ***Interfax*** (2007) 424, 443. The two authors point to \u2018normal\u2019 state practice in tax matters as a yardstick to judge whether or not host states\u2019 conduct in tax matters is in breach of an investment treaty regime.\n\n436.\n\nFor all of the above-mentioned reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the crude oil export taxes were not enacted by Argentina in violation of Total\u2019s rights and, consequently, that the taxes are not in violation of Total\u2019s legitimate and reasonable expectations. Thus the measures are not in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n***7. Elimination of the Tierra del Fuego Tax Exemption***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nWith respect to the elimination of the tax exemption, Total complains that Argentina, by Resolution 776/06,611 from the time of the enactment of the Emergency Law, retroactively eliminated the exemption from customs duties that was applicable to production in Tierra del Fuego.612 Total complains that Argentina thereby \"eviscerated the immunity from customs duties it had guaranteed to Total with respect to investments made in Tierra del Fuego.\"613\n\nSee Exhibit C-575.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 764 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 765.\n\n438.\n\nIn fact, Resolution 776/06 eliminated retroactively the exemption by stating that Article 6 of the Emergency Law intended *ab origine* to subject all oil exports, including those from Tierra del Fuego, to the newly established export tax.\n\n439.\n\nIn addition to Total\u2019s complaint regarding the retroactive elimination by Resolution 776/06 of the exemption from customs dutie.s' concerning Tierra del Fuego, Total also complains of the express elimination of the exemption granted in Law 19,640 of 1972 by Law 26,217 in 2007.614\n\nTotal\u2019s refers in its Post-Hearing Brief (para. 767 ff.) to the written testimony of its manager Michel Contie (Second Statement, at Annex N to the Reply, para. 22) and to his cross-examination at the Hearing on the merits (Transcript (English) Day 4, 1050:7-1051:1. See also Total\u2019s Reply, para. 261 ff.\n\n440.\n\nAs to the elimination of the exemption granted in Law 19,640 of 1972 by Law 26,217 of 2007,615 the Tribunal does not see any basis for concluding that the 1972 Tierra del Fuego exemption could not be revoked by a later statutory enactment. The 1972 Law did not guarantee any minimum period of application (it had remained in force in any case for 30 years). On the contrary, Article 13(c) of Law 19,640 expressly stated that future taxes would be applicable if the legislative acts introducing them explicitly provided that this was the case. Therefore, the elimination in 2007 of the exemption from customs duties concerning Tierra del Fuego is applicable to Total (and its investments) since Law 26,217 of 2007 explicitly so provides. As a conclusion, this law is not in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT. Total also objects to the elimination of the tax exemption, relying on an exemption, which Argentina obtained from the MERCOSUR Council in 1994, that allowed Argentina to maintain the special Tierra del Fuego custom regime until 2013.616 This authorisation did not, however, compel Argentina to retain the exemption until 2013 nor could it create a right or form the basis for a legitimate expectation by a private beneficiary such as Total that the regime would remain in force until 2013.617\n\nSee Exhibit C-613.\n\nSee Exhibit C-314.\n\nTotal states at para. 262 of its Reply that Argentina had assured Total, during the renegotiation of Contract 19,944, that the maintenance of the custom regime would be authorised by MERCOSUR. The Tribunal is not convinced by the documents and testimonies supplied by Total in support of this statement.\n\n441.\n\nAs to the distinct challenge by Total of the retroactive revocation of the exemption by Resolution 776 with effect from 2002, the Tribunal takes note that Total has submitted certain statements issued by Argentina\u2019s administrative authorities in 2002 and 2004 to the effect that the export taxes were not applicable to exports from Tierra del Fuego. These statements stated that such exports had remained exempted from those taxes.618 The convoluted reasoning in the preamble of Resolution 776/06 to the contrary is not convincing. Moreover, Argentina\u2019s competent authorities had confirmed by those statements the non-applicability of the new taxes (specifically in response to Total\u2019s request) for almost four years. This makes the change of position of Argentina\u2019s authorities in 2006 a breach of a specific promise made to Total and, therefore, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in the BIT. Furthermore, the Tribunal recalls that Articles 13(c) of Law 19,640 of 1972619 requires an express legislative enactment to effect a future elimination of the export tax exemption. Since the Emergency Law did not contain such an explicit statement, Resolution 776/06 could not by way of interpretation cure the absence of the specific provision required to eliminate the exemption from customs duties applicable to Tierra del Fuego in conformity with Law 19,640.\n\nSee MoE General Instruction 19/02, dated 26 March 2002 at Exhibit C-406; ***Subdireccion General de Legal y Tecnica,*** Nota 1318/04 DI ASLE, dated 1 July 2004 at Exhibit C-703(b); Legal and Technical Customs Deputy Director Opinion 128/04, dated 21 September 2004 at Exhibit C-478.\n\nLaw 19,640/72 at Exhibit C-292.\n\n442.\n\nThe claim by Argentina that Total is liable to pay back taxes under Resolution 776/06 is thus in breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment in Article 3 of the BIT. Clearly no argument of necessity can be entertained to oppose such a conclusion. Total has explained that the collection of the tax for 2002-2006 is currently suspended while Total Austral has engaged in a judicial domestic challenge of the tax claim. In view of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion above, if Argentina\u2019s authorities enforce Resolution 776/06 and obtain from Total Austral the payment of the export taxes from 2002 to 2007 *(i.e.,* as of the date of entry into force of Law 26,217) through domestic litigation or otherwise, Argentina would thereby commit an additional breach of Total\u2019s rights under Article 3 of the BIT. In such an event, Total would be entitled to recover, as damages, whatever amount Total Austral would have been compelled to pay and any costs incidental thereto.\n\n443.\n\nIn respect of the above-mentioned domestic litigation, Argentina has raised a preliminary exception based on the \"fork in the road\" provision of Article 8.2 of the BIT.620 Argentina claims that, since Total has pursued its opposition to the retroactive application of the afore-mentioned export taxes from Tierra del Fuego in Argentina\u2019s courts, Total is precluded from raising this claim in this arbitration under the BIT. Total rejects the invocation of Article 8(2) by Argentina because the present arbitration was initiated before the domestic litigation so that its claim concerning this issue must be viewed as predating the domestic proceedings. Total explains that its specific claim against Argentina\u2019s demand for the tax payment at issue is ancillary to Total\u2019s initial arbitration request, to which it was added when Argentina requested payment of those taxes in 2006, while these proceedings were pending. The Tribunal does not need to deal with this issue because it considers that the two proceedings have a different object. The object of the arbitration before this Tribunal is the alleged breach of the BIT by Argentina\u2019s demand for retroactive tax payment; the claim before Argentina\u2019s domestic courts is that the demand is in breach of Argentina\u2019s law. Further, the claimant in the domestic proceedings for *amparo* is Total\u2019s subsidiary, Total Austral, and not Total itself. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view therefore that Article 8.2 of the BIT is not applicable.\n\nIn accordance with Article 8 of Argentina-France BIT, an investor of either Contracting Party can choose to submit \"any dispute relating to investments made under this Agreement\" with the other Contracting Party to the domestic courts thereof or to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration. However, according to Article 8(2) \"once an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party concerned or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other of these procedures is final.\" See Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras 151 ff. On 16 November 2010 Argentina submitted to the Tribunal the text of a decision dated 25 August 2009 by the \"C\u00e1mara Contenciosa Administrativa Federal\" which in the recourse by Total\u2019s subsidiary mentioned in the text has declared Resolution 776/2006 unconstitutional. The Claimant has commented on 30 November 2010 that this decision has been revoked by an attached decision of the Supreme Court of 18 November 2010, submitting that these decisions \"are of no relevance to the proceedings\". The Tribunal recalls that it has decided not to take into consideration new evidence and arguments submitted by the Parties subsequent to the post-hearings briefs (see para. 20 above) and determines that the submission of Argentina of 30 November 2010 is in any case irrelevant.\n\n444.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the retroactive elimination of the Tierra del Fuego tax exemption effected by Argentina through the enactment of Resolution 776/06 is in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT. Consequently, any Argentine authorities\u2019 request of payment of export taxes addressed to Total for its exports from Tierra del Fuego concerning the period from 2002 to the entry into force of Law 26,217 in 2007 would be in breach of the BIT.\n\n***8. Domestic and International Sale of Natural Gas***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls (as stated above in paragraph 383) that Total\u2019s claims in this respect are based on Argentina\u2019s guarantee to Total of full property rights over, and full rights freely to dispose of, hydrocarbons produced that is enshrined in Article 6 of the Concession Decree. According to Total, this guarantee must be understood as entailing \"the right to sell the hydrocarbons it extracts to its willing counterparties in the amount and for the price it negotiates.\"621\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 69.\n\n446.\n\nAs to its private law contracts for the domestic sale of natural gas, Total has claimed that the following measures are in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause: (i) the pesification of all private law contracts (including Total\u2019s private law contracts) through Article 11 of the Emergency Law because it eviscerated \"Total\u2019s all property rights over hydrocarbons produced, including the right freely to dispose of its hydrocarbons by artificially re-denominating the price that had been freely negotiated between the contracting parties\"622; (ii) the pesification of the gas tariffs (including the reference price used to calculate the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff) because it \"limited the revenues of Total\u2019s distributor customers for the sale of gas to consumers and, therefore, rendered renegotiation of Total\u2019s pesified contracts futile\";623 (iii) the freezing of the gas tariffs at 2001 levels because Argentina, by establishing a maximum reference price that distributors could charge for the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff, nullified any possibility that Total could have had to renegotiate its supply contracts with distributors.624 As stated by LECG Report on Damages, \"this measure meant the de-facto intervention of wellhead price formation in the natural gas market.\"625\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 689.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 70 (b) and 690-694.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 70 (c).\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 90 b at p. 45.\n\n447.\n\nAs to the pesification of Total\u2019s private contracts and the pesification of the gas tariffs (the reference gas price included), the Tribunal recalls its finding and reasoning concerning the same measure in relation to Total\u2019s claim regarding its investments in TGN at paragraphs 159-165 above; namely, the Tribunal has concluded that the pesification was not in breach of the BIT, being a measure of general application justified by the circumstances and applied without discrimination.\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal now with the freezing of the Consumer Gas Tariff. The Tribunal recalls that it has in part analyzed the legal regime for the sale of natural gas, when it dealt with the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law and those contained in the Concession Decree referring explicitly to the Hydrocarbons Law and the Deregulation Decrees (at paragraphs 421-425 above). For this reason, the Tribunal will focus here only on the features of the legal regime for the sale of natural gas that are relevant in order to evaluate whether the freezing of gas tariffs effected by Argentina was in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Hydrocarbons Law is referred to in Article 6 of the Concession Decree. Pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 7 of the Hydrocarbons Law of 1967, \"gas commercialization and supply is subject to the further regulations set out by the Executive\". These further regulations are contained in the Deregulation Decrees of 1989 and in the Gas Law of 1992.\n\n450.\n\nIn turn, Article 10, paragraph 1 of Decree No. 1212/89 provided that \"natural gas prices for users and producers shall be determined on a monthly basis by the MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND SERVICES, through the SECRETARY OF ENERGY, until multiple suppliers market conditions are generated.\" According to Article 10, paragraph 4, first sentence, the Consumer Gas Tariff has to be fixed \"based on the producer price, plus conditioning, transport and distribution costs\". If the Consumer Gas Tariff is fixed below the latter basis, \"the amount of the corresponding subsidy shall be determined, with charge to general profits\" (Article 10 paragraph 4 second sentence). Finally, \"the producer price shall be determined on a \"netback\" basis, with transport and conditioning costs based on international values\" (Article 10 paragraph 5). This regulation was, however, superseded in 1992 by the successive enactment of the Gas Law.626\n\nArticle 1, paragraph 1 of the Gas Law states that it applies to transport and distribution of natural gas while the Hydrocarbons Law remains applicable to its production, extraction and treatment. According to Article 1, paragraph 2 of the Gas Law the Hydrocarbons Law is applicable also to transport and distribution of natural gas only when the Gas Law refers expressly to its provisions.\n\n451.\n\nAs already outlined by the Tribunal in respect of Total\u2019s claim in relation to TGN, the Gas Law states a series of paramount principles by which the gas regime and ENARGAS enforcement activity shall be guided (Article 2). The objectives of the Gas Law can be summarized as follows: the protection of consumer rights, encouraging the competitiveness \"of the natural gas production and demand markets\" and fostering investments for the purpose of guaranteeing the long-term gas supply. According to Article 37, the Consumer Gas Tariff \"shall be the sum of: a) the wellhead price of gas in the loading point to the transmission system; b) the gas transportation tariff; and c) the gas distribution tariff.\" In addition, Article 38(c) provides that the gas sale price that distributors charge to consumers shall include the cost of gas purchases. With regard to the contracts concluded after the coming into force of the Law, ENARGAS may prevent these costs from being charged to consumers if it determines that they are higher than the gas supply prices negotiated by other distributors in similar conditions.\n\n452.\n\nOn the basis of the analysis above, the Tribunal concludes that the Argentine natural gas market (as it existed when Total acquired the relevant concession) was not a free market. Instead, it was a state regulated market in accordance with both Decree 1212/89 and the subsequent Gas Law (as well as the Hydrocarbons Law). The Tribunal notes also that, from an economic point of view, the LECG Report on Damages acknowledges that [natural gas] \"[... ] unlike crude oil or LPG, is not a fully tradable commodity\" and, therefore, \"its prices are not necessarily linked to international parity levels (that is, neither import nor export prices have to be the same as prices in the domestic market).\"627\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 92.\n\n453.\n\nAfter having given an overview of the relevant legal regime, the Tribunal will turn now to the evaluation of the freezing of the Consumer Gas Tariff under the BIT. Total specifically contends that Argentina, by fixing the well-head price component of the Consumers Gas Tariff from June 2002 to August 2004 (ENARGAS Resolution 2612/02 dated 24 June 2002 and successive Resolutions628), acted contrary to the Gas Law629 and Total\u2019s rights under the relevant concession. In particular, these measures prevented Total from negotiating the domestic natural gas price with its counterparties and fixed such a depressed gas price as to be unsustainable and incapable of allowing producers to receive an acceptable rate of return.630\n\nThese successive ENARGAS Resolutions are referred to by the Tribunal at note 532 above and are listed in Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 823 at page 270.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 696.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 705.\n\n454.\n\nIt is true that the concession accorded Total the right to dispose of the natural gas. However, this right was not absolute, taking into account the content of Argentina\u2019s general legal enactments governing the gas market incorporated by reference in the concession, as outlined above. This results from the text of Article 6 of Decree 1589/89. Specifically, Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 envisages restrictions being imposed on the \"free availability\" of gas by the government. The provision states, however, in this case that \"the price of ONE THOUSAND CUBIC METERS (1000 m3) of gas at NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED KILOCALORIES (9,300 kilocalories) shall not be inferior to THIRTY PERCENT (35%) of the international price for a cubic meter of Arabian Light at 34\u00b0 API.\" In applying this rule, the gas prices fixed by Argentina should not have been below \"(35%) of the international price for a cubic meter of Arabian Light at 34\u00b0 API.\"631\n\nThis is stressed by Total in its Post Hearing Brief, paras. 73 and 714.\n\n455.\n\nTotal complains that the domestic gas prices resulting from the measures mentioned above were unsustainable from the gas producing companies\u2019 point of view and were incapable of allowing producers to receive an acceptable rate of return.632 The Tribunal understands that the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API was precisely a guarantee to producers of a given minimum price in case of future restrictions. Nevertheless, while invoking the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API as a benchmark for compensation in case restrictions are imposed, Total does not submit any evidence enabling the Tribunal to gather that the price resulting from the measures was below 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API. Nor does Argentina give any indication to the Tribunal that the price resulting from the measures was above this benchmark. In the light of the analysis above, the Tribunal considers that, in so far as Argentina has fixed the domestic price of gas below the relevant benchmark without providing for compensation to Total as required by Article 6 of Decree 1589/89, Argentina has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT. This would constitute an unfair and unreasonable interference with Total\u2019s rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the Concession.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 705 where Total also refers to the study on the effect of Argentina\u2019s Measures conducted by Mr Guich\u00f3n, Argentina\u2019s witness on the Exploration and Production sector.\n\n456.\n\nIf this is, in fact, the case, Total is entitled to damages for this breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard amounting to the difference between the actual price and the benchmark price. Argentina\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable treatment -subject to evidence showing that domestic gas prices resulting from the enacted measures were below 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API - took place from June 2002 to April 2004. This is because of the Price Path Recovery Agreement agreed between the government and gas producers (Total included) that was signed on 2 April 2004.633 The Price Path Recovery Agreement provided for progressive increases by the SoE of the well-head price of natural gas applicable to industrial consumers between May 2004 and July 2005, with the aim of liberalising the well-head prices for industrial consumers as of August 2005. It set out a different recovery regime for prices for residential consumers, providing for the liberalisation of those prices as of January 1, 2007.634\n\nThe Price Path Recovery Agreement that had as an object ***\"la Implementaci\u00f3n del Esquema de Normalizaci\u00f3n de los Precios del Gas Natural en Punto de Ingreso al Sistema de Trasporte...\"*** to be completed by 31 December 2006, was concluded on April 2, 2004 and then approved by the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investments and Services with Resolution 208/04 dated 21 April 2004 (Exhibit C-208).\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, paras 159-160; Total\u2019s Reply, para. 242 (as to the ***Acta Acuerdo*** see also See Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 705-709).\n\n457.\n\nThere is no reason for the Tribunal to consider that Total has not validly agreed to the recovery system described above by signing the Price Path Recovery Agreement with Argentina\u2019s authorities. Total has not challenged the validity of this Agreement. Instead Total has complained that, although during the course of the negotiations \"the producers sought a full recovery of the market-based method for determining the price of natural gas at the well-head, and compensation for the losses incurred in the aftermath of the Measures... Argentina refused to compensate the producers for past losses.\"635 The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Total\u2019s right to invoke the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil (34\u00b0 API) standard of compensation concerns the period from June 2002 to April 2004. Further details, including the relevance, if so, of Argentina not having fully implemented the Price Path Recovery Agreement, as Total complains, should be left to the quantum phase.636\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, para 158 and Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 708-709. Mr. Grosjean, who signed the Price Path Recovery Agreement for Total, testified at the Hearing on the merits that Total did not waive any rights vis-\u00e0-vis Argentina by signing the Agreement, despite Argentina having asked the producers to do so (Transcript (English) Day 3, 892:13-22-893:1-3). In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this statement, which is not reflected in the text of the Agreement or any other contemporary document, cannot invalidate the content of the Price Path Recovery Agreement in respect to the gas prices agreed by the parties according to its terms. Cf. the cross-examination of Mr. Grosjean, Transcript (English) Day 4, 935:10-22; 936: 1-4.\n\nSee paras. 371, 390 above and Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 708-709. The Price Path Recovery Agreement was later extended by another agreement (Resolution SE 599/07 dated 14 June 2007, Exhibit A RA 269).\n\n458.\n\nTotal makes two claims regarding the limitation of gas exports. First, Total complains of the negative effect on its revenue due to the introduction by Argentina of natural gas export taxes.637 Second, Total claims that the measures that Argentina enacted in March 2004 to respond to the gas shortage in the domestic market - such as SoE Resolution 265 and Undersecretary of Fuels Disposition 27/04 (together, the Gas Rationing Program) and SoE Resolution 659/04 (which replaced in June 2004 the Gas Rationing Program with a new one) - interfered with the export contracts that Total had entered into with various Chilean companies to the point of preventing Total from performing those contracts.638 These export contracts had been authorised in accordance with Article 3 paragraph 2 of the Gas Law (no objections had been made to the export contracts submitted by Total within 90 days).639 In particular, Total contends that \"as a direct result of Resolution 659, Total suffered losses for the redirection of natural gas originally destined for export to Chile, which was sold instead to specific consumers in the domestic market below export price. In short, Argentina put Total in a position where it had no choice but to breach the contracts with its Chilean counterparties and to receive as much as two-thirds less per MBTUs from the customers to whom it was ordered to sell its gas.\"640 In addition, Argentina had not provided for the compensation it had guaranteed to Total under the Concession Decree.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the effect of the natural gas export taxes, see LECG Report on Damages, paras. 103-105 and 111-112.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 722-725.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 75-78.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 726.\n\n459.\n\nAs to the first complaint concerning the negative effect on its revenue due to the introduction by Argentina of natural gas export taxes, the Tribunal recalls its previous findings based on Argentina\u2019s regime applicable to the subject matter. The Tribunal considers therefore that export limitations imposed to ensure domestic supply were lawful under the applicable legislation so that their application (however unwise they might have been from an economic point of view) cannot be considered *per se* in breach of the BIT. Furthermore, gas export taxes cannot be labelled as restrictions on Total\u2019s rights of free disposition of gas. The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the export limitations imposed by Argentina to ensure domestic supply are not in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n460.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal reaches a different conclusion regarding Total\u2019s second claim concerning its export contracts.641 The Tribunal recalls here that, under Argentina\u2019s legal framework, the export of natural gas should be authorised by ENARGAS within 90 days \"on the basis of sufficiency of supply in the internal market\". Taking into account this mechanism for authorisation, Argentina\u2019s interference with Total\u2019s export contracts was in breach of Argentina\u2019s own law..642 It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that once an export contract had been duly authorised pursuant to the domestic applicable legal regime, the subsequent withdrawal of those contractual rights at least constitutes unfair treatment as Total has argued.643 Argentina\u2019s argument that Total has prevailed in the litigations started by its Chilean buyers for breach of the export contract, because Total successfully invoked \"force majeure\" on the basis of Argentina\u2019s interference, appears irrelevant to the Tribunal.644 Total is entitled in any case to be compensated by Argentina for its loss of reasonably expected profits under these contracts since this loss is due to Argentina\u2019s interference with Total\u2019s export contracts in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT. In respect of the above-mentioned breach, Total\u2019s damages should be based on the difference between the domestic prices it received for the gas redirected and sold in the domestic market and the export prices agreed in export contracts.645 As to the duration of Total\u2019s export contracts, the relevant period will have to be determined in the quantum phase based on the evidence that the parties submit.\n\nIn respect of these export contracts see extensively ***supra*** para. 361 and note 488.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses Argentina\u2019s plea of necessity at paras. 482 ff. hereunder.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Argentina\u2019s conduct at issue here could also be labelled as (and could amount to) an expropriation of contractual rights without compensation. In this respect Total has, however, invoked the breach of Article 3 of the BIT rather than the breach of Article 5.2 of the BIT.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 633.\n\nIn any case, the exact calculation of Total\u2019s damages and its basis will have to be dealt with in the quantum phase, avoiding any double recovery.\n\n461.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal concludes that the export taxes introduced by Argentina after 2002, and the limitations on gas exports in general, are not in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT. In contrast the Tribunal concludes that the measures by which Argentina has specifically interfered with Total\u2019s gas export contracts that had been duly authorised by Argentina\u2019s authorities are in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT.\n\n***9. Pricing of LPG***\n-----------------------\n\n462.\n\nIn its final claim related to hydrocarbon exploration and production, Total argues that Law 26,020 of 2005 (the so-called LPG Law)646 and subsequent resolutions violated its rights under the Concession Decree of full ownership and free disposal of crude oil.647\n\nLaw 26,020 dated 8 April 2005 at Exhibit A RA 170.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 95. In any case, the Tribunal recalls here that the first relevant measure enacted by Argentina as to the LPG sector was the LPG Agreement of 2002 (the ***\"Acuerdo de Estabilidad en el Precio Mayorista de Gas Licuado de Petroleo en el Mercado Argentina\")*** between the Executive and LPG producers, Total Austral included (in this regard see below para. 474).\n\n463.\n\nBefore dealing with Total\u2019s claim regarding LPG production and sale, the Tribunal considers it useful to clarify two points. First, as is apparent from Total\u2019s submissions, Total submits that the same legal regime governing crude oil also applies in respect of LPG production and commercialization, LPG being considered as an oil derivative.648 Second, while Argentina has pointed out that Total has waived any right it could be entitled to when it signed the LPG Agreement,649 Total makes clear that it \"... has no claims for losses under the LPG Agreement. Its losses arise under the LPG Law.\"650 It is Total\u2019s view that Argentina\u2019s enactment of the LPG Law breached the Total\u2019s rights because the LPG Law prevented Total from negotiating free market prices for the LPG that it produced.\n\nSee also LECG Report on Damages, footnote 163 at page 97.\n\nResolution 196/02 (at Exhibit A RA 113)\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 96 (a).\n\n464.\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal notes that Total has not elaborated in detail its claim with respect to the LPG sector either in its Post-Hearing Brief or in its previous submissions. On the other hand, Mr. M. A. Abdala and Mr. T. Spiller, the experts appointed by Total, dealt more extensively with Total\u2019s claim concerning LPG in their Report than Total itself in its memorials. In particular the LECG Report considers as government measures, the impact of which it takes into account for the purpose of calculating Total\u2019s damages, the following measures: the introduction of export taxes on LPG since March 2002; the imposition in 2006 of taxes on hydrocarbon exports from Tierra del Fuego; and the enactment of the LPG Law.651 It is noteworthy that, with the exception of the measures relating to the LPG Law and the export taxes, Total\u2019s memorials did not present arguments relating to the above mentioned measures listed in the LECG Report in support of its claim with respect to LPG.652\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para 65, points c), d) and e). As to the introduction of export taxes on LPG and the elimination of the tax-exemption concerning Tierra del Fuego, see more extensively LECG Report on Damages, paras. 81-85 and 184-185. As to the price intervention through the enactment of the LPG Law, see more extensively LECG Report on Damages, paras. 86-89 and 186-188.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 763.\n\n465.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal has inferred from the brief part of Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief concerning LPG claim that the thrust of Total\u2019s argument in this respect is that Argentina\u2019s regulatory intervention through the LPG Law653 interfered with Total\u2019s right of free disposition of crude oil (its derivatives included) as enshrined in the Concession Decree. The Tribunal is familiar with this legal argument in spite of its brief exposition given by Total in respect to LPG claim, because Total developed it extensively in respect of the hydrocarbon sector in general and the Tribunal has already discussed it in detail above. However, the LECG Report bases the quantum calculation concerning LPG on further alleged breaches resulting from other measures besides the LPG Law and export taxes.\n\nTotal\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. ***TV&-T19.***\n\n466.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, considers it appropriate to evaluate in respect of Total\u2019s claims both the LPG Law and the afore-mentioned measures listed in the LECG Report. This approach is taken by the Tribunal notwithstanding that, absent any specific claim by Total in respect to the afore-mentioned measures listed in the LECG Report or any reference by Total in its memorials to the arguments put forward by the LECG Report, the Tribunal does not believe that it could (or should) take into account the LECG Report alone in order to find a breach by Argentina of the BIT or as a basis for the establishment of damages thereunder. For the sake of completeness and clarity, however, the Tribunal will deal with all the above measures separately in the following paragraphs, irrespective of whether the measures are challenged directly by Total in its memorials or by its experts alone in their report.\n\n467.\n\nAs to the pesification of LPG prices, as already stated with regard to the other claims submitted by Total and for the same reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that the pesification effected by Argentina was in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers Total\u2019s claim of indemnification of losses due to pesification as unfounded also in respect of LPG operations.\n\n468.\n\nAs to Argentina\u2019s imposition of taxes on hydrocarbon exports from Tierra del Fuego in 2006, and any demand for payment thereof by Argentina, the Tribunal has already stated above that the retroactive elimination of the Tierra del Fuego tax exemption effected by Argentina through the enactment of Resolution 776/06 is in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT. Furthermore, the Tribunal has already concluded above that any Argentine authorities\u2019 request for payment of export taxes addressed to Total for its exports from Tierra del Fuego concerning the period from 2002 to 2007 would be in breach of the BIT. The same Tribunal\u2019s findings and holdings have to be applied with regard to any export of LPG from Tierra del Fuego carried out by Total Austral.\n\n469.\n\nAccording to the LECG Report on Damages, Total\u2019s claim relating to the export taxes imposed by Argentina on LPG as of 2002 has two prongs. More specifically, the LECG Report on Damages states that \"the imposition of withholding taxes on LPG exports has effects analogous to those imposed for the crude oil market.\"654 The claim is that, on the one hand, Argentina\u2019s introduction of taxes on the export of LPG reduced the prices received by producers for sale of LPG in the international market, thereby limiting their exports of the product and reducing their revenues. On the other hand, the same taxes artificially reduced LPG prices in the domestic market.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 184.\n\n470.\n\nAs to the negative impacts of the export taxes on both Total right to export LPG without limitations and on Total\u2019s revenue, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recall its findings regarding the crude oil export taxes at paragraph 434. The challenged export taxes imposed by Argentina cannot be considered as \"restrictions\" under Argentina\u2019s regime. They are instead fiscal measures (to which oil producing and exporting countries normally have recourse) generally addressed to the exporters of crude oil and their derivatives (not specifically to Total). These export taxes are part of \"the general fiscal legislation\" to which Total is subject in accordance with Article 9, first sentence, of the Concession Decree. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that these export taxes did not affect directly Total\u2019s operations or any LPG export contract concluded by Total with other counterparties. On the contrary, even if it were accepted that the export taxes could be classified as restrictions, they negatively affected Transportadora de Gas del Sur (TGS) transactions as Total\u2019s experts conceded.655 TGS is a company unrelated to Total, which processes most of the LPG produced by Total Austral in Argentina, and carries out all of the export sales of that product.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 82.\n\n471.\n\nFor the reasons already stated above, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the introduction of LPG export taxes was not in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the Concession Decree either directly as \"restrictions\" on exports or indirectly because of their depressing effect, if any, on domestic prices.\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal must now address Total\u2019s main claim concerning LPG prices, namely that the LPG Law set prices in breach of Total\u2019s right under the Concession Decree to sell LPG at freely negotiated prices in the domestic market. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls its conclusions in the previous paragraphs, that Total had not an absolute right to negotiate the commercialization price of crude oil and its derivatives under the Concession Decree. Total\u2019s right of free disposal of crude oil and its derivatives (LPG included) was subject to the possibility of government interventions under Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\n473.\n\nIn this respect, Argentina points out that the legal regime applicable to crude oil authorises governmental intervention in pricing and that the massive increase of LPG consumption by the families hit by the crisis justified such intervention. It is undisputed that LPG is the fuel most easily substituted for residential natural gas consumption. According to the data supplied by Total\u2019s experts, as of 2001, LPG is the primary source of fuel for 45.8% of households in Argentina because they are not connected to gas networks.656 As the LECG Report also indicates, \"customers without access to natural gas distribution networks rely primarily on LPG for heating and cooking purposes. Retail LPG prices in domestic currency doubled in 2002 as compared to the previous year (from AR$9.0 per 10 kg container to AR$18.0)\".657 According to same Report, domestic currency prices received by LPG producers increased during 2002 and the export price increased by 162,8%.658\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, footnote 193 at page 111.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 215.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, para. 216. The Tribunal notes that the LECG Report further states that \"Measured in US dollars, the export price received by LPG producers dropped by 18.6%. The export parity price for LPG was affected by the introduction of an export withholding tax, which reduced the net price received by producers.\" The Tribunal notes that these statements provide the basis in the LECG Report for calculating losses suffered by Total as to LPG operations. However, the Tribunal has rejected Total\u2019s claims that either the pesification or the introduction of the export taxes were in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT.\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, in June 2002, well before the enactment of the LPG Law in 2005, the LPG Agreement was entered into with the objective of procuring the supply of LPG at agreed prices in the domestic market. This agreement was concluded between Argentina\u2019s Executive (represented by Mr. Roberto Lavagna, the then Minister of Economy) and the major producers/distributors in the sector (including Total Austral, which was represented by Mr. Grosjean and Mr. Pera) in order to stabilize LPG prices in the domestic market during the period from June 1, 2002 to September 30, 2002. According to the resolution implementing the Agreement, producers committed to sell LPG to Argentina\u2019s *\"empresas fraccionadoras\"* (bottling companies) at an average price of LPG not above $(pesos)/TN 600. In addition, producers committed to supply to distributors and subdistributors, upon the Ministry of Economy\u2019s request, a quantity of LPG amounting to 33,000 TN at a price of $(pesos)/TN 3 00.659 One of the producers\u2019 main conditions on entering into the Agreement, was the reduction of the export tax on LPG from 20% to 5% with retroactive effect from June 1, 2OO2.660 This condition was fulfilled by Argentina by means of Resolution 196/02 (Articles 2 and 4).\n\nSee Resolution 196/02 (Exhibit A RA 113), Annexed Agreement, point 2\u00b0) and point 3\u00b0).\n\nSee Resolution 196/02 (Exhibit A RA 113), Annexed Agreement, point 6\u00b0).\n\n475.\n\nAccording to Total, before the LPG Law was enacted, the LPG price was not fixed by governmental interventions but was freely established in the market.661 However, the conclusion of the LPG Agreement between LPG producers and the Executive in 2002 undermines this argument. Total claims that it accepted the Agreement \"under protest\" and \"with a full reservation of rights.\"662 The Tribunal notes, however, that this does not result from the text of the agreement submitted to the Tribunal or from any other written documents. Conversely, the LPG agreement entailed advantages for the producers, such as being subject to export taxes on LPG at a lower level than that which would have applied without the agreement. Moreover, this preferential treatment guaranteed by Argentina to LPG producers, namely to be subject to an export tax rate of 5% (instead of 20%), lasted until 2004, that is beyond the term of the LPG Agreement.663\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 95.\n\nSee Total's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 96 (b) with reference to the oral testimony of Mr. Grosjean who signed the Agreement on behalf of Total Austral. (Transcript (English) Day 4, 985:4 - 987: 18).\n\nIn this respect see also LECG Report on Damages, para. 81.\n\n476.\n\nSubsequently, in 2005, Argentina passed the LPG Law, which explicitly supplements both the Hydrocarbons and the Gas Laws. As stated in Article 1 of the LPG Law, the legislation aimed first of all to ensure regular and affordable LPG supply to residential users of modest economic means.664 At the same time, the price mechanism it introduced was meant to allow players in the LPG market (producers included) to obtain a price sufficient to cover their efficient costs and to allow a reasonable return. More specifically, according to Article 34, paragraph 2, the reference price of LPG for a typical 45 kilogram LPG unit, to be fixed by the competent authority each semester, should be calculated:\n\n\"..., in order for active subjects to have a retribution for their efficient costs and a reasonable rate of return, based on the monthly price of LPG in bulk at the exit of the producer plant calculated in accordance with the principles established in Article 7(b), the values sent by the corresponding bulk-breakers, under a sworn statement of sale, the distribution market information and the estimates made by the Applicable Authority.\"\n\nArticle 7 letter b) of the LPG Law provides that the supply of LPG must be guaranteed to the domestic market at prices for consumers not above export parity prices in order to guarantee domestic supply and availability of LPG for consumers.\n\n477.\n\nTotal contends that its rights under the concession to full ownership and free disposal of the crude oil that it produced were breached by this regulation because \"... the LPG Law capped Total\u2019s ability to negotiate free market prices for its product.\"665 The Tribunal notes to the contrary that the pricing rules set by the LPG Law are consistent with the powers that Argentina\u2019s Executive had under the Hydrocarbons Law, which was in force in 1994, when the concession on whose terms Total relies was concluded. The Tribunal recalls its previous reasoning examining in detail the references in the concession to the various Deregulation Decrees, which in turn referred to the Hydrocarbons Law.666 Specifically, the Tribunal recalls that under Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law in times of domestic scarcity preference must be given to domestic needs. Moreover, domestic prices could be set at a lower level than international prices when the latter had significantly increased due to exceptional circumstances. In this respect the Tribunal recalls its conclusions at paragraph 472 above, and the data referred to in the LECG Report mentioned above, concerning the LPG market from 2002 onwards.667 The pricing rules contained in the LPG Law correspond to the afore-mentioned principles of the Hydrocarbons Law on the pricing of crude oil and its derivatives in the domestic market, including the requirement that the producers\u2019 costs be covered and a reasonable return be ensured.668 Furthermore, the pricing principles of the LPG Law appears similar to the pricing principles of the Gas Law.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 95.\n\nSee above paras. 421-427.\n\nSee above para. 473.\n\nIn this regard see Article 34 of the LPG Law quoted above at para. 476.\n\n478.\n\nTotal has not submitted to the Tribunal evidence that would show that LPG prices in accordance with the LPG Law669 were below those agreed by Total under the LPG Agreement or were insufficient to cover costs, and include a reasonable return, contrary to the principles of Article 34 of the LPG Law. In any case the legal framework in place before the enactment of the LPG Law did not guarantee to producers such as Total the right to sell domestically at international prices. By contrast the LECG Reports on Damages670 are based principally on the difference between the projected future prices of LPG, calculated on the basis of the variations in the international price of LPG in US dollars, and the actual prices paid to Total Austral by TGS which processes and trades Total\u2019s LPG in the export market.671\n\nThese prices are set as follows: for residential users prices could not exceed US$32 for a typical 45 kilogram LPG unit and for the rest of the sales, a cap was set equal to the average price of LPG sold in the previous 24 months. See above para. 405.\n\nSee LECG Addendum on Damages, Table II at page 8 which estimates Total\u2019s damages in respect to LPG to US$ 121.9 million in US$ of December 2006.\n\nSee LECG Report on Damages, paras 186-187 (see also para. 86).\n\n479.\n\nBased on the analysis above of the facts and the legal arguments submitted by the parties, the Tribunal concludes that the price mechanism introduced by the LPG Law is not, as concerns Total, in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT and, therefore, it rejects Total\u2019s claim under Article 3 of the BIT as to its operations in the LPG sector.\n\n***10. Evaluation of Total\u2019s Claim under Article 4 of the BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has to examine Total\u2019s claim that Argentina breached Article 4 of the BIT in treating its investments in the energy sector in general (its investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons included) in a discriminatory way.672 As Total explained in its Reply,\n\nTotal\u2019s case is predicated on Argentina\u2019s deliberate policy of discriminating against the energy sector as a whole, in favour of domestic industrial, commercial and residential consumers. Although on their face the Measures do not contain any limitations on, or preference for, nationality, the key consideration is that industry and commerce largely represent Argentine\u2019s interests, while the energy sector was, until recently, largely in the hands of foreign private investors.673\n\nSee Total\u2019s Memorial, paras. 344-345; Total\u2019s Reply, paras. 7-29 and 499 ff. and Post-Hearing Brief paras. 620 ff.\n\nSee Total\u2019s Reply, para. 499.\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its discussion of Total\u2019s claim of discrimination concerning its investments in TGN and in power generation. On the basis of the principles highlighted above at paragraphs 210-217, the Tribunal is of the view that Total has not demonstrated that it has been treated in a legally relevant discriminatory manner as concerns its investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Argentina has not breached in this respect Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n***11. Argentina\u2019s State of Necessity Defence***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nArgentina has raised the defence of necessity under customary international law also in respect of Total\u2019s claims as to its investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons.674 As in the case of Total\u2019s other investments, the Tribunal must therefore examine this defence in the light of the criteria stated in Article 25 ILC Articles on State Responsibility as it relates to measures adopted by Argentina in breach of the BIT.675\n\nArgentina has raised the defence of necessity against all of Total\u2019s claims generally, as far as the Tribunal would have considered them a violation of the BIT; see Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 876 ff. The essential interest alleged by Argentina there is \"the preservation of the State own existence and that of its population at times of public emergency.\"\n\nSee the analysis by the Tribunal at paras. 220 ff. above.\n\n483.\n\nAs to the retroactive elimination of the Tierra del Fuego tax exemption (discussed at paragraph 447 ff. above), Argentina\u2019s request for payment of back taxes pursuant to Resolution 776/06 for the period 2001-2006 can in no way be considered required \"to safeguard an essential interest\" of Argentina \"against a grave and imminent peril\". Nor did Argentina present any evidence to the contrary. The same can be said of the fixing of the domestic price of gas below the relevant benchmark without providing for compensation to Total in accordance with Article 6 of Decree 1589/89, as addressed by the Tribunal at paragraph 455 above. Providing for such compensation to Total could not have impaired an essential interest of Argentina. Again, Argentina did not present any evidence to the contrary.\n\n484.\n\nAs to Argentina\u2019s interference with Total\u2019s export contracts in 2004,676 the Tribunal recognizes that in time of shortages, diverting gas intended for export to domestic consumption could qualify, in the abstract, as an act adopted \"to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril.\" However, this is subject to the party invoking the defence showing that the peril is grave and imminent and that the action is \"the only way\" to safeguard the essential interest at stake. Argentina, however, did not provide any evidence that the limitation of the gas export placed upon Total in 2004 (when the emergency of 2001 had been overcome) was correlated to a grave and imminent peril to consumers\u2019 access to essential gas supply. The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Argentina\u2019s defence based on the state of necessity under customary international law is groundless.\n\nSee paragraphs 372, 395 above.\n\n***Part V - Decision of the Tribunal on Liability***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nBased on the above reasoning and findings, the Tribunal, partially granting Total\u2019s claims, DECIDES as follows:\n\na) Argentina breached its obligations under Article 3 of the BIT to grant to Total fair and equitable treatment, as specified in paragraphs 184, 346, 444, 455, 461, causing damage to Total;\n\nb) All other claims by Total, including those under Articles 4 and 5 of the BIT, are rejected;\n\nc) All defences by Argentina, including those relating to the alleged state of necessity, are rejected;\n\nd) The Argentine Republic is liable to Total for the aforementioned violations of the BIT and the damages thereby suffered by Total must be compensated by Argentina, as will be determined in a separate quantum phase of these arbitration proceedings, and in respect of which the Tribunal retains jurisdiction. The Tribunal will issue a separate order concerning the further proceedings for the quantum phase.\n\ne) Any decision on the costs of the arbitration is reserved.\n\nDone in English and Spanish, both versions being equally authoritative."}, {"Title": "Award including Dissenting Opinions of Mr. Henri \u00c1lvarez and Mr. Luis Herrera Marcano", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2013-11-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award including Dissenting Opinions of Mr. Henri \u00c1lvarez and Mr. Luis Herrera Marcano\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**ABBREVIATIONS**\n\n**AFIP** *(Administraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos)'.* Argentina\u2019s Tax Authority.\n\n**APV:** Adjusted Present Value (alternative valuation method submitted by Argentina with respect to Transportadora de Gas del Norte \"TGN\").\n\n**Arbitration Rules:** ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, as amended effective April 10, 2006.\n\n**Argentina Cost Submission:** Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs of 26 April 2012.\n\n**Argentina PHB:** Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum of 27 March 2012, accompanied by UBA\u2019s Response to PO No. 7.\n\n**Argentina QCM:** Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum of 2 September 2011, accompanied by UBA\u2019s First Valuation Report of 31 August 2011.\n\n**Argentina QR:** Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Quantum of 25 November 2011, accompanied by UBA\u2019s Second Valuation Report of 23 November 2011.\n\n**Argentina Response to PO No. 5:** Respondent\u2019s Response to Procedural Order No. 5, submitted on 14 December 2011.\n\n**Argentina Response to PO No. 8:** Respondent\u2019s Response to Procedural Order No. 8, submitted on July 2, 2012.\n\n**Argentine PPI,** also referred to as **\"IPIM\"** *(Indice de Precios Internos al por Mayor)'.* Argentine Producer Price Index.\n\n**BIT:** Bilateral agreement between France and Argentina on reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments of 3 July 1991.\n\n**CAMMESA** *(Compa\u00f1\u00eda Administradora del Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista S.A.):* Argentina\u2019s Electricity Wholesale Market Administrator.\n\n**CAPEX:** Capital Expenditures.\n\n**CAPM:** Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\n**Central Puerto:** Central Puerto S.A.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n***A. Procedural Background - Quantum Phase***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Decision on Liability in this dispute was dispatched to the Parties on 27 December 2010 (the \"Decision on Liability\").1 On the same date the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO No. 1\"), providing for a timetable for the submission of the Parties\u2019 views on the procedure for the *quantum* phase.\n\nThe procedural background of the case from its initiation up to the Decision on Liability of 27 December 2010 [hereinafter \"Decision on Liability\"], including a reference to the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 26 August 2006, is set forth in paras. 1-22 of the Decision on Liability.\n\n2.\n\nOn 7 and 28 February 2011 and on 23 and 24 March 2011, the Parties submitted short briefs expressing their views and commenting on the other Party\u2019s proposals.\n\n3.\n\nOn 28 March 2011, the Parties and the Tribunal held a procedural hearing on the **quantum** phase at the premises of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") in Washington, D.C. Following the hearing, the Tribunal agreed on a procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 submissions on **quantum** and their respective expert reports.\n\n4.\n\nThereafter, the Parties submitted the following briefs and expert reports on *quantum:*\n\n- Total: Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Quantum (\"Total QM\"), accompanied by the Compass Lexecon Report (\"CL First Report\") on 17 June 2011; Claimant\u2019s Reply on Quantum (\"Total QR\") and Compass Lexecon Second Report (\"CL Second Report\") on 14 October 2011.\n\n- Argentina: Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial on Quantum of 2 September 2011 (\"Argentina QCM\"), submitted together with a Report by the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas (\"UBA\"): \"Valuation of Total\u2019s Claim in Accordance with the Decision on Liability issued by the Tribunal\" of 31 August 2011 (\"UBA First Valuation Report\"); Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Quantum of 25 November 2011 together with the \"Second Report\" prepared by the UBA of 23 September2011.2\n\nArgentina supplied English translations of its briefs and experts\u2019 reports, while Total supplied courtesy translations into Spanish.\n\n5.\n\nDuring this period the Tribunal had to resolve various procedural issues concerning production of documents which had arisen between the Parties. For this purpose the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 of 26 September 2011 (\"PO No. 3\") and Procedural Order No. 4 of 12 October 2011 (\"PO No. 4\").\n\n6.\n\nPO No. 4 addressed a dispute between the Parties as to the production of certain documents, particularly agreements executed by Total Austral relating to the sale of natural gas to direct customers. Argentina had requested Total to produce these documents and Total was willing to supply them \"subject to the signing by Argentina of a Confidentiality Agreement\". The Tribunal noted that \"other ICSID tribunals have issued procedural orders under Article 19 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to ensure confidentiality of documents produced by parties in ICSID arbitral proceedings\". The Tribunal considered that such an order, rather than the signing of a Confidentiality Agreement to which Argentina was objecting for reasons of principle, \"would be adequate to protect confidentiality as to the documents at issue\".3 The Tribunal annexed such Confidentiality Undertaking to PO No. 4 and decided that \"Claimant shall supply to the Respondent such documents within seven days from the date in which the ICSID Secretariat shall confirm to Claimant that Argentina has accepted in writing the annexed Confidentiality Undertaking as stated in the first paragraph of same, attaching copy of such Acceptance\". Pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, Argentina complied with the above-mentioned conditions and Total supplied the documents referred to in the order.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled in PO No. 4 \"the obligation of parties to ICSID arbitration to cooperate with the tribunals in matters of evidence (Article 34.3 of the Arbitration Rules), in conformity of the principle that parties must conduct themselves in good faith in international adjudicatory proceedings\".\n\n7.\n\nIn anticipation of the hearing on *quantum,* the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 of 7 December 2011 (\"PO No. 5\"), in which it gave directions as to the organisation of the hearing, including a number of \"issues of specific interest\" which the Tribunal invited the Parties to address. The Tribunal also asked the Parties to submit in advance to the hearing, certain \"information and exhibits whose potential usefulness and relevance stems from the submissions of the parties and the exhibits they have provided up to now\", in order to \"make the hearing more fruitful and ensure due process\". The Parties complied with the requests of the Tribunal by the due date of 14 December 2011.\n\n8.\n\nAs previously agreed and decided, the hearing on *quantum* was held at the premises of ICSID in Washington, D.C. from 19 December through 21 December 2011. The Tribunal heard the Parties\u2019 counsel and their respective experts on *quantum,* the experts were examined, cross-examined and answered questions posed by the members of the Tribunal. The hearing was concluded with closing statements by the Parties\u2019 counsel. Upon consent of the Parties, Dr. Anna De Luca attended the hearing as legal assistant to the President of the Tribunal. The following persons attended the hearing:\n\n**On behalf of the Claimant:**\n\n*Total S.A. :*\n\n- Mr. Stephen Douglas Mr. Jean-Andr\u00e9 Diaz Mr. Arturo Pera\n\n- Ms. Marisa Basualdo\n\n*Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, LLP:*\n\nMr. Nigel Blackaby Mr. Noah Rubins Ms. Lucy Martinez Mr. Ben Love Mr. Daniel Chertudi\n\n- Ms. Lindsay Gastrell\n\n- Ms. Cassia Cheung Ms. Katherine Ibarra\n\n*Abeledo Gotthei Abogados SC*\n\nMr. Luis Erize\n\nMr. Sergio M.

(\"TGN\"), Electricity and Total Austral. The answers to the questions of the Tribunal were to be submitted within 60 days, later extended by 15 further days \"as an annex to a short Post Hearing Brief, summing up the Parties\u2019 arguments and setting out in final form their respective detailed \"prayer for relief\u2019 in these proceedings\". The Parties duly complied with the above requests and directions of the Tribunal and filed their respective costs submissions, as agreed, after their post-hearing briefs.\n\n10.\n\nAfter having received the Parties\u2019 post-hearing briefs, the Members of the Tribunal met in person for initial deliberations at the premises of ICSID in Washington, D.C. from 18 to 20 April 2012. Following that meeting the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 on 1 June 2012 (\"PO No. 8\"), inviting the Parties to provide additional explanations on their respective answers to PO No. 7, in connection with the indexation of the but-for tariffs of TGN. The Parties duly provided their additional explanations on 2 July 2012.\n\n11.\n\nArgentina thereafter asked the Tribunal on 27 August 2012 for authorization to introduce additional documents into the proceeding, consisting of evidence recently submitted in another ICSID arbitration, which Argentina considered relevant for the present case. Total objected to such request arguing both that the request was untimely, and that the materials were irrelevant. On 30 August 2012, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties, on behalf of the Tribunal, that no further submission would be admitted.\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 September 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it rejected Argentina\u2019s request to admit the unauthorized submission of 27 August 2012 at such a late stage of the proceedings. The Tribunal noted that the material the Respondent was seeking to submit related on its face to a different dispute between different parties under a different treaty. In view of the Parties\u2019 respective experts\u2019 extensive written opinions, direct examination and thorough cross-examination at the hearings, the Tribunal in its decision of 10 September 2012 indicated that it had \"an adequate basis on which to assess their evidence submitted in the present arbitration and concerning the issues to be decided\", which \"have been moreover thoroughly debated by the parties until now\".\n\n13.\n\nOn 26 June 2013, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 38(1). On October 22, 2013, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 46, the Tribunal extended the 120 day period to draw up and sign the Award by a further 60 days.\n\n***B. General Principles Applicable to the Valuation of Total\u2019s Damages***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Total\u2019s claims concern its investments in Argentina in three distinct sectors (gas transportation, power generation/electricity, and hydrocarbons exploration and production) made in different forms.4 In relation to such investments Total complains that a number of different measures adopted by Argentina at the height of the financial and economic crisis of 2001 - 2002 and thereafter, have prejudiced it in breach of various provisions of the bilateral agreement between France and Argentina on reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments of 3 July 1991 (the \"BIT\"). The negative impact of which Total complains is different for each sector and the valuation criteria Total relies upon as to each investment are also, in part, different. This is due to the specificity of each of the various investments affected and the different impact of each measure found in the Decision on Liability to be in breach of the BIT. These claims and the specific issues raised in respect of each of the above sectors are reviewed in detail in distinct parts of this Award. However, before addressing separately those issues, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to highlight some \"general principles\" that are relevant to the examination of all claims made by Total in order to determine the *quantum* of damages to which Total is properly entitled under the Decision on Liability.\n\nIn gas transportation Total owned an indirect stake of about 19% in TGN; as to electricity, in 2001 Total acquired a majority stake in Central Puerto and HPDA which it sold at the end of 2006; as to hydrocarbons, Total had, through its fully owned subsidiary Total Austral S.A. (hereinafter \"Total Austral\"), exploration and exploitation concessions and sales of gas, primarily in Argentina and to customers in Chile.

Total\u2019s Position on the Calculation of Damages***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nBefore setting out its claims for compensation for the measures that the Decision on Liability found to be in breach of the BIT, Total listed a number of basic general principles, which it submits should apply to the calculation of all of its claims for damages in respect of its different investments. It then went on to address the specific application of these principles to the individual claims and their particular circumstances.5 Argentina challenged a number of the criteria invoked by Total.6 Thus, the Tribunal will start its analysis with a general review of the relevant applicable principles concerning the determination of damages in this dispute, before addressing, in order, the issues concerning Total\u2019s damages as to its investments in: (a) TGN, (b) Electricity Generators (Central Puerto S.A. [\"Central Puerto\"] and Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Piedra de Aguila S.A. [\"HPDA\"]), and (c) Hydrocarbons exploration, exploitation and sales of gas in Argentina and Chile (Total Austral S.A. [\"Total Austral\"]).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on Quantum of 17 June 2011, submitted together with the Compass Lexecon Report First Report [hereinafter \"Total QM\"], paras. 13 - 68.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum of 2 September 2011, accompanied by University of Buenos Aires\u2019 First Valuation Report of 31 August 2011 [hereinafter \"Argentina QCM\"], paras. 1 - 49.\n\n16.\n\nIn its Quantum Memorial, Total presented the five following \"Guiding Principles and Methodology\" for the calculation of *quantum7*\n\na) The determination of compensation owed by the Government to Total is governed by customary international law, and in particular by the \"full compensation\" principle established by the Permanent Court of International Justice (the \"PCU\") in the *Case Concerning The Factory At Chorzow (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits)* (\"Chorzow Factory\"), as confirmed by the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the *\"ILC Articles on State Responsibility\").*\n\nb) Compensation should be based upon the impact of the Treaty Breaches on the \"fair market value\" of Total\u2019s investments in Argentina; fair market value is best assessed by positing a hypothetical sale of the assets in question by a willing seller to a willing buyer in an arm\u2019s length transaction.\n\nc) The Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") methodology is the most reliable way to simulate this kind of hypothetical fair market value sale.\n\nd) To isolate and quantify the effect of Argentina\u2019s Treaty Breaches on the fair market value of Total\u2019s investments, it is appropriate to use and compare two scenarios (counter-factual or \"but-for,\" and \"actual\").\n\ne) Total is entitled to an award of interest.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 13.\n\n17.\n\nTotal explains in detail the reasons for which \"fair market value\" based on a DCF calculation has been generally accepted to determine compensation reflecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed as the result of an internationally wrongful act.8 Total further elaborates on the application of DCF to calculate the losses resulting from Argentina\u2019s treaty breaches, comparing the \"actual scenario\" (the present value of future cash flows/eamings taking into account the impact that Argentina\u2019s measures in breach of the BIT have had on Total\u2019s investments) and the \"but-for\" counterfactual scenario (in the absence of breaches). Under this methodology, Total discounts these cash flows, in both scenarios, to their present value9 at a rate, represented by the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") for each company affected, \"that takes full account of business risk affecting the relevant companies and their cash flow\".10 Finally, Total explains that the *quantum* of its damages in respect of the loss of value of its equity interest results from subtracting the lower figures of the actual scenario from those of the counterfactual scenario in respect of each investment.11\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 21, quoting from Prof. James Crawford\u2019s Commentaries to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Exhibit CL-167, p. 225.\n\nThe dates used by Total for assessing the fair market values of each of its investments depends on the date in which Argentina\u2019s measures have impacted each of them, and will accordingly be examined by the Tribunal in the relevant sections of this Award. See Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 41.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 43.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 44. In its \"Request for Relief\u2019 in paragraph 255 of its Quantum Memorial the principal amounts of compensation that Total asks the Tribunal to order Argentina to pay amount to $104.1 million in relation to TGN, $305.3 million in relation to the electricity generators, $150.7 million in relation hydrocarbons, plus reimbursement of certain legal fees and interest as specified therein. Including interest, the overall amount claimed by Total at the end of the *quantum* phase amounts to $1,002.2 million, Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief of 27 March 2012 [hereinafter \"Total PHB\"], Table Two, p. 44.\n\n18.\n\nAs to interest, Total underlines that interest \"is an integral component of full compensation under international law\" when payment of compensation is delayed. Total claims both \"pre-award\" interest from the date of valuation for each loss, which corresponds to that of Argentina\u2019s relevant breach, and \"post-award\" interest. The latter is meant to compensate Total for the additional loss incurred from the date of the Tribunal\u2019s award to the date of final payment.12 As to the rate of interest to be applied, Total distinguishes between compensation in relation to investments that Total continues to own (TGN and Total Austral) and those that it does not own anymore (that is, the two electricity generators Central Puerto and HPDA). For the latter, Total proposes in its Post-Hearing Brief a risk-free pre-award interest rate of 3.69 %. Total justifies requesting a higher interest rate in respect of TGN and Total Austral because \"Total continues to bear the various risks in connection with these assets, and should be compensated accordingly for having been deprived of associated funds overtime\".13 The WACC of TGN and Total Austral (respectively 11.01% and 10.92% p.a.) should be used, according to Total, because \"(a) the WACC reflects each company\u2019s real cost of raising funds; and (b) Total continues to own and operate these assets, and remains subject to the operational risks inherent in each business\".14\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 45 - 67.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 51.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 52.\n\n19.\n\nTotal claims \"compound interest\" on all pre and post-award interest, explaining that this approach is \"consistent with economic reality\" and pointing to the fact that \"the majority of recent investor-State arbitration tribunals have awarded compound interest on awards of damages, confirming the legitimacy and necessity (in appropriate circumstances) of compounding as an element of full reparation for violations of international law\".15\n\n*lb id.,* paras. 60-63.\n\n***ii. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nArgentina holds views different from those of Total with respect to the general principles applicable to the determination of the damages in accordance with the holdings of the Decision on Liability. Argentina considers that the \"Chorzow standard\" of full reparation is not applicable in the present dispute and that \"the relevant principles of international law\" referred to in Article 8.4 of the BIT call rather, for the calculation of \"fair compensation\".16 Argentina further submits that \"proportionality of compensation\" in relation to the damage must also be considered in this respect. Furthermore, according to Argentina, in order to define the applicable standard of compensation, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States (U.N. General Assembly Resolution 3281-XXIX of 12 December 1974) must be taken into consideration. Finally, in a case of a breach of a BIT obligation, other than the prohibition of expropriation without compensation which is the most serious interference with an investor\u2019s ownership right, \"the required standard of reparations is different and must necessarily lead to lower compensation\".17 Argentina advocates an \"equitable and acceptable outcome\", taking into account the behaviour of both Parties.18\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 1-4.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 14.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 8\n\n21.\n\nArgentina submits the following:\n\n*With regard to the issue of fair compensation, the Tribunal must refer to the relevant criteria set forth by the general principles of international law:*\n\n*There must be a close causal link between the damage sustained by Claimant and the violation of international law;*\n\n*Compensation must be reasonable;*\n\n*The damage must be certain, not hypothetical or vague;*\n\n*Compensation must cover the period during which the wrongful act took place;*\n\n*The investor is under an obligation to mitigate the damage;*\n\n*There must be no risk of double compensation;*\n\n*The investor must prove the causal link, the amount of the damages sought and the fact that damages are recoverable in accordance with the applicable law; and*\n\n*The damage must be certain enough that there is no doubt that the measures challenged were negative \u2014and not positive for the person claiming the damage.19*\n\nArgentina stresses that the assessed damages must be reasonable also in the light of \"the general economic, political and social conditions affecting the country where the measures were taken\", and points to the severe nature of the crisis of 2001-2002. Argentina concludes that \"the reasonableness of the damages awarded can be more important than the potential mathematical calculation made\".20\n\n*lb id.,* para. 10.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 22.\n\n22.\n\nAnother point made by Argentina is that \"(a)ccording to fundamental principles of valuation and finance, international practice, international law and the BIT, the date for valuation of damages in cases of violation of international law must be the date immediately preceding the date on which the measures that were allegedly contrary to the Treaty were adopted. In this regard, we cannot take into account the potentially higher profits that the claimant could have obtained after that date, but only the revenue that was foreseeable at that moment.\"21\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 37-38.\n\n23.\n\nFinally, Argentina points out that Total acts mostly, in any case as far as TGN is concerned, as a shareholder and not as a direct investor. Argentina accordingly considers that \"(t)he shareholders of a company are only entitled to receive dividends for their shareholdings after payment of all of the company\u2018s unpaid debts and provided that there are still liquid profits. Therefore, in order to calculate the value of a share, we only consider the expected flow of dividends after payment of all debts\".22\n\n*lb id.,* para. 45.\n\n***iii. Parties\u2019 Additional Submissions***\n------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe positions expressed by the Parties and their experts in their Quantum Memorials have been refined and, in part, modified in the course of the further written exchanges.23 These submissions have been supplemented by their arguments and the evidence of their expert witnesses at the hearing on *quantum* held on 19-21 December 2011, their written answers to the questions put to them by the Tribunal before and after the hearings24 and in the Quantum Post-Hearing Briefs. The Tribunal notes that, as to the legal criteria to be applied, Total in its Post Hearing Brief has maintained that:\n\na) full compensation, as articulated in *Chorzow,* is the fundamental rule of compensation for international wrongful acts, and the \"lesser compensation standards\" proposed by Argentina have no application;25\n\nb) the full reparation principle is also applicable to cases involving breaches of the fair and equitable standard, such as in the present case;26\n\nc) the DCF method and future profitability assess fair market value and are the proper criteria to be applied in assessing the compensation due to Total by comparing the actual situation and the \"but-for\" counterfactual scenario, \"where it is assumed that Argentina never breached the Treaty\".27\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on Quantum of 14 October 2011 [hereinafter \"Total QR\"] with the Compass Lexecon Second Report [hereinafter \"CL Second Report\"] and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Quantum of 25 November 2011 [hereinafter \"Argentina QR\"] with Universidad de Buenos Aires Second Valuation Report of 23 November 2011 [hereinafter \"UBA Second Valuation Report\"].\n\nSee Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 5 of 7 December 2011 [hereinafter \"PO No. 5\"], Procedural Order No. 7 of 13 January 2012 [hereinafter \"PO No. 7\"], and Procedural Order No. 8 of 1 June 2012 [hereinafter \"PO No. 8\"].\n\nTotal PHB, *supra* note 11, paras. 5-7.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 8 stating that \"This Tribunal accepted in its Decision on Liability that damages for indirect expropriation and breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause should be calculated in the same manner\" (with reference to paras. 198 and 342, and **fit.** 643 therein).\n\n*Ibid,* para. 10.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the general introduction of its Post-Hearing Brief, in addition to reaffirming its position summarized above, Argentina focused on the issue of the interst rate on the amount of the compensation that the Tribunal might grant to Total. Argentina maintains that only a risk-free rate must be calculated on any and all amounts of damages, irrespective of whether Total still owns the investment affected by a breach or not. Argentina submits that this is the practice of international tribunals, especially in respect of future damages (lost profits).28\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief of 27 March 2012 [hereinafter \"Argentina PHB\"], paras. 1-19.\n\n***iv. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n-----------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs to the legal standard applicable to determine the losses suffered by Total due to the breach by Argentina of the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3 of the BIT, there is no doubt that Total is entitled to monetary compensation equivalent to such losses. This conforms to the customary international law rule that requires a State to provide \"full reparation for the injury caused by its internationally wrongful act.\"29 The BIT between France and Argentina contains no specific provision concerning reparation in cases of breaches of Article 3. On the other hand, Article 5(2), which deals with \"any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession\", provides that any such measure \"shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation the amount of which, calculated in accordance with the real value of the investment in question, shall be assessed on the basis of a normal economic situation prior to any threat of dispossession\". The Tribunal considers that, since these provisions reflect customary international law principles relating to the obligation of full compensation for wrongful damage, they may guide the Tribunal in determining the compensation due to Total in the circumstances of the present dispute under Article 3 of the BIT.30 Indeed Article 5(2) of the BIT, in prescribing an \"adequate\" compensation *(\"adecuada\"* and *\"ad\u00e9quate\"* in the Spanish and French official texts of the BIT, respectively), specifies that this requires a payment \"calculated in accordance with the real value\"31 of the investment affected, thus implying compensation amounting to full reparation.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31.1.1. This standard has been applied in a number of awards in investment disputes in the form of full monetary compensation of the damage suffered by the foreign investor. See explicitly as to disputes concerning Argentina, *Compania deAguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007) [hereinafter *\"Vivendi* Award\"], para. 8.2.7; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award (12 May 2005) [hereinafter *\"CMS* Award\"], para. 410.\n\nDecision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 198, where the Tribunal, in rejecting Total\u2019s claim that Argentina had also breached Article 5(2) of the BIT in respect of TGN, noted that \"damages under the heading of indirect expropriation would not be different from damages due to breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard\".\n\nTribunal\u2019s translation. In the French official text of the BIT *\"calcul\u00e9 sur la valeur r\u00e9elle\",* in the Spanish official text of the BIT *\"calculado sobre el valor real.*\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal is, therefore, called upon to apply the most appropriate methodology in order to determine the losses of Total and to adopt calculations that will ensure the best possible correspondence between the actual losses and the amount of the compensation. In doing so, the Tribunal is mindful that these operations must be based on accepted valuation methodologies, but they do not simply involve a mathematical exercise.32\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 22: \"the reasonableness of the damages awarded can be more important than the potential mathematical calculation made\".\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties agree, in conformity with generally accepted accounting and damage valuation practice, that the determination of the \"fair market value\" of a going concern is a basic step to ascertain losses caused to the owner (or to its shareholders *pro rata).* This requires comparing the value of the enterprise in the actual scenario, which reflects the company having been prejudiced by unlawful measures, with the counterfactual scenario, had the company not been so prejudiced. The DCF method, used by Total and its experts, appears to be the method most widely followed. However, this does not relieve the Tribunal from examining the Adjusted Present Value (\"APV\"), the alternative method submitted by Argentina with respect to TGN. Moreover, since the fair market value is not an absolute value for an asset, but reflects what it is worth in the market, disagreement is often possible as to the basis of its calculation and the correspondence of DCF results with such actual or hypothetical market value.33\n\nSee *CMS* Award, *supra* note 29, para. 402 (citing the \"International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms\", American Society of Appraisers, ASA website, 6 June 2001, p. 4).\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, even assuming that the DCF method is the appropriate one for determining fair market value, and that the losses would in principle be those which result from comparing discounted cash flows in the actual and but-for scenarios using the same approach, this does not lead to uncontested results. Relevant and necessary additional elements (on which Total and Argentina mostly disagree) are the following: the dates to be used to discount future cash flows, considering the dates of the relevant breach; the future tariffs (with respect to TGN) and/or regulated prices (in the electricity sector) on which the calculation of future cash flows should be based in the actual and but-for scenarios; the proper rate of the WACC at which to discount those cash flows for each company; and the future evolution of costs that must be deducted from gross cash flows to obtain net earnings (taking into account in the but-for scenario whether the company would have been able to service its foreign currency debt, which in the actual scenario it had to reschedule due to reduced revenues).\n\n30.\n\nAll these calculations are based on the future evolution of economic and financial data, future decisions on tariffs and other future measures in regulated sectors which cannot be precisely predicted. Thus, they are necessarily based on assumptions, reflect some uncertainty and involve a margin of discretion in their calculation.34 Moreover, for calculating the damages suffered in specific instances, Total itself has used methods of calculation different from those explained in its \"Guiding Principles and Methodology\" on compensation and valuation,35 whose use Argentina has, however, not challenged in principle. Thus, as to Total Austral\u2019s losses, Total bases its calculation of damages on the monthly difference between the prices Total Austral was entitled to receive, and the reduced prices at which Total Austral was obliged to sell gas from 2002 to 2004 (and in part also from 2004 to 2006), due to the requirement imposed by Argentina\u2019s authorities that Total Austral redirect certain quantities of gas to the domestic market at less than the contractually agreed prices.36\n\nSee *Compania de Desarollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Final Award (17 February 2000) [hereinafter *\"Santa Elena* Award\"], para. 92, noting that valuation is ultimately a task requiring estimation and the exercise of professional judgment, partly done by the valuers subject to final adjustment by the arbitrators. As to the \"future\" evolution of prices, costs, tariffs, etc., an additional element of disagreement and uncertainty stems from the fact that the Tribunal is deciding in 2013 while relevant dates of the various breaches which caused the damages to be compensated to be used for DCF purposes, go back to 2002. Thus calculation of lost future revenues under the license of TGN and the concessions of the electricity generators (up to their end, 2027) would have been based almost in full on \"future\" reasonable expectation, if performed when the present arbitration was initiated. At the time of the Award, instead, actual data are available up to 2011/2012 and they have been submitted and relied upon (in part) by the Parties and their experts for use by the Tribunal. This issue is not unknown in investment arbitration, cf. *Amco Asia Corporation v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/8, Final Award (5 June 1990) [hereinafter *\"Amco* Award\"], para. 96 (President Judge Higgins), stating that there is no reason not to take into account for the purpose of valuation of damages developments which have occurred after the date of the unlawful expropriation, noting that \"(t)he only subsequent known factors relevant to value which are not to be relied on are those attributable to the illegality itself\u2019.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 13 ff.\n\nMoreover, Total has relied on a variation of the DCF method to assess its losses in respect of the electricity generators, by using a \"DCF/Transaction method\", in view of the fact that it has sold those assets in 2006, see infra para. 113.\n\n31.\n\nIt would not be efficient to address any further issues at this point, as the question of applicable valuation methodologies will be dealt with in detail in respect of each damage calculation made in the appropriate sections of this Award, respectively covering Gas, Electricity and Hydrocarbons. However, the Tribunal will deal in specific paragraphs in Part V of this Award, with the various issues concerning interest (appropriate rate, risk-free or not, pre-awad, post-award, simple or compound rates), since they relate to all of the principal amounts granted irrespective of the investment affected.\n\n32.\n\nAs a final observation, the Tribunal notes that the uncertainties affecting the valuation of future damages, notwithstanding the use by experts of accepted accounting methodologies, are well known. They have been acknowledged by international tribunals and by both legal and accounting experts in respect of the calculation of damages to companies and their assets affected by international wrongful conduct by host governments.37 Specifically, the assessment of the \"fair market value\" of a business is not an exact science, particularly when there is no current market price based on comparable actual transactions, so that the valuation is based on estimations of future revenues and profits which would or might have been earned in a hypothetical scenario (but-for analysis). Different assumptions and methodologies may lead to widely different estimates of damages. This is illustrated in this arbitration by the substantial divergence existing between the results of the same experts when calculating damages for a specific item under two different assumptions and methodologies, which, in principle, are both admissible.38 This explains why in these matters some discretion is generally accorded to tribunals, which have to use their prudent judgment in order to award damages in a reasonable amount.39\n\nSee, for example, the *caveat* found in a recent specialized work: B. Sabahi, *Compensation and Restitution in Investor-State Arbitration,* Oxford 2011, p. 118: \"Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation is the most complex and widespread valuation method, particularly for valuing business...DCF has an extremely broad scope of applicability, which, unfortunately, is offset by the difficulty in accurately performing a DCF valuation. Any DCF model is highly dependent on the assumptions the valuers make. As DCF valuation is not based directly on actual market prices, there is no built-in check against wrong assumptions, which can make the calculated DCF value drastically different from actual fair market value. The arbitrators, however, can and should examine the reasonableness of the assumptions\".\n\nIn the *quantum* phase Total\u2019s experts have submitted two different calculations of the loss suffered by Total in respect of the electricity generators that result in two estimates which are considerably different. The first one is based on the \"classic\" DCF method and the other one on a variation of the same method, the DCF/Transaction method, leading respectively to an estimate of Total\u2019s damages of $176.1 million and $304.9 million in respect of its investments in Central Puerto and HPDA, see *infra* paras. 113-115.\n\nSuch an exercise does not result in a tribunal deciding *ex aequo et bono,* which is admissible only with the consent of the parties (Article 42(3) ICSID Convention). See *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.* *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2 Award (29 May 2003) [hereinafter *\"Tecmed* Award\"], para. 190, for the proposition that an arbitral tribunal may consider general equitable principles when setting the compensation owed to a claimant, without thereby assuming the role of an arbitrator *ex aequo et bono* (with supporting reference to previous case law at footnote 228). Equitable considerations in the application of the law, including in performing calculation of damages, pertain to *aequitas infra legem* to use a Latin expression (equity within what the law admits) and not *aequitas praeter legem* (equity beyond/in lieu of the law), see G. Broggini, *Reflexions sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans l\u2019arbitrage international,* Bulletin de l\u2019Association Suisse de l\u2019Arbitrage, 95 ff (1991); P. Mayer, *Le principe de bonne foi devant les arbitres du commerce international,* Etudes P. Lalive, 543 ff (1993).

TOTAL\u2019S CLAIM IN RELATION TO ITS INVESTMENT IN TGN**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Total\u2019s Investment in the Gas Sector***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nTotal\u2019s investment in the gas transportation industry in Argentina, at the time the Request for Arbitration was filed, was an indirect 19.23% stake in TGN. TGN is one of two gas transportation companies established when, in 1992, the Republic of Argentina privatized Gas del Estado, which had been a State Company until then. At that time, TGN was granted a licence \"for the rendering of the public gas transportation utilities\"40 in northern and central Argentina for a term of 35 years, extendable at TGN\u2019s option for a further ten years, subject to compliance by TGN of the terms and obligations contained in the licence.41\n\nSee Decree 2,457/92 [hereinafter \"TGN Licence\"], Article 1, Exhibit C-53(l). Further details are set out in the Decision on Liability, paras. 41-45.\n\nSee Article 3.1 and 3.2 Basic Rules of the TGN Licence attached to Decree 2,457/92, Exhibit C-53.\n\n34.\n\nIn May 1992, Argentina enacted Law 24,076 (the \"Gas Law\") and Decree 1738/92 (the \"Gas Decree\"),42 which established the post-privatization legal framework of the gas sector. After an international bidding process, accompanied by an Information Memorandum of September 1992 prepared by Argentina\u2019s financial advisers,43 the government of Argentina sold a 70% share in TGN to Gasinvest (a consortium of mainly foreign investors44) on 28 December 1992.45 The government of Argentina retained a 25% share in TGN until July 1995, when a second public bidding process took place and resulted in CMS Gas Transmission Argentina (an Argentinean Company controlled by CMS Energy, a US company) acquiring such 25% stake in TGN.46\n\nExhibits C-31 and C-48, respectively.\n\nSee Information Memorandum, Privatization of Gas del Estado S.E. dated September 1992, Exhibit C-50.\n\nThe original members of the Gasinvest Consortium are listed in Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration of 31 October 2003 [hereinafter \"Total RFA\"] at fn 95, p. 41.\n\nSee Total RFA, *supra* note 44, para. 98 and Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits of 11 April 2008 [hereinafter \"Total PHB Merits\"], paras. 271-272.\n\nOn 26 July 2001, the Centre received a Request for Arbitration from CMS against Argentina complaining that Argentina had breached various provisions of the BIT between the US and Argentina through various measures affecting CMS\u2019s stake in TGN, principally the pesification of the TGN tariffs, the elimination of the US Producer Price Index [hereinafter \"US PPI\"] adjustment of tariffs and their subsequent freezing. The award rendered in that matter was submitted in these proceedings, *CMS* Award, *supra* note 29, para. 58, Exhibit CL-82. The CMS tribunal held, differently from the Decision on Liability in this arbitration, that the pesification of TGN\u2019s tariffs - and not just the lack of periodic indexation - was also a breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under the applicable BIT. The Tribunal awarded to CMS the principal amount of $133.2 million for the loss suffered in respect of its 29.42% share in TGN.\n\n35.\n\nIn March 2000, one of the investors in the Gasinvest consortium, the TransCanada Group (\"TCPL\"), decided to sell its share. On 30 May 2000, Total agreed to purchase a 19.23% stake in TGN from TCPL for an amount of US$230 million. This transaction was completed, and the shares in TGN were transferred to Total, on 23 January 2001.47 Total has held its shareholding in TGN continuously since then. However, as a result of TGN\u2019s debt restructuring in 2006, Total\u2019s stake in TGN decreased from 19.23% to 15.35%.48\n\nSee Total PHB Merits, *supra* note 45, para. 273, where a diagram explains the corporate structure of Gasinvest and TGN and Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits of 8 April 2005 [hereinafter \"Total MM\"], para. 53.\n\nSee Total PHB Merits, **supra** note 45, para. 582. In the calculations relating to the but-for scenario with no debt restructuring of TGN the original percentage must therefore be used. The Tribunal notes that in the *quantum* phase Total and its experts have clarified that Total\u2019s exact holding of TGN was 19.19% of TGN (sometimes rounded as 19.2%) from 2000 to 2006. Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 69, fn. 99. The Tribunal will utilize in this Award therefore the figure of 19.2%.\n\n***B. Total\u2019s Claims in respect of its Investment in TGN in the Liability Phase and the Tribunal\u2019s Findings in the Decision on Liability***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn relation to its investment in TGN, Total has claimed in this arbitration that Argentina breached various articles of the BIT, by taking a number of measures as of the end of 2001, most of which derived from or followed Law 25,561/02 (the \"Emergency Law\"). Together with the Emergency Law itself, Total claimed that these measures breached or revoked the commitments made by Argentina upon which Total relied in making its investment. More specifically, Total has claimed that in relation to its investment in TGN these measures include:\n\n- the forced conversion of dollar-denominated public service tariffs into pesos (or \"pesification\") at a rate of one to one;\n\n- the abolition of the adjustment of public service tariffs based on the United States Producer Price Index (\"US PPI\") and other international indices;\n\n- the \"pesification\" of dollar-denominated private contracts at a rate of one to one; and\n\n- the freezing of the gas consumer tariff (which is the sum of the: (a) wellhead price of gas; (b) gas transportation tariff; and (c) gas distribution tariff).\n\n37.\n\nTotal argued that these measures: expropriated Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT; resulted in unfair and inequitable treatment of Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Article 3 of the BIT; discriminated against Total\u2019s investment in TGN in breach of Articles 3 and 4 of the BIT; and are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligation to respect specific undertakings contrary to Article 10 of the BIT.\n\n38.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability (at paragraph 184), the Tribunal partially upheld Total\u2019s claim in respect of the breach of Article 3 of the BIT (Fair and Equitable Treatment). The Tribunal concluded at paragraph 184:\n\n(i) that Argentina breached its obligation under Article 3 of the BIT to grant fair and equitable treatment to Total by not periodically readjusting TGN\u2019s domestic tariffs in force in pesos in January 2002 from 1 July 2002 onwards; and\n\n(ii) that the damages thereby suffered by Total must be compensated by Argentina.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected all other claims by Total related to its investment in TGN under Article 3, as well as under other provisions of the BIT, specifically under Article 5.2 (indirect expropriation) and Article 4 of the BIT (non-discrimination).49\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 199 and 217. The Tribunal also rejected Total\u2019s claim under Article 10 BIT (specific undertakings), in substance by finding that Argentina had not made any relevant, binding commitments to Total (Decision on Liability, para. 144 ft) and formally, in the final paragraph 485(b): \"All other claims by Total, including those under Articles 4 and 5 of the BIT, are rejected\".\n\n39.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal noted that in so deciding it was only partially granting Total\u2019s claim concerning TGN under Article 3 of the BIT. As stated in paragraph 182:\n\n*The Tribunal has found that some of Argentina\u2019s measures challenged by Total were not in breach of Article 3 of the BIT (pesification and suppression of the US dollar link for the semiannual automatic adjustments), while other measures or aspects thereof are in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under Article 3 of the BIT (lack of readjustment). Therefore, the Tribunal cannot determine the damages suffered by Total, since the calculations submitted by Total regarding quantum are based on different premises for Argentina\u2019s liability. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to postpone the quantification of damages to a separate quantum phase.*\n\n40.\n\nIn deciding that Argentina had breached Article 3 of the BIT by not periodically readjusting TGN\u2019s domestic tariffs in force in pesos in January 2002 from 1 July 2002 onwards, the Tribunal laid down certain principles concerning the calculation of the damages ensuing therefrom at paragraph 183 of the Decision on Liability:50\n\n*The Tribunal considers it appropriate at this point to give some general indications concerning the criteria, based on the above findings on liability, according to which those damages should be calculated in the quantum phase, both as to the time period to be considered, and the basis of the calculation. Based on the analysis conducted above the Tribunal considers that the freezing of the tariffs was in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause as of 1 July, 2002 (i.e., the first 120-day deadline established by Res.* *20/2002 for the completion of the renegotiation process). Since Argentina has not remedied this block by any of the renegotiation mechanisms that it introduced after the Emergency Law or by operation of the previous mechanisms that nominally remained in force, the Tribunal believes that a six-month periodic readjustment of the tariff, as provided for in the Gas Regime but based on the evolution of local prices, would be appropriate to calculate the damages caused to Total. The calculation of these damages should take into account the difference between the revenues actually received by TGN (pro-rata according to Total\u2019s share) and those which TGN would have obtained if the tariffs in pesos in force on 1 July, 2002 had been readjusted on a semi-annual basis to reflect the variation of prices in Argentina, [footnotes omitted]*\n\nOther statements by the Tribunal, which may be relevant for the *quantum* phase, are found in the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 122, 175 and 198.\n\n***C. Total\u2019s Claims for Damages in the Quantum Phase in respect of TGN***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nTotal submitted a revised calculation of damages \"in line with the parameters established by the Tribunal in its Decision\" in its Quantum Memorial of 17 June 2011. Together with its Memorial, Total submitted the CL First Report on \"Damage Valuation for Total\u2019s Investments in Argentina based on the Decision on Liability\". This CL First Report, by Total\u2019s experts, Dr. Manuel Abdala and Professor Pablo Spiller, revised, on the basis of the Decision on Liability, the damage valuations that the same experts had previously submitted for Total as part of the merits phase of this arbitration (\"LECG Reports\"). The need for the revision stems first of all from the Tribunal\u2019s finding that mandatory pesification did not constitute a breach of the Treaty.51 This required substantial changes in the assumptions made in the previous experts\u2019 reports and calculations submitted on behalf of Total, since those reports were based on the premise that in the but-for scenario the dollar-based postprivatization legal framework of the gas sector would have remained unaltered.\n\nDecision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 164.\n\n42.\n\nBased on the five \"Guiding Principles and Methodology\" for the calculation of *quantum* that it presented in its Quantum Memorial,52 Total summarized the key elements of its claims for damages in respect of TGN as follows:\n\na) the valuation date is 1 July 2002;\n\nb) to calculate damages, the Tribunal must compare the value of Total\u2019s stake in TGN in the actual and but-for scenarios;\n\nc) damages should be based on cash flows projected through to the end of TGN\u2019s Licence in 2027, then discounted back to 1 July 2002;\n\nd) the but-for scenario should assume tariff adjustments beginning on 1 July 2002;and\n\ne) the value of TGN in the actual scenario, with the tariff freeze in place, is zero.53\n\nSee **supra** para. 16 and Total QM, **supra** note 5, paras. 13-68.\n\nTotal PHB, *supra* note 11, para. 14.\n\n43.\n\nOn this basis, Total considers that the damages it has suffered in respect of its investment in TGN due to Argentina\u2019s breach of the BIT amount to its *pro rata* stake of the difference between two values (calculated using the DCF method) of TGN:\n\na) TGN\u2019s fair market value as of 1 July 2002, based on TGN\u2019s revenues (and its related costs) as they would have been, had the pesified tariffs in force on 1 July 2002 been readjusted on that date according to the previous six-month Argentine Producers\u2019 Prices Index in pesos (reflecting the reference in the Gas Regime to the US PPI which is an indexation based on the producers\u2019 prices evolution), and henceforth on a semi-annual basis through to the expiry of the Licence in 2027 (the \"but-for\" scenario); and\n\nb) TGN\u2019s value as of 1 July 2002 based on its actual revenues (and its related costs) following Argentina\u2019s treaty breach, based on actual data available up to 31 May 2011, then projected to 2027, assuming that TGN\u2019s tariffs would increase by 20% in July 2011 and subsequently by wholesale inflation, starting in 2012 (the \"actual\" scenario).54\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 74, fn. 115. Total proposes a WACC of 12.22%, reflecting the company\u2019s real cost of raising funds; see Total QM **supra** note 5, para. 75 and fn. 116, to calculate the net present value of TGN\u2019s future cash flows (as of 1 July 2002) under the DCF method relying on the updated calculation of its experts; (see Compass Lexecon Report of 17 June 2011 [hereinafter \"CL First Report\"], para. 113). Total notes there that \"this WACC is broadly consistent with the 11.50% that consultants to recommended as the cost of capital applicable to TGN as of October 2001\". Based on the CL First Report, para. 131, Total refers at paras. 95-96 of the Total QM to an internal rate of return for TGN in the but-for scenario of 11.37%. The Tribunal recalls that the higher the rate used to discount future cash flows, the lower is the resulting actualized capital value of a company based on the present value of future flows at the reference date (here the value on 1 July 2002 of the 2002-2027 revenues from the but-for tariff). The tariff increases were based on the US PPI in the pre-Emergency Law Gas Regulatory Framework.\n\n44.\n\nTotal assumes that in both the but-for and actual scenarios TGN\u2019s tariffs are pesified; TGN\u2019s Licence expires in 2027 and is not renewed; and TGN\u2019s WACC (as of 1 July 2002) of 12.22% is used as the discount rate to calculate the net present value of TGN\u2019s future cash flows (as of 1 July 2002).\n\n45.\n\nTotal describes its \"Key assumptions for the but-for scenario\" as follows:55\n\na) TGN\u2019s tariffs are adjusted for the first time on 1 July 2002, taking into account inflation since 1 January 2002;\n\nb) TGN\u2019s tariffs are indexed to domestic Argentine prices on a semi-annual and retroactive basis, using the Argentine Producer Price Index (the \"IPIM\");\n\nc) TGN does not restructure its debt (TGN would have had enough cash flows to avoid the restructuring that took place in the actual scenario since TGN would have been a viable company56); and\n\nd) TGN is entitled to cover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return.\n\nTotal\u2019s but-for model includes an increase of certain costs only (those \"revenue-related\") and does not include an increase of investments. As for costs, Total explains that an increase of revenues with no additional transported quantities57 would not entail an increase of TGN\u2019s cost items that do not depend on revenues.58 As to investments, Total points out that \"new investments were not mandatory under the regulatory framework, and would only have been executed if a particular proposed new project or expansion would have generated a return equal to TGN\u2019s costs of capital\".59 Total supports this position by explaining that under the Licence, TGN is required to maintain physical assets and hand them back \"in good working order and condition\" at the end of the concession, but is not obliged \"to maintain constant the accounting useful life of the system\" nor is there any economic rationale to do so.60\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 77.\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, paras. 12-13 also assumes that in the but-for scenario \"TGN\u2019s firm contracted capacity for export transport volumes would have been the same as in the actual scenario\".\n\nOn the contrary, Total takes into account the possibility of a decline in volumes due to the increase in price in the but-for scenario, see CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 108.\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, paras. 109 and 125.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 98.\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 126; CL Second Report, para. 18 with reference to Article 5.2 of the TGN Licence, Exhibit C-53.\n\n46.\n\nIn respect of the actual scenario, Total takes into account in its Quantum Memorial that tariffs have been frozen from 1 July 2002 to 31 May 2011. Total assumes a tariff increase of 20% in July 2011 and that the Government \"will adjust the tariffs in accordance with Argentine PPI on a periodic basis\" thereafter.61 Total also takes into account that due to insufficient revenues to cover its outstanding debts (a large proportion of which had been undertaken in US dollars outside Argentina before the pesification), TGN had to negotiate two debt restructuring agreements with its creditors after having defaulted in 2006 and 2008.62 In any case, Total\u2019s calculation of the actual value of TGN based on the CL First Report concludes that the equity value of TGN for its shareholders is zero since the total firm financial value was less than its total financial debts.\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 99. The above tariff increases had not been granted in 2011. Further dates have been supplied in the CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 122-123.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 100. In the actual scenario, Total\u2019s stake in TGN decreased due to the renegotiation with the creditors after the default of 2008 to 15.4% In Total\u2019s but-for scenario TGN does not default on its debt and Total\u2019s shareholding remains unchanged at 19.2%.\n\n47.\n\nOn the above premises and assumptions and the calculations of its experts based thereon, Total claims that while TGN had no value in the actual scenario as of 1 July 2002, its equity value would have been $499.9 million at the same date in the but-for scenario, with a corresponding loss as to Total\u2019s 19.2% equity stake in TGN of $95.2 million.63\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 103, based on the CL First Report, *supra* note 54, Table II at para. 35. This amount of US$95.2 million takes into account that in the actual scenario Total received a cash dividend of US$0.7 million in 2007, see also Universidad de Buenos Aires Valuation Report of 31 August 2011 [hereinafter, \"UBA First Valuation Report\"], note 144.\n\n***D. Argentina\u2019s Position as to the Calculation of Damages in respect of TGN***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nAs mentioned above at paragraphs 20 to 23, Argentina contests the general principles relied upon by Total to evaluate damages. In relation to the specific parameters to be used to determine the damages suffered by Total in respect of its equity participation in TGN, Argentina objects to several of the assumptions made by Total. Moreover, Argentina points to what it considers to be \"inconsistencies\" in Total\u2019s valuation model. Argentina considers that these inconsistencies are reflected in Total\u2019s expert reports of 2011, as they propose a higher firm value for TGN ($104.1 million as of 1 July 2002, including Total\u2019s loss as Technical Operator) than in their original quantification of damages of 2007 ($87 million as of 31 December 2001) \"notwithstanding the fact that the Tribunal dismissed a significant portion of the measures challenged by Total\".64\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 108 and 132-133. Total\u2019s experts justify this result (notwithstanding the fact that Total\u2019s experts\u2019 report of 2007 assumed that pesification of the tariffs was a breach, while their estimates of 2011 acknowledge that the Decision on Liability rejected that claim), the CL Second Report, *supra* note 23, para. 81. Total\u2019s experts explain that the main reason for this discrepancy is that in 2007 they had assumed that tariffs would have increased and had consequently attributed a residual value of $11.7 million to TGN in the actual scenario. In their 2011 valuation, Total\u2019s experts have taken into account, instead, that tariffs \"are still frozen\". Total\u2019s experts consider that TGN\u2019s residual value in the actual scenario is nil, CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 28; they assume however in their model for the actual scenario that TGN tariffs would be increased by 20% in July 2011 and that the tariffs would thereafter be semi-annually increased by the IPIM (an evolution that apparently has not taken place in reality), CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 122-123.\n\n49.\n\nFirst, Argentina denies that the first tariff increase to be calculated in July 2002 should reflect retroactively inflation increases as from January 2002.65\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 91.\n\n50.\n\nSecond, Argentina disagrees with Total and its experts when they suggest using the IPIM as the most appropriate index for making the adjustments indicated by the Tribunal, primarily because the US PPI was referred to in the original Gas Regulatory Framework.66 Argentina challenges the justification advanced by Total and its experts that wholesale prices, reflected in the PPI, rather than consumer/retail prices, reflected in the Consumer Price Index (\"IPC\"), are more representative of the costs of an activity such as gas transportation. According to Argentina, this position was rejected by the Tribunal when it stated in the Decision on Liability that a balanced interpretation of the regulatory regime is called for, taking into account that, besides the viability of this public service, consumer protection is one of the primary objectives of the Gas Law. This objective requires that the tariffs be just and reasonable for consumers while ensuring that utilities can earn a reasonable rate of return.67\n\n*lb id.,* para. 92.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 95 with reference to the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 160.\n\n51.\n\nTherefore, Argentina suggests that from 2004 forward, domestic price indexes representative of TGN\u2019s cost structure, as elaborated by its experts from UBA, be used, weighting the influence of these price indexes according to their ability to represent the main cost items of TGN. On this basis, Argentina proposes the following weighting for the periodic tariff increases in the but-for scenario: IPC 21.40%, IPIM 38.38%, CVS 27.85%, and ER 12.36%.68 Argentina\u2019s experts construe, therefore, the increase of tariffs for TGN up to the end of the concession based on what was referred to as a \"blended index\". However, with respect to the period of \"economic emergency\" from 2002-2003, when inflation was in double digits and the difficulties for consumers most severe, Argentina suggests using a tariff adjustment based exclusively on the IPC index.69\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 71. Where IPC stands for \"Consumer Price Index\" (\"CPI\"), IPIM for \"Domestic Wholesale Price Index\", CVS for \"Salary Variation Coefficient\", and ER for \"Exchange Rate\".\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 101.\n\n52.\n\nAs to the other aspects of the but-for scenario proposed by Total in its valuation method, Argentina objects to several of the assumptions made by Total\u2019s experts, notably in respect of volumes, evolution of operating costs, the assumptions concerning the need and obligation to make additional investments and the appropriate rate to be used to discount future revenues.70\n\nAnother divergence between the Parties concerns the relevance of the export business of TGN which was ultimately not affected either by the pesification or by the freezing of the domestic tariffs. Total takes into account the existence of export revenues for TGN (which have become proportionally more relevant after the pesification and the freezing of the domestic tariffs) as well as the availability of additional transport capacity for the domestic market due to the early termination of some export contracts, CL First Report, ****supra**** note 54, para. 108. By contrast, Argentina does not take into account export revenues since they are not relevant for the formulation of the pesified but-for revenues, see UBA Second Valuation Report, ****supra**** note 23, para. 136. Total\u2019s experts challenge this approach because it ignores the existence of export revenues as an additional source of funds to meet TGN\u2019s financial obligations included in the but-for scenario and results in reducing the value of TGN\u2019s equity in both the actual and but-for scenarios; see CL Second Report, ****supra**** note 23, paras. 12-16. In response, UBA in its Second Valuation Report, ****supra**** note 23, para. 140, rectifies its calculation so as to exclude the corresponding part of TGN debt.\n\n53.\n\nWith respect to TGN\u2019s costs dynamics in the but-for scenario, Argentina\u2019s experts propose to apply the various indexes they use for the \"blended index\", applying the one most appropriate for the kind of expenses involved (such as wages, materials, services and supplies by third parties, etc.)71. As for investments in fixed assets, Argentina\u2019s experts consider that in the actual scenario \"TGN has reduced investments in fixed assets significantly in the last 9 years\", with a resulting decrease of the useful life of TGN\u2019s fixed assets. This, they say, cannot be accepted in a but-for scenario of higher revenues in light of the terms of the Licence and TGN should have made additional investments in line with its increased revenues.72\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 242.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 185-190.\n\n54.\n\nA further disagreement concerns the use of the DCF method to bring the future revenues of TGN to present value and thereby determine the company\u2019s value. Argentina submits that the APV based on the calculation of two discount rates, namely the fiscal shield costs and that of the \"unlevered capital cost\", should be used instead. UBA calculates the latter as the summing of a risk-free interest rate and \"an equity risk premium adjusted by the country risk value\" in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\"CAPM\").73\n\nSee UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 41-48 and paras. 219 ff.\n\n55.\n\nArgentina\u2019s experts consider that TGN would have been required to restructure its debt also in the but-for scenario, notwithstanding the higher tariffs resulting from periodic increases. According to Argentina\u2019s experts, in 2002 TGN had to pay capital maturities of $122 million and interest payments of $38.5 million for which it did not have adequate financial means. They note also that only 7% of the debt had been incurred with local banks and that 97% was denominated in foreign currency (bearing in mind that also a part of the debt with local banks was in US dollars).74 In Argentina\u2019s experts\u2019 analysis, even in the but-for scenario the company\u2019s asset value would have been lower than the debt volume so that TGN would not have been able to cover the repayment obligations with its revenues.75\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 136.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 147-150. In response to Total\u2019s criticism that the UBA model does not take into account TGN\u2019s export revenues in its UBA Second Valuation Report, **supra** note 23, para. 140, UBA, rather than including export revenues in both scenarios, excluded in its calculation the part of TGN debt that corresponds to the export business, see **supra** note 70.\n\n56.\n\nArgentina agrees with Total that the value of TGN was zero in 2002 in the actual scenario. However, Argentina\u2019s experts\u2019 assumptions and calculations lead them to conclude that TGN would neither have had a positive value as of 1 July 2002 in the but-for scenario, since TGN\u2019s debt was considerably higher than the net value of its assets in that scenario as well.76 Focusing on Total\u2019s position as a minority shareholder in TGN, Argentina concludes that Total had sustained no loss in this capacity since its equity stake had no value in the actual scenario and the tariff adjustments applicable in the but-for scenario would not have reversed this situation. Argentina concludes that the emergency measures did not cause any damage to Claimant.77\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, supra note 63, Table, para. 152. UBA\u2019s Valuation Report states further at para. 154, that the reason, therefore, \"is the indebtedness policy applied by the company. The concentration of maturities, and the risky decision of financing itself with a foreign currency led TGN to its current financial situation.\"\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 125.\n\n***E. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n----------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAs mentioned above at paragraph 24, the positions expressed by the Parties and their experts in their Quantum Memorials were refined and, in part, modified in the course of the further written exchanges.78 These submissions have been supplemented by their statements and the evidence of their expert witnesses at the hearing on *quantum* held on 19-21 December 2011, their written answers to the questions put to them by the Tribunal before and after the hearings79 and in the Quantum Post-Hearing Briefs.80\n\nTotal QR together with CL Second Report; and Argentina QR together with UBA Second Valuation Report, *supra* note 23.\n\nSee PO No. 5, PO No. 7 and PO No. 8, *supra* note 24.\n\nTotal PHB, **supra** note 11. As a result of this exercise Argentina has engaged in methodologies for appraising the value of a firm for a shareholder (such as Total\u2019s equity stake in TGN) based on the discount of future revenues, rather than insisting that only the amount of dividends is relevant, see UBA Response to Procedural Order No. 7 of 27 March 2012 [hereinafter \"UBA Response to PO No. 7\"] annexed to Argentina PHB, **supra** note 28.\n\n58.\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 26, in the Tribunal\u2019s view there is no doubt that Total is entitled to monetary compensation equivalent to the losses it suffered due to the breach by Argentina of the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3 of the BIT in accordance with the customary international law rule that requires a State to provide \"full reparation for the injury caused by its internationally wrongful act\"81. This principle is applicable in respect of economic damages caused by a wrongful act, irrespective of the content of the obligation breached, which may entail an unlawful expropriation or the violation of a treaty obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment as is the case here.82\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31.1.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 198.\n\n59.\n\nAs mentioned above at paragraph 26 the directions and requirements on compensation found in Article 5(2) of the BIT may guide the Tribunal in the instances dealt with here under Article 3 of the BIT.83As noted in paragraph 26, Article 5(2) in prescribing an \"adequate\" compensation *(adecuada, ad\u00e9quate* in the Spanish and French original texts, respectively) requires a payment \"calculated in accordance with the real value\"84 of the investment affected, thus implying compensation amounting to full reparation in conformity with customary principles in this respect.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 198, where the Tribunal, in rejecting Total\u2019s claim that Argentina had breached also Article 5(2) of the BIT in respect to TGN, noted that \"damages under the heading of indirect expropriation would not be different from damages due to breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard\".\n\nIn the French text *\"calcul\u00e9 sur la valeur r\u00e9elle\".* in Spanish *\"calculado sobre el valor real\".*\n\n60.\n\nIn order to determine the losses of Total and to adopt calculations that will ensure the best possible correspondence between the monetary value of the losses and the amount of the compensation, the Tribunal will base itself on the general principles which have been highlighted above.85 The Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that in the actual scenario TGN had no value for its shareholders as of 1 July 2002. The default of TGN on its debt in 2002, followed by a further default in 2008, and the subsequent processes of renegotiation with its creditors confirm that in the actual scenario TGN, subject to the freezing of its tariffs, has no equity value. Nevertheless, it has been able to continue operating since the crisis at the end of 2001. In view of the above, the loss suffered by Total as a TGN shareholder, is equivalent, *pro rata* of its shareholding to the value that TGN would have in the but-for scenario.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 26-32.\n\n61.\n\nBased on the Decision on Liability, in order to ascertain such but-for value it is necessary to determine on one hand (a) the increased revenues which TGN would have been entitled to receive through periodic semi-annual tariff increases based on domestic inflation, and on the other hand (b) the costs it would have incurred. The principles applicable to these items, flowing from the Decision on Liability, are addressed in the following paragraphs.\n\n62.\n\nThe relevant date to ascertain the but-for value of TGN is 1 July 2002, since at that date Argentina started breaching its obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment to Total in respect of TGN by not readjusting its tariffs every six months \"based on the evolution of local prices\".86 In order to respect these indications, which the Tribunal hereby confirms, and calculate the loss of revenues due to TGN, the TGN domestic tariffs should be readjusted from that day forward to take into account the increase of Argentina\u2019s prices in the previous six-month period, and every six months thereafter until the end of TGN\u2019s concession in 2027.\n\nDecision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 183.\n\n63.\n\nThe approach of Total\u2019s experts in this respect is therefore sound. The Tribunal cannot accept the different approach suggested by Argentina that adjustments should not take into account the price variations of the first semester of 2002, this being contrary to the findings and the logic underlying the decision of the Tribunal on the issue.87 Argentina and its experts make other assumptions that are not in line with the Decision on Liability: such as reducing the future tariff adjustments by an \"efficiency factor\" and contemplating a five-year periodic tariff adjustment by ENARGAS.88 Argentina also assumes that TGN is under an obligation under the licence to hand over the material assets (pipelines, etc.) in a condition equivalent to when it first acquired them. The Tribunal concludes, instead, that the obligation of TGN is somehow more limited, as submitted by Total, namely to \"maintain material assets in good working order and condition insofar as is necessary for the suitable provision of the licensed services.\"89\n\nAs to the justification for starting the indexation of the pesified tariffs from 2002, see the Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1, para. 175. Total points out that notwithstanding the statement of principle against indexation in 2002, UBA\u2019s but-for indexation model on 1 July 2002 takes into account Argentine inflation also over the first months of 2002, based on the CPI index, Total QR, ***supra*** note 23, para. Ill with reference to UBA First Valuation Report, ***supra*** note 63, paras. 70 and 152.\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63, paras. 72-77. An overview of UBA\u2019s various assumptions is found in the UBA Second Valuation Report, **supra** note 23, paras. 31-56. The Tribunal recalls that the Decision on Liability, para. 183, fn. 196, specifies that through a periodic six-month adjustment of the tariffs taking into account the domestic inflation from the beginning of 2002, the damages suffered by Total by the lack of both ordinary and extraordinary reviews will also be made good.\n\nSee TGN Licence, **supra** note 40, Article 5.2, Exhibit C-53(1). See also **supra** para. 46.\n\n64.\n\nThe Parties also come to completely different results as to the loss suffered by Total in respect of its equity in TGN - around $100 million according to Total and zero according to Argentina. This is due to different assumptions and, in part, different methods of calculation in their but-for models, both as concerns the positive components of TGN (revenues from tariffs) and the negative ones (costs, debt/financial burden). The Tribunal will examine and compare the various relevant methods and data submitted by each Party and compare them as appropriate in order to determine Total\u2019s loss.\n\n65.\n\nThe Parties disagree first of all, as mentioned above, as to the basis for construing TGN\u2019s tariffs in the but-for scenario. Total is of the view that the IPIM (that is the Argentine PPI) must be used because this index corresponds to the US PPI, which was used under the Gas Regime when Argentina\u2019s currency and tariff were pegged to and expressed in US dollars. Total finds support for its position in paragraph 183 of the Decision on Liability where the Tribunal held that \"a six-month periodic readjustment of the tariff, as provided in the Gas Regime but based on the evolution of local prices, would be appropriate to calculate the damages to Total\". Argentina objects to Total\u2019s position recalling that besides the viability of public service providers, consumer protection is one of the primary objectives of the Gas Law.90 Argentina acknowledges the findings at paragraph 183 of the Decision on Liability on which Total relies, but points out that at paragraph 160 of the Decision on Liability the Tribunal stated that \"a balanced interpretation is called for, taking into account that consumer protection is one of the primary objectives of the Gas Law, which provides that tariffs shall be just and reasonable for consumers and at the same time shall ensure that utilities can earn a reasonable rate of return.\"\n\nSee *supra* para. 50.\n\n66.\n\nIn summary, in deciding how to calculate the \"evolution of the local prices\", the Tribunal is faced with the existence of various indexes, whose variation is officially determined in Argentina, in order to measure the variation of different classes of prices.91 The issue is complicated by the fact that the different indexes have had in the relevant period a divergent evolution at various times.92 The Tribunal considers that the index to be adopted for the but-for evolution of TGN\u2019s tariffs from 1 July 2002 must balance and reconcile the various indications contained in the original Gas Regime as stated in the Decision on Liability: on one hand the \"principle that gas transportation and distribution activities are to be regulated to ensure just and reasonable tariffs\" (Article 2(d) of the Gas Law); and on the other hand the \"protection of consumer rights, as the first objective of the Law\" (Article 2(a)).93 In view of the above, the Tribunal does not consider that the transposition of the reference to the US PPI contained in the TGN license94 to the IPIM is required. The Tribunal is rather of the view that the use of an index that reflects the costs structure of TGN is more adequate for the purpose of ensuring that the hypothetical but-for tariff to be used for semi-annual adjustment be \"reasonable\". The Tribunal considers that the \"blended index\" proposed by Argentina as elaborated by UBA (\"UBA\u2019s Index\") ensures such reasonableness. Since this \"blended index\" is based on the proportion in which the various categories of prices whose indexes are used were reflected in the costs structure of TGN, it also reflects more accurately the evolution which would have taken place had Argentina complied with the Gas Law tariff framework.95 As explained below, the acceptance of UBA\u2019s Index does not mean, however, that the Tribunal shares all of the other suggestions and assumptions of Argentina and its experts on the application of such an index for the purpose of determining Total\u2019s damages in respect of TGN. Specifically UBA\u2019s Index, once adopted on the basis of the above reasons, must be used for the entire period of time from 1 July 2002 onwards. Argentina\u2019s submission that the IPC should be used if indexation is to be considered at all during the \"economic emergency\" of 2002-2003, must be rejected since it would negate the very reasons for which the Tribunal has found UBA\u2019s Index reasonable.96\n\nThe Tribunal has left open what indices to use in order to calculate the tariff readjustment in the but-for scenario, Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 183.\n\nThus UBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63, para. 168 sets forth a table showing that the IPIM increased much more than the IPC in 2002. According to CL\u2019s calculations, however, the dynamic of the IPIM over the period of the concession is not overall markedly different from that of the UBA blended index, see CL Response to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 7 [hereinafter \"CL Response to PO No. 7\"], para. 6, Graph 2 (annexed to Total PHB, **supra** note 11).\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 49.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that the use of the US PPI for periodic readjustment of the tariff is not found in the Gas Law itself, but rather in the TGN Licence, *supra* note 40, at Section 9.4.1.1, Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 54.\n\nSee UBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63, paras. 70-72 pointing out that the proposed weightings (IPC: 21.40%; IPIM: 38.38%; 27.85%; ER: 12.36%) were adopted for the (uncompleted) extraordinary review of 2004 and result from the analysis of Annex H of the 2003 Annual Financial Statements of TGN. Total does not appear to challenge this correspondence while maintaining that it has correctly chosen the IPIM index because \"wholesale prices are more representative of producers\u2019 costs than consumer prices or other indices\", CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 20.\n\nArgentina\u2019s proposal is set out in Argentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 103.\n\n67.\n\nIn order to assess the Parties\u2019 estimates of TGN\u2019s revenues in the but-for scenario based on UBA\u2019s Index, the Tribunal asked each Party (in PO No. 7) \"to submit an estimate with graph and quantification of an indexation of the \u2018but-for\u2019 tariffs with the first increase on 1 July 2002 based on the \u2018UBA Index\u2019 until the end of the concession\" together with their Post-Hearing Briefs on Quantum. In their Response, Total\u2019s experts submitted graphs comparing the actual tariff with but-for tariffs based both on the IPIM and on UBA\u2019s blended index.97 Total\u2019s experts calculated the net revenue of TGN from tariffs adjusted by the UBA index until the end of the concession, maintaining unchanged all other variables, such as costs, discount rate (WACC) and financial debt, as they had employed them for their valuation based on the IPIM. Using the UBA index, Total\u2019s experts determined the present value (as of 2002) of Total\u2019s equity in TGN in the but-for scenario as being $92.6 million.98 The comparable value using the IPIM index was $95.9 million.99 Since Total\u2019s experts assume that TGN has no value in the actual scenario,100 those amounts would represent the loss of Total in respect of its equity in TGN depending on which index is used.\n\nCL Response to PO No. 7, **supra** note 92, pp. 7-8, Graph I and II (annexed to Total PHB, **supra** note 11). The calculation of Total\u2019s losses based on the UBA blended index rather than on the IPIM results *(ceteris paribus)* amounts to $92.6 million rather than $95.9 million *(Ibid.,* Table IV, p. 9), before deduction of $0.7 million for dividends received.\n\nSee CL Response to PO No. 7, *supra* note 92, para. 7, Table IV.\n\nSee CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 35, Table II.\n\nThis is also the assumption of Argentina\u2019s experts, who assume, however, that TGN would also be worthless in the but-for scenario because the value of its debt would be higher than its assets\u2019 value (see UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 33.\n\n68.\n\nArgentina also responded to the Tribunal\u2019s request by submitting a graph presenting the evolution of the blended index UBA had proposed.101 The evolution of the index submitted by UBA is similar to that of Total\u2019s experts, except for the years 2012-2013 where the latter estimate a higher rate of inflation, as will be discussed in a subsequent paragraph. The result of UBA Response to PO No. 7 is, however, completely different from that of Total\u2019s experts because the assumptions of UBA concerning other variables are quite different from those of Total\u2019s experts. As a consequence, UBA\u2019s conclusion remains that TGN\u2019s value is zero also in the but-for scenario.102 This conclusion is essentially based on the much lower value attributed by UBA to TGN assets due to the much higher rate used by UBA to discount TGN\u2019s future revenues (17.3% as against 12.22% by CL). The picture is not altered by the fact that CL deducts from the value of the assets a higher amount for Financial Debt (valued in its entirety without any post-default reduction), while UBA attributes a lower value to the Financial Debt since UBA considers that TGN would be unable to meet its debt in the but-for scenario as well.103\n\nUBA Response to PO No. 7, *supra* note 80, pp. 8-9.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 15, Table III.\n\nThe conclusions of the experts are found respectively in CL Response to PO No. 7, **supra** note 92, Tables IV and V, and in UBA Response to PO No. 7, **supra** note 80, Tables III, VIII and XIII.\n\n69.\n\nSubsequently, in PO No. 8 the Tribunal requested more details concerning the Parties\u2019 replies to PO No. 7, especially regarding their respective assumptions as to the future evolution of the price indexes until the end of the concession. The Tribunal\u2019s questions were without prejudice to its final determination of the appropriate indexation of TGN\u2019s tariffs in the but-for scenario.\n\n70.\n\nFrom the answers provided by the Parties, the Tribunal obtained helpful information on the elaboration of the various indexes used by their experts The respective assumptions and positions of the Parties have thereby been clarified and the differences between them reduced somewhat, but not entirely resolved. One major remaining difference is due to CL using for its calculations much higher inflation forecasts for 2012-2013 than those used by UBA.104 The Parties also make different assumptions as to the future evolution of the peso/US dollar exchange rate. Higher anticipated inflation means higher increases of the relevant indices, while higher devaluation leads to a lower but-for value of TGN in terms of US dollars. The Tribunal will explain in the following paragraphs how it has resolved these divergences which reflect the difficulty in objectively forecasting the evolution of a national economy such as Argentina\u2019s, especially over an extended period of time.\n\nThis results clearly by comparing the evolution of the prices proposed by Total and by Argentina which are both reproduced in CL Response to PO No. 7, ***supra*** note 92, Graph 1. The curve reflecting Argentina\u2019s proposed inflation data is found also in UBA Response to PO No. 7, ***supra*** note 80, p. 8. Specifically in order to clarify the difference the Tribunal has addressed to the Parties further questions in PO No. 8, ***supra*** note 24.\n\n71.\n\nFinally, while Total includes in its calculations the revenues of TGN deriving from exporting gas (both in the actual and in the but-for scenario), Argentina does not consider those revenues. Argentina argues that the decision of the Tribunal that pesified tariffs should have been revalued semi-annually from mid-2002 onwards is not applicable to export prices set in dollars. While the last point is correct, this does not justify excluding any revenues of TGN while deducting all its costs to determine how much the company would have been worth in the but for-scenario. In this respect, the adjustments proposed by Argentina\u2019s experts are eminently subjective and ultimately arbitrary.105\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that UBA is able to neutralize this flaw by reducing proportionally the costs and partially allocating TGN debt to the export business in its calculation. The proportion of foreign revenue of TGN varied between 23% (pre-devaluation in 2001) to 46% on average in 2002-2010, see Compass Lexecon\u2019s PowerPoint Presentation at the *quantum* hearing, Direct Testimony by Mr. Manuel A. Abdala and Professor Pablo T. Spiller, slide 8. UNIREN stated that \"TGN economic equation must be forecasted with all its sales, notwithstanding the fact that the resulting increases in tariffs are applied only to domestic sales\", 2005 Report on TGN, Exhibit ARA-167.\n\n72.\n\nAs mentioned above, the determination of the revenues of TGN in the but-for scenario is but one of several steps to determine the value of TGN at the date of 1 July 2002 in this scenario. The next step is to determine the actualization criteria to be used in order to value at that date the future/subsequent flows of those revenues. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with Total and its experts on the use of the DCF method. This method of calculating the present value of a company on the basis of a reasonable estimation of that company\u2019s future cash flows (net revenues), taking into account the risk involved in producing those cash flows and the time value of money, is commonly used. This approach is reflected in the World Bank\u2019s 1992 \"Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Investment\" and its definition of DCF106 as a method to determine adequate compensation based on fair market value. This method has been used by many international arbitral tribunals, including several ICSID tribunals in disputes against Argentina concerning the but-for value of utilities whose future revenues have been curtailed by measures found to be in breach of the relevant BIT\u2019s provisions.107\n\nSee World Bank Guidelines on Treatment of Foreign Investment, 7; ICSID Rev. 295, 1992, p. 304, Exhibit CL-49. The free cash flow to be discounted is, in any given year, the residual cash earned by a company after meeting all its operating and investment (capital) expenses and taxes, but before debt repayment and other financial payments which are calculated separately and deducted from the asset value calculated based on the DCF methodology, CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 31, fn. 38. DCF is also endorsed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility cit, Commentary to Article 36 (Compensation), paras. 26-27, as a recognized method of calculating damages in international law, Exhibit CL-23.\n\nSee *Phillips Petroleum v. Iran* (1989), para. 112, Exhibit CL-29; *ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award (2 October 2006), para. 501 ff, Exhibit CL-173. As to cases involving Argentina, the DCF method has been used in the *CMS* Award, *supra* note 29, para. 411 ff, Exhibit CL-82, and more recently in awards issued after the hearing on *quantum.* See *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (31 October 2011) [hereinafter *\"El Paso* Award\"], Exhibit CL-253, and *EDFInternational S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22, Award (11 June 2012) [hereinafter \"ADA Award\"].\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with Argentina that the amount of these flows cannot be calculated *a priori* because they are too \"uncertain\" or \"speculative\". It is possible to reasonably determine the but-for projection of future revenues stemming from tariffs based on regulations and concessions and, in fact, in response to PO No. 7 Argentina\u2019s experts provided calculations in that respect.108 Of course, a calculation using the DCF method, and any other method, requires careful appraisal of the relevant parameters concerning future developments, especially if extended over time. That said, such a calculation using the DCF method permits a reasonable valuation of the losses suffered by an investor, measured at a given point in time (past or current) due to a decrease of the future income of its investment. As to the alternative APV method submitted by Argentina, the Parties\u2019 arguments, evidence and debate at the *quantum* hearing have confirmed that this method \"is a variation of the general discounted cash flow method\", as stated by UBA.109 Under this method the present value of a company\u2019s business represents the sum of two present values: (a) the present value of the company\u2019s free cash flow, assuming that the company is exclusively financed with its own equity, calculated by discounting future flows at a Ku rate (the unlevered equity cost), and (b) \"the tax saving [\"shield\"] derived from the utilization of the financial debt as a funding source for its business\".110\n\nSee *infra* note 121.\n\nSee UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 41; T. Copeland, T. Koller, J. Murrin, *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies* (2000), pp. 131-132, Exhibit C-765.\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 43 - 48. As clarified at para. 51 of this First Report, UBA\u2019s model projects cash flows on an annual basis up to 2027, as established by the Gas Industry Regulatory Framework, exactly as in the CL DCF model.\n\n74.\n\nThe discussions and evidence referred to above have convinced the Tribunal that *in casu* reliance on the DCF model rather than on the APV model is more appropriate for various reasons. First of all, factoring in tax savings, as in the APV model, appears to be problematic. UBA itself is of the opinion that TGN would have not been profitable also in the but-for scenario to the point of being unable to meet its financial obligations. In the absence of profits, the relevance of a tax shield is, therefore, not apparent. Secondly, as explained by UBA in the Annex to its Valuation Report concerning TGN,111 the APV model requires making assumptions whose application by UBA to TGN appear debatable. This is the case especially in respect of the Beta factor (\"sensitivity of the share regarding market yield\"). In order to determine its value, UBA uses, \"due to the absence of comparable companies at a local level\", estimates based on a group of utilities operating in the North American market, which include companies engaged in activities different from that of TGN. The appropriateness of such a reference appears questionable and cannot be verified by the Tribunal. In fact, the comparability of the sample used by UBA was disputed by Total\u2019s experts since the industries referred to include both natural gas distributors and electric utilities.112 Similarly, the Tribunal is not persuaded of the soundness of UBA\u2019s premises for including in its proposed discount rate additional 0.50% for the \"incremental risk which would have derived from Argentina\u2019s inaction in the face of the crisis\" contributing to the high discount rate of 17.30% proposed by UBA.113\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 219-241.\n\nCL Second Report, *supra* note 23, paras. 53-57 and 69-78.\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 241.\n\n75.\n\nHaving determined that the \"classic\" DCF method is appropriate, the Tribunal must now address the WACC proposed and used by Total and challenged by Argentina.114 The Tribunal recalls that it is undisputed that the WACC reflects the cost of raising funds from shareholders and lenders for a typical company operating in a given industry.115 The experts for Total have calculated the WACC for TGN as of 2002 to be 12.22% and have used this discount rate to calculate the net present value of TGN\u2019s future cash flows as of 1 July 2002.116 Total points out that this WACC is \"broadly consistent\" with, and even somewhat higher (thus resulting in a lower actualized value of the firm) than \"the 11.50% that consultants to ENARGAS recommended as the cost of capital applicable to TGN as of October 2001\".117 On the basis of this evidence and the relevant arguments submitted, the Tribunal is of the view that the 12.22% discount rate proposed and used by Total is appropriate, while the rate of more than 17% proposed by UBA is not justified.118\n\nThe calculation of the relevant WACC under the DCF method is preferable to the calculations of the \"cost of the unlevered equity capital\" under the APV model (which UBA determines to be 17.30%, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph) where the appropriateness of certain figures and adjustments are difficult to evaluate as mentioned in the text. For example, \"the incremental risk which would have derived from Argentina\u2019s inaction in the face of the crisis\", valued by UBA at 0.50%, UBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63, para. 241. See also in the CL Second Report, **supra** note 23, paras. 47-50 the criticism of UBA\u2019s proposed methodology based on the ENARGAS cost of capital findings. In the Parties\u2019 respective Responses to PO No. 7, the Parties supplied the figures resulting from using the Claimant\u2019s WACC of 12.22% and the Respondent\u2019s estimated WACC under the APV model of 17.30%.\n\nDamage Valuation for Total\u2019s Investment in Argentina by Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller, LECG, LLC of 15 May 2007 [hereinafter \"LECG Damage Report\"], para. 36, submitted during the merits phase, explains that the \"WACC is computed as the weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity, with the weighting of the two based upon the optimal balance of debt and equity financing for the industry in question\".\n\nThe underlying calculations are found in Appendix D to the LECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115,\"Cost of Capital Methodology and Computation\".\n\nTotal QM, ***supra*** note 5, fn 116. The data supplied in Tables XLVIII and XLIX of Appendix D, referred to in the previous footnote, indicate that the capital structure of TGN was in line with that of other *\"transportadoras''* and that the WACC has not been affected by the pesification of 2002 contrary to UBA\u2019s statements. See also CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, para. 131 and Total QM, ***supra*** note 5, paras. 95-96 making further comparisons with slightly lower rates of TGN\u2019s internal rate of return and other relevant WACCs (ranging between 10% and 11%).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n76.\n\nHaving thus dealt with the \"positive\" components of TGN\u2019s business in the but-for scenario, we now turn to examine the \"negative\" components, namely capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenditures (OPEX) and financial costs required to meet the financial debt of TGN.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal has set forth above the different positions of the Parties on these items.119 According to Total, in the but-for scenario of higher TGN revenues most expenses would remain unchanged and there would be no economic need, nor legal requirement to increase investment expenditures. On the contrary, according to Argentina, the most appropriate of the various indexes contained in its proposed \"blended index\" should be applied to the different categories of expenses. As to investments in fixed assets, the use of UBA\u2019s blended index is advocated by Argentina considering that TGN has not been able to maintain required investment in the real scenario due to lack of resources.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 44 and 53.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that Argentina\u2019s position is partially justified in light of the totality of the evidence concerning the operation of TGN in the actual scenario. TGN has had to operate in a difficult situation due to insufficient revenues since 2002. TGN has been unable to service and repay its financial debt (as evidenced by the defaults and rescheduling of 2002 and 2008-2009) and was able to remunerate equity by paying dividends to its shareholders in 2007 only. As recognized and complained of by Total itself, due to the severe reduction in revenues, TGN has also been compelled to reduce operating expenses and to save on the maintenance of its infrastructure to the point of risking that its licence be revoked by ENARGAS.120\n\nSee Total PHB, *supra* note 11, paras. 466 and 469: \"Argentina\u2019s Measures destroyed the economic equilibrium of the Licence and reduced TGN\u2019s revenue to a level insufficient to cover its costs let alone to earn a reasonable rate of return.\"\n\n79.\n\nHowever, had TGN benefited from an increase in tariffs based on bi-annual revaluations in line with price increases, TGN revenues would have increased substantially (up to double in 2003). In such a scenario it is reasonable to believe that not all the additional revenues would have been used to remunerate equity and financial debt.\n\n80.\n\nRather, the Tribunal considers that in such a but-for scenario of reasonable domestic tariffs and revenues derived therefrom, enabling it to operate normally, TGN would have been able to meet all reasonable operating and capital expenses. TGN would have been able to meet the costs required for maintaining the equipment in proper operating conditions in accordance with the term of the Licence, before remunerating financial creditors and shareholders. The Tribunal concludes in this respect that in the but-for scenario the evolution of OPEX and CAPEX to be used is the one proposed by Argentina in paragraphs 242-246 of the UBA First Valuation Report. In order to obtain the relevant figures of TGN\u2019s net revenue applying Argentina\u2019s approach, the Tribunal asked both Parties in PO No. 7 to submit graphs and resulting data, using, in addition to the index/increase proposed by Total, also the one based on the above hypothesis of UBA. The Tribunal has taken note of the ensuing results, set forth for Total at Table V of CL Response to PO No. 7 and for Argentina at Table 4 of UBA Response to PO No. 7. The Tribunal considers that the calculations by Total\u2019s experts set forth the correct results where they apply UBA\u2019s proposed rate of increase for costs and investments, in order to determine future but-for revenues at the appropriate WACC of 12.22%. In their calculations, Argentina\u2019s experts apply the same price increases to the cost as Total\u2019s experts, but use for the positive components (TGN\u2019s revenues) the approach discussed above that the Tribunal considers not well founded. Therefore, the result reached by UBA\u2019s experts cannot be accepted by the Tribunal.121\n\nThe Tribunal notes that where UBA uses for calculations the same approach as Total\u2019s experts, UBA\u2019s valuation of TGN (and hence of Total\u2019s equity) in the but-for scenario is not so different from that of Total\u2019s experts. In fact, the latter value Total\u2019s equity at $80 million (down from their initial conclusion of $95.9 million), when using UBA\u2019s proposal for CAPEX and OPEX (CL Response to PO No. 7, ***supra*** note 92, Table V). Based on the same assumptions, UBA arrives at a value of $88.1 million (UBA Response to PO No. 7, ***supra*** note 80, Table IV). UBA\u2019s calculations exclude, however, the export business, \"proportionally adjusting\" costs, expenses and investments, an approach that the Tribunal has rejected as not accurate, see ***supra*** para. 71.\n\n81.\n\nBefore drawing its overall conclusions, the Tribunal must address the divergence between the Parties as to the ability of TGN to meet its financial obligations in the but-for scenario. The Tribunal recalls that Total\u2019s experts considered that TGN would have been able to do so, in the but-for scenario, as a consequence of reasonable tariffs resulting from periodic inflation-linked increases of the tariffs.122 However, according to Argentina, based on UBA\u2019s model, TGN would have defaulted in the but-for scenario for lack of adequate revenues. The reason, therefore, according to Argentina, is that TGN was over indebted and, specifically, had an unreasonably high *ratio* of debt in US dollars when its domestic tariffs became pesified at the beginning of 2002. Since this situation was due to a risky financial policy by TGN, Argentina submits that the ensuing negative effects cannot be \"charged\" to Argentina.123\n\nIn CL\u2019s but-for model, TGN would have faced a transitory shortage of funds in 2002, but would have been able to obtain a rollover of the amounts due in that year thanks to the foreseen adequacy of its cash flows in all subsequent years, see CL Response to PO No. 7, supra note 92, para. 14 and fn. 14, referring to the discussion on this issue at the *quantum* hearing.\n\nUBA Second Valuation Report, *supra* note 23, para. 52. Total\u2019s experts attribute instead the lack of adequate funds for TGN to service its debts in UBA\u2019s model to a faulty construction of UBA\u2019s model, because it does not include, in full or in part, in TGN\u2019s cash flows, the revenues from its export business.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal put specific questions to the Parties on this issue in PO No. 7.124 After having examined the answers, the Tribunal is of the view that TGN was not over-indebted in comparison with similar utilities in Argentina and that the share of debt incurred in US dollars outside Argentina, while high, was not unreasonable.125 Since the Tribunal has found that the pesification does not give rise to liability on the part of Argentina under the BIT, any imbalance in the actual scenario due to the fact that most revenues of TGN have been pesified is not legally attributable to Argentina. However, Total has demonstrated that in the but-for scenario, periodically adjusted tariffs would have allowed TGN to service its foreign denominated debt notwithstanding the pesification. A contrary hypothesis by UBA would mean that a default in the but-for scenario would be attributable to an inadequate adjustment of the domestic tariffs rather than to a risky financial policy by TGN.\n\nSee para. I (iii): \"the Tribunal invites the Parties to specify the amount of the financial debt of TGN before its default in 2002, the percentage that was pesified (domestic debt) and the percentage that remained in US dollars (debt due to foreign creditors). Furthermore, the Tribunal asks the Parties to specify the level of indebtedness of TGN and the proportion between foreign and domestic financial debt, both compared to similar operators in Argentina (to which the Parties referred to in the proceeding)\".\n\nSee CL Response to PO No. 7, supra note 92, para. 16-19, Table VI (37% pesified debt as compared to 63% non-pesified debt based on TGN\u2019s pre-default financial statements in 2002).\n\n83.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal fails to see the relevance of Argentina\u2019s arguments on this issue since they do not appear to support Argentina\u2019s thesis that Total exaggerates the damages it has suffered in respect of TGN. If, as Total submits for purposes of the but-for model, TGN would be able to fully comply with its financial debt, the value of this debt would be higher than under the hypothesis suggested by UBA where the financial debt is reduced as a result of renegotiations because of the impossibility for TGN to service its debt (default). A higher value of TGN\u2019s debt in the but-for scenario reduces TGN\u2019s net value and, therefore, would reduce the amount of Total\u2019s loss.126 Under Argentina\u2019s hypothesis, Total\u2019s equity value in TGN would be higher rather than lower and, therefore, the damages to TGN to be made good by Argentina would also be higher.\n\nThis is noted in CL First Report, *supra* note 54, fn. 20: \"Assuming that a similar debt restructuring would take place also in the but-for scenario would only increase damages\".\n\n84.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that a proper valuation of TGN in the but-for scenario, based on the revenues that TGN would have obtained but for the lack of readjustments of the tariffs in breach of the BIT, must include:127\n\n- A periodic semi-annual domestic tariff adjustment based on UBA\u2019s index of price increases in Argentina, starting from 1 July 2002 up to the end of TGN\u2019s concession in 2027;\n\n- Use of the DCF method to discount those future revenues using a WACC rate of 12.22%;\n\n- Taking into account TGN\u2019s revenues from its export business;\n\n- Deduction of operative and capital expenses (OPEX and CAPEX respectively) applying the various domestic prices indices as proposed by Argentina; and\n\n- Full service of TGN\u2019s financial debt.\n\nBy properly including all relevant parameters of the but-for tariff as discussed above, the hypothesized tariff would also comply with the overall requirement (Decision on Liability, **supra** notel, para. 122) that it allow the concessionaire \"to recover its costs, amortize its investments and make a reasonable rate of return over time\" as emphasized by Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 92.\n\n85.\n\nSuch valuation has been supplied by Total in CL Response to PO No. 7, estimating Total\u2019s equity participation of 19.19% in TGN at $80.3 million (lower than CL\u2019s initial valuation of $95.9 million).128 Argentina\u2019s experts in their Response to PO No. 7 supplied a number of tables on the basis of the various alternative assumptions referred to by the Tribunal in PO No. 7 whose results did not match those of Total\u2019s experts. As mentioned above, the Tribunal asked the Parties for supplementary information in PO No. 8 in order to clarify the divergent results reached by the Parties\u2019 experts in their Responses to PO No. 7. Specifically the Tribunal asked them to explain the basis of their respective projections of the price indexes from 2011 through 2027 which diverged markedly. The Parties\u2019 experts explained the main inputs, sources and methodologies that they used. By comparing the information, graphs and tables supplied by the Parties it was clarified that as clearly stated in Argentina\u2019s experts\u2019 response, the difference stems mainly from the different estimates of Argentina\u2019s inflation in 2012 and 2013 made by the experts.129 While Total\u2019s experts estimate an inflation rate around or even exceeding 20% p.a. in those years, on the basis of the sources mentioned in their response, UBA adopts the price projections used in Argentina\u2019s National Budget, which are around 10%.130 Both Parties anticipate a decrease after 2014, but Argentina estimates a higher future value of the peso in dollar terms than Total. As a result, Total\u2019s experts maintained in their Response to PO No. 8 the but-for value of Total\u2019s equity in TGN they had submitted in their Response to PO No. 7, that is $80.3 million. However, if UBA\u2019s projections were used, the value of Total\u2019s TGN equity would amount instead to about $70 million.131\n\nAs results from CL Response to PO No. 7, *supra* note 92, Table V.\n\nSee CL Response to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 8, submitted on July 2, 2012 [hereinafter \"CL Response to PO No. 8\"], paras. 3-6; UBA\u2019s Response to Procedural Order No. 8, submitted on 2 July 2012 [hereinafter \"UBA Response to PO No. 8\"], paras. 9-33.\n\nUBA Response to PO No. 8, *supra* note 129, para. 28.\n\nThis results from comparing CL Response to PO No. 8, **supra** note 129, p.10, Table II with UBA\u2019s Response to PO No. 8, **supra** note 129, Table 7.\n\n86.\n\nFaced with this divergence, the Tribunal considers that the basis of Total\u2019s experts\u2019 projections are sounder, and rejects UBA\u2019s rectification proposals. In this regard, in addition to the reasons previously stated, the Tribunal notes that the inflation hypothesis of Total\u2019s experts, matches their tariff increase hypothesis for 2012-2013, and are thus \"internally\" consistent.132 Further, the evidence as to the actual inflation in Argentina in 2012-2013, available when the Parties filed their submissions, supports Total\u2019s experts\u2019 calculations.133 Accordingly, the Tribunal determines Total\u2019s loss in respect of its share in TGN - to be compensated by Argentina - to be **$80.3 million** as of 1 July 2002. Total has claimed interest up to the date of the Award on the amount of compensation, as well as post-award interest until full payment. The Tribunal has explained in paragraph 31 above that all issues concerning interest on the compensation granted to Total are dealt with together in Part V of the present Award. Interest on the above amount from 1 July 2002 to payment shall be therefore based on the principles spelled out in Part V hereunder dealing with interest in general.134\n\nTotal\u2019s experts\u2019 hypothesis for inflation in 2012-2013 (around 20%) is consistent with Total\u2019s hypothesis of a similar increase in the domestic tariffs of TGN in 2011, as recalled at paras. 43(b) and 46 and at *supra* note 64. The fact that Total has assumed in the actual scenario an increase of tariffs from 2011/2012 onwards avoids the risk of double recovery that might arise (in the absence of such an assumption) from Total being awarded damages for its stake in a company worth zero while retaining the ownership of its stake, should the value of TGN recover due to an actual increase in tariffs.\n\nIn UBA Response to PO No. 8, *supra* note 129, para. 28, UBA refers not only to the projections used in Argentina\u2019s National Budget projections, but also generically to \"projections presented by the International Monetary Fund\" for retail inflation in Argentina (around 10%). No evidence, however, was supplied in that respect. On the contrary, the position publicly taken by the IMF, already before the submission by UBA and widely known, concerning doubts as to the accuracy of Argentina\u2019s official data on inflation, points in the opposite direction, see *Statement by the IMF Executive Board on Argentina,* Press Release No. 12/30, 1 February 2012.\n\nAs to the entitlement of Total to interest from the dates it suffered the damages attributable to Argentina until payment on all principal amounts of compensation therefor under international law, generally, and specifically in accordance with Article 5(2) of the BIT, see *infra* paras. 251-252.\n\n***F. Total\u2019s Claim for Damages as Technical Operator of TGN***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn the *quantum* phase Total has claimed specifically, as a part of its claim concerning its losses in respect of TGN, \"damages based on the reduced technical operator fees that it received from TGN as a result of the Government\u2019s measures.\"135 Total states that it had set forth this specific claim in its Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits of 18 May 2007 after the jurisdictional phase and had submitted a detailed valuation of its damages in this respect in the merits phase.136\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 105-113.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits of 18 May 2007 [hereafter \"Total RM Merits\"], para. 691; LECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115, paras. 153 and 288-293.\n\n88.\n\nAs to the premises and *quantum* of this claim, Total explains that when it acquired a stake in TGN, it became a party to the Technical Assistance Agreement under which it participated (with other shareholders) in the technical management of TGN for a yearly fee. In the actual scenario, however, TGN did not pay the full amount of the fees due to Total, resulting in a shortfall of US $4.2 million for 2002-2005. Total\u2019s experts have explained that the technical operators waived their rights for the remaining fees concerning that period. In 2006, a new agreement was reached providing for Total\u2019s fees under a certain scale until 2017. However, a cap to the payments was introduced by a covenant added pursuant to the 2006 restructuring of TGN\u2019s debt. Moreover, TGN stopped paying the management fee from 2008 onwards.137\n\nFor this description, see LECG Damage Report, **supra** note 115, paras. 288-291; CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras, 29-32; and Exhibit C-726.\n\n89.\n\nIn the but-for scenario Total assumes that TGN would have been able to pay the amount of the fees as agreed in 2006 for the period 2006-2017. The fees lost by Total are estimated by its experts as the difference between the fees Total would have earned in the but-for scenario and those earned in the actual situation. In this respect, the Tribunal notes a difference between the calculations made in the LECG Report on Damages of 2007 from that submitted in the CL First Report of 2011 in the *quantum* phase. In both reports the fees in the but-for scenario are valued at $8.9 million. However, in the actual scenario, fees earned by Total are valued at $2.7 million in the 2007 report, while in the 2011 report the experts do not mention any management fee payment. As a consequence, the 2007 report values the loss of Total at $6.1 million ($8.9 million minus $2.7 million, presumably rounded), while in the 2011 report the loss is valued in the full amount of $8.9 million.138 The 2011 report acknowledges however that TGN suspended the payment of the fees at the end of 2008 (implying that some fees had been paid until then). The net figure of $6.1 million appears therefore to the Tribunal to be the correct one, since it takes into account the fees which Total\u2019s experts acknowledge TGN paid to Total as technical operator from 2006 to 2008.\n\nCompare LECG Damage Report, **supra** note 115, paras. 153, 291-293 with CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 32-33.\n\n90.\n\nIn the *quantum* phase, Argentina objected in principle to Total\u2019s claim for lost revenues as technical operator of TGN, submitting that this claim is a \"...new issues that bear no relation to the Decision on Responsibility,\" for which, moreover, Argentina submits it has not been held liable in the Decision on Liability.139 Argentina also objects on the basis that the obligation of shareholders who had acquired shares in TGN in accordance with the bidding terms to provide for technical assistance had expired in 2000.140\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 50 and 135.\n\nArgentina PHB, **supra** note 28, para. 78, based upon UBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63, para. 243, which, however, does not address the merits of Total\u2019s experts\u2019 calculations.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal first addresses the procedural exception raised by Argentina that Total\u2019s claim concerning its losses as technical operator of TGN was not timely submitted in these proceedings and are thus inadmissible. The Tribunal first notes that the ICSID Convention does not provide for a defined final step in the proceedings or moment in time by which a claimant must submit all its claims in detail.141 Article 46 of the ICSID Convention provides that a \"Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\" without specifying a time limit for submitting them. Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules, concerning Ancillary Claims, provides however that \"(a)n incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\" Thus it is not necessary for a claimant to articulate in detail all its claims and relief sought (such as the amount of damages sought) in the Request of Arbitration or in its first brief (such as the \"memorial\" mentioned in Rule 31) after a tribunal has been constituted.\n\nThis contrasts with rules on the matter found in other arbitration rules, such as the requirement in the ICC Rules of Arbitration, Article 23 that an arbitral tribunal draw up, at an early stage of the procedure, \"Terms of Reference\" that must include \"a summary of the parties\u2019 respective claims\".\n\n92.\n\nIn any case the Tribunal does not consider that Total\u2019s claim for its fees as technical operator is a \"separate\" claim that may be termed ancillary, incidental or additional to the claim submitted for its losses in respect of its stake in TGN. Rather, it is an integral part of that principal claim.142 The right of Total to earn fees as a Technical Operator of TGN derives directly from Total\u2019s position as an investor which has made a direct investment in TGN.143 This was acknowledged by the Tribunal in the Decision on Liability, and has been indirectly recognized by Argentina\u2019s experts themselves.144 As to the timing of Total\u2019s submitting this claim, the Tribunal considers that due to the \"bifurcation\" of these proceedings after Argentina had raised its objections to jurisdiction, Total articulated its claim in a timely manner. Total did so in the first brief on the merits it was required to file in the proceedings after the Tribunal affirmed its jurisdiction in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 25 August 2006. Such first brief was Total\u2019s Reply of 18 May 2007, where Total set out its claim for Technical Operator fees, supported by its experts\u2019 detailed statements and calculations.145\n\nFor definitions of these types of claims under the ICSID Convention and Arbitral Rules, see C. Schreuer \"The ICSID Convention, A Commentary\", 2nd Edition, p. 740 ff.\n\nThe Preamble to the Technical Assistance Contract, Exhibit C-726, states that the original contract of 28 December 1992 was made \"pursuant to a legal condition imposed in the framework of privatization\" (*\"como condici\u00f3n legal impuesta en el marco de la privatizaci\u00f3n'').*\n\nSee Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 191: \"Before discussing the legal issues, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recall the evidence concerning Total\u2019s position as a major shareholder of TGN and its role as \u2018Technical Operator\u2019\"; UBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63, para. 244, fn. 58, recalls that according to TGN\u2019s Comptroller \"the payments under the category of Technical Operator from 2002 onwards have merely been concealed dividend payments, even when the Transporter was in default\".\n\nSee **supra** note 136 and the description of the proceedings in the Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, paras. 9-10.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal considers immaterial the fact that this claim is not specifically mentioned in the Decision on Liability, considering that the role of Total as technical operator was explicitly recognized therein.146 This claim is covered by the Tribunal\u2019s statements in paragraph 182: \"The Tribunal thus only partially upholds Total\u2019s claim concerning TGN under Article 3 of the BIT\". The claim is further covered by paragraph 184 containing the findings as to TGN, which is referred to in turn in the final paragraph of the Decision on Liability (paragraph 485(a)). The Tribunal concluded in paragraph 184(i) that Argentina breached its obligation under Article 3 of the BIT \"...by not periodically readjusting TGN\u2019s domestic tariffs...\" and further concluded in paragraph 184(ii) that \"the damages thereby suffered by Total must be compensated by Argentina\".\n\nSee Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 191 quoted at **supra** note 144.\n\n94.\n\nThe losses suffered by Total as TGN technical operator are part of the damages that flow from Argentina\u2019s breach of the BIT. Total\u2019s claim for fees lost as technical operator is the result of TGN\u2019s inability to pay the contractually agreed amounts after 2008. Based on the evidence submitted by Total and its experts referred to above, the Tribunal finds that this inability was directly related to the insufficient revenues of TGN as result of Argentina\u2019s freezing of the domestic tariffs in breach of the BIT. Therefore, Total is entitled to recover as damages, the fees it would have received absent the breach, less fees actually received.\n\n95.\n\nAs to the amount of the loss, based on the comparison between the calculations of Total\u2019s experts in 2007 and in 2011 discussed above, the Tribunal determines that this loss amounts to US$6.1 million. However, the Tribunal considers that in order to avoid a double recovery, the amount of operator fees awarded needs to be reduced by Total\u2019s proportionate ownership in TGN (19.2%).147 This is because the payment of the fees would have increased the operating costs of TGN and reduced *pro rata* the net profits of TGN based on which Total\u2019s loss has been calculated above. Therefore, the Tribunal awards to Total the amount of **$4.9 million** as damages suffered in its position as TGN\u2019s Technical Operator with interest from 1 March 2006.148\n\n19.19% rounded to 19.2%, see *supra* note 48.\n\n1 March 2006 is the relevant date (and not 1 July 2002, as indicated by Total\u2019s experts and properly claimed by Total for its other damages in respect of TGN) because Total\u2019s experts explain that lost payments claimed would have accrued to Total from 2006 to 2017 under the amended Technical Operator Agreement which is dated February 2006, Exhibit C-726, CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 31.\n\n**III. TOTAL\u2019S CLAIMS AS TO ITS INVESTMENTS IN THE ELECTRICITY AND POWER GENERATION SECTOR**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Total\u2019s Investments in Power Generation***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in the Decision on Liability at paragraphs 232-236, in the power generation (electricity production) sector Total had invested in two major power generation companies, Central Puerto and HPDA.\n\n97.\n\nCentral Puerto is a large dual fuel electricity generator, having the capacity to produce 2,165 megawatts, which represents 9.5% of Argentina\u2019s total installed capacity. Central Puerto was created in 1992 as part of the privatization of Servicios El\u00e9ctricos del Gran Buenos Aires S.E. (\"SEGBA\"). In July 2001, Total acquired all of the shares in Central Puerto held by Gener, a Chilean company, representing 63.79% of the total stock of Central Puerto. Total says it paid approximately US$255 million and subscribed to US$120 million of debt to acquire those shares.149\n\nSee Exhibit C-70 for a diagram of Total\u2019s shareholdings in Central Puerto and Exhibit C-44 for a copy of an extract from Central Puerto\u2019s share register.\n\n98.\n\nHPDA is said to be the largest private hydroelectric generation company in Argentina. It was created in 1993, as part of the privatization of Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Norpatag\u00f3nica S.A., a state-owned hydroelectric generation company. At the time of privatization in 1993, a number of foreign investors created an Argentine company, Hidroneuquen S.A., which acquired 59% of HPDA\u2019s shareholding. In September 2001, Total, through Total Austral, acquired 70.03% of Hidroneuquen from Gener for the payment of US$72.5 million plus the acquisition of approximately US$57 (or US$50.42) million of subordinated debt in the form of bonds.150 As a result, Total indirectly owned a 41.22% shareholding in HPDA.151 According to Total, HPDA\u2019s four hydroelectric units have an aggregate installed capacity of 1,400 megawatts and represent 6.13% of Argentina\u2019s installed electricity capacity.\n\nSee Total PHB Merits, *supra* note 45, pp. 44-45, fn. 87.\n\nSee Total RFA, *supra* note 44, paras. 158-160 and Exhibit C-72, a diagram showing Total\u2019s participation in HPDA, and Exhibit C-44, a copy of HPDA\u2019s share register.\n\n99.\n\nThus, in 2001, Total spent a total of US$327.45 million to acquire shares in Central Puerto and HPDA.152 In November 2006, while the arbitration was pending, Total sold its investments in Argentina\u2019s power generation sector to an Argentinean private investor receiving US$35.0 million for its 63.79% equity stake in Central Puerto and US$145.0 million for its 41.22% equity stake in HPDA.153\n\nTotal PHB Merits, *supra* note 45, para. 98.\n\nSee LECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115, p. 66, para. 133.\n\n***B. Total\u2019s Claims in respect of its Investment in Power Generation in the Liability Phase***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIn the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal provided a detailed overview of the complex legal regime governing Argentina\u2019s power generation sector after its privatisation in 1992, based on the Parties\u2019 submissions and evidence and on the reports prepared by the Parties\u2019 experts.154 The Tribunal will not repeat that lengthy explanation here, considering it incorporated by reference in this Award.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 237-278.\n\n101.\n\nIn the merits phase, Total alleged that a number of measures taken by Argentina breached or revoked the commitments, contained in the Electricity Law (especially Article 36), granted to attract investment in the power generation sector and upon which Total had relied in making its investments.155 The measures complained of by Total are the Emergency Law (Article 8) and a number of Resolutions adopted by the Secretariat of Energy (\"SoE\"), some of which were specifically based on, and others which simply followed, the Emergency Law. According to Total, through the Emergency Law and these SoE Resolutions, Argentina altered the basic principles of the electricity legal regime in such a manner as to breach the fair and equitable treatment clause in the BIT.\n\nSee Total MM, *supra* note 47, para. 33. Law 24,065 which entered into force on 16 January 1992, Exhibit C-84, and implementing Decree 1,398/92, Exhibit C-35.\n\n102.\n\nTotal has also complained that these measures were in breach of Argentina\u2019s law, namely the Electricity Law (Article 36), which remains in force, because they did not respect the fundamental promise of remuneration to generators at a uniform rate, based on the economic cost of the system and which takes account of the cost of unsupplied energy.156 On the contrary, the regulations adopted by the SoE during and after the state of emergency\n\n*resulted in: (a) generators no longer receiving a uniform rate; (b) prices no longer reflecting the economic cost of the system; and (c) prices no longer reflecting the cost that unsupplied energy represents for the community, i.e., no longer encouraging investment in capacity to satisfy peak demand, and no longer promoting longterm investment to satisfy future demand.157*\n\nSee Total PHB Merits, *supra* note 45, para. 880.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 881.\n\n103.\n\nTotal has identified the measures (and their effects), that it describes as \"radical alterations\" of the existing power generation regime in breach of the BIT, as follows:158\n\n*(i) the pesification of the spot price, and any other payments to which power generators were entitled, specifically the capacity payments and the payment of unsupplied energy, at a one to one rate; (ii) the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism in the power generation market through violation of the uniform rate rule and the introduction of a fixed price cap; and (iii) the \"refusal\" to pay power generators their dues even at the dramatically reduced values resulting from the measures159, followed by the forced\u2019 conversion of Total\u2019s existing and future receivables (that CAMMESA160 is not able to pay) into participations in new power plants, (i.e., \"Fondo para Inversiones Necesarias que Permitan* *Incrementar la Oferta de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica en el Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista\", hereinafter also \"FONINVEMEM\").161*\n\nFor a full description of Total\u2019s complaints and arguments see Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 279-296.\n\nThis list is contained in Total MM, **supra** note 47, para. 33. A more detailed description of the measures complained of and their specific impact is found in Total RFA, **supra** note 44, paras. 103-116, 135-140, and 180-198.\n\nCAMMESA was established in Decree 1,192/92 as the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Administradora del Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista S.A. [hereinafter \"CAMMESA\"], a not-for-profit company in which the main actors of the Wholesale Electricity Market participate together with the State.\n\nDecision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 286.\n\n104.\n\nTotal claimed that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3 of the BIT was breached by the measures discussed, since the obligation to provide such treatment protects investors against fundamental alterations of the regulatory framework on which they legitimately relied in making their investment. Moreover, according to Total\u2019s Request for Arbitration, through the various measures complained of by Total, Argentina also failed to observe the obligation not to take measures equivalent to expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in breach of Article 5(2) of the BIT and that of refraining from discriminating against Total (Article 4).162\n\nSee Total RFA, *supra* note 44, paras. 229-232 and 233-238, respectively.\n\n***C.

The Secretariat of Energy appears to have broader powers to regulate the electricity sector under the law than ENARGAS has for the gas sector. In light of the legal principles on which the Tribunal relied with respect to the TGN claim above, the changes made in the pricing structure, including specific parameters, are not per se in breach of promises or legitimate expectations of the investors.*\n\n*313. This does not mean that any change or alteration of the regime, negatively affecting the operations of the private generators and their economic equdibrium, is shielded from the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard guaranteed by the BIT. The respect for economic equilibrium principle entails that, in normal situations and from a long term perspective, the private generators are able to cover their costs and make a return on their investment, while providing their services to the market and consumers as required under the Electricity Law.*\n\n*328. It cannot be disputed however, that the pricing system the SoE progressively put in place after 2002 is at odds with those principles as spelled out in the Electricity Law, even leaving pesification out of consideration. After 2002, the market has been characterized by unreasonably low tariffs. These, in turn, have massively reduced the returns of the generators, barely permitting them to cover their* *variable costs, contrary to sound economic management principles for power generators operating within a regulated system of public utilities. [...]*\n\n*330. The Tribunal considers that this situation, brought about by the SoE with full awareness of its negative impact on affected generators operating under sound economic principles, cannot be reconciled with the fair and equitable treatment standard of Article 3 of the BIT.* *As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that Argentina has violated the BIT in this respect.*\n\n*333. (...) the fair and equitable standard has been breached through the setting of prices that do not remunerate the investment made nor allow reasonable profit to be gained contrary to the principles governing the activities of privately owned generators under Argentina\u2019s own legal system...*\n\n106.\n\nAs to FONINVEMEM, the Tribunal held as follows:\n\n*338 This scheme must be considered as a kind of forced, inequitable, debt-for-equity swap (...). As such, in the view of the Tribunal it represents a clear breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation of the BIT for which Argentina is liable to pay damages.* *(...) The determination of the value of these shares is relevant to the valuation of damages and will have to be taken into account in the quantum phase.*\n\n*339 (...) the quantum phase shall deal with the determination of the losses suffered by Total because of the negative impact of Argentina\u2019s actions on HPDA and Central Puerto that have been found to be in breach of the BIT. [Footnote: 458 This includes determining the proper \"but for scenario \", the actual scenario and the possible influence of both the purchase price paid by Total in 2001 and the sale price of its equity stakes in Central Puerto and HPDA at the end of2006.]*\n\n107.\n\nBased on the above the Tribunal concluded as follows in respect of Total\u2019s claims regarding Power Generation:\n\n*346 The Tribunal, based on the above reasoning and findings,*\n\n*- concludes that Argentina has breached its obligations under Article 3 of the BIT to grant to Total fair and equitable treatment, in respect and as a consequence of:*\n\n*(a) the alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism, as specified in the preceding paragraphs;*\n\n*(b) the non-payment of receivables arising from energy supplied in the spot market by HPDA and Central Puerto and the conversion of such receivables into shares in new generators under the FONINVEMEM scheme.*\n\n*- concludes that the damages thereby suffered by Total must be indemnified/compensated by Argentina in the amount to be determined in a separate quantum phase of these proceedings;*\n\n*- rejects all other claims by Total related to its investment in HPDA and Central Puerto under Articles 4 and 5 of the BIT;*\n\n*- defers the determination of the above damages to the quantum phase; and*\n\n*- rejects any other plea and defences by Argentina, including those premised on the \"state of necessity \".*\n\n***D. Total\u2019s Claims of Damages in the Quantum Phase in respect of Power Generation***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nIn the *quantum* phase Total submits that it is entitled to full compensation for all damages arising out of the government\u2019s treaty breaches recognized in the Decision on Liability, specifically the loss in fair market value of Total\u2019s shares in Central Puerto and HPDA, the loss of \"technical operator\" fees in relation to HPDA, and interest.163 As to the loss in fair market value, Total considers that based on the Decision on Liability it is entitled to damages corresponding to the difference between:\n\na) the fair market value of Total\u2019s stake in Central Puerto and HPDA as it would have been on 31 December 2006, had Argentina: (i) observed the \"economic cost of the system\" principle and not altered the uniform marginal price mechanism; and (ii) paid receivables arising from energy supplied in the spot market by Central Puerto and HPDA (this being the \"but-for\" scenario, calculated using a DCF model);164 and\n\nb) the value of its stakes in Central Puerto and HPDA in late 2006 when Total sold them (the \"actual\" scenario). Total submits that 31 December 2006 is the appropriate valuation date for determining the fair market value of Total\u2019s investments in Central Puerto and HPDA (and the decline in this value due to Argentina\u2019s treaty breaches) because it is the closest year-end date to Total\u2019s divestment of those stakes which took place in November 2006, when Total\u2019s losses up to the date of divestment effectively crystallised.165\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 134-135.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 141-150. See also CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 47.\n\nIn the original fn. 231 at para. 136 of Total QM, *supra* note 5, Total writes: \"Argentina appears to concede this. See Argentina PHB (n 28), \u00b6 603 (\"TOTAL sold its interest in HPDA in December 2006. Upon selling its interest, it would be logical that the damages would remain fixed at that time\")\".\n\n109.\n\nIn order to calculate the revenues of the two generators under the assumptions of the but-for scenario referred to above, and to discount them as at the end of 2006, Total explains that its experts have developed a but-for model that assumes that Central Puerto and HPDA would have been able to cover their costs and make a reasonable return on the investment based on those \"main assumptions\".166 Total explains in further detail167 that its experts \"project the path that the electricity spot prices would have taken in the absence of Argentina\u2019s treaty breaches, using the complex dispatch simulation procedure normally used by the electricity pool administrator, CAMMESA\" by using the Lestard Franke electricity dispatch model that simulates/replicates CAMMESA\u2019s model. This is \"consistent with the Parties\u2019 agreement that the damages analysis... must be made using a dispatch model that would appropriately reflect the characteristics of the Argentine market\".168\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, paras. 46-49, and in more detail at paras. 133-143.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 142.\n\nIn fn. 242 at para. 142 of Total QM, *supra* note 5, Total refers to Argentina\u2019s Comments on Claimant\u2019s Submission on Quantum Procedure of 28 February 2011, para. 85.\n\n110.\n\nThe assumptions of Total\u2019s experts are that in the but-for scenario Argentina would not have modified the basic rules for price formation, which established that electricity spot prices were to be: (i) uniform; (ii) determined by the level of hourly demand; and (iii) determined by the marginal plant called for dispatch.169 To reflect these premises, Total\u2019s experts updated the model used for their LECG Damage Valuation of 2007 to obtain but-for energy spot prices to compare with actual spot prices.170 They assume in the but-for scenario that \"consistent with the Decision\":\n\na) neither Resolution 240/03(a) nor ARS$120 cap would be in effect, implying uniform prices in the electricity market;\n\nb) natural gas wellhead prices are actual market prices for 2002-2006;\n\nc) natural gas transportation tariffs would be the but-for tariffs proposed for TGN, that is increased semi-annually starting in July 2002; and\n\nd) capacity payment would be set in pesos at ARS$12/MWh as in the actual scenario.171\n\nTotal\u2019s experts\u2019 model assumes furthermore that \"Electricity demand volumes reflecting actual demand up to end of 2006 and growing at a rate of 5.5% per year from 2007 onwards, are consistent with the average historical growth over the period 1993-2006\".172 They assume also that the FONINVEMEM scheme is not in place in the but-for scenario, since it was found in the Decision on Liability to represent a breach of the BIT.173\n\nCL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 38-39 referring to the Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 325. In the but-for scenario CL assumes (as in the actual situation) that \"contractual pesification as of 2002 affecting HPDA\u2019s debt and HPDA and Central Puerto\u2019s contractual sales\" is in accordance with the Decision on Liability\u2019s finding that pesification was not in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT, CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 46.\n\nSee Total QM, ***supra*** note 5, para. 143 and the graph with actual vs. but-for prices at para. 144. More details as to CL\u2019s assumptions are found in the CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 41-42 and Appendix B thereto, paras. 135-142. See also fn. 67 at para. 42 of the CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, referring to paras. 255-267, 313, 327-329, and 333 of the Decision on Liability as the basis of the various assumptions.\n\nSee CL First Report, *supra* note 54, Annex B, para. 135(d).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 136(c) referring to LECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115, para. 251(b) which in turn refers to growth data of CAMMESA 1993-2006, Exhibit C-602.\n\nCL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 47. See Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 338.\n\n111.\n\nIn order to obtain the value of the two firms under the but-for scenario, CL estimates174 the higher dividends that an equity holder such as Total would have been able to collect in 2002-2006 in the but-for scenario, due to higher revenues based on the above assumptions.175 As from 2007 onwards until the end of the respective concessions, CL estimates annual cash flows, discounting them back to 31 December 2006 \"at 13.77%, the estimated WACC for power generators in Argentina\", assuming that Total would have kept the investment in the but-for scenario.176\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, paras. 48-51. The use of estimated dividends until 2007 and of estimated cash flow thereafter reflects the fact that the CL First Report of 2011 is based on the LECG Damage Report submitted in 2007 for the merits phase.\n\nCL First Report, **supra** note 54. CL acknowledges, however, that Total would not have actually collected dividends in the but-for scenario (as it did not in the actual scenario) \"as additional cash-flows generated during this period would have been used to reduce debt obligations in both companies\", CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 49 and fn. 80.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 51. Future revenues are projected until the end of the generators\u2019 concessions (2023 for HPDA and 2030 for Central Puerto), see Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 41(b) and Total QR, **supra** note 23, para. 148.\n\n112.\n\nBased on the above assumptions and calculations, Total submits a but-for valuation for Central Puerto at $564.6 million in 2006 ($304.7 million after adding accumulated cash and deduction of the financial debt), resulting in a valuation of Total\u2019s 63.79 % share at $194.4 million. The values for HPDA are $762.5 million for the whole firm ($706.5 million after adding accumulated cash and deduction of financial debt), resulting in a net equity value for Total\u2019s 41.22 % share at $291.2 million.177 Together, Total\u2019s shares in the two generators would have been worth, according to Total, $485.6 million, as results from adding $291.2 million (HPDA) and $194.4 million (Central Puerto).178\n\nTotal QM, ***supra*** note 5, para. 165; CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 53-54. The figures submitted by LECG Damage Report, ***supra*** note 115, para. 130, assuming no pesification in the but-for scenario, were for Central Puerto: total value $626.5 million, and equity value for Total, $297 million. As for HPDA: $830.1 million and $358.6 million respectively.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Total had bought these shares in 2001 for $327.45 million, see *supra* para. 99.\n\n113.\n\nIn order to determine its losses caused by Argentina\u2019s treaty breaches, Total deducts from these figures the actual value of Total\u2019s stake in the two generators at the end of 2006. In this respect, Total\u2019s experts submit two different sets of figures based on two different methods of calculation. Under the first method, the actual value of the two generators is the price which Total received for them on their sale in November 2006, namely $35.1 million for Central Puerto and $145.5 million for HPDA, in total $180.6 million. Based on this comparison of the but-for DCF value versus the actual transaction price,179 Total claims damages amounting to the difference between the two figures, namely $159.2 million for Central Puerto and $145.7 million for HPDA, totaling $304.9 million as at the end of 2006.180 Total defines the method based on this comparison as the \"DCF/transaction\" method because DCF is used in the but-for scenario to establish the value the investment would have had if the impugned measures had not been put in place, while in the actual scenario the investment is valued at the actual sale price obtained when it divested.181 Total explains that it is appropriate to base the actual value of the generators on the sale price of 2006 because \"[t]he 2006 transaction was an arm\u2019s length transaction to an independent third party, and the sales price thus reflected what market participants believed to be the fair market value of these assets, as late at 2006\".182\n\nTotal QM, ***supra*** note 5, paras. 151-153; CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 54-57 referring to LECG Damage Report, ***supra*** note 115, paras. 42-46 (Section II.3 \"The Transaction Approach\").\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, Tables XVI and XVII at para. 165.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 153.\n\nTotal QR, *supra* note 23, para. 162.\n\n114.\n\nTotal\u2019s experts have also performed a different, alternative calculation for determining Total\u2019s losses based on what they call the \"pure DCF approach\".183 This approach is based on the DCF method to calculate the value of the two generators both in the but-for scenario and in the actual scenario.184 Also under this methodology as in the DCF/transaction method, the but-for and actual values of the two generators are compared as of 31 December 2006 and the difference indicates the loss suffered by Total due to the measures found to be in breach of the BIT. However, under this methodology, while the but-for values of the generators are the same as in the DCF/transaction method (since they are in both cases calculated according to the DCF method), the actual values are different as a result of being calculated based on the DCF method instead of on the actual sale price. Under this pure DCF approach also Central Puerto\u2019s and HPDA\u2019s *actual* values are, therefore, based on the discounted present (2006) value of their future cash flow. In this regard, Total\u2019s experts note that Total collected no dividends in 2002-2006 and discount future cash flows in the actual scenario at the same WACC rate of 13.77% as in the but-for scenario, assuming that Total would have continued to hold its stakes in the actual scenario as well.185\n\nCL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 46. While Total does not submit formally in its *quantum* briefs and prayers for relief a request of damages based on its experts\u2019 alternative \"pure DCF\" method, Total does recognize this alternative approach as submitted by its experts; see Total QM, **supra** note 5, fn. 236: \"In addition to this \"DCF/transaction approach\" and consistent with the approach taken during the liability phase, Dr. Abdala and Professor Spiller also calculate Total\u2019s damages in relation to Central Puerto and HPDA by using a \"pure\" DCF approach, which uses a DCF model to calculate fair market value in both the \"but-for\" and \"actual\" scenarios.\"\n\nCL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 46-52 and Tables III and IV at para 53. In both but-for and actual scenarios, using the DCF method, Total and its experts assume that \"the Treaty breaches affecting spot prices would cease at the end of 2011 - a conservative assumption given that the Government has given no indication that it intends to lift the Spot Price Cap or repeal any of the other electricity pricing measures\", Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 146 with reference to CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 55.\n\nSee CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 49 and 51 based on the LECG Damage Report, ***supra*** note 115, paras. 121-128. The assumptions on the future evolution of the actual prices are found in the graph at para. 144 of Total\u2019s QM, ***supra*** note 5. Total\u2019s experts assume, as noted above, that spot prices would be increased in 2011, assuming, as set forth by Total at para. 146, that \"the Treaty Breaches affecting spot prices would cease at the end of 2011\", although \"the Government has given no indication that it intends to lift the Spot Price Cap or repeal any other electricity pricing measure\".\n\n115.\n\nAccording to Total\u2019s experts, under the pure DCF method the actual value of Central Puerto is $323.6 million, resulting in a net value of $149.9 million after having added accumulated cash and having deducted financial debt. The actual value of HPDA is set under the same method at $709.2 million, resulting in a net value of $518.8 million after having added cash and deducted financial debt. Thus, the value to Total of its respective equity shares amount to $95.6 million for Central Puerto and $213.8 million for HPDA (in total $309.4 million). As a result, the difference in respect of their but-for value, that is Total\u2019s damages in respect of the two generators, would amount under the \"pure DCF\" method to $176.1 million ($485.6 million minus $309.4 million, rounded).186 The damages to Total under the \"pure DCF\" method are thus considerably lower than under the DCF/transaction method ($176.1 million versus $304.9 million). This is due to the fact that the actual value of the two generators under the pure DCF method is significantly higher than the price at which Total sold the investments (for Central Puerto and HPDA respectively: DCF value equal to $95.6 million and $213.8 million - for a total for both of $309.4 million; against transaction sale prices of $35.1 million and $145.5 million - for a total for both of $180.6 million). In other words, Total sold in 2006 at a price of $180.6 million assets which according to the DCF method would have been worth $309.4 million.\n\nSee CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 53, Tables III and IV.\n\n116.\n\nThe calculations made by Total\u2019s experts are best shown by reproducing their Tables:187\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Table III Damages to Total\u2019s Investments in Central Puerto (DCF Approach) |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| *In MM US$ of December* 37, 2005 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Forward Looking Damage | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| + Total Firm Value | 564.6 | 323 6 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| + Accumulated Cash | 2.1 | 13.6 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| - Total Financial Debt | 262.0 | 137.3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Equity Value to Shareholders | 304.7 | 149.9 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| *TOTAL share* | 63.6% | *63.8%* | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Equity Value to TOTAL | 194.4 | 95.6 | 93.7 |\n| Damages in Million US$ as of December 31, 2005 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 98.7 |\n| Damages in Million US$ as of May 31, 2011 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 115.9 |\n| *Source: Centra/ Puerto Damage Valuation Model as* | *per Decision (C-761).* | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| *Note: Damages related to FONINVEMEM included,* | *in the above calculation* | *are US$ 1.9 MM* | *in US$ of* |\n| *May 31, 2011* | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Table IV Damages to Total's Investments in HPDA (DCF Approach) |\n||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| *In MM US$ of December 31, 2006* |\n| Forward Looking Damage | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| + Tolal Frm Value | 7G2.5 709.2 |\n| + Accumulated Cash | 167.G 3.7 |\n| - Total Financial Debt | 223.6 194.1 |\n| Equity Value to Shareholders (Dec 06) | 706.5 518.8 |\n| *TOTAL* snare | *41.2% 41.2%* |\n| Equity Value to TOTAL | 291.2 213.S 77.4 |\n| Value as Technical Operator | 3.0 2.5 0.5 | |\n| Damages in Million US$ as of December 31. 2006 77.3 |\n| Damages in Million US$ as of May 31, 2011 | | | 91.4 |\n| Source;

Total has in fact not included nor added in its valuation of the losses a distinct figure for those due to the FONINVEMEM scheme under either of the above valuation methods, although a separate calculation of those damages has been submitted by Total.189 The issue of FONINVEMEM is irrelevant under both methods because of the following reasons: Under both methods, in the but-for scenario the FONINVEMEM scheme obviously would not exist: On the other hand in the actual scenario, under the DCF/transaction method the actual sale price is taken into account, whereas in the pure DCF method the actual value is measured by the discounted cash flow of future revenues, so that the actual existence of the scheme has no impact. As a consequence, the dispute between the Parties as to the value of the FONINVEMEM shares, currently or in the future, is of no relevance to the assessment of the damages suffered by Total and the Tribunal does not need to analyze it further.\n\nSee CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 52 estimating a loss of $24 million as of 2011.\n\n***E. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n119.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on Quantum of September 2, 2011 (\"Argentina QCM\"), Argentina opposes on various grounds both the methodologies submitted by Total to calculate the damages resulting from the measures found in breach of the BIT and the *quantum* figures proposed by Total. Pointing out that Total sold in 2006 the investments made in 2001, Argentina suggests that \"compensation should only be awarded for the period during which Total\u2019s investment was affected by the measures for which Argentina was held liable\"; that is, from Resolution 240/03 in August 2003 to the date of the sale.190 Based on this assumption, Argentina submits that Total, as a shareholder, can only complain in respect of the loss of potential dividends from the companies in question. However, no dividends were paid to Total in the actual scenario nor could they have been distributed in the but-for scenario due to the existing debt covenants. Argentina therefore concludes in this respect that \"the mechanism imposed by the Secretariat of Energy, despite altering the uniform marginal price mechanism, did not cause any harm to Total\".191\n\nSee Argentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 146.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 150-152; UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 255-256.\n\n120.\n\nArgentina further relies on its experts on *quantum,* namely on the UBA First Valuation Report that shows that \"the generators covered their costs at all times and achieved a positive EBITDA that is higher than the one obtained by averaging out the EBITDA for 130 American utility companies\".192 Since a positive EBITDA shows that the operating margins of the two companies in the period were positive, UBA concludes that the generators were profitable and the price mechanism was adequate to remunerate them. Higher prices would have simply generated higher profits. Based on the above, Argentina submits that a different conclusion would be inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s statements regarding the concept of reasonable profitability in the sector.193\n\nSee Argentina QCM, ***supra*** note 6, para. 151-152, based on UBA First Valuation Report, ***supra*** note 63, para. 336 and referring to the Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1, paras. 327 and 333.\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 152.\n\n121.\n\nUBA reviews in detail the evolution of electricity prices, both to the end user and paid to the generators,194 and points out \"two different periods, one tending towards a significant fall in electricity power prices between 1993 and 2001, and another evidencing a rise in power prices from 2002 to date\" and analyses the variations in the remuneration of the generators which occurred after 2002.195\n\n*Ibid.,* fn. 182. Argentina observes: \"We must draw a distinction between the prices paid to the generators for the electricity power and the tariffs paid by users, since they are not directly related to one another\", suggesting that the Tribunal may have overlooked this distinction at para. 328 of the Decision on Liability. To the contrary, the Tribunal wishes to point out that the Decision on Liability clearly makes this distinction in analysing in detail the mechanism under which generators were paid for dispatched and non-dispatched energy (spot price and capacity payments) at pp. 110-126, paras. 239-274 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1). There is, however, a link between the two prices, as recalled by the Tribunal at para. 294 of the Decision on Liability: \"from September 2003, CAMMESA was unable to pay generators for the electricity that they were supplying, since the tariffs paid by the consumers were not adequate to cover the payments owed by electricity distributors to the generators\".\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 283.\n\n122.\n\nSpecifically as to the EBITDA,196 UBA concludes from its analysis that \"from 2003 to 2006, [the] period in which the damage caused by the breach of the BIT is to be calculated, the actual EBITDA was higher than the one obtained in the shareholding purchase year (denominated in ARS), updated to maintain its purchase power. Thus, based on the fact that EBITDA was reasonable at the time Total purchased shares in HPDA and in Central Puerto, Argentina concludes that, between 2003 and 2006, there was no damage from the alleged breach of Article 3 of the BIT in accordance with the terms of paragraph 346(a) of the Decision on Liability. This would be so because in that period, EBITDA was higher than that which would have resulted from updating the 2001 EBITDA purchase power. Furthermore, Argentina points out that in 2006 EBITDA denominated in USD was equal to 2001 EBITDA in USD.197\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 327.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 355-356.\n\n123.\n\nIn addition to the arguments based on the lack of dividends and on the positive EBITDA in 2003-2006, Argentina makes a different argument based on the purchase and sale prices of the generators in 2001 and 2006 respectively. Argentina submits that \"[i]n this regard, it may be convenient to draw a comparison between (i) the value of the share capital in the but-for scenario, that is, the value that such share capital would have had, in accordance with investors\u2019 expectations, right before the adoption of the measures that allegedly violated the Treaty; and (ii) the value of the share capital in the actual scenario, that is, the value that such share capital has, taking into consideration what actually happened.\"198\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 161.\n\n124.\n\nArgentina submits that the purchase price that Total paid was a \"completely inflated price,\" because it was based on the pre-crisis expectations which can be taken into account only as a ceiling on the value of the shareholdings in the but-for scenario.199 As for the sale price in 2006, Argentina considers that Total decided to sell its stake \"at a bad time\", namely when the prices were low, while thereafter, \"[i]n addition to the favourable situation of the country, which has experienced a sustained growth, the power sector has recorded steady increases in the power generation price.\"200 Argentina submits that Total should suffer the cost of its decision of selling the shares at a relatively low price and that it \"should not take advantage of the short period in which it was involved in the sector to earn the same return as a long-term investor under ordinary circumstances.\"201\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, ****supra**** note 63, para. 143 appears to be more cautious in this respect. According to the UBA First Valuation Report, ****supra**** note 63, paras. 341-347, Total had paid the stakes in the generators 5.12 (at para. 341) or 6.45 (at para. 347) times the EBITDA and has resold them at 3.45 times the EBITDA. Total challenges this data, see CL Second Report, ****supra**** note 23, para. 96. UBA concludes in its report at para. 347 that Total would have obtained US$70 million more than the purchase price, had it sold the generators in 2006 based on the 2001 EBITDA of 6.45. According to UBA, under normal circumstances the reasonable rate for this kind of company is between 4 and 6 times. The UBA First Valuation Report concludes at para. 341 as follows: \"However, taking into account the emergency situation in which the domestic economy, in general, and the electric power industry, in particular, were immersed when this operation was performed, it would be reasonable to believe that TOTAL could have utilised a lower ratio and, thus, paid a lower price\". For the position of the Tribunal as to this issue see the Decision on Liability, ****supra**** note 1, paras. 322-324.\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 169.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 168.\n\n125.\n\nAt the same time, Argentina argues that \"the value to be calculated in the actual scenario should reflect the value of the business and, therefore, the present value of the shares, as the power plants are still operating and the users are still paying for the electricity generated by them\".202 Argentina submits that under this approach the purchase price of $327.45 million should be compared with the but-for price calculated by Total\u2019s experts under the pure DCF method as being $309 million, resulting in a loss for Total of about $18 million.203\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 167.\n\n*Ibid..* para. 174. Argentina insists, in any case, that Total suffered no damage based on the other methodologies submitted by it. Argentina further argues that Total\u2019s experts are wrong in estimating the damages as of 2006 and not as of 19 August 2003, the date preceding the adoption of Resolution 240/2003 through which the Tribunal found Argentina to have \"breached its obligations under the treaty by modifying the uniform marginal price\", *Ibid.,* paras. 175-177.\n\n***F. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n----------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nIn conducting its assessment, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed all the arguments of the Parties summarized above, their respective expert reports and evidence submitted in writing and at the hearings, the various pleadings filed by the Parties and their Post-Hearing Briefs, as well as the Parties\u2019 and their experts\u2019 Responses to PO No. 7.204\n\nIn PO No. 7, *supra* note 24, the Tribunal asked the Parties to specify, as part of their Post-Hearing Briefs, the percentage of the financial debt of Central Puerto and HPDA that was pesified (domestic debt) and the percentage that remained in US dollars due to foreign creditors as well as total amounts thereof. Furthermore, the Tribunal asked the Parties to specify the level of indebtedness of Central Puerto and HPDA and explain the impact of pesification, if any, on the debt burden of each generator.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes first to confirm its findings, reasoning and conclusions set forth in the Decision on Liability, according to which Argentina has breached its obligations of fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the BIT in relation to Total\u2019s investments in HPDA and Central Puerto due to \"the pricing mechanism the SoE progressively put in place after 2002\".205 The fact that the generators had a positive EBITDA, or that they would have paid no dividends also in the but-for scenario, does not exclude the existence of damages, as explained below, and in any case does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions in the Decision on Liability as to the existence of breaches by Argentina of Total\u2019s treaty rights in respect of the electricity sector. As explained in the Decision on Liability, this was because the new pricing regime to which the generators owned by Total were subjected from 2002 on did not remunerate them adequately, \"barely permitting them to cover their variable costs, contrary to sound economic management principles for power generators operating within a regulated system of public utilities\",206 besides being also in \"disregard of the basic principles of the Electricity Law\".207 It is therefore the task of the Tribunal to ascertain the damages suffered by Total based on the most appropriate methodologies and assumptions, and calculations.\n\nDecision on Liability, **supra** note 1, paras. 325-333, specifically at para. 328, and conclusions at para. 346(a). The Tribunal recalls that the SoE had already enacted several changes affecting wholesale spot electricity prices before Resolution 240/2003, Exhibit C-79, such as Resolution 8/2002, Exhibit ARA-99 and Resolution 1/2003, Exhibit C-77. See also Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 141, fn. 239.\n\nDecision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 328.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 331.\n\na) *Correctness of the DCF approach in general*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the general approach adopted by Total for the valuation of damages relating to power generation is sound: the Tribunal has already explained in the paragraphs on General Principles applicable to the valuation of Total\u2019s damages and in respect of the TGN claim why this approach is correct to establish damages concerning going concerns which have been affected in their profitability by objectionable governmental measures. By comparing the relevant but-for future cash flows with the actual future cash flows using the DCF method and applying an appropriate WACC in order to discount those flows to the relevant date, the lost profits can be determined and hence the decrease in market value of the equity affected that must be indemnified.208 This method has been approved and followed by economic and accounting experts and by regulatory authorities,209 and has been routinely applied by arbitral tribunals in investment disputes to determine the fair market value of a going concern in different contexts, both hypothetical and real.210 The Tribunal has already referred to this method in the Decision on Liability and here above when discussing valuation principles in general.211\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note that, in conformity with standard valuation practice, Total\u2019s experts have obtained the companies\u2019 equity in both scenarios by subtracting the financial debt from the firms\u2019 value (based on the firm\u2019s overall discounted cash flows), CL Response to PO No. 7, **supra** note 92, annexed to Total PHB, **supra** note 11, para. 42.\n\nSee ENARGAS 2001 Annual Report, p. 40, Exhibit C-727.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that there have been cases in which due to the specific circumstances and/or the content of the claim for damages other methods have been followed. Such is the case of the LG&E award: in that award the historical losses due to the non-payment of dividends to the claimant was the basis of the damages calculation (as requested by the claimant) since the investment had not been permanently impaired by the measures in question and, on the contrary, had even rebounded in value. That tribunal noted further that \"In fact, the loss of the capital value has not crystallized. Had LG&E sold its investment, as did other foreign investors, for a depressed value resulting from the measures, capital value would become a practicable basis for determining compensation\", *LG&E Energy Corp, LG&E Capital Corp and LG&E International Inc. v.* *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Award (25 July 2007) [hereinafter *\"LG&E* Award\"], para. 47, Exhibits CL-186 / ALRA-341.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 339 and fn. 458. See also English Transcript of the procedural hearing on *quantum,* of 28 March 2011, 123:1-125.13, where the Tribunal asked each Party to build its own \"damage model\" for each sector, in order to provide the Tribunal with \"full, complete sets of calculations\" including but-for electricity prices.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see why this method cannot be employed here simply due to the fact that Total sold its investment in the generators while this arbitration was pending in 2006. There are no elements in the record to indicate that Total somehow made a short term, \"speculative\" investment in Argentina in 2001, such as to render inappropriate the DCF method based on the long term expected stream of revenues from a utility.212 Limiting the calculation of damages to the dividends lost while the equity was held by the investor and concluding that if dividends would not have been paid in the but-for scenario (just as they were not paid in the actual scenario) then there has been no loss, is not an acceptable way to measure damages caused to the capital value of equity. Dividends are not equivalent to profits; likely future profits, properly derived from expected cash flows, must be taken into account to determine the but-for value of an investment at the relevant date. This value can then be compared to the actual value to determine the difference and the measure of damages.\n\nFrom the evidence on the record and the arguments made by Total before the sale it does not appear that the sale had been anticipated.\n\n130.\n\nThe other method suggested by Argentina, based on the EBITDA of the two utilities does not appear relevant and acceptable as an alternative to the DCF approach. This is so because the EBITDA measures the profitability of companies, specifically the operational profitability of the business based on their present assets. A positive EBITDA is not an indicator of the capital value of a firm, nor *per se* implies that the business generates enough cash to pay its liabilities.213 The fact that the EBITDA of the generators was positive in the actual scenario is consistent with the uncontested fact that they had a positive value (which is not the case for TGN) as evidenced by Total\u2019s ability to sell its stake in them in 2006 for more than $180 million. Nor has Argentina supplied data of a possible but-for EBITDA to compare with the actual situation in order to support its conclusion that Total suffered no loss. In other words, Argentina has not supplied any persuasive arguments to support this method for determining the negative effects of the measures in breach of Article 3 of the BIT on the value of the generators (and Total\u2019s stake therein), nor data that would allow the measurement of such impairment.\n\nA positive EBITDA indicates only that a company is able to cover its variable costs, but does not say anything as to the coverage of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and hence to the ability of the company to make profits. In fact, it is uncontested that the generators were unable to pay their long term debt in the actual scenario. See the Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 325, and as to the details of their restructuring process, see CL Response to PO No. 7, **supra** note 92, para. 33.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore assess the damages suffered by Total by comparing the but-for value of the generators with their actual value in accordance with the DCF approach, on the basis of the evidence, assumptions and calculations in the record, as submitted by the Parties, essentially by the Claimant. As noted above, Argentina has not submitted an acceptable alternative benchmark in the **quantum** phase (nor in the merits phase before, as noted in the Decision on Liability214). This does not, of course, relieve the Tribunal from verifying whether the approach and calculations submitted by Total in the **quantum** phase are accurate and respect the criteria laid down in the Decision on Liability.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 327.\n\nb) *Speci**fic*  *issues as to construing a proper but-for scenario in the electricity sector*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nBefore examining the but-for scenario used for this claim, a preliminary remark and a caveat are appropriate. Determining the but-for value of HPDA and Central Puerto is more complex than in the case of TGN. The parameters of the but-for or contra-factual scenario are more complex for the power generators than for TGN because, unlike the transportation and distribution of gas, electricity generation was not regulated as a tariff-based sector.215 The measure challenged in the case of gas transportation was the elimination of semi-annual readjustments of the gas transportation tariff from 1 July 2002. Thus, the but-for scenario as to that sector has been construed by the Tribunal assuming regular semi-annual increases based on the evolution of the indexes of the domestic prices.\n\nSee, for these differences, *ibid.,* para. 248.\n\n133.\n\nThe measure challenged in the electricity sector consists instead of the imposition of a new pricing mechanism which, in contrast with the previous one, did not reflect the economic cost of the system and made it impossible for generators to operate with a reasonable margin and to cover their investment costs. This was the result of \"the alteration of the uniform marginal price system\", that is, \"the abandonment of the uniform spot price based on the variable costs of the marginal unit\" with the additional introduction of a fixed cap of ARS$120/MWh replacing the previous variable price mechanism.216 The alternative scenario cannot be based on a hypothetical tariff as the revenues of the generators were based on a complex system of variable spot prices and capacity payments in which no fixed tariff was applicable.217 The Tribunal has acknowledged that since the system in place in 2002 was not subject to specific promises by Argentina, it could have been changed without breaching the BIT if a new system had \"equally respected the principle of economic equilibrium allowing generators to cover their costs and make a reasonable return on their investments.\"218 This, however, was not the case. In fact, the Tribunal concluded in the Decision on Liability that a but-for situation, respectful of Argentina\u2019s BIT obligation of fair and equitable treatment, \"would have been met had the spot price been fixed on the basis of the costs of the marginal unit (uniform marginal price mechanism) without a cap of ARS$120, according to the principles in force in 2001.\"219\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 325.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 267-268.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 327, with reference to para. 313.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n134.\n\nThe damage model (but-for scenario) submitted by Total\u2019s experts conforms to the findings of the Decision on Liability since it assumes but-for spot prices for electricity that would correspond to the average system marginal price without the cap introduced by Resolution 240/2003, taking into account the 2002 pesification and using actual natural gas prices.220 Total\u2019s experts\u2019 elaboration, based on CAMMESA\u2019s data, shows that \"the price that would have resulted in the absence of SE Resolution 240/2003 or what is called the system marginal cost... exceeded spot prices 70% of the time. While the average spot price for this period was US$14.7 per MWh, the average system marginal cost was US$41.3 per MWh\".221 The model considers capacity payments (whose mechanism was changed in 2003) by constructing the but-for monomic price (the average per MWh overall remuneration from spot transactions) in accordance with the pre-2003 system. Total\u2019s experts compare the but-for monomic price with the price under the actual system where \"the monomic price has become meaningless in representing what the average generator obtains\" due to specific reimbursements to less efficient generators depending on their costs, which in turn depend in great part on the fuel they bum.222 As a result, Total\u2019s experts submitted that \"as of 2006, there is a US$11/MWh gap between the actual and but-for monomic prices\".223\n\nSee CL First Report, ****supra**** note 54, paras. 46- 47 and Total QM, ****supra**** note 5, para. 143. At para. 48, CL explains that the actual scenario valuation of the LECG Damage Report of 2007, ****supra**** note 115, has remained unchanged since it has not been affected by the Decision on Liability, ****supra**** note 1. The but-for scenario has been updated by CL to take into account the Tribunal\u2019s decision that pesification did not represent a breach of the BIT, but the approach to the construction of the but-for scenario has not changed either.\n\nLECG\u2019s Report on Assessment of Argentina\u2019s Recent Regulatory Conduct in Electricity Generation by Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller of 15 May 2007 [hereinafter \"LECG Electricity Report\"], para. 56 and Graph IV. CL has updated the figures to take into account the evolution from 2007 to 2010 (which is relevant for the construction of but-for future revenues), CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 141-142 and CL Second Report, ***supra*** note 23, para. 98. CL has assumed there that the gap would end in 2011 through the Government lifting the effect of Resolution 240/2003 and related measures, CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 137-138. In the LECG Report on Electricity of 2007 the experts assumed instead that the gap would converge at the end of 2007 leading to a higher estimate of the difference between but-for and actual pnce, see CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 139.\n\n*See* LECG Electricity Report\", ***supra*** note 221, paras. 59-64, updated in CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 137-143, with reference to the mechanism introduced by SoE Resolution 240/03, Article 1.2, Exhibit C-79. As to the \"monomic pnce\", see Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1, para. 268.\n\nLECG Electricity Report, *supra* note 221, p. 63, para. 61 and Graph VI show a 2006 average but-for monomic pnce of about US$41/MWh against an actual price of US$30/MWh. The Tribunal notes that the LECG Electricity Report states *inter alia* at para. 63 that \"[s]ince SE Res. 240/2003 makes spot prices relatively insensitive to movements in crude oil prices...large users\u2019 demand for electricity becomes insensitive to the raise in crude oil price, when the efficient response should be to reduce demand when the economic cost of the system increase\".\n\nc) *The choice between the \"DCF method\" for both the but-for and actual scenarios (the \"pure DCF Method\"), and the \"DCF/Transaction method\" (DCF for the but-for value and using the actual sale price for the actual scenario)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that before reviewing the methodology of the but-for calculations submitted by Total and the data in support thereof, it is appropriate to discuss the two alternative methods that Total\u2019s experts have set forth for determining the actual scenario.224 The first one (\"DCF/transaction method\"), which is the one formally advocated by Total,225 identifies the actual fair market value of the two generators with the price at which Total sold them in 2006 (US$180.6 million). The second one (\"pure DCF method\"), which has been explained and submitted as an alternative by Total\u2019s experts, is based on a DCF analysis to ascertain the actual fair market price of the two generators when Total sold them at the end of 2006, leading to a value of US$309.4 million. For clarity, the various tables set forth by Total\u2019s experts to calculate the damages of each of the two generators under the two methods, pure DCF and DCF/Transactions, have been reproduced above at paragraph 116. As to the relevant date at which to determine the damages, the Tribunal agrees with Total that under both methodologies this is the date when Total sold its stake, namely the end of 2006. This date is the relevant one because, as a result of the divesture, from that date Total ceased to sustain any risks and derive any benefit from the HPDA and Central Puerto businesses, so that any loss crystallized at that date. The end of 2006 is therefore also the date from which to calculate interest accruing to Total on the damages it has suffered.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 114-117 with reference to the relevant parts of Total\u2019s briefs and expert reports (Table V and VI reproduced at para. 116).\n\nSee **supra** para. 113, Total PHB, **supra** note 11, p. 43, Table One: \"Total\u2019s Damage Claim: Principal v. Interest\".\n\n136.\n\nAs recalled above, Total explains that it is appropriate to base the actual value of the generators on the sale price of 2006 because, \"[t]he 2006 transaction was an arm\u2019s length transaction to an independent third party, and the sales price thus reflected what market participants believed to be the fair market value of these assets, as late as 2006.\"226 This statement has to be verified against the background of the arguments repeatedly made by Total that \"full compensation for Total\u2019s losses resulting from Argentina\u2019s Treaty Breaches must be based on an assessment of the fair market value of the affected investments.\"227 Total consistently advocates the DCF method as \"the most appropriate way to determine fair market value in this case\" and submits that even Argentina and its experts agree \"that the calculation of the present value of projected future cash flows is the most widely accepted way to determine the fair market value of a going concern, and therefore the basis on which to assess economic harm for the owners of such an enterprise, at the relevant date of valuation.\"228 The Tribunal has already stated that it accepts generally this approach and has explained the reasons therefor.229\n\nTotal QR, *supra* note 23, para. 162.\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 20. See fn. 21 there. See Total RM Merits, **supra** note 136, paras. 650-653, 655-659, 667-668, and the authorities cited therein, including The World Bank, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,* 7 ICSID Review, 295, 303 (1992), Exhibit CL-49, \"Compensation will be deemed \u2018adequate\u2019 if it is based on the fair market value of the taken asset\"\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 27 and 29.\n\nSee *supra* para. 128.\n\n137.\n\nIn order to support its argument that the actual sale price rather than the DCF value should be used in the actual scenario, Total argues \"that the 2006 sale price is relevant for this purpose, because it was the result of an arm\u2019s length transaction, involving the assets directly at issue in this arbitration, conducted at precisely the relevant time, taking into account the full impact of the Government\u2019s Treaty Breaches.\"230 Total adds that the Tribunal should adopt the 2006 sale price because \"[t]his sale price represents the market\u2019s perception of the impact of the Treaty Breaches on the value of Total\u2019s shares, based on an arm\u2019s-length transaction concluded between sophisticated parties.\"231\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 151.\n\nTotal PHB, *supra* note 11, para. 46.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the DCF method is considered a *reasonable* method to ascertain the market value of a going concern, that is the \"amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics.\"232 The fact that \"normally\" a willing buyer and a willing seller would carry out a transaction based on the DCF value of an enterprise does not mean that each and every transaction will be so based. If it were correct that \"[p]rojections of future costs and revenues are used because a buyer or seller in the market would invariably calculate the company\u2019s present value on the basis of a reasonable assessment of the company\u2019s future cash flows, taking into account the risk involved in generating those cash flows and the time value of money\",233 then the substantial difference between the DCF actual valuation and the sale price of the two generators would be inexplicable and contradictory. The Tribunal notes, moreover, that neither Party has claimed, nor proved, that there was a \"market\", characterized by a number of transactions, and a current price for electricity generators in Argentina in 2006.234 Such a situation is unlikely to occur generally, since there are usually few electricity generators operating in a given market and sales transactions are infrequent, in view of their high price, the capital and technology needed by an investor to acquire and operate them and regulatory requirements.\n\nWorld Bank, *Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,* Section IV, para. 5, Exhibit CL-49.\n\nAs stated in Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 31.\n\nCentral Puerto is listed in the stock exchange, but the LECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115, para. 30, fn. 4, explains that \"[a]lthough stock market information is available for Central Puerto, it is not reliable as the liquidity of this stock has been extremely weak\".\n\n139.\n\nBased on the evidence and the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal is not convinced that the 2006 sale transaction can be taken as representative of the \"market value\" of the generators, in the absence of an actual market and of specific evidence that the parties to that transaction had based themselves on an objective evaluation of the \"fair market value\" of the generators, or on competitive biddings, in order to determine the agreed price.235 On the contrary, Argentina\u2019s post-crisis context and the specific features of the regulation of the electricity market, which led to the reduction of the revenues of generators (with the effect *inter alia* of Central Puerto and HPDA having paid no dividends since 2001), and the uncertainty of their future evolution, could explain that Total might have decided to get out of the Argentina electricity market and divest, selling its stakes even at a price considerably less than their \"normal\" fair market value.236\n\nSuch an objective determination could be that of an independent valuation by a consultant or appraiser jointly appointed by the seller and the buyer. The sales contracts (Exhibits C-585 and C-586) contain no elements as to how the price was determined. Competitive bidding has been resorted to by Argentina\u2019s authorities in the privatization of generators, thus justifying that arbitral tribunals have considered this feature as the starting point of their valuation analysis (such as in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award (14 July 2006), paras. 38-41 and 427, and *EDF* Award, *supra* note 107, para. 1223. Such an approach has not been advocated by either Party in the present dispute, nor has Total as claimant introduced any evidence that the transaction price reflected an effective market price for the generators when it sold them in 2006.\n\nSee, for example, the complaint by Total that in other sectors prices were permitted \"to rise freely in accordance with market forces, while energy prices on the whole were strictly pesified and frozen at 2001 levels. In this way, Argentina transferred wealth directly from TGN, Total Austral, Central Puerto and HPDA (as well as from other energy companies) to local industrial commercial and residential gas users\", favouring manufacturers for export as well, Total MM, *supra* note 47, paras. 37-38.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in this case, as advocated by the Claimant and not denied in principle by the Respondent, the DCF method has been generally employed to ascertain longterm damages suffered by Total as to its investments in enterprises in Argentina, comparing homogeneous DCF but-for values with DCF actual values. The Tribunal is therefore reluctant to accept another method in the absence of specific evidence to support the appropriateness of such a choice in respect of the generators. The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the sale price of the generators is not a reliable basis to ascertain their actual value at the end of 2006 and, as a result, accepts for this purpose the DCF method set forth by Total\u2019s experts as an alternative.237\n\nTotal has referred to other awards in investment disputes with Argentina where the arbitral tribunals have taken into account the price at which the investor had sold its stakes in the energy sector, Total PHB, ***supra*** note 11, para. 47, referring to the *National Grid PLC v. Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL and *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/01/3 decisions. The different facts of each case and type of claims do not allow preferring the approach of these tribunals to that of others. The Tribunal notes that in the recent *EDF* Award, ***supra*** note 107, the tribunal did not rely on the fact that the claimants, Electricit\u00e9 de France and other investors, had sold their stake in a generator for a symbolic price, to the point of holding the investors responsible of contributory negligence, at paras. 1286 ff. This case is mentioned here as a further factual example, without drawing any conclusion from it, since it was not addressed by the Parties in their arguments and the circumstances of the sale appear quite different. The Tribunal does not take any position as to whether Total sold its stake at \"a bad time\" (as Argentina suggests, Argentina QCM, ***supra*** note 6, para. 169, any judgment thereon not being required to decide the issue.\n\nd) *Calculating the but-for revenues o**f*  *the generators: but-for prices and but-for quantities*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nOnce the methodology to determine but-for prices has been established, various further calculations must be made in order to derive the cash flows that HPDA and Central Puerto would have obtained under the but-for scenario and ultimately the but-for value of the generators. The items to be determined are the following: (i) the specific prices that HPDA and Central Puerto would have obtained, absent the 2002-2003 changes in the system of remuneration of the generators; (ii) the quantity (volumes) of electricity that the generators would have dispatched, both until 2006 and thereafter;238 (iii), figures for but-for revenues, which are obtained by applying the prices (i) to the quantities (ii); and finally (iv) these figures have to be discounted by the appropriate WACC to obtain the but-for fair market value of the generators at the end of 2006. The Tribunal has encountered difficulties in finding in the Claimant\u2019s briefs and in the experts\u2019 reports the assumptions concerning the volume of electricity that the two generators would have dispatched and the revenues they would have obtained (steps (i) and (ii) above).239 The relevant data assumed for steps (i) and (ii) are not apparent in the many tables with explanations included in the relevant briefs of Total and in the reports of its experts.240\n\nThe end date of the concessions is 2030 for Central Puerto and 2023 for HPDA, Total QM, *supra* note 5, parr. 41(b).\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the pre-2003 regime used for the but-for scenano includes capacity payments not conelated to energy dispatched, see Total Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 268-271.\n\nSee Total QM, ***supra*** note 5, para. 150. CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 137-143 (updating the LECG Electricity Report, ***supra*** note 221), though titled \"Appendix B - Central Puerto & HPDA: Main Valuation Assumptions\" focuses exclusively on the \"dispatch model\" and FONINVEMEM.\n\n142.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal has been able to locate relevant information and data as to Total\u2019s experts\u2019 hypothesis for (i) and (ii) in Exhibits C-784 and C-785 which present in Excel electronic spread sheets the Central Puerto and HPDA \"Damage Valuation Models as per Decision, updated as of September 2011\", respectively.241 The Tribunal has especially examined the Revenues but-for sheets that indicate for each generator the volumes of energy sold in past years and those expected to be sold in future years, the respective prices and the income which results or would result therefrom. The Free Cash Flow but-for sheets therein show *inter alia* the resulting assumed overall revenues. The Tribunal notes that the corresponding figures for the actual scenario are also set forth in distinct actual Revenues and Free Cash Flow spread sheets in the same exhibits.\n\nAs described in fn. 33 and 34 of CL Response to PO No. 7, *supra* note 92, attached to Total\u2019s PHB, *supra* note 11, and referenced there for the purpose of analyzing the different issue of the level of indebtedness of the two generators.\n\n143.\n\nThese data are not easy to analyze and reconcile. In any case the Tribunal understands that the prices, shown in the sheets, that each generator would have charged in the but-for scenario, are those resulting from the price structure described above based on the pre-2003 electricity pricing system. As expected, the but-for prices are in Total\u2019s experts\u2019 model substantially higher than in the actual scenario: thus for HPDA the but for \"average energy prices\" compared to actual prices in the years from 2003 to 2006 are (US$/MWh) as follows:\n\n- in 2003: 11.1 v. 7.7;\n\n- in 2004: 18.2 v. 9.6;\n\n- in 2005: 28.3 v. 13.1; and\n\n- in 2006: 19.8 v. 17.6.\n\nActual prices would start to approach but-for prices according to Total\u2019s experts\u2019 model as of 2013.242 The volumes set forth by Total\u2019s experts for electricity sales are, however, exactly the same in the two scenarios.243 Multiplying in the two scenarios the same volumes of electricity by those different unitary prices results, evidently, in much higher revenues and cash flows in the but-for scenario than in the actual scenario for the various years.244 In other words, the model rests on the hypothesis that HPDA would have been able to sell the same volumes of electricity notwithstanding the much higher prices assumed in the but-for scenario. The assumptions for Central Puerto are similar.245\n\nSee Exhibit C-785, HPDA \"Damage Valuation Models as per Decision, updated as of September 2011\", Revenues actual and but-for Spread Sheets.\n\nSee Exhibit C-785, HPDA \"Damage Valuation Models as per Decision, updated as of September 2011\", Revenues actual and but-for Spread Sheets, actual Total Energy Generation/ Total Spot sales compared to But-For Total Spot Sales. As recalled at ***supra*** para. 110: \"Total\u2019s experts\u2019 model assumes furthermore that \u2018Electricity demand volumes reflecting actual demand up to end of 2006 and growing at a rate of 5.5% per year from 2007 onwards, consistent with the average histoncal growth over the penod 1993-2006\u2019\", CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, Annex B, para. 135(c) based on LECG Damage Report, ***supra*** note 115, para. 251, fn. 228, which in turn refers to actual \"average historical growth rate\" data (that is actual data, not but-for estimates) of CAMMESA 1993-2006, Exhibit C-602.\n\nSee Exhibit C-785, HPDA \"Damage Valuation Models as per Decision, updated as of September 2011\", Free Cash Flow actual and but-for Spread Sheets.\n\nAs to Central Puerto, whose data presents a different, more complex structure, the volumes in the but-for scenario are below those of the actual scenario by about 3% in 2003, 18% in 2004, 15% in 2005 and 2006, are almost the same in 2007, higher in 2008 and 2009, below by 15% in 2011. Thereafter, but-for volumes are similar (just slightly higher by about 2%), than actual anticipated volumes, in accordance with Total\u2019s experts\u2019 assumption that actual prices will increase by 2012, CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 138. See Exhibit C-784, Central Puerto \"Damage Valuation Models as per Decision, updated as of September 2011\", Revenues actual and but-for Spread Sheets. The same sheets include the prices for the electricity produced by Central Puerto from various sources setting forth generally higher prices (as expected) in the but-for scenario. The resulting total revenues set forth in the same sheets are much higher in the but-for scenario, except for 2003 and 2006. The Tribunal notes that UBA First Valuation Report, **supra** note 63 at paras. 408-413, states that Total\u2019s experts\u2019 model, contrary to their own premises, does not assume full convergence between but-for and actual prices from 2012 on, thus resulting in an \"unjustified\" increase of estimated future damages in UBA\u2019s view.\n\n144.\n\nThis conclusion has to be scrutinized carefully in respect of the issue of crosselasticity between electricity consumption and the price thereof. The assumption of Total\u2019s experts of lack of cross-elasticity, or a very limited cross elasticity, is difficult to reconcile with the evidence submitted by the Parties and the arguments made by Total that (i) actual post 2003 price in Argentina as set by the SoE \" were since 2002 on average 50% below what they would have been absent of the measure\"...\" being subject to price interference in the natural gas market and a hard and binding cap\";246 and that (ii) the low electricity price had caused demand for electricity to soar.247\n\nSee Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 145 quoting the LECG Electricity Report, **supra** note 221, para. 5(c) and (d). In detail, the LECG Electricity Report, at para. 59, fn. 64, sets forth an even bigger gap between the prices in their but-for model and actual spot prices: in 2002 USS 14.33 vs 5.82 /MWh; in 2006: USS 32.44 vs. 20.35 / MWh.\n\nTotal MM, *supra* note 47, para. 47.\n\n145.\n\nAs to (i) the Tribunal has already acknowledged in the Decision on Liability that due to the measures that altered the price mechanism established with the Electricity Law \"After 2002, the market has been characterized by unreasonably low tariffs\",248 as a consequence of Argentina\u2019s disregard of \"the principle of the economic equilibrium allowing generators to cover their costs and make a reasonable return on their investments\".249 The increase of price hypothesized for the but-for scenario by Total and its experts in order to model the higher prices that would comply with the above requirement is thus quite substantial. According to the position expressed by Total, quoted in paragraphs 134 and 144, the but-for prices should have been the double of actual prices in order to reflect the economic costs of the system and allow generators to cover costs and make a reasonable profit. Even without accepting fully that position, it is a fact that Total in its Quantum Memorial has advocated but-for spot prices that for 2004 would have been about 40% higher than the actual ones, for 2005 the double, for 2006 about 50% higher, and for 2007-2011 about 30% higher than actual prices.250\n\nSee Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1, para. 328 and fn. 449. The 2004 average price of residential electricity in Argentina was a fraction of prices in all industrial countries, around 20% of those in Germany, Japan, Italy; less than one third of those in France and the U.K.; and less than half of those in the US. In this regard, see Total PHB Merits, ***supra*** note 45, para. 133 and table therein from Energy Information Administration, 2007, Exhibit C-706. Total emphasizes that the price of electricity in Argentina was already one of the lowest in the world in 2001: new investments in the sector since 1992 had more than doubled installed capacity, had eliminated power shortages and had brought the prices steadily down to the benefit of consumers, see Total PHB, ***supra*** note 11), paras. 831-833 and tables therein.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 327-328, with reference to para. 313.\n\nSee Total QM, **supra** note 5, graph at para. 144, corresponding to Graph II of CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 137, where actual spot prices for 2006-2011 are around AR$/MWh 24 against but-for prices around 35. A comparison between the curves submitted there by Total for the actual and but-for scenarios show an even bigger difference in 2005 (the but-for curve being about 100% higher) and 2006 (about 50% higher). For the period after 2011 Total projects an increase of actual prices, assuming that \"Resolution 24/2003 would end by the end of 2011\", CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 138, so that but-for prices would approach actual prices.\n\n146.\n\nAs to (b), that is the increase of electricity consumption due to very low prices, Total has explained in the merits phase that \"Reduced gas prices translate directly into electricity prices, causing demand for electricity to soar. Demand increased by 30% more in the first quarter of 2004 than it had in the first quarter of 1998, long before the advent of any economic difficulty\",251 adding that \"The minimal electricity tariff has generated a substantial increase of demand for electricity, mainly from industries\".252 The Tribunal has acknowledged in the Decision on Liability, based on the evidence and the statements by the Parties that electricity consumption in Argentina after 2002 increased massively due to very low prices that did not cover the costs of generation.253\n\nTotal MM, **supra** note 47, para. 47.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 221.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 326 and 328.\n\n147.\n\nIf the reduction of prices and their ensuing low levels have substantially increased consumption, it is reasonable to assume that demand is elastic. A substantial increase of prices in the but-for scenario (amounting to almost 50% on average between 2004 and 2011) should therefore lead to lower consumption. Therefore, revenues and cash flows for generators would be lower, including for Total\u2019s two generators, contrary to what is set forth in Total\u2019s but-for model.254 In view of above mentioned evidence to the contrary and Total\u2019s own statements regarding the effect of increases of prices on the demand for electricity, the Tribunal is not convinced by Total\u2019s experts\u2019 arguments that electricity demand is \"inelastic\", so that a wholesale electricity price increase \"would imply only a minimal reduction in average residential and commercial demand\".255 Nor does the Tribunal believe that a reduction in demand would have hit in the but-for scenario only the less efficient generators, while HPDA and Central Puerto would have escaped the effect of the general reduction in consumption.256 This would not be in line with the approach of the Decision on Liability that a but-for system where the spot price would have been fixed on the basis of the marginal unit without a cap of ARS$120 is not the only mechanism that could respect the paramount requirement of economic equilibrium \"allowing generators to cover their costs and make a reasonable return on their investments\"257 The ensuing corrections to Total\u2019s evaluation of the damages will be dealt with hereunder at paragraph 150. As to operation (iii) listed in paragraph 141, Total\u2019s experts derive the figures for but-for and actual revenues by applying in each scenario the electricity prices to the estimated quantities for the relevant number of years.258 Tor the purpose of discounting future revenues (operation (iv) also described above at paragraph 141), Total\u2019s experts explain that \"[a]nnual cash flows from 2007 onward are discounted back to 31 December 2006 at 13.77%, the estimated 2006 WACC for power generators operating in Argentina, to obtain the firm valuation in the but-for and actual scenarios.\"259 Claimant\u2019s experts have not provided details explaining on what basis they have found that 13.77% was the WACC \"for electricity generation companies\" at the end of 2006.260 Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that this rate is reasonable, noting that it has not been challenged by Argentina and that it is similar to the one proposed and justified by Total in respect of gas transportation.261\n\nSee also to the contrary the LECG Electricity Report, *supra* note 221, para. 63, stating that \"the efficient response should be to reduce demand when the economic cost of the system increase.\"\n\nCL Second Report, ***supra*** note 23, paras. 133-135 in response to UBA First Valuation Report, ***supra*** note 63, para. 398. The arguments omit reference to industrial consumers to which Claimant refers instead in the Total MM, ***supra*** note 47, para. 221, cited above: \"The minimal electricity tariff lias generated a substantial increase of demand in electricity, mainly from industries\" (referring to Exhibit C-250). Total\u2019s experts argument is contradicted by the very paper to which they refer, Cont & Navajas, *\"La Anatom\u00eda Simple de la Crisis Energ\u00e9tica en Argentina\"* (2004), Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina Econ\u00f3mica Pol\u00edtica, available at www.aacp.org.ar Exhibit C-488. In the paper, one can read statements such as: \"Que las elasticidades-precio de la demanda de energ\u00eda no son cero o insignificantes es una evidencia largamente documentada en la Argentina (ver, por ejemplo Banco Mundial 1990; FIEL, 1995a) y, desde luego, a nivel mundial (Pydyick, 1979; Donelly, 1987; Bacon 1992)\", p. 4, see also p.17. Publicly available studies confirm that \"a rise in electricity prices, *ceteribus paribus,* should lead to a fall in the quantity demanded\". World Bank Report, \"Meeting the Electricity Supply/Demand Balance in Latin America & the Caribbeans\" (2010), para. 106 \"the demand for electricity is positively correlated with income and negatively correlated with price\".\n\nTotal\u2019s experts assume that both HPDA and Central Puerto are efficient generators that benefit from Electricity Law original scheme fixing the uniform price at the higher costs of the marginal unit. While Argentina experts also recognize that HPDA as a hydroelectric power plant is highly efficient, they dispute that the same holds for Central Puerto, considering that some of the latter\u2019s units have been in operation for a very long period of time, see UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 401.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 327, referring back to para. 313.\n\nSee Exhibits C-761 and C-762, updated by Exhibits C-764 and C-765.\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 51.\n\nLECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115, para. 128.\n\nSee *supra* para. 85.\n\n148.\n\nThe final data as to the amount of damages resulting from the above valuation process submitted by Total\u2019s experts under the DCF method (\"pure DCF method\"), have been recalled above at paragraph 115.262 Those damages estimated by Total\u2019s experts amount to $98.7 million for Central Puerto and $77.4 million for HPDA, for a total amount of $176.1 million, this being the difference between the but-for valuation of Total\u2019s stakes ($194.4 million and $213.8 million respectively, in total $485.9 million) and the actual DCF valuations ($95.6 million and $213.8 million respectively, in total $309.4 million).\n\nSee the reproduction of Tables III and IV in CL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 53.\n\n149.\n\nAs previously discussed, in the Tribunal\u2019s view the but-for values (and hence the difference with the actual scenario, which represents the damages), appear to be overestimated since the but-for valuation of the revenues assumes that the energy sold by the two generators would be basically the same in the but-for as in the actual scenario, notwithstanding the higher electricity prices assumed in the but-for scenario. As mentioned in paragraph 147 above, this assumption cannot be accepted by the Tribunal because of the evidence to the contrary confirming the existence of a definite cross-elasticity between price and demand (sales) of electricity. As stated above, there is abundant evidence on record and statements of the Parties, particularly by Total, that electricity prices in Argentina have been unreasonably low in Argentina since 2002, both in respect of costs, as well as compared to the prices in other countries, thus fuelling a massive growth in demand.263 Considering the evidence of the reduced income of a great part of the population caused by the crisis of 2001,264 the Tribunal cannot but conclude that electricity consumption would have declined substantially had the prices been those assumed by Total\u2019s experts in the but-for scenario.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1, para. 328; Total MM, ***supra*** note 47, para. 47: \"demand for energy in Argentina has risen out of control, due to the artificially low prices that the government has imposed\"; UBA First Valuation Report, ***supra*** note 63, graph at para. 273, which shows an abrupt increase of electricity demand from 2003 following a substantial decline from 1998 to 2002.\n\nSee the Indices on poverty, indigence and unemployment from 2000 to 2003 and the data on the decrease of salaries from 2001 to 2003, Argentina\u2019s counter-memorial on the Merit of 26 January 2007, paras. 79-82. Income is also a vanable influencing the demand of electricity, see the World Bank report referred to at *supra* note 255.\n\n150.\n\nIn the light of these considerations relating to the actual scenario, the Parties\u2019 arguments concerning the low prices for electricity, the ensuing over-consumption, the reduction of income of the population throughout the crisis and the Tribunal\u2019s own findings and conclusions in the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal concludes that the but-for value of the generators under the DCF model submitted by Total\u2019s experts ($485.6 million) has been overestimated. This has led in turn to an excessive valuation of the but-for losses which Total\u2019s experts have valued as a result at $176.1 million. The amount of damages should therefore be reduced by an appropriate percentage. In order to determine such reduction the Tribunal relies on the evidence supplied by the Parties as to the existence of cross elasticity between the evolution of prices in electricity and its impact on the demand.265 Comparing available data and estimates, the Tribunal considers that an increase of the electricity prices for the period 2004 - 2011 in excess of 40%, as estimated by Total for the but-for scenario,266 would have led to a reduction of sales and revenues of about 30%, *ceteribus paribus,* in view of the price/demand elasticity for electricity which can be prudently deduced from available evidence.267 Therefore, the Tribunal ascertains, the damages under the \"pure **DCF** method\" to be granted by Argentina to Total in respect of its investments in the electricity sector to amount to **$123.3 million** (rounded). The relevant date of the loss for purposes of the calculation is the end of 2006, this being the date when the loss crystallised with the divesture of Total from the electricity generators.268 In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal resolves the difficulties concerning the assessment of the damages undoubtedly suffered by Total in respect of its investments in the electricity sector. In so doing, the Tribunal makes use of the inherent discretion that arbitral tribunals enjoy in this respect, especially when different methodologies and different, equally reasonable assumptions do not lead to an unequivocal amount, as explained above at paragraph 32.269\n\nSee the references at *supra* notes 254 and 255.\n\nSee the references at *supra* note 250 and related text.\n\nFor the electricity prices / demand elasticity in Argentina see Exhibit C-488, referred to at **supra** note 255, Table 5.1 (limited to the years 2001-2004) and especially the World Bank Report, referred to at **supra** note 255, \"Meeting the Electricity Supply / Demand Balance in Latin America & the Caribbean\" (2010), at Annex 2 \"Price and Income Elasticity of Demand\", and Table 6 at p. 47, para. 105, which puts the coefficient at 78% (one dollar increase in price would result in a drop of demand of about 78 cents, so that a 40% increases x 0.78 = a 31.2% decrease).\n\nThe end of 2006 is therefore also the date from which to calculate interest on the principal amount of the damages suffered by Total in respect of the generators. The determination of the interest payable on this sum is dealt with in Part V hereunder, together with all other issues concerning interest.\n\nAn alternative approach for reducing the but-for value of the generators would have been to proceed first to reduce the \"Total Firm Value\" estimated by Total\u2019s experts to take into account the reduced but-for revenues/cash flows due to the Tribunal\u2019s estimate of the smaller quantities of electricity that the generators would have been able to sell at the higher prices of the but-for scenario, and thereafter to deduct the financial debt. This more analytical approach would have required performing analytical calculations, also in respect of the level of indebtedness of the generators which the Parties have addressed in their answer to a specific question contained in PO No. 7 that the Tribunal is not in the position to make. The Tribunal believes that the more straight forward approach adopted in the text leads to correct, equivalent results as to the ultimate determination which it must make, namely that of a reasonable assessment of the amount of damages.\n\ne) *The irrelevance of the 2001 acquisition price for establishing damages in 2006 and* *its use for comparison purposes*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties do not consider a valuation method based on the price paid by Total for the generators in 2001 as relevant.270 However, they reach this conclusion for different reasons. Total submits that the 2001 transaction could have no relevance to the contra-factual valuation because of the substantial difference of prevailing business and power market conditions \"in the but-for world\" in 2006 from those actually prevailing in 2001.271 In any event, Total asked its expert to calculate damages also using the Net Capital Contribution (\"NCC\") approach\" explaining that \"[t]his takes into account the theoretical value of HPDA and Central Puerto to Total as of December 2006, using the 2001 acquisition price as a base, increased over time by the expected profitability at that date\".272 Total shares the view of its experts that the ensuing results (damages of $460.9 million in respect of Central Puerto and none in respect of HPDA) \"reflect the weakness of the NCC methodology which, given its theoretical nature can show opposite results for two assets which were negatively impacted by the same set of treaty breaches\".273\n\nAt para. 339 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, the Tribunal stated that \"the quantum phase shall deal with the determination of the losses suffered by Total because of the negative impact of Argentina\u2019s action on HPDA and Central Puerto that have been found to be in breach of the BIT\", adding in fn. 458 there: \"This includes determining the proper \"but for scenario\", the actual scenario and the possible influence of both the purchase price paid by Total in 2001 and the sale price of its equity stakes in Central Puerto and HPDA at the end of 2006\".\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 154-156.\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 158, referring to CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 58-69.\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, paras. 67-68.\n\n152.\n\nArgentina takes into account the purchase price, though not as a basis for determining whether Total has suffered damages due to its measures. Argentina submits that Total had paid a \"highly exaggerated\" or \"completely inflated price\" since it was based on a series of macroeconomic assumptions and expectations that turned out to be different from the subsequent performance of the main variables affecting the revenues and costs of companies.274 Argentina considers, rather, that the purchase price should be considered as \"a ceiling price\" for any calculation. Argentina insists on its different methods referred to above (such as the EBITDA method) for concluding that Total suffered no damage due to the measures that the Tribunal has found in breach of Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations.\n\nArgentina QCM, ***supra*** note 6, paras. 163-165, with reference to CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, para. 59. See also ***supra*** paras. 124-125.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied by the Parties\u2019 different, but ultimately concurring, explanations that using the purchase price to measure Total\u2019s damages would be inappropriate. Nevertheless, the Tribunal believes that there is some value to be derived by taking into account on the one hand the price paid by Total for the purchase of HPDA and Central Puerto stakes in 2001 ($327.45 million), and, on the other hand, the but-for and actual values five years later, in 2006, of those same stakes under the various methods discussed above. These values are the *but-for value* without the measures in place calculated by Total\u2019s experts under the \"pure DCF\" method ($485.6 million), the *actual value* based also on DCF ($309.4 million), and finally the *actual sale price* ($180.6 million). Comparisons between the initial price paid by Total in 2001, before the pesification, the economic crisis and the alteration of the electricity price mechanism, on the one hand, and the above mentioned 2006 values and prices, on the other hand, may have some relevance as a kind of \"reality check\" or double check of the conclusions reached by the Tribunal as to the *quantum* of damages.275\n\nAccording to the UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 341-342, Total paid for the stakes in the generators 5.12 or 6.45 times the EBITDA and resold them at 3.45. According to UBA under normal circumstances, the reasonable rate for this kind of company is between 4 and 6 times.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Total bought the stakes in the two generators before the economic crisis, considering as negligible the risk of complete upheaval of the existing currency dollar-peg system and of the electricity regime.276 The price paid in 2001 was a total of $327.45 million. In comparison, Total and its experts have estimated using the DCF method that those same stakes would have been worth $485.6 million in 2006 in the but-for scenario. The Tribunal recalls that this scenario would incorporate pesification, the ensuing crisis and actual changes in the fuel prices, but not the alteration of the electricity price mechanism affecting the revenues of the generators.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 324 and fn. 445 there, as well as Argentina QCM, **supra** note 6, para. 164 (\"no one was aware of how severe the ensuing cnsis would be\").\n\n155.\n\nThe reduction by 30% of the damages claimed by Total, from $176.1 million to $123.3 million, that is by $52.8 million, as determined by the Tribunal above, is somehow equivalent to reducing the but-for value of the generators from $485.6 to a $422.8 million. This determination appears justified since the figure of $485.6 million would correspond to an increase of value of Total\u2019s shares in the generators, in respect of the purchase price, of more than 50% in five years (from $327.45 million to $485.6 million), notwithstanding the pesification and the crisis that are assumed also in the but-for scenario. On the basis of all the information gathered in the proceedings such an increase seems to the Tribunal not to be in line with those assumptions and thus excessive. Even more so considering that Argentina\u2019s electricity regime was organized in a way that generators would receive a rate \"based on the economic cost of the system\", in the expectation that \"competition would drive costs down\", while \"protecting adequately the right of users\".277 As explained in the Decision on Liability, the pricing mechanism was such as to establish a stable pricing system and ensure reasonable revenues to the electrical generators (so as to encourage private investment therein), while safeguarding at the same time consumers from excessive prices.278 A fifty per cent increase in the value of the generators from 2001 to 2006 in a but-for scenario of higher electricity prices incorporating pesification and the economic crisis does not appear in line with the statutory objective of safeguarding consumers from excessive electricity prices.\n\nSee Article 2 of the Electricity Law of 1992 and the descnption by the Parties of its basic principles in the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras 241-250.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 251-276; Electricity Law, Article 2(f)\n\n156.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the following considerations. In the actual scenario Total was able to sell its stakes only at $180.6 million, well below the DCF actual value estimated by its experts to be $309.4 million as recalled in paragraph 115 above. Whatever the reasons for this difference (the Tribunal recalls that Total considers that the transaction was an arm\u2019s length transaction, while according to Argentina it was carried out at a depressed price because of the decision of Total to divest at a \"bad moment\"), Total is being granted in the present Award as damages $123.3 million because of the depressing effect that Argentina\u2019s measures have had on its equity in breach of the BIT. Thus Total will have obtained for its stakes in the generators a sale price of $180.6 million and damages for $123.3 million. The resulting total amount of $303.9 million is what Total will ultimately obtain for its stakes in the generators sold in 2006, which Total acquired in 2001 for the price of $327.45 million. Feaving aside the effect of Total\u2019s subjective business choices of buying and selling the stakes in the generators at those points in time, the lower 2006 figure (sale price plus damages) reflects two elements. First, (i) the depressing effect of the crisis and the pesification which occurred in the meantime (and which is not attributable to Argentina under the Decision on Liability), and secondly (ii) the alteration of the electricity price mechanism. The latter is attributable to Argentina instead and is made good by the awarding of damages. It seems to the Tribunal that such a result ($327.45 million in 2001 versus $303.9 million in 2006) reflects the evolution on Argentina\u2019s economy and of its electricity sector in the period under consideration. The reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s approach and of the result is further confirmed by the fact that the sum of the sale prices and the amount of damages calculated by the Tribunal ($303.9 million), broadly conforms to the 2006 actual value of Total\u2019s stakes in the two generators under the DCF method (US$ 309.4 million). The Tribunal believes that these considerations confirm the soundness of the Tribunal\u2019s determination of damages in the amount of $123.3 million in respect of Total\u2019s investments in the electricity generators.\n\n***G. Total\u2019s Claim as Technical Operator of HPDA***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn its Quantum Memorial, Total submits a distinct claim for damages in respect of its position as management/technical operator of HPDA, explaining that \"[d]uring the liability phase, Total sought damages based on the reduced management/technical operator fees it received from HPDA as a result of the Government\u2019s measures.279 Total claims that it would have received these fees in full from HPDA as per agreement, absent Argentina\u2019s alteration of the uniform marginal price mechanism. Total complains that as a direct consequence of the Government\u2019s treaty breaches it received substantially less fees. Total\u2019s experts estimate the amount that Total would have received as technical operator in each of the two scenarios *(but-for* and *actual)* and determine the difference, that is the loss for Total, to be $500,000.280\n\nSee Total QM, ***supra*** note 5, paras. 161-162, referring in fn. 277 to para. 720 of Total RM Merit, ***supra*** note 23 and to the LECG Damage Report, ***supra*** note 115, paras. 122,127,131.153, and 288-298. Paras. 153 and 288-293 do not relate, however, to Total\u2019s position as technical operator of HPDA, but to its position as technical operator of TGN.\n\nCL First Report, *supra* note 54, para. 50.\n\n158.\n\nArgentina objects to this claim on procedural grounds. Argentina submits that Total had not submitted this claim in the merits phase and that the submission of new claims in the *quantum* phase is too late and hence inadmissible, so that it should be rejected because of this procedural reason alone. Argentina also submits that the Tribunal did not hold Argentina liable in this respect in the Decision on Liability.281\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 57-60 and 182.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have made similar arguments as to the procedural admissibility of the claim made by Total for lost fees as technical operator in respect of TGN. A difference between the two claims is that in the Decision on Liability the Tribunal did not mention nor address Total\u2019s claim based on its status as technical operator of HPDA while such a mention was made as to Total\u2019s claim in respect of TGN.282\n\nSee **supra** paras. 88-94 and Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 191.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided here by the same principles it has applied to the procedural objection raised by Argentina in respect of the technical operator fees to which Total was entitled under its contract with TGN.283 In respect of that claim, the Tribunal recalls that it has rejected Argentina\u2019s position, holding that Total timely articulated this claim in its Reply of 18 May 2007.284 However, as to Total\u2019s claim as technical operator of HPDA, unlike in the case of TGN, the Tribunal considers that Argentina is correct and that it cannot be said that Total did \"set out\" this claim, not even in general terms, in the merits phase. The only mention or reference to this item is found in paragraph 720 of Total\u2019s Reply, in parenthesis, in the following terms: \"To this amount [the difference between the but-for valuation of HPDA and the sale price in 2006] are then added the historical losses that Total has suffered as cash flow reductions from 2002 until the November 2006 sale (i.e. in respect of dividends and management fees)\". Such a mere mention of management fees (in a parenthesis), whose legal basis and calculation of *quantum* are not explained either in Total\u2019s Reply at paragraph 720 or in the LECG Report paragraphs referred to there, does not meet in the Tribunal\u2019s view the minimum requirement for a claim to be \"presented\", as required by Article 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.285 Therefore, the Tribunal rejects on this ground the claim of Total for losses suffered in respect of fees due by HPDA to Total as management/technical operator.\n\nExhibit C-721.\n\nSee *supra* para. 93.\n\nWhile the LECG Damage Report, **supra** note 115, paras. 153, 288-293 includes detailed calculations and tables concerning the loss of Total as technical operator of TGN, the same Report at paras. 122,127, 131 and Table XVII contains only brief statements on Total\u2019s position and losses as operator of HPDA without any supporting evidence, estimating Total\u2019s loss at $2.4 million at that time. Only in Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 162 has Total mentioned that it was entitled to a fee of 1.5% of HPDA revenues based on an Agreement to which it became party when it acquired a share in HPDA, Exhibit C-721.\n\n**IV. TOTAL\u2019S CLAIM IN RELATION TO ITS INVESTMENT INEXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF HYDROCARBONS (OIL AND GAS)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Total\u2019s Investments in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAs explained in detail in the Decision on Liability, Total made investments in Argentina in the oil and gas sector in and around the Austral Basin in Tierra del Fuego. The terms of Total\u2019s investment were set out in Contract 19,944 of 1978 between Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Sociedad del Estado (\"YPF\") and Total Exploration S.A. and the other Consortium members who had been successful in the competitive bidding process for the contract.\n\n162.\n\nContract 19,944 was approved by Decree 2853/78 pursuant to Article 98(g) of the *Ley de Hidrocarburos,* Law No. 17,319, adopted on 23 June 1967, which governed the sector at the time. Another relevant feature of the legal regime applicable to Contract 19,944 was Law 19,640 of 2 June 1972, which exempted exports from Tierra del Fuego from export taxes by making it a Tax Tree Zone.286\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 347-349.\n\n163.\n\nIn 1989, Argentina undertook a process of reform and privatization of many aspects of its economy. Argentina sought to increase private investment in the exploration, production and distribution of hydrocarbons through: privatization of YPF; the divestment of a number of YPF\u2019s concessions; the break-up and privatization of Gas del Estado; and the creation of a concession system that provided for the production of hydrocarbons by private enterprises. Among several legislative measures adopted for implementing this program, reviewed and discussed in the Decision on Liability, Decree 1212/89 called for the renegotiation of existing contracts between foreign investors and YPF.\n\n164.\n\nDecree 1212/89 was intended to increase production of hydrocarbons and to support progressive deregulation; replace State intervention with free market mechanisms and the principle of free disposal of crude petroleum and its derivatives; permit the prices for hydrocarbon products of national origin to reflect international prices; and replace rules that limited the free commercialization of crude oil and its derivatives. Two other decrees, referred to collectively by the Claimant as the \"Deregulation Decrees\", issued in conjunction with Decree 1212/89, were Decrees 1055/89 and 1589/89.287\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 351-354.\n\n165.\n\nPursuant to the Deregulation Decrees, in 1991 Argentina adopted Decree 2411/91 (the \"Reconversion Decree\") which authorised YPF to renegotiate its service contracts that had been adopted under the previous legislative regime, including Contract 19,944, and to convert these into new agreements consisting of two parts: exploration permits and exploitation concessions.\n\n166.\n\nIn 1993, on the basis of the Reconversion Decree and after lengthy negotiations, Total and Argentina reached agreed terms for the conversion of Contract 19,944 into the new concession agreement regime. On 23 November 1993, Total (also on behalf of the other Consortium members) and YPF signed an *\"Acta Acuerdo\"* which set out the parties\u2019 agreement for the reconversion of Contract 19,944. The terms of the *Acta Acuerdo* were specifically referred to, approved and adopted in Decree 214/94 (the \"Concession Decree\") adopted on 15 February 1994.\n\n167.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Concession Decree, Total (through its fully owned subsidiary Total Austral) expanded its exploration and hydrocarbon production activities in Argentina. Total also made a number of investments in several exploration areas in order to locate new reserves. Total entered into long-term contracts with local distributors for the sale of natural gas and also into export contracts for natural gas with Chilean customers, which were approved by the Argentine authorities. This reflected the fact that production in the Argentine market for natural gas had increased significantly, such that Argentina became a regional exporter of natural gas.288\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 358-361.\n\n168.\n\nTotal was also active in the LPG (\"Liquefied Petroleum Gas\") sector. Total freely agreed sales contracts with its customers on both the domestic and international markets.\n\n169.\n\nTotal\u2019s crude oil production came primarily from the Hidra field in Tierra del Fuego. Pursuant to the terms of Law 19,640 of 1972, crude oil exports from Tierra del Fuego remained exempt from export taxes.\n\n170.\n\nTotal explains that by the end of 2001, its share of overall production of natural gas in Argentina was approximately 22%. Among the exploration and production companies operating in Argentina, Total had the highest percentage of its production (in energy equivalent terms) in gas. Of its total production, the large majority (82%) was natural gas and the remainder (18%) represented crude oil and LPG. Of Total\u2019s gas production, the majority was sold in the domestic market to distribution companies and large industrial customers, including power generation plants. Total also entered into a significant number of long-term export contracts for the sale of natural gas, primarily to purchasers in Chile.289\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 362-363.\n\n***B. Total\u2019s Claims in respect of its Investments in Oil & Gas Exploration and*** ***Production in the Liability Phase and the Tribunal\u2019s Holdings in the Decision on Liability***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nIn the liability phase, Total submitted a number of distinct claims, alleging the breach by Argentina of Article 3 of the BIT due to a series of specific measures affecting various rights relating to its investment in oil and gas exploration and production. According to Total, Argentina\u2019s measures (listed and described in the Decision on Liability), severely affected its rights under the relevant legal framework, frustrated Total\u2019s legitimate expectations with respect to its investments and breached Argentina\u2019s obligation to treat Total fairly and equitably under the BIT.290 The rights invoked by Total are those to which it understood it was entitled as a holder of a production concession: full property rights over the hydrocarbons produced, including the right freely to dispose of all of those hydrocarbons set out in Article 6 of the Concession Decree, Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law, Decree 1589/89 and Article 5 of Decree 2411/91 (the so-called Reconversion Decree); and the right to be compensated by the government for limitations of those rights pursuant to Article 8 of the Concession Decree.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 364-380, listing the measures complained of by Total.\n\n172.\n\nThe Decision on Liability sets out in detail the Tribunal\u2019s findings on Total\u2019s various claims. The following summary focuses on the claims which were upheld in whole or in part in the Decision on Liability and in respect of which the assessment of damages was deferred to this Award.291 Following this summary, the Tribunal addresses separately the *quantum* of each claim.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 364-405. In the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, the Tribunal denied Total\u2019s claims relating to the pesification of domestic oil contracts and prices (para. 431), the pesification of Total\u2019s private gas contracts and of the gas tariff (para. 447), the export taxes on oil (para. 436), and the price mechanism introduced by the LPG Law (para. 479). The Tribunal also denied all claims by Total under the nondiscrimination clause of Article 4 of the BIT (para. 481).\n\n173.\n\nWith respect to the elimination of the Tierra del Fuego Tax Exemption granted by Law 19,640 of 1972, Total complained that, by way of Resolution 776/06,292 Argentina retroactively eliminated, from the time of the enactment of the Emergency Law at the beginning of 2002, the exemption from export customs duties that was applicable to production in Tierra del Fuego. On this claim, the Tribunal concluded, based on the evidence and arguments provided by the Parties and its analysis, that Argentina\u2019s measure requiring Total to pay back taxes under Resolution 776/06 was in breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment in Article 3 of the BIT.293 In this regard, the Tribunal held as follows in paragraph 444 of the Decision on Liability:\n\n*In view of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the retroactive elimination of the Tierra del Fuego tax exemption effected by Argentina through the enactment of Resolution 776/06 is in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT. Consequently, any Argentine authorities\u2019 request of payment of export taxes addressed to Total for its exports from Tierra del Fuego concerning the period from 2002 to the entry into force of Law 26,217 in 2007 would be in breach of the BIT.294*\n\nSee Exhibit C-575.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 441-442.\n\nSee also *ibid.,* para. 442: \"...if Argentina\u2019s authorities enforce Resolution 776/06 and obtain from Total Austral the payment of the export taxes from 2002 to 2007 (i.e., as of the date of entry into force of Law 26,217) through domestic litigation or otherwise, Argentina would thereby commit an additional breach of Total\u2019s rights under Article 3 of the BIT. In such an event, Total would be entitled to recover, as damages, whatever amount Total Austral would have been compelled to pay and any costs incidental thereto.\"\n\n174.\n\nTotal also complained of the subsequent express elimination of the exemption granted in Law 19,640 of 1972 by Law 26,217 in 2007. However, the Tribunal denied that claim, holding that the 1972 Tierra del Fuego exemption could be revoked by a later statutory enactment that explicitly so provided. The Tribunal therefore concluded that the 2007 elimination was not in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT.295\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 440.\n\n175.\n\nIn respect of the domestic sale of natural gas, Total claimed in the liability phase that Argentina\u2019s freezing of the gas tariffs was in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT. Total contended that Argentina, by fixing the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff from June 2002 to August 2004 (ENARGAS Resolution 2612/02 of 24 June 2002 and subsequent Resolutions), acted contrary to the Gas Law296 and Total\u2019s rights under the relevant concession. According to Total, this breach started with \"Argentina\u2019s decision in May 2002 to freeze the maximum reference price that natural gas distributors could charge to consumers for gas at the 2001 pesified levels\".297 Total argued that those measures prevented it from negotiating the price of natural gas with its domestic customers and fixed the gas price at such a low level as to be unsustainable and incapable of allowing producers to receive an acceptable rate of return.298\n\nSee Total PHB, *supra* note 11, para. 696.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 388 with reference in fn. 539 to the relevant ENARGAS decisions.\n\nSee Total PHB, **supra** note 11, para. 705; Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, paras. 448 and 453.\n\n176.\n\nIn this respect Total referred specifically to Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 that addressed the situation where restrictions were imposed by the government on the \"free availability\" of gas. As stated in paragraph 454 of the Decision on Liability:\n\n*The provision states, however, in this case, that \"the price of ONE THOUSAND CUBIC METERS (1000 m3) of gas at NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED KILOCALORIES (9,300 kilocalories) shall not be inferior to THIRTY FIVE PERCENT (35%) of the international price for a cubic meter of Arabian Light at 34\u00b0* *API In applying this rule, the gas prices fixed by Argentina should not have been below (35%) of the international price for a cubic meter of Arabian Light at 34\u00b0 API299*\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 454 setting forth the arguments of Total. The original text there reads: \"...THIRTY PERCENT (35%)...\", due to a typing error as made clear by the Spanish text and other references to the provision in the Decision on Liability (see para. 354 quoting Article 6 of Decree 1589/89).\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal held as follows in the Decision on Liability:\n\n*455. The Tribunal understands that the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API was precisely a guarantee to producers of a given minimum price in case of future restrictions. Nevertheless, while invoking the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API as a benchmark for compensation in case restrictions are imposed, Total does not submit any evidence enabling the Tribunal to gather that the price resulting from the measures was below 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API Nor does Argentina give any indication to the Tribunal that the price resulting from the measures was above this benchmark. In the light of the analysis above, the Tribunal considers that, in so far as Argentina has fixed the domestic price of gas below the relevant benchmark without providing for compensation to Total as required by Article 6 of Decree 1589/89, Argentina has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT. This would constitute an unfair and unreasonable interference with Total\u2019s rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the Concession.*\n\n*456. If this is, in fact, the case, Total is entitled to damages for this breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard amounting to the difference between the actual price and the benchmark price. Argentina\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable treatment - subject to* *evidence showing that domestic gas prices resulting from the enacted measures were below 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API - took place from June 2002 to April 2004. This is because of the Price Path Recovery Agreement agreed between the government and gas producers (Total included) that was signed on 2 April 2004.300 The Price Path Recovery Agreement provided for progressive increases by the Secretary of Energy of the well-head price of natural gas applicable to industrial consumers between May 2004 and July 2005, with the aim of liberalising the well-head prices for industrial consumers as of August 2005. It set out a different recovery regime for prices for residential consumers, providing for the liberalisation of those prices as of January 1, 2007* 1301\n\nOriginal fn. 633 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1: The Price Path Recovery Agreement that had as an object *\"la Implementaci\u00f3n del Esquema de Normalizaci\u00f3n de los Precios del Gas Natural en Punto de Ingreso al Sistema de Transporte...* \" to be completed by 31 December 2006, was concluded on 2 April 2004 and then approved by the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investments and Services with Resolution 208/04 dated 21 April 2004, Exhibit C-208.\n\nOriginal fn. 634 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1: \"See Total\u2019s Memorial, paras. 159-160; Total\u2019s Reply, para. 242 (as to the *Acta Acuerdo* see also Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 705-709).\"\n\n178.\n\nTotal has also complained in the liability phase that since Argentina had breached the \"Price Path Recovery Agreement \" that was signed in 2004, Total is also entitled to the difference between the actual prices and the benchmark price during the period in which this Agreement was in force, with respect to quantities that were not covered by the Agreement. Total has explained that the breach it complains of, consists of having been required by Argentina to redirect gas it had destined for sale on the free (export) market (to Chilean customers), to the internal Argentinean market where Total had to sell it at the reduced domestic price set in the Price Path Recovery Agreement.302 In the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal concluded in respect of this claim as follows:\n\n*457. There is no reason for the Tribunal to consider that Total has not validly agreed to the recovery system described above by signing the Price Path Recovery Agreement with Argentina\u2019s authorities.* *Total has not challenged the validity of this Agreement. [...] The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Total\u2019s right to invoke the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil (34\u00b0 API) standard of compensation concerns the period from June 2002 to April 2004. Further details, including the relevance, if so, of Argentina not having fully implemented the Price Path Recovery* *Agreement, as Total complains, should be left to the quantum phase.303*\n\nSee Total PHB, *supra* note 11, paras. 705-709.\n\nOriginal fn. 636 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1: \"See paras 371, 390 above and Total\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 708-709. The Price Path Recovery Agreement was later extended by another agreement (Resolution SoE 599/07 dated 14 June 2007, Exhibit ARA 269).\"\n\n179.\n\nAs to the two claims made by Total concerning Argentina\u2019s limitations of gas exports, the Tribunal rejected the first one concerning Total\u2019s complaint of the negative effect on its revenue due to the introduction by Argentina of natural gas export taxes.304 However, the Tribunal upheld Total\u2019s other claim concerning Argentina\u2019s interference with Total\u2019s export contracts, concluding that: \"It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that once an export contract had been duly authorised pursuant to the domestic applicable legal regime, the subsequent withdrawal of those contractual rights at least constitutes unfair treatment as Total has argued.\"305\n\nDecision on Liability, **supra** note 1, paras. 458-459, referring to Total PHB, **supra** note 11, paras. 722-726.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 460.\n\n180.\n\nIn this respect the Tribunal concluded as follows at paragraphs 460-461 of the Decision on Liability:\n\n*Total is entitled in any case to be compensated by Argentina for its loss of reasonably expected profits under these contracts since this loss is due to Argentina\u2019s interference with Total\u2019s export contracts in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT. In respect of the above-mentioned breach, Total\u2019s damages should be based on the difference between the domestic prices it received for the gas redirected and sold in the domestic market and the export prices agreed in export contracts.306 As to the duration of Total\u2019s export contracts, the relevant period will have to be determined in the quantum phase based on the evidence that the parties submit.*\n\n*[...] the Tribunal concludes that the measures by which Argentina has specifically interfered with Total\u2019s gas export contracts that had been duly authorised by Argentina\u2019s authorities are in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT.*\n\nOriginal fn. 645 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1: \"In any case, the exact calculation of Total\u2019s damages and its basis will have to be dealt with in the quantum phase, avoiding any double recovery.\"\n\n***C. Total\u2019s Claims in the Quantum Phase***\n--------------------------------------------\n\na) *Retroactive Elimination of the Tierra del Fuego Tax Exemption*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***i. Total\u2019s Claims***\n-----------------------\n\n181.\n\nTotal states that \"[b]ased on the Decision, Total is entitled to recover all duties actually paid by Total Austral pursuant to Resolution 776/06 for its exports of LPG, crude oil and natural gas from Tierra del Fuego for the period between 2002 and January 2007 (the date of entry into force of Law 26,217/2007)\".307 As explained in detail in the CL First Report, the total taxes requested from and actually paid by Total Austral on those exports amount to $7,828,000.308\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 173.\n\nCL First Report, ***supra*** note 54, paras. 77 and 151 and Table XVI, relying on Exhibit C-758 (document of the *Administraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos,* Argentina\u2019s Tax Authorities [hereinafter \"AFIP\"] listing all tax requests/ invoices as set forth in Table XVI) and Exhibit C-763. The dates of the various payment requests as listed in Table XVI and shown on each tax liquidation go from 25 October 2006 to 8 January 2007, but actual payment appears to have been made for all the requests on 31 May 2011, the date appearing on Exhibit C-758. This is in accordance with the statements of Total (Total QM, ***supra*** note 5, paras. 174-175) that the domestic judicial challenge by Total Austral which had suspended the payment (as mentioned in para. 442 of the Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1) had been rejected at the last resort on 9 November 2010.\n\n182.\n\nTotal has further stated in its Quantum Memorial that after the conclusion of local proceedings in Argentina concerning the tax request at issue, the Argentine Tax Authorities (\"AFIP\") notified Total Austral in December 2010 of a request for additional taxes potentially amounting to $45 million due under the same Resolution 776/06 for exports from Tierra del Fuego between 2002 and 2006.309 Total relies on the holdings at paragraphs 444 and 468 of the Decision on Liability for opposing such additional request as being in breach of the BIT, and adds: \"While Total does not currently seek any relief from the Tribunal in this regard, it reserves the right to request an order directing Argentina to indemnify Total Austral for the full amount sought by AFIP, plus interest (if any). Total also reserves the right to seek interim relief from the Tribunal in relation to future attempts by the Argentine Government to enforce Resolution 776/06.\"\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 176-177.\n\n183.\n\nFinally, \"based on the Decision, and in particular the reference to incidental costs, Total understands that it is entitled to recover reasonable expenses and fees incurred in connection with the legal proceedings in Argentine courts relating to Resolution 776/06.\" Based on these premises, Total requests an additional US$77,826.43 as compensation equivalent to \"the amount spent to date on costs and fees incurred in connection with proceedings in Argentina between 12 October 2006 and 25 November 2010.\"310\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 178.\n\n***ii. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nArgentina argued in respect of Total\u2019s claim for recovery of retroactive tax payments that Total has suffered no damage from the withholding tax, because Total was able to pass on these taxes to third parties, specifically to the Chilean buyers.311 Argentina submits that such a transfer is common practice in the relations between Argentinean producers and Chilean buyers, as evidenced by contracts made by other producers in Argentina with their Chilean clients. Total therefore should not have suffered any damage. Argentina also relies on the general obligation for Total to mitigate any damages it may have suffered. In respect of this issue, the Tribunal notes that in its Quantum Reply, Total replied that it has been able to pass through only a small part of the withholding tax imposed on natural gas exports to Chile, that is $200,000 pursuant to an agreement with Methanex.312 Total has reduced its claim to recovery of tax paid retroactively under Resolution 776/2006 accordingly.\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 206-215, relying on Exhibits ARA-292 ARA-309 and C-748, concerning Total, but not related to Tierra del Fuego.\n\nSee Total QR, **supra** note 23, paras. 192-195; Exhibit C-722; and CL Second Report, **supra** note 23, para. 139.\n\n185.\n\nIn respect of Total\u2019s claim for costs and procedural expenses of the domestic proceedings instituted to challenge the request of retroactive taxes, Argentina submits that, although the costs had been incurred before the Decision on Liability, Total did not make this claim during the merits phase but only in the *quantum* phase. This claim is therefore inadmissible as having been made too late in the proceedings.313\n\nSee Argentina QR, *supra* note 23, para. 156, where Argentina notes, moreover, that the bills submitted by Total (Exhibit C-759) are addressed to the Consortium, not just to Total.\n\n***iii. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Total\u2019s claim to recover $7,828,000 from Argentina, corresponding to the amount of taxes retroactively imposed on and paid by Total Austral on hydrocarbon exports from Tierra del Fuego, is correctly based on the holding of the Tribunal in paragraph 444 of the Decision on Liability.314 This amount results from the tax documents submitted by Total as identified above.315\n\nPara. 444 of the Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, is reproduced at **supra** para 173.\n\nSee *supra* note 308, Exhibit C- 758.\n\n187.\n\nAs to the exact amount of the claim to be granted, based on the evidence and arguments by the Parties, including those at the *quantum* hearing, the Tribunal is persuaded that Total was only able to pass on $200,000 of the taxes imposed to the buyers. The retroactive imposition of the tax at issue is different from the case of other, later, export contracts, where the issue of who had to bear withholding tax burdens could have been addressed at the time of making the relevant contract. Since the taxes in question here were imposed retroactively in respect of past supplies, it appears that Total could only have transferred this burden by way of an *ex post facto* arrangement subject to the agreement of the purchasers. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this was not likely to occur and, therefore, Total is entitled to damages in the amount of $7,628,000 for this claim.\n\n188.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Total\u2019s claim to recover expenses and legal costs incurred, in whole or in part, by Total Austral relating to the latter challenge of the retroactive taxation before Argentina\u2019s domestic courts, should fail for two reasons. First, this claim is new and comes too late since it was not submitted in the liability phase.316\n\nSuch a claim should have been introduced before the *quantum* phase, see *supra* para. 92 (in relation to Total\u2019s claim as technical operator of TGN), and paras. 160-161 (in respect of Total\u2019s claim as technical operator of HPDA).\n\n189.\n\nFurther, this claim is not covered by the finding in paragraph 442 of the Decision on Liability, where the Tribunal held that should Argentina obtain the additional back taxes it was claiming (and whose payment had been suspended at the time), \"Total would be entitled to recover, as damages, whatever amount Total Austral would have been compelled to pay and any costs incidental thereto.\"317 The Tribunal, at paragraph 443 of the Decision on Liability, rejected moreover Argentina\u2019s defence based on the \"fork in the road\" argument that Total, having chosen to pursue its claim before Argentina\u2019s courts, was barred under Article 8(2) of the BIT from submitting the \"same\" claim in arbitration proceeding under the BIT. The Tribunal has found that the two claims have a different object such that Total\u2019s claim under the BIT is not precluded by the different claim to a tax refund by Total Austral under Argentina\u2019s laws before local courts. Based on the same principle, costs incurred in the domestic proceedings pursued by Total Austral cannot be recovered by Total here.\n\nSee the full quotation at *supra* note 294. By \"incidental costs\" the Tribunal refers to costs incidental to the taxes themselves.\n\n190.\n\nFinally, Total has raised the issue, as mentioned in paragraph 182 above, of an additional request or threat thereof by Argentina\u2019s tax authorities for retroactive taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego based on Resolution 776/06. The Tribunal confirms its holding in paragraphs 442 and 444 of the Decision on Liability that any such request is or would be in breach of Article 3 of the BIT. In its Quantum Memorial, Total stated that \"it reserves the right to request an order directing Argentina to indemnify Total Austral for the full amount sought by AFIP, plus interest (if any). Total also reserved the right to seek interim relief from the Tribunal in relation to future attempts by the Argentine Government to enforce Resolution 776/06.\"318 The Tribunal cannot, for procedural reasons, accept such potential or future requests. Once this Tribunal has issued the present Award, it will have concluded its task and will cease, *\"munere suo functus\".* Accordingly, it will be without jurisdiction to entertain any further claims or requests.319\n\nSee Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 177.\n\nSubject to the power of a tribunal upon request of either party to rectify or interpret its award pursuant to Articles 49(2) and 50 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n191.\n\nBased on the reasons set out above and the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal grants to Total and declares Argentina liable to pay to Total the amount of $7.,628.,OOO320 as compensation for withholding taxes on exports in the period of 2002-2006 from Tierra del Fuego, imposed retroactively in breach of Article 3 of the BIT and paid by Total Austral under Resolution 776/2006.321 The Tribunal also declares that further requests for such additional taxes, if any, would also be in breach of Article 3 of the BIT. Should Total S.A. or Total Austral be compelled to pay any such taxes to Argentina\u2019s tax authorities, Claimant Total S.A. would be entitled to recover any such amount with interest (as determined in Part V here after) under this Award. The Tribunal denies any other claim and defence concerning the issue of retroactive withholding taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego for the period 2002-2006.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted some confusion in the figures submitted by Total and its experts in the *quantum* phase. In Total QM, ****supra**** note 5, para. 173, Total has identified the \"duties actually paid\" and which it is asked to recover as amounting to $7,800,000, which corresponds to the figures of the CL First Report and to the total of the invoices, Exhibit C-758. Total also included interests on this amount, at the WACC of Total Austral, arriving at the figure of $8.1 million as of 31 May 2011. In CL Second Report, ****supra**** note 23, Total\u2019s experts updated the amount of principal and interest as of 30 September 2011 to $8.4 million, reducing it thereafter to $8.2 million, to take into account the transfer of $200,000 to Methanex discussed at ****supra**** para. 186. In Total PHB, ****supra**** note 11, table two, annexed to its PHB, Total claims, however, the amount of \"$8.3 million ($4.8 million plus pre-award interest from the date of loss, at WACC)\". In view of the above, the Tribunal considers that 4.8 is a typo, an error instead of the correct figure of 7.8.\n\nInterest on the above sum will accrue from the date of actual payment (31 May 2011, see *supra* note 308) at the rate determined hereafter in Part V of this Award..\n\nb) *Domestic Sales of Natural Gas 2002-2004*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n***i. Total\u2019s Claim***\n----------------------\n\n192.\n\nIn the relevant paragraphs of the Decision on Liability, quoted above, the Tribunal held that \"...in so far as Argentina has fixed the domestic price of gas below the relevant benchmark without providing for compensation to Total as required by Article 6 of Decree 1589/89, Argentina has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT.\" The Tribunal has specified that \"...the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API was precisely a guarantee to producers of a given minimum price in case of future restrictions.\"322\n\nSee Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 455, quoted above at **supra** para. 177. The relevant provision of Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 (reproduced at para. 354 of the Decision on Liability) is as follows: \"Art. 6. ON EXPORT RESTRICTIONS: In the event the National Executive proceeds to establish restrictions on the exportation of crude petroleum and/or its derivatives, Article 6 of the Law No. 17,319 shall become enforceable, by virtue of which producers, refiners, and exporters shall receive, per product unit, an amount not less than that of petroleum, and derivatives of a similar nature\". In the event of restrictions on the right of free availability [disposal] of gas, the price of a thousand cubic meters (1,000 m3) of gas of nine thousand three hundred calories (9,300 kilocalories) shall not be less than thirty five per cent (35%) of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian Light petroleum of 34\u00b0 API\".\n\n193.\n\nIn paragraph 455 of the Decision on Liability the Tribunal has noted that \"Total does not submit any evidence enabling the Tribunal to gather that the price resulting from the measures was below 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil, 34\u00b0 API. Nor does Argentina give any indication to the Tribunal that the price resulting from the measures was above this benchmark.\" The decision on this issue was therefore postponed to the present *quantum* phase.\n\n194.\n\nIn the *quantum* phase, Total submitted evidence that indeed the benchmark price in the period of 1 May 2002 - 21 April 2004323 was higher (considerably higher) than the average price received by Total in the domestic market at regulated prices. Total has shown that the benchmark oscillated in that period, increasing from $1.40 to $1.80 per Mmbtu, with an average around $1.54 per Mmbtu. By contrast, the domestic sales price was fixed at an average of $0.43 per Mmbtu.324 Total also provided evidence of the quantities of natural gas that it sold in that period at the regulated domestic prices. Finally, in paragraph 184 of its Memorial on Quantum, Total quantified its damages as \"amounting to the difference between the Benchmark Price and the actual price, for all domestic sales of natural gas, multiplied by the volume of gas actually sold by Total Austral into the domestic market\". This difference, which Total claims as damages, amounts to $112.3 million, net of income taxes.\n\nTotal considers these two dates as the relevant dates: 1 May 2002, being \"the commencement of the Government\u2019s unlawful gas price interventions\", and 22 April 2004 as \"the date of entry into force of the 2004 Agreement\", Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 182.\n\nSee Total QM, **supra** note 5, para. 186 and table showing graphically the evolution of the Benchmark Price and average actual price; table at para. 187 showing also the volumes quarterly sold and the difference in revenues. For more details see CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 81-84, Table VII and Graph II. Total points out that as a consequence Total Austral \"received prices that were, on average, 28.2% (or 71.8% below) of the Benchmark Price\", Total QR, *supra* note 23, para. 213.\n\n***ii. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nArgentina has raised three defenses against Total\u2019s claim. In the first place, Argentina says that the benchmark based on the international price of oil was never considered relevant for the fixing of gas prices since the two markets not connected. According to Argentina, \"[t]his Arabian Light benchmark price had already lost any significance already before emergency measures were taken in Argentina\", pointing out that in the relevant period from May 2002 to 2004 the benchmark was on average approximately 300% higher than the gas prices (in pesos) in the Argentine domestic market. According to Argentina, if the gas price is compared with the benchmark price after the issuance of Presidential Decree 1589/89, it is possible to observe, that throughout the 1990s these price trends were totally different, already making it unreasonable to use this comparator.325\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 219 ff and 224-225.\n\n196.\n\nArgentina claims, therefore, that the damages allegedly suffered by Total because of the government\u2019s intervention, which the Tribunal has held in breach of the BIT, cannot be measured by the difference between the benchmark and the actual domestic regulated price. According to Argentina, the benchmark price proposed by the Tribunal, based upon Section 6 of Presidential Decree 1589/89, \"is not applicable\". According to Argentina moreover Total had never invoked in the liability phase the benchmark and its experts had set the but-for price at much lower levels, $1.00 as compared to the benchmark of $1.38.326\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 225, with reference to the LECG Damage Report, *supra* note 115, para. 229 and Graphs VII, and VIII (which, however, set forth pre-2002 prices).\n\n197.\n\nArgentina relies on UBA\u2019s First Valuation Report, which calculates alternative benchmark prices, namely the exploitation cost and reasonable profit margins pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law, and the premises upon which the price path was calculated for the 2004 Agreement. The latter are especially relevant, according to Argentina, because this agreement was voluntarily executed by and between the Government and most gas producers (including Total Austral), and would have allowed producing companies to cover their costs and obtain reasonable profit margins from June 2002 to April 2004.327\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 234.\n\n198.\n\nArgentina concludes that if damages are calculated using the UBA price criteria and the volumes presented by Compass Lexecon, the amount of damages that would result, as calculated by UBA, would amount to US$5,465,436,328\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 235, relying on UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 504- 505.\n\n199.\n\nThe second argument raised by Argentina concerns the existence, at certain times, of \"exceptional circumstances\" which allowed the Executive to delink domestic prices from international prices under Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law.329 This section of the Hydrocarbons Law provides that \"[...] [w]hen international oil prices increase significantly due to exceptional circumstances, they will not be considered for setting the sale price within the domestic market. In that case, domestic prices can be set on the basis of real exploitation costs for the state-owned company, the amortizations that are technically applicable, and a reasonable interest rate on the updated and depreciated investments made by such state-owned company. [...]\". In such cases, according to Argentina, \"if the crude oil price does not serve to fix domestic prices, it can neither serve as a reference to fix prices of gas sale to the domestic market\". According to Argentina, such exceptional circumstances occurred in 2002 and 2003 respectively, due to a strike in the Venezuelan oil industry and the Iraq war.330\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 228, footnote 250, referring to the Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 409, where this argument, previously made by Argentina in the liability phase, is summarized. See also Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, paras. 252-259, setting forth the relevant provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law and of the various decrees of 1989 and 1991 and of the Concession Decree, all referring to Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law. Argentina states that Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law is referred to both in Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 and in Decree 2411/91 [hereinafter \"ReconversionDecree\"].\n\nFor both references see Argentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 228, and Respondent\u2019s Response to Procedural Order No 5, submitted on 14 December 2011 [hereinafter \"Argentina Response to PO No. 5\"].\n\n200.\n\nThe third defence raised by Argentina concerns the volumes relevant to ascertain the damages suffered by Total due to its sales in the domestic market at regulated prices. Argentina submits that only Total\u2019s sales to distributors must be taken into account because Argentina\u2019s intervention on prices concerned only those sales under the terms of the relevant ENARGAS resolutions331 such that the relevant volumes are a fraction of those advanced by Total.332 Finally, Argentina submits that the end date for the calculation of damages is 2 April 2004, the date of the signature of the Price Path Recovery Agreement, and not 21 April 2004, the date of the agreement\u2019s entry into force, as suggested by Total.333\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 216-217, with reference to ENARGAS 2612/2002. These measures and their impact on Argentina\u2019s gas price to consumers are dealt with in para. 368 of the Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1.\n\nUBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 506-512, indicating an average volume of sales to distributors of 31% or 53%, depending on the source of the gas and pointing out that those additional revenues would be subject to taxes/royalties.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 508-510.\n\n201.\n\nIn its Reply on Quantum, Total opposed Argentina\u2019s arguments and defences. Specifically, Total objects to Argentina defining the Benchmark as \"inappropriate\", pointing out that it was set by Argentina\u2019s own law, to which the Decision on Liability has properly and conclusively referred.334 Total also disagrees with the relevance of the 2002 oil sector strike in Venezuela and the 2003 Iraq war and the related reduction in Iraq\u2019s oil production.335\n\nSee Total QR, *supra* note 23, para. 209: \"Moreover, the Decree 1589/1989 remains in force today: if Argentina truly believed that the Benchmark Price was no longer appropriate, it could have modified the law to that effect long ago.\"\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 208 and 218, as to the initial and final relevant dates.\n\n202.\n\nTotal further denies that only sales to distributors336 were affected by the Government\u2019s price intervention and objects to UBA cutting away \"the bulk of the harm caused by Total\" which leads UBA to reduce Total\u2019s damages by $53.4 million.337 Total argues as follows:\n\n*Although ENARGAS Resolution 2612/2002, dated 24 June 2002, specifically suppressed prices for gas distributors, all contracts (including those of large users (industrial users and CNG customers) and power plants) were affected by these pricing measures. Once distributors supplied the market with subsidized gas, Total Austral was forced to match this price for its other customers. Otherwise, buyers would naturally have turned to the distributors to receive the cheaper gas indirectly. As a result, Total Austral was forced to sell gas to gas-fired power plants at suppressed prices - because if Total Austral attempted to raise prices above those set by ENARGAS in Resolution 2612/2002, these customers would have bypassed Total Austral and bought gas directly from the distributors. In addition,* *CAMMESA required power plants to base their reference prices on ENARGAS\u2019s \u2018large user \u2019 category of the Consumer Gas Tariff -meaning that these plants would not buy natural gas at higher prices, \u2018as otherwise they would be exposed to monetary (unrecoverable) losses\u2019. In this way, Argentina\u2019s Treaty Breach distorted the entire domestic gas market, necessarily lowering the price at which Total Austral could sell to all of its customers. \" [Footnotes omitted.]*\n\nAccording to Total, Argentina also fails to take into account \"that the Benchmark Price is a measure for calculating compensation; it does not represent the price of gas in the absence of Argentina\u2019s Treaty Breaches.\"338\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 216-219.\n\nSee *Ibid.,* text and Table at para. 216, based on the CL Second Report, *supra* note 23, para. 149 and Table there.\n\n*lb id.*, paras. 217 and 219 (footnotes omitted).\n\n***iii. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nBefore discussing the merits of the Parties\u2019 position on the issues set out above, the Tribunal recalls that in order to obtain more factual information and clarification of a number of the arguments set out by the Parties in their *quantum* briefs, the Tribunal issued PO No. 5 in which it asked the Parties to address certain specific points in advance of the *quantum* hearing. The Tribunal asked Total: (a) to detail the monthly prices for the natural gas quantities that Total could have exported to Chile if it had not been obliged to redirect them to the domestic market, and (b) to calculate the damages suffered by Total Austral for not having been able to sell those quantities to customers in the Chilean market. The Tribunal asked Argentina: (a) to submit detailed information as to increases of the price of imported crude oil into Argentina, pointing out in what respect they \"increased substantially\" due to \"exceptional circumstances\", and (b) to submit legal or administrative texts evidencing the scope and interpretation of the term \"exceptional circumstances\" in Article 6(3) of the Hydrocarbons Law. The answers of the Parties are referred to below, to the extent they are relevant.\n\n204.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the Parties\u2019 arguments and all of the evidence submitted, including the Parties\u2019 submissions in response to PO No. 5, the Tribunal has concluded, contrary to what Argentina suggests, that the benchmark is an appropriate basis on which to calculate Total\u2019s damages. It is important to underline, as already clarified in the Decision on Liability, that in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the breach by Argentina of the FET Standard (Article 3 of the BIT) relating to the regulation of natural gas domestic prices in 2002 - 2004 does not stem from such regulation or intervention *per se.* The breach consists, rather, in Argentina not having provided the compensation guaranteed in Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 in case of such an intervention, that is, in not having paid to Total Austral the difference between such regulated price and the benchmark as therein defined.339\n\nSee Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 455. The Tribunal clarified there that the breach of Article 3 of the BIT does not consist in Argentina\u2019s non-respect of the price integration obligation *per se,* but in the fact that this constitutes \"an unfair and unreasonable interference with Total\u2019s rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the Concession\". Article 8 of the Concession Decree referred in turn to Article 6 of Decree 1589, see Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 359.\n\n205.\n\nThis being the content of the obligation and the consequences of the breach thereof, it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to substitute the benchmark guaranteed by Argentina\u2019s own legislation with another criterion. Moreover, the evidence submitted in the *quantum* phase, specifically the information submitted by Total in its answer to PO No. 5 concerning the price of natural gas exported to Chile, shows that the free market prices were not so distant from the benchmark.340 This evidence contradicts Argentina\u2019s argument about the irrelevance of the benchmark compared with free market prices for gas.\n\nSee Total PHB, *supra* note 11, para. 66 and the graph set forth there comparing the evolution of the Benchmark to that of other prices.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not see any basis for departing from the use of the benchmark established in Decree 1589/89, as set forth in the Decision on Liability, to measure the compensation that Argentina should have provided under that Decree, as the basis for calculating the damages suffered by Total341\n\nContrary to Argentina\u2019s objection that Total had not invoked the benchmark in the liability phase, Total did so explicitly, notably at para. 714 of Total PHB, ***supra*** note 11. Total considers that the reference to the benchmark in the Decision on Liability is *\"res judicata/* Total PHB, ***supra*** note 11, para. 64. The Tribunal understands this statement to imply that, according to Total, in no case could the Tribunal depart in the Award from its reliance on the benchmark as set forth in the Decision on Liability, ***supra*** note 1. Since the Decision on Liability is not a final award, the Tribunal is of the different opinion that it would not be precluded for good reasons, such as arguments and evidence supplied in the *quantum* phase, not only from clarifying, but also from rectifying any findings made in the Decision on Liability found subsequently defective, subject to respecting the principles of due process. The need to do so does not arise here for the reasons stated above that confirm the Tribunal\u2019s reliance on the benchmark.\n\n207.\n\nThe issues to be resolved in order to determine the *quantum* of Total\u2019s damages are the following:\n\na) the exact period in which the price intervention was in force during the period 2002 - 2004;\n\nb) whether it has been shown, and if so for what period, that prices of imported petroleum increased significantly due to \"extraordinary circumstances\", that might render the reference to the benchmark inapplicable under the relevant regulation;342 and\n\nc) whether all sales by Total Austral in the domestic market, or, instead, only sales to distributors should be taken into account to identify the quantities in respect of which Total was entitled to receive the benchmark price.\n\nSee *supra* para. 199 quoting Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law to this effect.\n\n208.\n\nAs to the first issue, relating to the relevant initial and final dates, Article 2 of the ENARGAS Resolution of 24 June 2002, which established a maximum reference price that distributors could charge for the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff, explicitly provided that this price regulation was effective from 1 May 2002. Therefore, that is the relevant initial date.343 This regulation terminated with the entry into force of the Price Path Recovery Agreement which provided for progressive increases by the SoE of the wellhead price of natural gas applicable to industrial consumers between May 2004 and July 2005, with the aim of liberalising the well-head prices for industrial consumers as of August 2005. This agreement was signed by the gas producers, including Total Austral and the SoE, on 2 April 2004 and was approved by the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investments and Services by Resolution 208/04, dated 21 April 2004 (Exhibit C-208).344 Article 13 of the Agreement provides, in fact, that its entry into force was subject to the approval within thirty days by the Ministry. From the above, the Tribunal deduces that the Agreement entered into force on the day of its approval by the Ministry, that is, on 21 April 2004. The relevant period is therefore the one from 1 May 2002 to 21 April 2004.345\n\nSee Exhibit C-155 and Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 368.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 456 and fn. 633.\n\nSince the Tribunal was in doubt before the *quantum* hearing on whether the correct final date was 2 April or 21 April 2004, pursuant to the questions posed to Total in PO No. 7, Total\u2019s experts have calculated the damages suffered by Total also up to 2 April 2004 (based on the total quantities of gas sold domestically by Total Austral in this period), indicating an amount of $108.3 million, instead of $112.0 million set forth in Total QM, ***supra*** note 5 and in CL First Report, ***supra*** note 54. See CL Response to PO No. 7, ***supra*** note 92, para. 38 and monthly data at Table X there.\n\n209.\n\nThe second issue, relates to whether there were extraordinary circumstances which would render the benchmark inapplicable. The response provided by Argentina to the question addressed to it in PO No. 5, was not clear, nor persuasive with respect to the evolution of the price of imported oil or the extraordinary nature of the circumstances alleged.346 The effects of the strike in the oil sector in Venezuela around the end of 2002 to which Argentina referred347 are not evident from the graph of the evolution of oil prices in Argentina, even assuming that the strike was an \"extraordinary\" event, that is out of the ordinary and normal course of business.\n\nSee the Excel Table at Argentina Response to PO No. 5, **supra** note 330, at No. 19 \"Precios de Importacion de Crudos\". In Argentina PHB, **supra** note 28, para. 82, Argentina relied on the generic statements of its witness, Portnoy, quantum hearing, Day 3, 576:4-6.\n\nSee UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, para. 471 and fn. 117, which refers to a \"Monthly Oil Market Report\" of the International Energy Agency of 17 January 2003. See \"Highlights\" Section at www.omrpublic.iea.org. This report mentions the loss of supply due to the \"crippling strike in Venezuela\" but without indications as to the effect on prices.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal finds otherwise in respect of the relevance of the war in Iraq, whose military operations lasted formally from 19 March to 1 May 2003 but whose outbreak was anticipated sometime before. On the one hand, such a war is undoubtedly an extraordinary event. On the other hand, the price data and graphs submitted by Total and its experts show a marked peak in oil prices in the months of February - April 2003, followed by a rapid descent back to previous average values of the period.348 The Tribunal considers therefore that this increase is attributable to an extraordinary circumstance. This does not mean however that those two months must be simply excluded from the calculation of Total damages because Argentina would have no obligation to compensate producers during that period.349 Section 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides for the exception in case that \"...the prices of imported petroleum increase significantly due to exceptional circumstances\". Section 6 also provides that where such significant increases and exceptional circumstances exist, then the prices of imported petroleum shall not be used for the setting of prices in the domestic market. It goes on to state that \"...in such case, domestic prices can be set on the basis of the real exploitation costs of the state owned company, the amortizations that are technically applicable and a reasonable rate on the updated and depreciated investments made by such state owned company...\".350 Rather, Argentina had the option of setting a price based on different costs incurred by the relevant state enterprise, etc. In the absence of information from the Parties on these alternative criteria,351 and on the evidence available, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to use as benchmark price for a period of two months the average prices of January and May 2003.\n\nAccording to Total QM, ***supra*** note 5, graph at para. 186, prices started to grow markedly in December 2002, peaked in February 2003, and were back at pre-increase levels in May 2003, see also CL Response to PO No. 7, ***supra*** note 92, Table X detailing the monthly average benchmark price. See also the graph at para. 66 of Total PHB, ***supra*** note 11. This graph shows that oil prices increased much more in subsequent years, starting from the beginning of 2005, but such subsequent evolution is not at issue in the present dispute.\n\nThe damages to be excluded (and to be replaced by an average) result from the monthly data of Table XVII at para. 157 of CL First Report, **supra** note 54 (based on the total volumes sold by Total Austral on the domestic market). They amount to $4,436,000 for March 2003 and $3,259,000 for April 2003, together $7,695,000, out of a total claim for 2002-2004 of $112.3 million as mentioned at **supra** para. 162.\n\nFor the full text of Art.6 of the Hydrocarbon Law see Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 348.\n\nWhen the Hydrocarbon Law was enacted in 1967, YPF was the state-owned company in the hydrocarbon sector that was later privatized. The references provided for in the Hydrocarbon Law appear therefore to be unusable in respect of the exceptional circumstances of 2003.\n\n211.\n\nIn respect of the third issue, the volumes of Total Austral\u2019s sales of gas to be taken into account to calculate the compensation due to Total Austral, the Parties advanced their respective evidence and opposing arguments forcefully in their **quantum** briefs and at the **quantum** hearings. As mentioned above at paragraph 203, Total claims that although ENARGAS Resolution 2612/2002 of 24 June 2002 (retroactively effective since 1 May 2002), specifically suppressed prices payable by gas distributors. All contracts (including those with large users and power plants) were affected by these pricing measures. Once distributors supplied the market with subsidized gas, Total Austral was forced to match this price for its other customers. Total claims, therefore, that Argentina must pay as damages the difference between the benchmark and the actual regulated price for all domestic sales of Total Austral in the relevant period.352\n\nSee *supra* para. 176. ENARGAS Resolution 24/2002 is Exhibit C-155.\n\n212.\n\nArgentina opposes this argument both legally, since only sales to distributors were subject to the official price intervention in the relevant ENARGAS resolutions, and factually.353 Argentina claims that Total was able to sell to clients other than distributors at higher prices. At the *quantum* hearing, invoices of sales filed by Total were submitted, discussed and commented on by the Parties\u2019 respective experts.354 While Argentina and its experts considered that there was evidence of price differentiation, Total and its experts attributed any such difference (which, in their view, is only minor and occasional) to other factors such as transport costs.\n\nSee Argentina QCM, ***supra*** note 6, paras. 216-217; Argentina QR, ***supra*** note 23, para. 172 and UBA Second Valuation Report, ***supra*** note 23, paras. 357-358, 364-365 and Annex III.\n\nSee Exhibit C-806, comprising more than 3,000 invoices; *quantum* hearing, Transcripts, Day 2, 493, 507, and 559; Day 3, 699 (Abdala, Spiller, Portnoy).\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that this dilemma is to be solved legally, focusing on the content of the obligation that Argentina had undertaken, the measures taken by Argentina, which breached that obligation and the consequences of its non-compliance therewith, which resulted in a BIT breach, in order to determine the damages thereby caused to Total.\n\n214.\n\nAs concluded in the Decision on Liability, Argentina is liable for not having made good to Total the difference between the regulated domestic price and the Benchmark price which had been guaranteed in case of restrictions imposed to the \"free availability [disposal]\" of gas (as to price and quantities) by virtue of the Deregulation Decrees of 1989.355 As stated above in paragraph 204: \"the breach by Argentina of the FET standard (Article 3 of the BIT) relating to the regulation of natural gas domestic prices in 2002 - 2004 does not stem from such regulation or intervention *per se.* The breach consists rather in Argentina not having provided the compensation guaranteed in Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 in case of such an intervention, that is, in not having paid to Total Austral the difference between such regulated price and the Benchmark as therein defined.\"\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 454- 455.\n\n215.\n\nIt is undisputed that the intervention by ENARGAS\u2019 Resolution of 24 June 2002 established a maximum reference price that distributors could charge for the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff, thus requiring producers to limit their sale price to distributors accordingly.356 Given that the measure of Argentina at issue (which represents the \"restriction on the free availability [disposal] of gas\" giving rise to the price guarantee at issue) is directed only to distributors, whose tariffs were subject to regulated prices,357 the price guarantee of Argentina operates only in respect of sales to distributors whose price was compressed below the benchmark. Since by not complying with this obligation Argentina has breached its obligations under Article 3 of the BIT, Argentina must pay as compensation to Total the corresponding amount in respect of sales to distributors only. The obligation was not that of making good all losses that gas producers may have suffered in respect of other sales, even if indirectly due to the depressed price they had to charge to distributors, as Total claims.\n\n*Ibid..* para. 368: \"Then commencing in May 2002, ENARGAS established a maximum reference price distributors could charge for the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tarff. The effect of this measure was to freeze the level of the Consumer Gas Tariff at the same level than in 2001, but pesified,\" referencing the various ENARGAS Resolutions including 2612/2002, fn. 498\n\nSee the text of Resolution 2612/2002, pp. 2-3, 5, and 9 referring to *\"las Reglas B\u00e1sicas de la Licencia de* *Distribuci\u00f3n... los Cuadros Tarifarios propuestos por dicha Distribuidora......las partes convocadas son* *Licenciatarias de distribuci\u00f3n de gas natural... las Distribuidoras ratificaron las presentaciones en su respectivos expedientes, y en el conjunto con los transportistas tambi\u00e9n presentes en la sala, hicieron una petici\u00f3n acerca que deb\u00eda generalizarse un aumento equivalente*para los segmentos regulados de las tarifas, es decir transporte v distribuci\u00f3n... \" (emphasis added).\n\n216.\n\nThe fact that Total Austral may have had to sell to its other clients at similar prices because of the gas market structure is thus not the consequence of Argentina not having paid such compensation in breach of its guarantee but rather the effect of a market situation for which Argentina is not liable. The characterisation of these losses as indirect or rather consequential damages and the discussion whether the breach of the treaty standard entails, as a breach of an international obligation, compensation for only direct losses (as Argentina submits), or also for indirect losses (as Total submits, claiming that they were an inevitable consequence of Argentina\u2019s action) is therefore irrelevant in the Tribunal\u2019s view, because of the specific content of the substantive primary obligation that Argentina had undertaken.358 An \"a contrario\" argument confirms this conclusion: had Argentina been willing to provide the price difference in accordance with Decree 1589/89 it should have done so only in respect of sales subject to restrictions, that is those of the distributors subject to regulated tariffs. If Argentina had done so, Argentina would not have breached Article 3 of the BIT. Also in such a situation the non-regulated prices might have aligned themselves to the compressed regulated prices, but Argentina would have committed no breach Article 3 of the BIT. In conclusion, the Tribunal is called to determine the amount of sales that Total Austral made to the distributors from 1 May 2002 to 21 April 2004. In response to Argentina\u2019s challenge of its approach,359 Total supplied various break-downs of Total Austral\u2019s sales by types of clients and different data as to the percentage of its sale to distributor and the volumes thereof.360 According to its report annexed to Total\u2019s Quantum Reply, CL\u2019s previous calculation of damages amounting to $112.3 million, based on total sales, is reduced by $53.4 million if only sales to distributors are taken into account, thus resulting in a loss of $58.4 million.361 In their presentation at the *quantum* hearing, Total\u2019s experts projected and distributed a slide indicating that sales to distributors amounted to 36.1% of all Total Austral domestic sales in the relevant period.362 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Total mentions instead that sales to distributor were approximately 25% of Total Austral\u2019s overall sales.363\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal considers that the losses incurred by Total (Total Austral) in respect of sales to others than the distributors, due to the market prices having aligned themselves to those to the distributors which were subject to the ENARGAS regulation, might be labelled as indirect or consequential. As such they would not be covered by the international obligation of compensation, see ILC *Draft Articles on State Responsibility,* Comment to Article 31, para. 13.; I. Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* 2009, pp. 304-305; S. Alexandrov and J Robins, *Proximate Causation in Investment Disputes,* YB on Inti Investment L & Pol, 2008-9, p. 321.\n\nSee UBA First Valuation Report, *supra* note 63, paras. 364-365.\n\nSee CL Second Report, *supra* note 23, para. 149, Table VIII: \"Differences in Domestic Volumes Subject to the Breach (UBA and CL)\" based on Exhibit C-788 (Excel Worksheet \"Reconciliation\") with yearly breakdown and comparisons of total sales with sales to distributors. The figures submitted by Argentina are slightly different from those of Total\u2019s experts; see UBA\u2019s slides 7-11, *quantum* hearing of 21 December 2011.\n\nSee CL Second Report, *supra* note 23, para. 149.\n\nDirect Testimony by M. Abdala and P. Spiller, 19-21 December, 2011, Slide 4.\n\nTotal PHB, *supra* note 11, para. 70.\n\n217.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the different calculations presented by Total, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to rely on the data of the slide presented at the hearing, which presents the clearer and more detailed calculation. Moreover, that slide sets forth intermediate values among those submitted by Total. As mentioned above, the share of sales going to distributors is set forth there as being 36.1% of total gas sales to the domestic market. Total Austral\u2019s total sales from 1 May 2002 to 21 April 2004 were $112.3 million;364 averaging the losses for two months between February and April 2003, as explained above at paragraph 210, the value of the loss in respect of the benchmark for all sales of Total Austral in the period amount to $109.2 million. The amount of losses for sales to distributors, due to Argentina not implementing its guaranteed benchmark price, amounts thus to **$43 million**  (36.1% of $109.2 million). This is the amount of damages, as of April 2004, owed by Argentina to Total on account of the price intervention without the payment of the compensation up to the benchmark price in breach of Article 3 of the BIT, as explained in the preceding paragraphs.365\n\nSee CL Response to PO No. 7, **supra** note 92, annexed to Total PHB, **supra** note 11, Table II.\n\nSince this amount of damages corresponds to the compensation that Argentina should have paid to Total Austral and not to an income, this amount is not subject to any deduction for royalties payments.\n\n**Individual Opinion under** **Article**  **48(4)**  **of the**  **ICSID**  **Convention** **(Dissent) by Arbitrator Henri Alvarez in respect of paragraphs**  **213 - 217**  **concerning the volume of saled to be considered in order to determine damages to to Total.**\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Argentina breached the FET Standard when it passed ENARGAS Resolutions Nos. 2612/2002 and 2614/2002 and subsequent related resolutions (the \"ENARGAS Resolutions\") and failed to pay compensation to reach the minimum benchmark price provided for in the regulatory framework in the event of restrictions on the free disposal of gas. The ENARGAS Resolutions limited the price that distributors could charge to their domestic customers (the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff). The majority has concluded that damages for the Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET Standard by fixing the domestic price of gas is limited to damages flowing from Total Austral\u2019s sales to distributors on the basis that the relevant ENARGAS Resolutions applied only to the price that distributors could charge to their customers. The majority has also refused to award damages for losses suffered by Total Austral on sales to industrial and commercial users and power plants stating that these were indirect or consequential damages.\n\n219.\n\nMr. Alvarez disagrees with both of these conclusions. In his view, the ENARGAS Resolutions interfered generally with the right of free disposal of gas and clearly and foreseeably caused the suppression of the price of all domestic sales of gas in the relevant period from 1 May 2002 to 21 April 2004. By freezing the reference price that distributors could charge for the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff, ENARGAS predictably and effectively suppressed all sale prices in Argentina\u2019s regulated gas market and thereby interfered with Total Austral\u2019s right to freely dispose of the natural gas it produced.\n\n220.\n\nAt paragraphs 204, 214 and 216 above, the majority states that the freezing of the well-head price was not, *per se,* the breach. For the reasons described in Mr. Alvarez\u2019s Individual Opinion attached to the Decision on Liability (at paragraphs 72-103 and 109), Mr. Alvarez is of the opinion that the ENARGAS Resolutions were in violation of the broad right of free disposal of natural gas provided for in the regulatory framework (including the Deregulation Decrees, Reconversion Decree, *Acta Acuerdo* and Conversion Decree) and did not fall within the narrowly-defined limitations of this right contemplated in Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law and the subsequent Decrees. As a result, according to Mr. Alvarez, the Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET Standard was not limited to a failure to pay the minimum bench-mark price provided for in Article 6 of Decree 1589/89, but, rather, was the much broader underlying breach consisting of freezing the well-head price component of the Consumer Gas Tariff in violation of the right of free disposal of gas provided for in the regulatory framework.\n\n221.\n\nArticle 6 of Decree 1589/89 simply provided a minimum price for gas (the \"Benchmark Price\") in the event of restrictions on the free disposal of gas. However, this provision does not address the circumstances in which restrictions on the fundamental right of free disposal may be permitted. This right is provided for and guaranteed in other parts of the regulatory framework. Further, Article 6 of Decree 1589/89 does not limit the application of the minimum price it sets for sales to distributors or any other specific category of purchasers, but refers in general terms to the minimum price for natural gas.\n\n222.\n\nIn Mr. Alvarez\u2019s view, the evidence was clear that Total Austral was unable to sell natural gas in the domestic market at prices higher than those fixed for consumers because of the freezing of the well-head component of the Consumer Gas Tariff applicable to distributors. As a result, all of Total Austral\u2019s sales and contracts, including those with industrial and commercial users and power plants were affected by the measure. Once the distributors supplied the market with gas at the low, subsidized price, Total was required to match that price for all of its other customers. Otherwise, the customers would simply have turned to the distributors and purchased the gas at the cheaper price from the distributors. The evidence was clear and persuasive that all of Total Austral\u2019s contracts and natural gas prices in the relevant period from 2002 through to 2004 were similar and very low. The effect on all prices was recognized by, amongst others, a study in 2003 commissioned by the SoE (Exhibit ARA-233) and the 2004 Price Path Recovery Agreement and implementing decree (Exhibit C-208), which recognized the need to liberalize and restore prices for a wide range of gas consumers, including industrial users (see the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability at paragraph 456). Mr. Alvarez is of the view that this confirms that the Respondent\u2019s measures controlling the well-head price in sales to distributors clearly affected the price to the entire domestic market, including industrial users and power generators which were significant customers of Total Austral.\n\n223.\n\nThe relationship between fixing the prices to distributors and consumers and the effect this had on other (industrial and commercial) consumers in the domestic market is evident and was foreseeable. This was reviewed convincingly in detail by Total\u2019s experts. ENARGAS did not need to regulate expressly for the entire market when all that was required was to regulate the key well-head price component in the Consumer Gas Tariff for sales to distributors and the market would dictate all other domestic prices in a form of \"regulatory arbitrage\". Thus, in Mr. Alvarez\u2019s view, the ENARGAS Resolutions were the foreseeable, proximate cause of the loss suffered by Total Austral on all of its sales of gas in the domestic market during the relevant period.\n\n224.\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Alvarez does not agree with the majority when it considers that the losses incurred by Total Austral and the respective sales to customers other than distributors should be labelled as indirect or consequential and, therefore, not available. The relevant obligation at international law is to make full reparation so as to wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would have existed had it not been committed. In his view, the damages flowing from the effect of the ENARGAS Resolutions on the entire domestic market have been proven and are properly compensable at international law. Accordingly, Mr. Alvarez considers that Total was entitled to damages covering the losses suffered by Total Austral on all its gas sales in the domestic market between 1 May 2002 to 21 April 2004, measured by the difference in the actual sales price and the Benchmark Price during that period. **(End of Individual Opinion of Mr. Henri Alvarez)**\n\nc) *Domestic Sales of Natural Gas 2004-2006*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n***i. Total\u2019s Claim***\n----------------------\n\n225.\n\nIn the liability phase in this proceeding, Total complained that Argentina by not having fully implemented the Price Path Recovery Agreement of 2004-2006 had further breached Article 3 of the BIT.366 The Tribunal rejected Total\u2019s argument that any breach of this agreement would entitle Total to rely on the benchmark price, since Total has not challenged the validity of this agreement. The Tribunal has concluded on this point in paragraph 457 of the Decision on Liability as follows \"[t]he Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Total\u2019s right to invoke the 35% of the international price per cubic meter of Arabian light oil (34\u00b0 API) standard of compensation concerns the period from June 2002 to April 2004. Further details, including the relevance, if so, of Argentina not having fully implemented the Price Path Recovery Agreement, as Total complains, should be left to the quantum phase.\"\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 371, 390 and 457.\n\n226.\n\nDuring the *quantum* phase, Total argued that it is entitled to damages arising out of Argentina\u2019s failure to fully implement the terms of the 2004 Price Path Recovery Agreement. This agreement was intended to implement a return to free market pricing by progressive increases of the well-head price of natural gas, first as to industrial and other large consumers and later as to residential and small commercial consumers.367 Total complains specifically that the Government failed to implement the Price Path Recovery Agreement by unilaterally increasing the volumes required to be sold to the local market at regulated prices in excess of the volumes established in the Agreement.368 As a result, Total says that it was prevented from enjoying the liberalisation of prices that had been granted by the Price Path Recovery Agreement and required to redirect volumes destined for free market sales (including for export) through the imposition of \"Additional Injection Requirements\" on the gas producers.369 Total argues that this amounts to a breach of the FET Standard guaranteed under Article 3 of the BIT based on the same reasoning that has led the Tribunal to find a breach of this provision in relation to Argentina\u2019s interference with gas prices in 2002-2004.370\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 456.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 192 ff.\n\nFor a description of these interventions, see Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, paras. 373-378 referring to Resolutions 659/2005, Exhibit C-215 and 752/2005, Exhibit C-497.\n\nSee Total QM, **supra** note 5, paras. 202-204. See also Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, para. 378.\n\n227.\n\nTotal claims that the damages it suffered are appropriately measured as the difference between the actual depressed price at which Total Austral was compelled to sell the additional quantities and the benchmark price. Based on detailed data of quarterly volumes of gas so affected, Total claims a cumulative loss of $28.2 million as of the end of 2006.371\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 212 and the table there, based on CL First Report, **supra** note 54, paras. 158-164 and Tables XVII and XIX.\n\n***ii. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nArgentina denies Total\u2019s claim. According to Argentina (a) it was entitled to require the injection of additional quantities of gas for sale in the domestic market at regulated prices under the Price Path Recovery Agreement, and (b) Total had in any case accepted to deliver more gas at the agreed price, since it complied with the request without availing itself of the right to resolve the Price Path Recovery Agreement by invoking the alleged breach pursuant to the terms of the Price Path Recovery Agreement.372\n\nArgentina\u2019s QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 236-242.\n\n***iii. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nBoth objections raised by Argentina appear to the Tribunal to be without merit. The Price Path Recovery Agreement did not permit the unilateral additional requests that Argentina implemented by way of Resolutions 659/2005 and 752/2005.373 Argentina thereby retreated from its contractual commitment pursuant to which it had promised a return to normality, with agreed modalities, from the previous situation of 2002 - 2004. This situation, as Total has described was \"unsustainable from the gas producing companies\u2019 point of view and were incapable of allowing producers to receive an acceptable rate of return.\"374 In the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that Argentina should have remedied this situation by honouring the guarantee it had given that in the event of restriction of the right of free disposal of gas, the price would not be less than the Benchmark.\n\nSee Agreement, Exhibit C-208, specifically Article 10. Nor is rescinding the agreement by Total Austral (which would have entailed further negative consequences for it) a precondition for Total being able to invoke the protection of the BIT.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 455.\n\n230.\n\nAfter Argentina had set up, in April 2004, the Price Path Recovery Agreement to progressively allow the return to market prices in the gas market, a unilateral return to the previous depressed price situation, in breach of the terms of the 2004 Price Path Recovery Agreement, amounts necessarily to a breach of the FET Standard to which Total was entitled under the BIT. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina did breach Article 3 of the BIT by requiring additional quantities at the below-market prices of the Price Path Recovery Agreement.\n\n231.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is of the view that the ensuing damages should not be calculated on the basis of the Benchmark. As stated in paragraph 457 of the Decision on Liability, the 2004 Price Path Recovery Agreement set up a new mechanism for the gas regime, as to prices and market liberalization. Above the sales at (still) regulated prices of certain quantities, the 2004 Price Path Recovery Agreement rendered sales at a free market price possible, both domestically and within the export market. Damages stemming from the breach by Argentina of the Price Path Recovery Agreement cannot be based on a \"guaranteed benchmark price\" any more but must be therefore calculated as the difference between the price Total would have obtained on the free market, and the lower price which it was compelled to accept in respect of the redirected quantities.\n\n232.\n\nFollowing the discussion of the proper valuation method for the damages arising under the Price Path Recovery Agreement at the *quantum* hearing, the Tribunal asked Total to submit a calculation of damages based on this alternative method. Total\u2019s experts supplied this calculation and re-determined the damages as amounting to **$8.4 million** for the period from April 2004 to 31 December 2006.375 The Tribunal considers the underlying figures to be correct and, for the above reasons, concludes that this amount represents the damages suffered by Total during the period from 2004 to 2006, and that must be compensated by Argentina, with interest from 1 January 2007.\n\nSee CL Response to PO No. 7, *supra* note 92, paras. 39-42 and Table XI.\n\n233.\n\nFinally, in its Quantum Memorial, Total claimed damages in general terms for the period after the expiration of the 2004 Agreement, from the end of 2006 to the date of the Award.376 It is uncontested that after the expiration of the 2004 Agreement at the end of 2006 a new agreement replaced it.377 Total complained in its Quantum Memorial that Argentina has continued to intervene in domestic gas prices in disregard of this latest agreement. Later in the proceedings, however, Total stated that it does not seek damages under the 2007 Agreement, that is for the period after 31 December 20 06.378 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Total accordingly limited its claim up to 31 December 2006 and has not made any claim for damages for the subsequent period of time.379\n\nSee Total QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 182(c), pp. 213-224.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 223 and 224, Exhibits ARA-269 and C-739 (\"The 2007-2011 Agreement with Natural Gas Producers\").\n\nTotal QR, *supra* note 23, para. 225.\n\nTotal PHB, *supra* note 11, Section VB3.\n\n234.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is not required to decide on damages that Total may have suffered after the end of 2006, nor, preliminarily, whether Argentina has committed any breach of the BIT by its conduct in respect of the 2007 Agreement, since such a claim is not before it. However, the Tribunal notes that Total has reserved the right to make additional submissions, including a request for interim relief, if necessary, in light of Argentina\u2019s conduct in relation to the conditions in the domestic market.380 For the same reasons spelled out in paragraph 190 in respect of a similar reservation by Total concerning any future imposition by Argentina of further retroactive taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego, the Tribunal must decline any such reservation. Once the Tribunal has issued its award it will have concluded its task and its jurisdiction will cease so that it would be impossible for it to entertain any further claims or requests.\n\nTotal QR, *supra* note 23, para. 225.\n\nd) *Argentina\u2019s Limitations o**f*  *Gas Exports (Interference with Gas Export Contracts)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***i. Total\u2019s Claim***\n----------------------\n\n235.\n\nTotal relies on the Decision on Liability at paragraphs 460-461, where the Tribunal stated that \"...the measures by which Argentina has specifically interfered with Total\u2019s gas export contracts that had been duly authorised by Argentina\u2019s authorities are in breach of Total\u2019s rights under the BIT\", such that \"Total is entitled in any case to be compensated by Argentina for its loss of reasonably expected profits under these contracts.\" As to the calculation of the amount of damages, Total relies on the finding in the Decision on Liability that damages should be calculated \"...based on the difference between the domestic prices it received for the gas redirected and sold in the domestic market and the export prices agreed in export contracts\".\n\n236.\n\nAs to the contracts affected, Total refers to the description of the factual situation complained of by it in paragraph 458 of the Decision on Liability. Total claims that the \"Gas Rationing Program\" measures that Argentina enacted commencing in March 2004, SoE Resolutions 659/04 and 752/2005,381 compelled Total Austral to redirect natural gas originally destined for export to Chile to specific consumers in the domestic market at prices well below the agreed export price. As a consequence, Total Austral was prevented from complying with duly authorized export contracts it had entered into with various Chilean companies.382\n\nResolution 257/2004 and Disposition 27/04, see Decision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 458.\n\nSee Decision on Liability, **supra** note 1, paras. 378 and 458, Total QM, **supra** note 5, paras. 231 and 232.\n\n237.\n\nTotal\u2019s experts calculated the volume of gas redirected and the difference between the agreed export prices and those obtained on the domestic market (as indicated in paragraph 460 of the Decision on Liability) for the relevant period from 2004 to 2006, during which the relevant Resolutions and Dispositions were in force.383 With respect to the export prices, these calculations distinguish between the various contracts affected, and take into account: the different prices agreed therein; the export curtailments under the various measures of restriction; and the monthly volumes curtailed. As for the domestic prices, the regulated price of about US$1.03 per Mmbtu (against agreed monthly export prices between $1.46/Mmbtu and $1.89/Mmbtu) are used. The difference, net of a 12% royalty and 35% income tax, amounts to $2.4 million as of 31 December 2006.384\n\nSee CL First Report, *supra* note 54, paras. 165-175.\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 238 based on CL First Report, **supra** note 54, para. 175, Table XXI.\n\n238.\n\nIn addition to this amount, Total also claims indemnification for legal fees and costs in the amount of $381,454 incurred by Total Austral. These fees and costs were incurred for the litigation between Total Austral and the Chilean buyers arising from the failure to deliver the agreed volumes of gas redirected pursuant to the measures.385 Total justifies this request on the basis that these costs are \"incidental\" to the damages arising from Argentina\u2019s Treaty breach.386\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, paras. 240-242; Total PHB, **supra** note 11, para. 82.\n\nTotal reserves the right to claim further damages including interim and injunctive relief \"to the extent that Argentina continues to interfere with Total Austral\u2019s Export Contracts in the future\", Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 243.\n\n***ii. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nArgentina opposes Total\u2019s claims based primarily on two arguments, First, Argentina argues that the authorizations to export gas were subject to the condition that additional quantities of gas, above the daily amounts authorized, needed to supply the domestic market, could be redirected to that market.387 Argentina submits that the export volumes curtailed and redirected were indeed additional volumes subject to that provision. Second, Argentina objects that Total did not provide evidence of the domestic contracts it entered into in respect of the redirected sales and, therefore, did not meet its burden of proof.388\n\nSee Argentina QCM, **supra** note 6, para. 251, Argentina QR, **supra** note 23, paras. 186-190.\n\nSee Argentina QCM, **supra** note 6, paras. 249-262; Argentina QR, **supra** note 23, paras. 191-195.\n\n***iii. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in the Decision on Liability it found that export limitations to ensure domestic supply of gas as well as gas export taxes were generally lawful.389 Only interference with duly authorized export contracts in force was held to be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligations of Article 3 of the BIT.390\n\nDecision on Liability, *supra* note 1, para. 459.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 460.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the parameters used by Total in the *quantum* phase to calculate its damages correctly reflect the findings and indications set forth in the Decision on Liability. Total gave detailed evidence of the duly authorized contracts in force which Total Austral was prevented from performing, the volumes involved, the time period during which its export contracts were affected by the various measures issued by Argentinean authorities, as well as the relevant price differences. This information formed the basis of the damages calculations performed by Total\u2019s experts.391\n\nSee *supra* para. 237.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Argentina\u2019s arguments that the quantities involved in the redirection to the domestic market were \"surplus\" quantities that Argentina was authorized to curtail in respect of authorized contracts.392 Nor does the Tribunal find that it was necessary for Total to supply evidence of the details of the individual domestic buyers and sales, since the sales values were duly proved and the domestic prices were regulated. Therefore, the Tribunal grants Total\u2019s claim for damages due to Argentina\u2019s interference with gas export contracts of Total Austral in the amount of **$2.4 million** as of 31 December 2006.\n\nIn PO No. 3, the Tribunal noted that Argentina would be able to challenge the data supplied by Total relying on the data of exports to Chile, in its possession, in the relevant period. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s request for a production order directed at Total. See also CL Second Report, *supra* note 23, paras. 229-231.\n\n243.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal denies Total\u2019s claim for indemnification of legal fees borne by Total Austral in respect of litigation initiated by its Chilean clients because of the forced non-performance of its export contracts. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this claim was submitted too late as it was presented only in the *quantum* phase and is thus inadmissible.393 In addition, Total\u2019s reservation to make further requests to the Tribunal must be denied for the reasons spelled out above in respect of similar reservations as to other claims made by Total pertaining to future tax measures.394 Once the Tribunal has issued its award it will have concluded its task such that it will be impossible for it to entertain any further claims or requests.\n\nTotal refers to Total RM Merits, *****supra***** note 136, fn. 339. Total refers there to potential penalties it might incur for breach of contract of Total Austral\u2019s contracts with its Chilean clients, but no reference to (possible) litigation and no reservation for litigation costs are found there. Total refers in Total QM, *****supra***** note 5, para. 242 as a basis for this claim the mention in the Decision on Liability of \"incidental costs\" with reference to taxes for operation in Tierra del Fuego, see Decision on Liability, *****supra***** note 1, para. 442. By \"incidental costs\" the Tribunal refers, however, to costs incidental to the taxes themselves as explained in *****supra***** note 317. In respect of this claim the Tribunal refers to and relies on the reasons given above at *****supra***** paras. 188-189 for rejecting the similar claim by Total in respect of Total Austral\u2019s litigation costs concerning the Tierra del Fuego tax issue.\n\nSee *supra* para. 190.\n\n244.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons spelled out above, the Tribunal decides that Total is entitled to recover from Argentina the following damages caused to it by Argentina for breach of the FET Standard under Article 3 of the BIT in respect to Total\u2019s investments in Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons (Oil and Gas):\n\na) retroactive elimination of the Tierra del Fuego Tax Exemption: **$7,628 million** as of 31 May 2011;\n\nb) measures relating to the domestic sale of natural gas from 2002 to 2004: **$43 million** as of 30 April 2004;\n\nc) measures relating to the domestic sale of natural gas from 2004 to 2006: **$8.4 million** as of 31 December 2006; and\n\nd) limitation of gas exports (interference with gas export contracts): **$2.4 million** as of 31 December 2006.\n\nFor a total of **$61,428 million.**\n\n**V. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n***A. Total\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn respect of interest, Total underlines, as recalled above, that interest \"is an integral component of full compensation under international law\" when payment of compensation is delayed. Total claims both \"pre-award\" interest from the date of valuation for each loss, which corresponds to that of Argentina\u2019s relevant breach, and \"post-award\" interest. The latter is meant to compensate Total for the additional loss incurred from the date of the Tribunal\u2019s award to the date of final payment.395 As to the rate of interest to be applied, Total distinguishes between compensation in relation to investments that Total does not own any more (that is the two electricity generators Central Puerto and HPDA), for which Total proposes in its Post-Hearing Brief a \"commercial risk-free pre-award interest rate\" of 3.69% and in relation to the other investments, that Total continues to own (TGN and Total Austral). Total justifies requesting higher interest in respect of these latter two investments because \"Total continues to bear the various risks in connection with these assets, and should be compensated accordingly for having been deprived of associated funds over time\".396 According to Total, the WACC of TGN and Total Austral (respectively 11.01% and 10.92% p.a.) should be used because \"(a) the WACC reflects each company\u2019s real cost of raising funds; and (b) Total continues to own and operate these assets, and remains subject to the operational risks inherent in each business\".397\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 45- 67.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 50-51, Total PHB, *supra* note 11, para. 89.\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 52. Total specifically claims that an award of interest at the WACC for TGN and Total Austral is essential to avoid what it labels as \"the impermissible \"round trip\" embedded in UBA\u2019s calculations, using a high discount rate to bring cash flows back to a valuation date several years in the past, and then actualizing damages to the present at a much lower interest rate\", Total PHB, **supra** note 11, paras. 92 and 26. Total QR, supra note 23, paras. 59-67.\n\n246.\n\nTotal claims \"compound interest\" on all pre- and post-award interest (also defined as pre- and post-judgment interest), explaining that this approach is \"consistent with economic reality\". Total points to the fact that \"the majority of recent investor-State arbitration tribunals have awarded compound interest on awards of damages, confirming the legitimacy and necessity (in appropriate circumstances) of compounding as an element of full reparation for violations of international law\".398\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, paras. 60-63. Total proposes compounding on an annual basis, *ibid.,* para. 65.\n\n***B. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n247.\n\nArgentina submits that, even admitting that interest is due as part of the standard of \"fair compensation\", \"international practice is clear in that international law sets forth that simple interest must be applied.\"399 Furthermore, Argentina submits that a risk-free rate must be applied in any case because the purpose of awarding interest is only to compensate the victim for the time value of money when payment is deferred. Argentina relies specifically on the ILC Commentary of Article 38 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility, at paragraph 8, where it says that \"the ILC has emphatically stated\" that: \"[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest, and this is true even of those tribunals which hold claimants to be normally entitled to compensatory interest\".400\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, para. 61, citing case law and referring to the *ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility* (2001), Commentary Article 38, Exhibit ALRA-320.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 62-63.\n\n248.\n\nArgentina especially objects to Total\u2019s request that in respect of the damages that Total incurred due to Argentina\u2019s treaty breaches in respect of its investments in TGN and Total Austral, which Total still holds, the proper interest rate should not be a risk-free rate but based on the respective WACC of these two companies. Argentina submits that a calculation on this basis would transform the loss of Total, due to delayed payment of the principal amount of damages, into compensation for loss of hypothetical profits that Total might have made if it had reinvested the amounts due to it in those two companies. Argentina argues that this concept is extraneous to the awarding of interest to compensate delay in payment.401\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 72-74 and Argentina QR, *supra* note 23, paras. 49-59.\n\n***C. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n----------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn the light of the positions of the Parties outlined above, the Tribunal must decide several issues in respect of interest on which Total and Argentina disagree, namely:\n\na) whether the interest rate for all losses of Total should be at a risk-free rate or whether it should reflect the WACC of TGN and Total Austral in relation to the amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal to Total in respect of these investments;\n\nb) whether interest should be calculated as simple interest or as compound interest;\n\nc) whether a distinction should be made between pre-award and post-award interest; and\n\nd) the proper risk-free interest rate.402\n\nTotal has requested a risk-free rate of 3.69% in its post hearing brief in respect of the electricity sector from which it has divested in 2006 (Total PHB, **supra** note 11, para. 89 and Annex 1: \"Total\u2019s detailed request for relief\u2019), while it had indicated a rate of 4.56% \"consistent with the position in the liability phase\" in Total QM, **supra** note 25, para. 50.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal underlines that the issue concerning interest in this case is not just \"ancillary\" to the determination of *quantum,* as is mostly the case whenever the principal awarded as damages represents by far the preponderant part of the overall compensation for damages. In this case instead, Total\u2019s request for interest almost doubles the global amount of compensation it requests: the principal amount of $557.2 million claimed by Total becomes $1,002.2 million as of 15 March 2012.403 This is due to the length of time from the dates of the various breaches (most of which occurred during the period from 2002 to 2006), the rates of interest claimed, especially the WACC-based rates in respect of TGN and Total Austral, and finally the compounding of the interest calculated at the rates advocated by Total.404 Deciding the issue of how interest should be calculated requires, therefore, the utmost care in this case due to its impact on the overall compensation, depending on the approach adopted.\n\nSee Total\u2019s PHB, *supra* note 25, Annex 1: \"Total\u2019s detailed request for relief\u2019, Table One: Total\u2019s Damage Claim: Principal v. Interest. In their Response to the request by the Tribunal in P.O. No. 5 to calculate in the alternative pre-award interest based on a risk-free rate, Total\u2019s experts have calculated the total of simple interest (at an annual rate of 4.08% for TGN and Total Austral and 3.69% for Electricity) on the principal claimed by Total to amount to $116.9 million up to 30 September 2011.\n\nArgentina objects to Total\u2019s methodology that results in the amount of interest being greater than that of the damages claimed \"como si el recurso al arbitraje fuese una inversion financiera y no el inicio de un procedimiento jurisdiccional\", Argentina PHB, *supra* note 28, para. 3.\n\n251.\n\nAt the outset the Tribunal recalls certain legal parameters that it must consider in deciding all the above issues. First of all, it is undisputable that the delay incurred by the creditor, in this case Total, in receiving the payment of the amount of money due to it must be compensated through the awarding of interest at an appropriate rate. This is required in order to compensate a creditor for the lack of use of the funds *(i.e.* reflecting \"the time value of money\") and \"to the extent that is necessary to ensure full reparation\".405 The awarding of interest, specifically in respect of a principal sum due to the creditor to compensate it for the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act, as here, is independent from the reasons of the delay.\n\nILC *Draft Articles on State Responsibility* cit, Commentary to Article 38(2), Exhibit ALRA-133.\n\n252.\n\nThe BIT between France and Argentina provides at Article 5, concerning compensation due to an investor in case of expropriation, that interest shall accrue at an \"appropriate\" *(apropiada / appropri\u00e9* in the official Spanish and French texts of the BIT) rate up to the date of payment. The Tribunal believes in this respect that there is no reason not to apply this provision also to damages due for the breach of other articles of the BIT.406 The term \"appropriate\" is not definitive because it requires a term of reference: appropriate in respect of what? The premise is that interest is intended to ensure full compensation considering that the delay in payment reduces the value of the principal amount of compensation. Failure to pay interest at an \"appropriate\" rate would normally not provide for \"adequate\" compensation which, as prescribed by Article 5(2), should correspond to the \"real value\" of the property lost, or to its decrease in value. Interest must thus compensate for the additional loss due to the non-availability of the sum to which the creditor is entitled for a given period of time. The level of interest and other features of its calculation, in order to adequately cover such additional loss, depends on the currency in which the principal is expressed and the market rate for money placed in that currency, which in turn reflects *inter alia* the rate of inflation.\n\nSee **supra** para. 26 as to the calculation of the amount of compensation \"in accordance with the real value of the investment affected\". The same reasoning has been made by the *EDF* Award, **supra** note 107, para. 1337.\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal must take into account also Article 8(4) of the BIT, which directs an arbitral tribunal in case of a dispute under the BIT between France and Argentina to apply, besides the terms of the BIT itself and the principles of international law, also the law of the Contracting Party which is part of the dispute, thus here the law of Argentina. The Tribunal therefore inquired on the law of Argentina in respect of the various issues it has to decide in respect of interest, asking the Parties in PO No. 5, to supply in advance of the *quantum* hearing \"information with legal exhibits on the applicable rate(s) of interest under Argentine law\". The Tribunal considers that overall it has not obtained much useful information from the answers of the Parties to the above question. This is not because the Parties have been reticent or not forthcoming, or because they have not supplied sufficient information and documentation. On the contrary, the Parties submitted the texts of legal provisions, commentaries and a number of judicial decisions. Rather, the law of Argentina relating to interest is of limited assistance since the domestic situation of Argentina bears little correspondence with the international setting in which this Tribunal operates.\n\n254.\n\nThus, first, Argentina is a high-inflation economy in which prevailing interest rates are much higher than those which characterize a risk-free investment in US dollars, which is of primary relevance for the Tribunal for the reasons spelled out hereafter. Second, in Argentina two different sets of interest rates exist, the *tasa pasiva,* and the *tasa activa,* which are used also to calculate interest on amounts due by law, contract or judicial decision. The first one is the low interest rate given by banks to depositors, the second one is the higher rate which banks charge to their clients407. Moreover, different legal provisions apply depending on whether the Civil Code or the Commercial Code governs a given obligation. Finally, while in principle interest is calculated as simple interest, courts have discretion in commercial disputes to grant pre-judgment compound interest to compensate the specific loss suffered by an individual creditor for the delay in being paid.408\n\nWhile Total suggests that the *tasa activa* would be relevant by application of Argentine law, Argentina submits that the *tasa pasiva* would be the proper reference: see Total\u2019s PHB, ***supra*** note 25, para. 93 and Argentina\u2019s PHB, ***supra*** note 28, para. 6, respectively. In any case, Argentina submits that \"En la legislaci\u00f3n argentina, la tasa libre de riesgo, l\u00edquida y de relativo corto plazo, aplicable a la actualizaci\u00f3n de potenciales da\u00f1os en una controversia de estas caracter\u00edsticas, es la tasa para dep\u00f3sitos en d\u00f3lares a un plazo de seis meses\", Argentina PHB, ***supra*** note 28, para. 19.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Response to Procedural Order No. 5 of 15 December 2011 [hereinafter \"Total Response to PO No. 5\"], para. 1.\n\n255.\n\nThe above details of the Argentine legal regime on interest cannot be transposed to the dispute at hand which concerns interest for damages caused by a breach of international law (the BIT between France and Argentina) and to be granted in an international award governed by the ICSID Convention. As a result, the law of Argentina in respect of interest cannot appropriately guide the Tribunal in its decision on how to calculate interest on the principal amount granted to Total in the present Award. As an exception, the only point where the Tribunal may find guidance in Argentine law, and on which the Parties tend to agree, is that normally post-judgement interest, that is on amounts granted by a court to the successful party (the creditor) which the unsuccessful party (the debtor) does not satisfy promptly, contrary to its obligation to comply with the decision, is calculated on a compound basis.409\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 1, based on Article 623 of Argentina\u2019s civil code; Argentina PHB, *supra* note 28, para. 17.\n\n256.\n\nHaving dealt with the above general or preliminary issues, the Tribunal addresses the first issue (a) above, whether the rate of interest must be risk-free also as to the damages awarded to Total in respect of its investments in TGN and Total Austral. In this regard, the Tribunal does not share Total\u2019s point of view that since Total still owns stakes in these two companies and bears the connected risks, the interest rate on the compensation for damages it has suffered in respect of these investments should reflect this risk. The principal amounts that the Tribunal is awarding to Total, because of the damages it has suffered due to wrongful conduct of Argentina causing losses to Total in respect of its various investments in Argentina, are granted to Total in application of the principle that losses caused by internationally wrongful conduct entails a duty of reparation. It is immaterial whether Total has maintained those investments after suffering any such loss. Maintaining the investment or divesting it is a business choice of Total which, as such, should not influence the rate of interest that Argentina has to pay on the principal amount of damages determined by the Tribunal from the date of the loss to the date of payment.\n\n257.\n\nThe losses suffered by Total crystallized at the respective dates of the breaches by Argentina, as determined above. Whenever the losses entailed a decrease in the value of the company in which Total had a stake at that time, which is the case of TGN, HPDA and Central Puerto (but not of Total Austral, which suffered mostly transitory decreases in monthly income), the DCF method was applied to determine that loss in value, as advocated by Total in accordance with prevailing valuation methodologies. This has entailed using the respective WACC of those companies to discount future revenues. Once the amount of damages has been determined in this manner, interest on the various amounts has to be calculated to determine the additional loss suffered by Total as a result of the delay in payment, irrespective of the investment which suffered losses\n\n258.\n\nThe use of a risk-free rate in respect of all principal amounts is justified in any case, by the legal nature of the claim as recognized and enshrined in the Award and is supported by the particular nature of the present Award under international law. The present Award, which contains pecuniary obligations expressed in US dollars, is issued at the seat of ICSID in Washington, DC, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and is governed specifically by Articles 53(1) and 54 of the Convention as to its authority and effects. The particular situation of Total\u2019s investment in Argentina is therefore irrelevant in this respect. The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that interest on all principal amounts granted as compensation for damages to Total in the present Award shall be at a risk-free rate.\n\n259.\n\nAs to issue (b) above, whether interest should be simple or compounded, the Tribunal has taken note of the divergent views of the Parties recalled above. The Tribunal notes that the traditional view, supported by case-law and by doctrinal contributions as reviewed by the IFC, is against the awarding of compound interest in international law. The IFC in its Draft Article on State Responsibility has been cautious, however, in not reaching definite conclusions.410 It has noted that several authors have argued for reconsideration of this principle on the ground that \"compound interest reasonably incurred by the injured party should be recoverable as an item of damage\"411 and that this view has been supported by arbitral tribunals in some cases. The conclusion of the ILC is that \"given the present state of international law it cannot be said that an injured State has any entitlement to compound interest, in the absence of special circumstances which justify some elements of compounding as an aspect of full reparation\".\n\nILC *Draft Articles* cit, Commentary (9) to Article 38, Exhibit ALRA-133. For a detailed analysis see P. Nevill, *Awards of Interest by International Courts and Tribunals,* 78 BYIL, 255-341 (2008).\n\n*Ibid.,* referring to F. A. Mann, *Compound Interest as an Item of Damages in International Law,* 21 UC Davis LR, 577 (1988).\n\n260.\n\nWhile duly taking into account the above position of the ILC, the Tribunal recognizes that Total is correct in pointing out that there has been an increasing trend by investment arbitral tribunals to award compound interest. Most of the awards rendered against Argentina, especially in recent years, have decided in favour of compound interest, a trend that commentators have recognized and largely supported.412\n\nTotal QM, **supra** note 5, para. 61 distinguishing pre and post-2004 awards and referring to seven awards against Argentina and eight other investment awards issued after 2006 granting compound interest. Simple interest was granted in 2002 in the *CMS* Award, **supra** note 29, para. 471, Exhibit ALRA-240.\n\n261.\n\nThis evolution indicates that discretion in the matter is recognized to investment arbitral tribunals and that they have made use of this discretion.413 The trend towards granting compound interest in investment awards reflects the different status and position of investors in such disputes from that of States in inter-States disputes, since investors operate in a commercial environment. A common explanation given is that \"compound interest would better compensate the Claimants for the actual damages suffered since it better reflects contemporary financial practice\",414 an explanation which is particularly appropriate when the investor operates in the financial sector.415 Another similar explanation given is that the standard of full reparation would not be met if an award were to deprive a Claimant of compound interest which would have been available on the sums awarded had they been paid in a timely manner.416 The Tribunal finds these reasons persuasive and concludes that the awarding of compound interest is justified in this case.\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee in *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment (5 February 2002) [hereinafter *\"Wena* Decision\"], paras. 52-53, held that the tribunal had not gone beyond the boundaries of its discretion and that the award of compound interest pursued the legitimate objective of preventing the erosion of compensation by the passage of time.\n\n*LG&E* Award, *supra* note 210, para. 103, Exhibit CL-186.\n\nThis is the case of the *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award (5 September 2008), Exhibit CL-207, [hereinafter *\"Continental* Award\"] where the tribunal recalls at para. 313 that Continental\u2019s loss consisted of the deprivation of an interest-bearing Argentinean treasury bill held as reserve by its subsidiary, a local insurance company.\n\n*BG Group Pic v. Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, Award (24 December 2007) [hereinafter *\"BG Group* Award\"], paras. 455-456, Exhibit CL-192; *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award (6 February 2007) [hereinafter *\"Siemens* Award\"], para. 399, Exhibit CL-121; S. Ripinsky and K. Williams, Damages and International Investment Law, BIICL 2008, pp. 386-387.\n\n**Individual Opinion under** **Article**  **48 (4)**  **of the**  **ICSID**  **Convention** **(Dissent) by Arbitrator Luis Herrera Marcano in respect of paragraph**  **261**  **in favour of granting of compound interest.**\n\n262.\n\nMr. Herrera Marcano does not agree with the majority as to the awarding of compound interest on the compensation granted to Total as damages in this Award. In his view the position of international law in this matter is properly reflected in the statement of the International Law Commission, according to which simple interest is the rule \"in the absence of special circumstances\". Mr. Herrera Marcano cannot detect any such special circumstances in this case. He also notes that investment arbitral tribunals are split on the issue. In any case, as he stated in his Concurring Opinion to the Decision on Liability at paragraph 9, these tribunals are not \"international tribunals under international law\" and their decisions do not create precedent. In Mr. Herrera Marcano\u2019s view, therefore, simple interest should have been granted on all amount of compensation granted to Total from the date due of any such amount until payment thereof. **(End of Mr. Herrera Marcano\u2019s individual Opinion)**\n\n263.\n\nAs to issue (c) above, whether a distinction should be made between pre-award and post-award interest, the Tribunal notes that, besides pre-award interest, post-award interest is regularly granted until payment of the principal determined in an award. This is justified because the rationale for interest is to compensate the creditor for the time lag between the date in which it ought to have received the amount due as compensation and the effective date of collection. A distinction between pre- and post-award interest is sometimes made as to simple versus compound interest, respectively, and as to the rate of each. Such a distinction is not necessary in the present case, since compounding interest is justified also in respect of any delay by Argentina in paying the principal amount granted to Total in the present Award. As noted above, compounding post-judgment interest is also admitted in Argentine law.417 Compound interest has also been granted by investment tribunals that have granted simple pre-award interest,418considering that any delay in payment after the issuance of a decision is normally due exclusively to the debtor not satisfying promptly the obligation arising from the final and binding decision at issue.419 The Tribunal concludes therefore that post-award interest due by Argentina shall be compounded in the same manner as pre-award interest.\n\nSee *supra* note 409.\n\nSee *CMS* Award, **supra** note 29, para. 471 and *LG&E* Award, **supra** note 210, para. 105.\n\nSee Article 53 of the ICSID Convention: \"The award shall be binding on the parties...Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\"\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal deals now with the last issue set out above, (d), namely the proper riskfree interest rate to be used. For measuring the loss suffered by a creditor for not having received timely an amount due, the standard reference is to a rate that can be obtained from a first class issuer presenting no risk as to payment of interest and repayment of capital (typically, as to US dollars, the U.S. government). The underlying assumption is that the money could have earned such a rate of interest in any event, by being placed at no risk with such a first-class borrower.\n\n265.\n\nThis generally-followed approach does not look at the subjective nature of the creditor (consumer or investor, individual or business entity) or at its hypothetical preferences as to the type of investment, such as putting the money in the creditor\u2019s business, which may yield a higher return but may also be exposed to higher risks.420 Total could have, in any case, placed the money owed to it by Argentina in such a US Governmental risk-free instrument and thus have earned, at a minimum, the periodic interest paid to their holders.\n\nIn order to support its claim to a WACC-based rate of interest for the principal related to TGN and Total Austral, Total claims that it \"would only have invested these revenues from TGN and Total Austral in a project that would provide a comparable rate of return\" (Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 58), but this statement has not been supported by evidence. The extreme difficulty of proving such a but-for scenario is the reason for the use instead of market based rates and is behind the legislative indication in many domestic legal systems of a \"statutory official rate of interest\" (\"legal rate of interest\"), applicable in the absence of specific evidence of higher damages suffered by the creditor for not having had the due amount at its disposal.\n\n266.\n\nAs to the type of security to be used as reference, a review of awards shows that ICSID tribunals have made use of a remarkable discretion. While most awards base the riskfree interest rate for claims in U.S. dollars on the yields of certain U.S. governmental debt instruments, such as short-term U.S. treasury bills or longer term bonds,421 the rates of interest that tribunals have adopted, though based on rates which were known, have varied greatly. A first divide is that some tribunals have referred to the variable rate of a specific security leaving it to the parties to make the ensuing calculations,422 while other tribunals have set the rate for the period between the due date(s) and the date of the award.423 Following the second approach, in one of the first awards against Argentina, *CMS v. Argentina,* an interest rate of 2.51% was awarded, while in the *Sempra* award issued in 2007, the rate was set at 6%. In one of the most recent decisions, *EDF v. Argentina,* the rate awarded was 4.51%. These differences in rates do not appear to depend necessarily on different rates prevailing at the time of the issuance of those awards but rather depend on the individual choice of each tribunal.\n\nIn some case the LIBOR has been used, depending also from the request of the claimant. Here Total\u2019s experts have advocated reference for pre-award interest the rate of US Treasury bills, using the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds explaining that this security \"approximately matches the duration of the cash flow being valued\", LECG Damages Report, **supra** note 115, para. 314; Total Response to PO No. 5, **supra** note 408, paras. 2-8.\n\nSee thus *BG Group* Award, *supra* note 416, para. 457, Exhibit CL-192: interest \"at the average interest rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit compounded semi-annually.\"\n\nUnder the second approach the rate for the post-award period until payment must be separately determined by reference to the future interest rate of the security chosen prevailing from time to time (such as quarterly, semi-annually or annually).\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that in view of the different dates at which the various amounts of damages determined in the present award became due (and at which dates, consequently, interest start accruing on each of those amounts) and the substantial variation in interest rates from July 2002 until 2013, it is not appropriate for the Tribunal itself to fix a single rate of interest applicable for the whole pre-award period, based on some kind of averaging. The Tribunal finds it more appropriate, instead, to follow the first approach mentioned above and to refer to the interest rates in force from time to time as to an appropriate security as the basis for calculating the interest accruing on the distinct amounts granted to Total for the damages it has suffered in respect of its various investments.\n\n268.\n\nAs to the type of security to be used as reference, the Tribunal notes that investment tribunals have referred mostly to short-term US Treasury bills, such as 6-month or one-year bills, rather than to longer instruments, such as 10-year Treasury bonds.424 In light of the preceding examination of the issue and of the various parameters available and used by investment tribunals, the Tribunal determines that all amounts due by Argentina to Total as damages shall bear interest at the one-year U.S. Treasury bill average rate in effect on the date on which each payment became due425 and thereafter at the subsequent yearly average interest rates of one-year U.S. Treasury bills until payment. Accruing interest shall be compounded yearly.426\n\nAs recalled above, Total has supported reference to the 10-year bonds, whose yield is higher, while Argentina to the 6-month bills whose yield is lower.\n\nSuch dates have been determined above in the relevant paragraphs dealing with each item of damage and are conclusively specified hereafter in Part VII of the present Award.\n\nCompounding on an annual basis has been suggested in Total QM, *supra* note 5, para. 65.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n***A. Total\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------\n\n269.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Article 47(l)(j) of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal must allocate the costs of the arbitration between the parties, including ICSID\u2019s administrative charges, the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, and the legal and other expenses incurred by the parties.427\n\nIn order for the Tribunal be in the position to decide on apportionment of costs, Article 28(2) of the Arbitration Rules provide that promptly after the closing of the proceeding, each party \"shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred...\". The Parties have supplied their respective statements (Costs Submissions) on 26 April 2012 pursuant to the directions of the Tribunal.\n\n270.\n\nTotal requests \"a full award of its costs and fees related to this arbitration, with interest, calculated on a compound basis\".428 Total relies on the principle that \"costs follow the event\", and on its right to full reparation which includes reimbursement of the costs necessary to obtain such reparation. Total points out that while Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention \"affords the Tribunal broad discretion in deciding how to allocate the costs of the arbitration\", recent ICSID tribunals have reversed the traditional trend to split the arbitration costs equally among the parties.429 According to Total, the factors considered by investment arbitral tribunals in exercising such discretion are (a) the extent to which each party has prevailed in relation to jurisdiction, liability and damages; (b) the underlying factual circumstances giving rise to the arbitration and the complexity of the proceedings; and (c) the conduct of each party in the arbitration, and in particular whether either party has \"needlessly prolonged\" or \"obstructed\" the proceedings.430\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 246. Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs of 26 April 2012 [hereinafter \"Total Cost Submission\"] specified that the risk-free rate should be 3.69% from the date of the Award until full payment.\n\nTotal QM, *supra* note 5, para. 251.\n\nTotal Cost Submission, *supra* note 428, para. 4.\n\n271.\n\nTotal submits that it should be entitled to full reimbursement of its arbitration costs as \"the Tribunal has rejected Argentina\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and found Argentina to be in breach of the Treaty in numerous ways\". In its final Costs Submission of 26 April 2012 (Total\u2019s Costs Submission\"), Total submitted that Argentina should be ordered to pay all the costs that it has incurred, amounting to \u20ac 12,950,579.93 and $7,357,581.03, which include the legal fees (international and Argentine counsel), the fees of its experts on *quantum* and its other expenses and fees incurred in the arbitration. Total has also asked that Argentina reimburse the full amount of its deposits to the Secretariat of ICSID on account of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative fees.\n\n***B. Argentina\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n272.\n\nArgentina objects to the request of Total concerning costs, referring to what it says is the dominant practice *(la pr\u00e1ctica imperante)* of investment arbitral tribunals, in any case at ICSID, that each party bears it costs and that the costs of the tribunal is equally apportioned between the parties.431 Moreover, Argentina rejects Total\u2019s assessment that the Decision on Liability was against Argentina, pointing out that the Tribunal rejected all claims by Total except those based on the breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation. Argentina also submitted its statement of costs (\"Argentina\u2019s Costs Submission\") on April 26, 2012. According to Argentina\u2019s Costs Submission, its total costs in these proceeding amount to $2,434,243.49, representing the costs of the staff of the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n* in charge of the legal defense of Argentina and of its experts on *quantum.*\n\nArgentina QCM, *supra* note 6, paras. 196-203.\n\n***C. The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation***\n----------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided in its decision on the matter of apportionment of costs by the following considerations. Undoubtedly, the relevant ICSID provisions give broad discretion to arbitral tribunals in the matter. The practice of ICSID tribunals in apportioning costs is neither clear nor uniform. It has been noted that in a majority of cases ICSID tribunals have decided that the parties should bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the charges for the use of the Centre\u2019s facilities, and that each party should bear its own expenses.432 When so deciding, tribunals often have given no reason, taking it somehow for granted that this is the rule. When tribunals have apportioned the costs differently, especially those incurred by the parties, they have referred to the criteria that Total has mentioned, such as the extent to which the claimant has prevailed, the breaches adduced having been found to exist; the complexity of the proceedings and whether arbitration costs have somehow been due to the \"misconduct\" of a party in the course of the proceedings.433\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary* (Second Edition), Article 61, paras. 19 and 33.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 44. The Parties have also referred to recent cases where claimants that have lost a case against a State, either as to jurisdiction or on the merits have been ordered to pay the costs of the respondent State.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus empowered to consider all relevant factors mentioned above in order to apportion the costs between the parties based on the outcome of the case and the conduct of the proceedings rather than deciding at the outset that each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n275.\n\nIn view of the above, as to the underlying factual and legal issues and the conduct of the proceedings the Tribunal notes the following: (a) the proceedings have been very complex, lengthy and costly, due to the number and complexity of the claims submitted under the BIT, affecting three different types of investments in Argentina, and involving a number of complex legal issues under local and international law; (b) the proceedings have spread over ten years (the Request for Arbitration was filed in May 2003 although the Tribunal was constituted almost a year later, in March 2004); they entailed the issuance of a first a decision on jurisdiction (in May 2006), thereafter a Decision on Liability (at the end of December 2010), and finally the present Award in 2013. The proceedings have comprised a number of hearings, the examination of many factual and expert witnesses, the filing by the Parties of more than one thousand factual exhibits, of hundreds of legal documents and authorities, and finally a number of voluminous memorials and briefs by the Parties and many complex reports by their respective experts in both the liability and in the *quantum* phases.\n\n276.\n\nIn respect of the issues mentioned as relevant in the previous paragraphs, the Tribunal does not consider that any of the Parties is \"responsible\" for the complexity or the duration of the proceedings such that those elements should influence the decision on the apportionment of the costs. Both Parties have made full use of their rights of defense as they were entitled to do, without abusing the process. No party has committed any \"procedural misconduct\"; on the contrary the Tribunal takes the opportunity to acknowledge the cooperation of both Parties in facilitating the conduct of such complex proceedings at all stages.\n\n277.\n\nAs to the outcome of the dispute, the Tribunal notes that Total had raised two general types of claims against Argentina: the first relating to the pesification of tariffs and prices by the Emergency Law and related Decrees in 2001-2002; the second relating to the freezing of the tariffs and restrictions on the prices of energy affecting the operation of the companies in which Total had invested. In the Decision on Liability the Tribunal found that pesification did not breach the BIT, while it found that the freezing of tariffs and restrictions on prices (and other connected measures) did represent a breach of the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed to Total under the BIT.\n\n278.\n\nAs to *quantum,* this Award has determined that the losses that Argentina must compensate to Total are substantial, in excess of US$250 million. On the other hand Total had claimed twice that compensation (US$557 million), before interest. Based on the compound interest rates claimed by Total (which in its view should not be risk-free in respect of about one-half of the amount of the principal), interest would have doubled the amount of overall damages claimed by Total. Such overall amount, as recalled above in the Award, is in excess of one billion dollars. Since the Tribunal has only awarded risk-free pre-award interest on the entire principal sum, the amount of interest due by Argentina to Total to the date of the Award will be substantially less.\n\n279.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal believes that the absolute and relative amounts of the costs claimed by the Parties and directly incurred by them should also be taken into account. In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the legal and experts\u2019 costs of Total are considerable and that they are multiple of those claimed by Argentina. On the other hand, the amount of costs incurred and claimed by Total reflects the complexity of the case, the number, volume and quality of the briefs, the length and complexity of the hearings and the amount of damages to be determined.\n\n280.\n\nOn balance and making use of its discretion, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate that each Party bears its own costs and that the Parties share the administrative costs of the Centre in equal parts, including the expenses and fees of the members of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 59 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**VII. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\nArgentina shall pay to the Claimant the following amounts as compensation for the damages caused by Argentina in respect to Total\u2019s investments in Argentina in breach of Article 3 of the BIT between Argentina and France of 3 July 1991, as decided in the Decision on Liability issued by this Arbitral Tribunal, dated 27 December 2010, to be considered an integral part of this Award:\n\n**(A) Compensation for losses in the gas transportation sector:**\n\n**-**  **US$80.3 million** plus interest as of 1 July 2002, for losses related to Total\u2019s stake in TGN;\n\n**-**  **US$4.9 million,** plus interest as of 1 March 2006, for losses related to Total\u2019s rights as Technical Operator of TGN.\n\n**(B) Compensation for losses in the electricity sector:**\n\n**-**  **US$123.3 million,** plus interest as of 1 January 2007, for losses related to Total\u2019s stake in Central Puerto and HPDA.\n\n**(C) Compensation for losses in Hydrocarbons Exploration and Exploitation (Oil and Gas):**\n\n***Retroactive Elimination of the Tierra del Fuego Tax Exemption:***\n\n**US$7,628,000,** plus interest as of 1 June 2011, for withholding taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego during the period of 2002-2006, imposed retroactively in breach of Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n- The Tribunal also declares that future requests for additional retroactive taxes on exports from Tierra del Fuego for the period 2002-2006 would also be in breach of Article 3 of the BIT. Therefore, should Total S.A. or Total Austral be compelled to pay any such taxes to Argentina\u2019s tax authorities, Claimant Total S.A. would be entitled to recover any such taxes with interest under this Award as specified in paragraph 191.\n\n***Domestic Sales of Natural Gas in 2002 \u2014 2004:***\n\n**- US$43 million,** plus interest as of 1 May 2004 for losses in sales to distributors, due to Argentina\u2019s intervention and lack of compliance with the benchmark price in breach of Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n***Domestic Sales of Natural Gas in 2004 \u2014 2006:***\n\n**- US$8.4 million** plus interest as of 1 January 2007.\n\n***Limitations of Gas Exports (Interference with Gas Export Contracts):***\n\n**- US$2.4 million,** plus interest as of 1 January 2007.\n\n**For a total amount of US$269,928,000** before interest.\n\n**(D) Interest:**\n\n- On all above amounts, interest shall accrue as of the date indicated for each amount, at a rate equal to the average rate of the one-year U.S. Treasury bills prevailing on such initial date, and thereafter at the subsequent yearly average interest rates of one-year U.S. Treasury bills prevailing in each following yearly periods, until payment. Such interest shall be compounded yearly;\n\n- Each Party shall bear all of its own legal costs and expenses, including for its respective experts, without recourse to each other;\n\n- The Parties shall bear equally the costs and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID.\n\n- All other claims, defences and exceptions of the Parties are hereby rejected.\n\nDone in English and Spanish, both versions being equally authoritative."}, {"Title": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2014-12-04T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **List of Defined Terms** | |\n| \u00b6 | Paragraph |\n| Application | Application of Argentina for the Annulment and Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 27, 2014 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Argentina | The Argentine Republic |\n| Argentina's First Submission | Argentine Republic's First Brief on Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated July 11, 2014 |\n| Argentina-France BIT or the BIT or the Treaty | Agreement between the Republic of France and Argentina on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, entered into on June 28, 1990 |\n| Argentina's Second Submission | Argentine Republic's Second Brief on Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated August 12, 2014 |\n| Award | *Total S.A. v.

In this proceeding, the Argentine Republic is represented by:\n\nDra. Angelina Abbona\n\nProcuradora del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nProcuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\n\n3.\n\nArgentina seeks the annulment of the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction rendered on August 25, 2006, the Decision on Liability rendered on December 27, 2010 and the Final Award rendered on November 27, 2013 in ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, whereby the tribunal declared it had jurisdiction to entertain the dispute under the Argentina-France BIT. Under the Decision on Liability the Tribunal upheld Total's submission concerning Argentina's obligation to grant Fair and Equitable Treatment to Total S.A. under the Argentina-France BIT and in the Final Award, the Tribunal ordered Argentina to compensate Total for the damages suffered for the violations of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, Argentina filed an application requesting the Annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction rendered on August 25, 2006, the Decision on Liability rendered on December 27, 2010 and the Final Award rendered on November 27, 2013, in ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*. The Application for Annulment was submitted within the time period provided for by Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nIn its Application, Argentina requested the Stay of Enforcement of the Award provided for in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nOn April 2, 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for Annulment of the Arbitral Award in accordance with Arbitration Rule 50(2)(a) of the Arbitration Rules and provisionally stayed the enforcement of the Award pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54 (2).\n\n7.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties the proposed names for the appointment of the *ad hoc* Committee. The Secretary-General of ICSID recommended Ms. Teresa Cheng, a national of China, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos, a national of Guatemala and Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a national of Colombia.\n\n8.\n\nOn May 21, 2014, ICSID Legal Counsel communicated to the arbitrators their appointment in the *ad hoc* Committee. On May 27, 2014, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted. The Committee was composed of Ms. Teresa Cheng, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos and Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, as President of the Committee. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Natali Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel, would be the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 9, 2014, the Committee requested the Parties to confer on the date of the First Session and the timetable for the exchange of written submissions on Argentina's request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. On June 16, 2014, Total submitted a letter to the Committee on behalf of both Parties requesting for additional time to confer on these matters. On June 18, 2014, the Committee granted additional time until June 26, 2014.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, the Parties agreed to hold the First Session in Washington D.C. on August 15, 2014. In addition, the Parties agreed to file their First Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement on July 11, 2014, with translations due 18 July, and their Second Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement on July 25, 2014, with translations due 1 August. Argentina confirmed that this was the agreement reached by the Parties by letter dated June 30, 2014.\n\n11.\n\nOn July 11, 2014, the Parties filed their First Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 11, 2014, after conferring with the Parties, the *ad hoc* Committee changed the date of the First Session to October 6, 2014.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 15, 2014, the Secretary of the Committee circulated a Draft of the First Procedural Order.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 24 July 2014, Argentina requested the Committee to extend time limits for the discussion of the Parties on Draft Procedural Order No. 1 until July 28, 2014 and to extend the deadline of the Second Submission on the Request for Stay of Enforcement of the Award until August 12, 2014. Claimant confirmed its agreement to extend these two deadlines by email dated July 25, 2014. On the same date, the Committee granted the two time extensions. The Parties submitted their comments and points of difference to the First Procedural Order on July 29, 2014.\n\n15.\n\nOn August 12, 2014, the Parties presented their Second Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement.\n\n16.\n\nThe First Session of the Committee was held on October 6, 2014 in Washington D.C. During the First Session the Parties made oral submissions on Argentina's request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement and on the topics of the First Procedural Order on which the Parties had not reached agreement.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 whereby the Parties agreed on the number of written pleadings that each of them would have, the corresponding deadlines for their submission and reserved dates for a hearing on annulment. The Parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. It was agreed that the proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in effect as of January 1, 2003. The Parties agreed on several other procedural matters, *inter alia*, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceedings would be the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C.\n\n18.\n\nThe Committee has conducted its deliberations on the request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee's Decision has taken into account all written submissions and oral arguments of the Parties.\n\n**III. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES CONCERNING THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nFollowing is a summary of the claims and reliefs of the Parties on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee has carefully reviewed all claims, reasoning, documents and legal authorities submitted by the Parties on this matter. The fact that an argument, document or legal authority is not cited or referred to in the summary does not mean that the Committee has not considered it.\n\n20.\n\nThe Argentine Republic requests the *ad hoc* Committee to order the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award until a decision on annulment is rendered in these proceedings, and that no conditions are imposed on Argentina in order to stay the execution of the Award.\n\n21.\n\nTotal S.A. requests the *ad hoc* Committee to dismiss Respondent's request to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the Committee's decision on annulment of the Award. In the alternative, Total requests the *ad hoc* Committee to order the Respondent: (i) to provide financial security in the form of a bank guarantee or a payment into escrow sufficient to satisfy the Award in full; (ii) to provide a letter confirming its intention to satisfy the Award as required under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, including its intention not to subject satisfaction of the Award to any further legal proceeding or remedies; and (iii) to declare that Respondent's failure to comply with these two orders will result in immediate lifting of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**A. Position of Argentina**\n----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn Argentina's view, the Committee must take into account the seriousness of the grounds invoked in its request in order to grant the stay of the Award1. The merits of Argentina's request for annulment are sufficiently serious and cannot be considered a dilatory measure or superficial in nature2. In any case, contrary to what has been suggested by Total, the merits of the request for annulment shall not be considered at this stage3.\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b62\n\nTr. 8:15-19\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b618-20\n\n23.\n\nArgentina holds that it is not acceptable to argue that applying for annulment is a dilatory tactic.4 Moreover, a party cannot be considered to be acting in bad faith or as using dilatory tactics because it has exercised its rights under the ICSID Convention. The opportunity to apply for annulment of an award is a fundamental right under the ICSID Convention5, a central feature of the ICSID arbitration system that confers stability and reliability.6\n\nTr: 22:13-19\n\nTr: 79:16-17\n\nTr: 8:20-9:2\n\n24.\n\nRegarding the applicable standard to continue the stay of enforcement, Argentina quotes to the decision in *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, to argue that there is no indication as to what circumstances require staying the enforcement of the Award and therefore that the Committee is free to evaluate the arguments of the Parties in view of the particularities of each case.7\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b67\n\n25.\n\nBased on the decisions in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (\"Azurix\") *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. & Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (\"Enron\") *and Victor Pey Casado y Fundaci\u00f3n Presidente Allende v. Chile* (\"Pey Casado\") *,* Argentina submits, that in general, a stay should be granted under Article 52 (5) of the Convention, if requested, and there are no exceptional circumstances in the instant case that may render such stay inadmissible.8 In this regard, the practice of annulment committees, as acknowledged in *Elsamex, S.A. v. Honduras* (\"*Elsamex*\") and in *Enron,* has been to grant the continuation of the stay.9 The *Pey Casado* committee concluded that it had been the practice of the committees to grant the stay of enforcement of the award in a practically automatic manner.10\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b65; Argentina's Second Submission, \u00b69-10\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b68; Argentina's Second Submission, \u00b611-12\n\nTr:85:5-16\n\n26.\n\nArgentina submits that there are sufficient guarantees to ensure its compliance of the Award.\n\n27.\n\nOn October 2013, Argentina entered into settlement agreements concerning the final awards in the following cases: *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. (formerly \"Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux\") v. Argentine Republic,* Azurix, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic, Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, and *National Grid P.L.C. v. Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL Arbitration).11\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b610\n\n28.\n\nArgentina claims that the settlement agreements reached in October 2013 were prompted by requests of the investors, and that these investors have affirmed that they are satisfied with the settlement. It adds that creditors in *Impregilo S.p.A v. The Argentine Republic* (\"Impregilo\") and *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic (\"El Paso\")* have still not made contact with Argentina to enforce the Awards and have not started proceedings to do so.12\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b625-30; Tr: 15:6-16\n\n29.\n\nIn addition, Argentina asserts that its legal system is, in itself, an adequate guarantee of compliance with the BIT, the ICSID Convention and any award rendered pursuant to those instruments, because under the laws of Argentina international treaties take precedence over domestic laws.13 In 1992 the Argentine Supreme Court handed down a decision that established precedence of treaties over domestic laws (Case of *Ekmekdjian v. Sofovich*) and, in 1994 the Constitution was amended to include in Article 75 (22) an express provision in this regard.14 Moreover, Argentinean judges must do everything within their reach to prevent the State from being found internationally liable.15\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b611; Argentina's First Submission, \u00b621\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b611, \u00b617-20\n\nTr: 23: 5-22\n\n30.\n\nThe *CMS* committee recognized the treatment of international law in Argentinian law and concluded that the commitments of Argentina under the ICSID Convention were sufficient.16 The *Azurix* committee stated that the primary security of the award were the obligations assumed by Argentina under the Convention17. According to Argentina, the decision by the *CMS* committee signals that Article 54 of the ICSID Convention is the key issue and that the Committee must be satisfied that the obligations have been incorporated into domestic law when deciding the stay.18\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b613\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b614\n\nTr: 27: 6-16 In its first submission, Argentina added that *\"(...) the conclusions of the annulment committees in CMS and Azurix should be sufficient in order to provide the necessary guarantees that the Award will be complied with in the event that this Committee decides to reject the Application for Annulment (\u2026)*\".Argentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b616\n\n31.\n\nArgentina also refers to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in the *Elsamex* case, according to which an award has to be complied with under the specific terms of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and that Article 53 of the ICSID Convention is equally applicable because it sets forth the binding nature of the award.19\n\nTr: 31:10-14\n\n32.\n\nIn Argentina's view, Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention shall be interpreted jointly. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention establishes the final and binding nature of ICSID awards and Article 54 cannot be understood to limit this provision.20 Argentina posits that under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, investors must follow the domestic proceedings to enforce an award21, yet it clarifies that these are not confirmation or exequatur proceedings.22\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b637\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b638\n\nTr: 81:4-6. In response to a question by the Committee, Argentina explained the manner in which this domestic proceedings work: \"*So, the procedure is to appear before the designated authority, and then that is taken to the judge, and the judge decides whether the Decision is paid based on the availability of funds. And this is the same procedure followed for final Decisions, but this has nothing to do with exequatur because the idea is with this standard to make a foreign Decision valid in the territory (\u2026)\"* Tr: 137:16-138:1 Argentina further clarified that: \"*This is an administrative court judge that verifies the existence of the funds. If the funds are not available the Executive is requested to make those funds available, and then if the Executive does not make those funds available, assets are attached so that that execution is carried out immediately. It doesn't mean that if the Executive doesn't provide the funds, this is an order that will not be fulfilled*.\" Tr: 143:17-144:3. In addition, the parties discussed on the requirement to pay a 3 per cent charge to initiate this process. Tr: 140:11-142:22\n\n33.\n\nArgentina disagrees with Total's interpretation of Articles 53 and 54 of the Convention because it does not consider that Article 54 applies only in cases of breach of the Award. To hold this proposition would be to modify the text of the treaty.23\n\nTr: 114:1-17\n\n34.\n\nArgentina also advances that the balance of interest in this case favors the continuation of the stay of the award.\n\n35.\n\nOn the one hand, continuing the stay of enforcement of the Award will not be detrimental for Claimant since the interest accrued during the annulment proceedings would compensate Total for the passage of time from the issuance of the Award until its payment.24\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b622\n\n36.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Argentina to recover amounts paid for an award rendered null25. This factor was taken into account by the *CMS*, *Enron* and *El Paso* committees.26 The risk of attachment by third parties of sums paid to Total inclines the balance of interest towards staying the enforcement of the award.27 In addition, the consequences of not having the sums paid would be very severe for a developing country like Argentina.28\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b643\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b643-46\n\nArgentina's First Submission (Translation), \u00b624: Argentina's Second Submission, \u00b672; Tr: 34:17-36:8\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b649\n\n37.\n\nDuring the hearing, Argentina contested Total's assertions on the factors that should be taken into account by an *ad hoc* committee to lift the stay of execution of an award. First, Argentina argued that annulment proceedings are not a remedy to deal with enforcement of an award, in those instances in which the State wishes to repudiate it.29 Moreover, according to Argentina, most ICSID annulment committees, and specifically the committee in *El Paso,* have acknowledged that it is not the committee's task to ensure compliance with the award.30 Second, Argentina is not repudiating the award; it recognizes that the Award exists and will abide by its conclusions, once it has been analyzed by the Committee.31 Argentina is the country that has enforced more ICSID awards in history32 and it has complied with its international obligations.33 Third, Argentina assesses the prejudice that might be caused to Total and concludes that the award equals less than 1 percent of the sales of Total in 2013.34 Yet, as has been publicly reported, Argentina is undergoing a very complex financial situation, and it could suffer great harm in committing resources that could be otherwise earmarked to social assistance and other public programs.35 Thus, Argentina considers that in the event the enforcement of the award is stayed, it cannot be affirmed that a greater harm would be caused to Total.36 Payment of interest by Argentina would still be available as a remedy in the event the Committee determines the award should not be annulled.37\n\nTr:11:8-18\n\nTr: 12:8-12\n\nTr: 13:16-22\n\nTr: 14:5-16\n\nTr: 16:5-19\n\nTr: 17:11-13\n\nTr:17:17-18:4\n\nTr: 18:5-19\n\nTr: 18: 20-19:2\n\n38.\n\nRegarding the allegation of Total as to the dilatory nature of the application for annulment, Argentina asserts that Total has not presented evidence to support this claim.38 It refers to the decisions in *Azurix* and *Enron,* where the committees stated that:\"... *the fact that a State is going to lose the annulment of all Awards that are adverse to it does not mean that this is a dilatory tactic. Rather, it means it is a right that is expressly provided for under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and as you know, it also implies the responsibility of a public official, who, if they understand that there are grounds for annulment, it is their duty and their right to apply for annulment of the Award*.\"39\n\nTr:20:8-18\n\nTr: 21: 4-12\n\n39.\n\nFinally, Argentina opposes Total's subsidiary request that the stay be granted only with the provision of a financial guarantee. Relying on the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix*, Argentina holds that requiring financial security to stay the execution of an award is contrary to the ICSID Convention.40 Also, Argentina posits that at the time of negotiation of the ICSID Convention, the drafters did not include the possibility of posting guarantees to stay the execution of an award.41\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b653-54\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b656-60\n\n40.\n\nArgentina, further relies on the decision of the *El Paso* committee indicating that the requirement to provide a guarantee was not provided for in the ICSID Convention or in the Arbitration Rules and that \"(\u2026) *this would be tantamount to punishing the State asking for the annulment because the State would have to pay a price to maintain the stay while everything is being processed and that this sanction is not provided for in any of the rules applicable to this case*.\"42\n\nTr: 33:15-20\n\n41.\n\nIn addition, Total has failed to demonstrate circumstances that require a financial security. As stated above, Argentina's legal system is sufficient guarantee of compliance. The delay in payment is an inherent risk to the annulment proceedings and there is no risk of non-payment since creditors to Argentinian awards have been paid.43\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b661-64\n\n42.\n\nAlso, Argentina claims that there might be a risk of attachment by third parties of the financial guarantee.44 During the hearing, Argentina explained that the *Enron* committee considered the possibility of constituting an escrow account in a foreign bank, and the risk that, if Argentina prevailed in the annulment proceedings, this financial security would be attached by third parties. The *Enron* committee concluded that it was not advisable to be exposed to this risk. Argentina suggests that this risk exists today in light of its current disputes with vulture funds.45\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b672\n\nTr: 33:21- 36:8\n\n43.\n\nArgentina further holds that granting a financial security would pose a burden on the party that requested annulment46 and would place the investor in a better position than it would have been if annulment proceedings had not been initiated. In its view, imposing a financial security is contrary to the principles of state immunity that have not been waived by States under the ICSID Convention.47\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b667\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b673-78\n\n**B. Position of Total**\n------------------------\n\n44.\n\nTotal submits that the baseline of ICSID Awards is that awards are immediately enforceable, except due to compelling reasons. Argentina cannot overcome this presumption in this case.48\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b62\n\n45.\n\nAccording to Total, the request for annulment and for a continuation of the stay filed by Argentina seeks to delay the satisfaction of an adverse arbitral award as it has been done by Argentina with other awards in the past.49 This is part of a systematic Government strategy to defy the core obligations of the ICSID Convention and to obey the dictates of ICSID Awards immediately and unconditionally.50\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b63\n\nTr:37:16-21\n\n46.\n\nAccording to Total, Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention is the starting point for assessing Argentina's request for continuation of the stay of enforcement: *\"This provision reflects the default position that ICSID awards are immediately enforceable upon issuance and, absent a ruling from the Committee to extend a temporary stay of enforcement, remain enforceable throughout the annulment process. Granting a stay of enforcement is by no means automatic. It is a form of extraordinary relief, available only if Argentina is able affirmatively to demonstrate that the circumstances* require *a stay.\"*51\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b69\n\n47.\n\nIn addition to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee shall turn to Article 53, according to which the obligation to comply with ICSID Awards arises as soon as they are issued, the only exception being the stay of enforcement.52 Before turning to other decisions, the Committee shall first interpret the ICSID Convention as an international treaty in accordance with its plain meaning: \"*These words, both those in Article 52(5) stating the default position that the stay should be lifted and Article 53 dictating that Awards must be complied with immediately, have only one meaning. There is no ambiguity about them, and there is no place to refer, for example, to subsidiary sources of international law, such as, for example, the Opinions of learned commentators or the Opinions of other ad hoc committees*.\"53\n\nTr: 39:18-40:3\n\nTr: 40:11-19\n\n48.\n\nThe drafters of the Washington Convention rejected a proposal to make stay of enforcement automatic.54 Total also refers to the decision in the *Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v Georgia* (\"*Kardassopoulos*\"), to support its proposition that under Article 52 (5) of the ICSID Convention, awards are immediately enforceable and that granting a stay is not automatic.55 As stated by the *Kardassopoulos* committee and the committee in *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of Paraguay (\"SGS v. Paraguay\")*, the Party requesting the stay of enforcement bears the burden of demonstrating that there are circumstances requiring stay of enforcement.56 Argentina has failed to identify any circumstances that might merit the continuation of the stay.57\n\nTr: 41:1-5\n\nTr: 41:7-14\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b69; Total's Second Submission, \u00b68; Tr:41:21-42:2\n\nTotal's Second Submission, \u00b68\n\n49.\n\nTotal considers that Argentina has erroneously referred to the decision by the *Enron* committee to state that there is a presumption in favor of granting the stay, but ignores that most recent committees have \"*sought to correct this counter-textual interpretation of Article 52 (5) of the ICSID Convention*\".58\n\nTotal's Second Submission,\u00b64\n\n50.\n\nTotal admits that the Convention offers no guidance as to the particular considerations that should be taken into account to determine whether an extension of the stay is required59. However, it points out to three considerations, among the variety of factors that have been taken into account by prior ICSID *ad hoc* committees60: (i) dilatory motives of the application for annulment; (ii) likelihood of compliance with the award in case it is upheld and (iii) the balance of the respective interests of the parties61.\n\nTr: 42: 6-9\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b610-11\n\nTr: 42:15-19\n\n51.\n\nOn the first consideration, Total argues that Argentina's request for annulment is part of a government policy implemented to extend investment treaty arbitrations and to delay payment of the award.62 Argentina has sought to nullify every single adverse award rendered against it, including 11 ICSID annulment proceedings and two court challenges for UNCITRAL awards63; therefore, a challenge to this Award was preordained.64 Argentina has been successful in only 3 out of 13 challenges; the vast majority of awards have survived challenge.65\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b612\n\nTr: 43:11-16\n\nTr: 44: 8-11\n\nTr:46:7-47:10.\n\n52.\n\nArgentina has raised the same three grounds for annulment in other proceedings and it has based its complaints on the same facts and issues, which ultimately lie in a disagreement with the merits of the Tribunal's decision.66\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b613-14\n\n53.\n\nDetermining whether Argentina's application for annulment is dilatory may require a high-level review of the grounds for annulment of Article 52 that were invoked and the likelihood that the alleged defects in the Award have any merit.67 Total stresses that no ICSID rules of procedure have been identified by Argentina as the bases for the allegation on a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure and that the alleged defects of the Award concern the merits of the Tribunal's decisions that have been alleged consistently by Argentina in other annulment proceedings.68\n\nTr: 49: 6-10\n\nTr: 49:15-50:12\n\n54.\n\nAs to the second consideration, Total argues that Argentina has not complied with its enforcement obligations under the ICSID Convention. Citing to *Sempra Energy International v The Argentine Republic* (\"*Sempra*\"), Total argues that the prospects of compliance are essential to the decision on whether to terminate the stay69; if the Respondent State intends to defy the Award, there will be no justification for assisting it for a year or more by suspending the treaty remedy for non-compliance.70\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b621\n\nTr: 51: 1-4\n\n55.\n\nTotal conceives Argentina's interpretation of its enforcement obligations under the ICSID Convention as nihilist.71 In its view, the plain meaning of this provision is that Argentina is under an immediate obligation to satisfy awards that are not subject to a stay of enforcement.72 Contrary to what has been stated by Respondent, Article 54 of the ICSID Convention does not require award creditors to bring their awards to its courts before it is obligated to satisfy the Award.73 Respondent's interpretation was rejected by the *Sempra* committee and is contrary to other authorities74.\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b622\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b622\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b622\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b623\n\n56.\n\nTotal accepts that under the Constitution of Argentina international law takes precedence over domestic law.75 However, it suggests that it is for Argentina itself to determine the content of its obligations under international law, and that in the case of the ICSID Convention, these obligation have been reduced to their minimum.76\n\nTr: 55:19-22\n\nTr: 55:19-56:4\n\n57.\n\nTotal counters Argentina's arguments on the need to have a domestic enforcement mechanism by stating that the \"*positive obligation under Article 54 to provide for a domestic enforcement mechanism cannot affect Argentina's obligation under Article 53 to satisfy an award without qualification\"*.77 The committee in *El Paso* criticized Argentina's stance on requiring procedures for the compliance of awards.78 Total adds that Article 54 of the ICSID Convention is a remedy for cases in which States do not comply with Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.79\n\nTotal's Second Submission, \u00b69\n\nSecond Submission, \u00b610; Tr: 58:19-59:4\n\nTr: 59:20-60:7\n\n58.\n\nAdditionally, Total argues that Argentina routinely defies its international obligations, particularly its financial obligations.80 Argentina requires creditors to start lengthy proceedings before its domestic courts in order to satisfy the award and uses delay to obtain settlements with investors whereby only a portion of the amount owed is paid.81\n\nTr: 51: 6-12\n\nTotal's First Submission \u00b622-27; Tr: 52: 1-14\n\n59.\n\nReferring to the recent settlement agreements between Respondent and award creditors, Total affirms that partial payment may well constitute the extinguishment of obligations under the Award, but it does not imply compliance with Article 53 of the Convention. The Convention requires States to pay Awards and does \"*not envisage partial payment in government bonds of dubious value and liquidity*\".82 Furthermore, in these settlements, the time waited by the investor was not compensated because only a fraction of the actual value of interests recognized by the Award was included.83\n\nTr: 52:15-53:1\n\nTr: 53:5-13\n\n60.\n\nIn addition, Total argues that prior committees did not have the benefit of \"*Argentina's now extensive record of non-compliance when they decided to maintain the stay of enforcement in those proceedings*\".84\n\nTotal's Second Submission, \u00b611-12\n\n61.\n\nFinally on this second factor, Total regards Argentina's interpretation of Article 53 as demonstrative of its lack of intention of complying with Article 53 and with the Award, in case Argentina's application for annulment is rejected.85 This was the conclusion of the *Sempra* committee.86\n\nTr: 61:9-18\n\nTr: 61:19-62:6\n\n62.\n\nThe third factor upon which Total relies its request for lifting the stay of enforcement is the balance of interests. Argentina's intention to evade payment shifts the balance of interests in favor of lifting the stay, since Total risks the total destruction of the value of its Award.87 The recovery of Argentina since the 2000 crisis is in the public record and the Award is equivalent to 1/100th of Argentina's foreign exchange reserves.88 Therefore, Argentina's arguments on impecuniosity offer no justification to extend the stay of enforcement of the Award.89\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b628, \u00b631\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b629; Tr: 65: 10-20\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b629\n\n63.\n\nIn addition, it is unlikely that Argentina could not recover any amounts seized by an award creditor if the award was eventually annulled.90 Total has no intention of retaining assets in case the award is annulled and Argentina could eventually attach its assets in Argentina or elsewhere.91 The existence of third-parties that might eventually attach assets in satisfaction of Argentina's international obligations is of no concern to this Committee, and evidences Argentina's non-compliance with its international obligations.92\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b630\n\nTotal's First Submission, \u00b630\n\nTr: 67:7-68:21\n\n64.\n\nMoreover, Total argues that it has a right under the Convention to full payment as of the date of the Award, and that it would be prejudiced by any reduction or suspension of that right.93\n\nTr: 62: 8-14\n\n65.\n\nTotal has not received the money to which it is entitled as of late 2012 and it is clear from Argentina's submissions that the Award will not be paid in full regardless of the outcome of these proceedings, and that it must initiate time-consuming processes to attach Argentina's assets elsewhere.94 The longer Total is forced to wait, the more difficult and costly the enforcement proceedings become.95 During this time, Argentina will obtain more leverage over Total to push for a settlement in extremely favorable conditions for it, as it did in the past round of settlements.96\n\nTr: 62: 15-20\n\nTr: 62:22-63:4\n\nTr:62:22-63:10\n\n66.\n\nTotal submits that the precedent of other award creditors that had to wait over six years to receive partial payment poses a substantial risk over Total's recovery of interests ordered in this proceeding.97 Interests fixed in the Award were set at a low rate and will not be able to compensate for the opportunity costs to Total of not having these resources promptly.98\n\nTotal's Second Submission,\u00b614\n\nTr: 64:2-22\n\n67.\n\nAlternatively, Total requests that in the event the stay of enforcement is granted, it should be conditioned on Argentina providing financial security in the form of escrow funds or bank guarantee99 because Argentina has demonstrated that it does not intend to honor adverse arbitral awards.100 A letter assuring compliance with the Award shall not suffice as a condition to extend the stay of enforcement for Argentina has not honored them in the past.101 However, such a letter could be provided in addition to a financial security, in the event that the Committee considers it necessary to extend the stay of enforcement.102 In such letter, Argentina should not require procedural preconditions to make payments under the Award: payment shall be immediate.103\n\nTr: 69:20-21\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b64\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b635\n\nTotal's First Submission,\u00b65\n\nTr: 76: 1-6\n\n68.\n\nTotal affirms that the Committee has the authority to require security as a condition to extending the stay *\"[s]ince you have full discretion entirely to reject an application to extend the Stay of Enforcement, it must be the case that you have the lesser power to approve the application subject to appropriate protection of the judgment creditors' rights*\".104\n\nTr: 70: 10-15\n\n69.\n\nIn addition, Total submits that in over half the cases where ICSID annulment committees have granted a stay of enforcement, they have done so on the condition that the losing party posts security or some other form of assurance.105 The practice of ICSID *ad hoc* annulment committees is to grant stay of enforcement of the award on the condition that a bond is provided for the full amount of the award.106\n\nTr: 72:3-7\n\nTr: 73:5-14 (Quoting Paul Friedland's paper on RA-30)\n\n70.\n\nClaimant contests Argentina's submission that ordering security would be contrary to the ICSID Convention. Argentina cannot expect to seek annulment without payment of the Award, because Article 53 of the ICSID Convention obliges it to pay awards immediately.107 For this reason, security will not place Total in a better position; it will place it in a position nearly equivalent to that which would have existed if Argentina had paid in the first place.108\n\nTr: 71:1-7\n\nTr: 71:14-18\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe parties do not dispute that pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention arbitral awards are final and binding. The parties also agree that a party to an arbitration under the ICSID Convention has the right to request annulment of the award under the grounds provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. Argentina considers that it is a fundamental right that is part of the ICSID system.\n\n72.\n\nArgentina and Total also seem to agree on the basic standards that other committees have identified for the granting or extension of the stay of enforcement. They differ, however, on the interpretation and application of such standards and on whether the burden of such standards lies on Argentina or on Total.\n\n73.\n\nIt is well established, first, that annulment under the ICSID system is an exceptional remedy109 that applies only under the very limited grounds provided for under Article 52 of the Convention and second, that such grounds do not constitute an appeal or allow for a review of the merits of the case.\n\nAs stated by the ad-hoc committee in *SGS v Paraguay* \"*The actions taken by the \"Contracting Parties\", who created the ICSID system must lead us to the conclusion that the binding nature of the award is the rule, whereas its annulment is the exception. The ICSID system is built on the premise that the awards rendered by ICSID tribunals settle in a definite manner the issues submitted to their consideration, and that only under exceptional and highly limited circumstances may their annulment be declared*.\" *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. The Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Paraguay's Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 22, 2013, \u00b684\n\n74.\n\nThese undisputed principles - finality of the award and exceptional nature of the annulment - that derive from Articles 52 and 53 of the ICSID Convention must be considered in the interpretation of the provisions related to the stay of enforcement.110\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Articles 31 and 32.\n\n75.\n\nThe rules on the stay of enforcement of the award are contained in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules 52 to 54. Pursuant to such provisions:\n\n(a) If the application for annulment contains a request for stay of enforcement of the award, the Secretary-General of ICSID shall order the provisional stay thereof.\n\n(b) Such provisional stay is temporary and if no request is made for the committee to continue the stay, it shall automatically terminate;\n\n(c) Unless the committee decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically terminate.\n\n(d) In the event that the committee considers \"that the circumstances so require\", it may order that the stay be continued pending its decision on the application for annulment.\n\n(e) If the committee grants a stay of enforcement, it may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party.\n\n76.\n\nThe aforementioned provisions of the ICSID Convention lead to the inevitable conclusion that the stay of enforcement in the ICSID system is far from automatic. The fact that statistically *ad hoc* committees may have granted the stay in the vast majority of cases does not mean that the stay is automatic. Moreover, in the decisions quoted by Argentina, and particularly in the annulment decisions of *Elsamex*, *Enron* and *Pey Casado*, the *ad hoc* committees have simply acknowledged that it had been the practice of the committees to grant the stay of enforcement of the award in a practically automatic manner111 and that stay of enforcement had been granted in all of the cases where it had been requested112. However, none of those committees have indicated that the relevant Articles of the ICSID Convention should be construed as considering the stay automatic.113 In fact, the *ad hoc* committee in *Elsamex* granted the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the award in light of specific circumstances which were present in that case and not because it deemed the stay of enforcement to be automatic114.\n\nTr:85:5-16\n\nArgentina's Second Submission, \u00b612\n\nFor example, the committee in *Elsamex* stated that it did not share the position that under the ICSID system stay of enforcement was automatic. See: *Elsamex S.A. v. Republic of Honduras*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/4 *, Decisi\u00f3n sobre la solicitud de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras para la continuaci\u00f3n de la suspensi\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n del Laudo*, January 7, 2014, \u00b690\n\n*Elsamex S.A. v. Republic of Honduras*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/4 *, Decisi\u00f3n sobre la solicitud de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras para la continuaci\u00f3n de la suspensi\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n del Laudo*, January 7, 2014, \u00b6\u00b698-101\n\n77.\n\nThe above reasoning is in conformity with decisions of previous *ad hoc* committees, for example, the committee in *Sempra v. Argentina* held that:\n\n*\"Against that background, the view of the present Committee as to the prerequisites for granting a stay can be summarized as follows. An ICSID award is immediately payable by the award debtor, irrespective of whether annulment is sought or not. A stay of enforcement should not in any event be automatic, and there should not even be a presumption in favour of granting a stay of enforcement. This follows, in the Committee's opinion, from the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, which authorizes the Committee to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision \u2018if it considers that the circumstances so require'. Although the ICSID Convention does not give any indication as to what circumstances would warrant a stay, it is nonetheless clear from this language that there must be some circumstances present that speak in favour of granting a stay. As a consequence, it cannot be assumed that there should be a presumption in favour of a stay or that the primary burden is placed on the award creditor to show that continuation of the stay should not be granted\".115*\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continuation of Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 5, 2009, \u00b627\n\n78.\n\nThe committee in *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* indicated that:\n\n*\"The exercise of the discretion of the Committee depends on the circumstances surrounding the Stay Request and, therefore, the granting of a stay of enforcement or its continuation should in no way be regarded as automatic. The Committee is aware that some ad hoc annulment committees have considered that, \"absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic.\" However, this does not follow from the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules, and the Committee considers that its decision should be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances.116*\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 7, 2012, \u00b643. Footnotes omitted.\n\n79.\n\nFinally, Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the stay shall only be continued if the committee considers that \"the circumstances so require\". The Committee notes that the ICSID Convention does not use other less categorical verbs, such as \"recommend\", \"deserve\", \"justify\" or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb \"require\".\n\n80.\n\nIn sum, to order the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Committee has to be satisfied that the circumstances of the particular case so require. It is for the party seeking the stay to show that such circumstances exist, and thus, the stay of enforcement of the award should be continued.\n\n81.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not identify the special circumstances that should be considered in order to maintain the stay of enforcement of the award. However, ICSID *ad hoc* committees have identified, amongst the circumstances the following: (i) prospect of prompt compliance with the award; (ii) hardship to one of the parties; (iii) risk of non-recovery; (iv) irreparable harm to the award debtor; (v) dilatory requests for annulment; (vi) enforcement regime and (vii) balancing of interests.117\n\nD. Bishop, S. Marchili, *Annulment under the ICSID Convention,* Oxford University Press, UK, 2012, \u00b612.17-12.28\n\n82.\n\nEven though the Parties in these annulment proceedings have referred substantially to all of the above circumstances, they have mainly focused on (i) dilatory requests for annulment; (ii) prospect of prompt compliance with the award; (iii) enforcement regime; and (iv) risk of non-recovery.\n\n**Dilatory request for annulment**\n----------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nAs regards the issue of whether or not the application for annulment by Argentina is well founded or dilatory, the *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the statements made by other annulment committees in that the merits of an annulment application are not relevant for purposes of the decision on whether or not to grant the stay, unless the application is manifestly dilatory.118 Likewise, the mere fact that the application is not dilatory is not sufficient to grant the extension of the stay.119\n\n*Elsamex S.A. v. Republic of Honduras*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/4 *, Decisi\u00f3n sobre la solicitud de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras para la continuaci\u00f3n de la suspensi\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n del Laudo*, January 7, 2014 \u00b696-97\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. The Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Paraguay's Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 22, 2013, \u00b694\n\n84.\n\nHaving reviewed the application for annulment by Argentina, the *ad hoc* Committee does not find that the allegations of Argentina to support its request for annulment could be considered, as clearly unfounded or as mere allegations to delay the enforcement of the award. This, however, does not automatically imply that the stay should automatically be maintained. First, because at this stage of the proceedings it is not for the Committee to decide on whether the application for annulment is well founded or not. Second, because a serious application is the least that can be expected from an applicant, and nowhere in the ICSID Convention - or in the practice of *ad-hoc* committees - compliance with such minimum duty results in the extension of the stay.\n\n**Prospect of prompt compliance with the award and enforcement regime**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Committee will analyze these two circumstances together given the form in which the allegations of the parties on the subject were submitted and particularly the impact that the allegations of Argentina as to the enforcement regime impact the prospect of prompt compliance with the award.\n\nArgentina devotes a significant portion of its allegations to discuss the supremacy of international law and international obligations under the Argentinian Constitution and hierarchy of laws resulting pursuant to its legal regime. Argentina concludes that under the laws of Argentina international treaties take precedence over domestic laws and therefore, given such precedence, the Argentine legal system is, in itself, an adequate guarantee of compliance with the BIT, the ICSID Convention, and any award rendered pursuant to those instruments.\n\nThis discussion, whatever the relevance it may have, does not allow the *ad hoc* Committee to conclude that an award against Argentina, rendered pursuant to the ICSID, Convention will be enforced as a final judgment of an Argentine court under Article 53.\n\nArticle 53 (1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\". The language does not leave room for doubt: the award is final and Article 53 (1) imposes an unconditional obligation to comply with the award, provided only that a stay ordered pursuant to the provisions of the ICSID Convention will temporarily release a party from that obligation.\n\n86.\n\nThe *ad-hoc* Committee agrees with the conclusion of the *Sempra* committee that stated \"*Article 53 is directed to the parties to a particular arbitration (\"the award shall be binding on the parties\"). Hence, the obligation to abide by and comply with the terms of the award is imposed on a party to the arbitration irrespective of whether that party is the foreign investor or the host State*.\"120\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continuation of Stay of Enforcement of the Award, Marc 5, 2009,\u00b638\n\n87.\n\nThe Parties in these annulment proceedings do not seem to disagree with the above conclusion. The substantial difference in their positions refers to the scope of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n88.\n\nWhile Article 53 imposes an obligation on the parties to the arbitration -\"the award shall be binding on the parties\" - Article 54 imposes an obligation on all the ICSID Convention States - \"[e]ach Contracting State\" - to \"recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.\"\n\n89.\n\nTherefore, in this particular case, Argentina has an obligation, as a party to this arbitration, both to comply with the award (Article 53) and as a Contracting State to recognize the award \"as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award\" within the territory of Argentina \"as if it were a final judgment\" of an Argentinian court (Article 54). In other words, the fact that Argentina, as a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, has an obligation to recognize and enforce ICSID awards under Article 54, neither deprives Article 53 of its effects nor relieves Argentina of its unconditional obligation, as a party to the arbitration, \"to abide by and comply with the terms of the award.\"\n\n90.\n\nWith respect to Article 54, Argentina claims that it should be interpreted jointly with Article 53 and that Article 54 does not limit the final and binding nature of ICSID Awards provided for under Article 53. According to Argentina, under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, investors must follow the domestic proceedings to enforce the award. These proceedings, according to Argentina, are not the equivalent to an exequatur or confirmation proceedings, but in any event procedures that must be followed before the Argentinian courts.121 In Argentina's view, Article 54 does not apply only in the event of enforcement of an award resulting from non-voluntary compliance with the obligations contained therein. It also refers to compliance with the requirements that a State deems necessary to pay the monetary obligations under the award.\n\nTr: 81:4-6. In response to a question by the Committee, Argentina explained the manner in which this domestic proceedings work: \"*So, the procedure is to appear before the designated authority, and then that is taken to the judge, and the judge decides whether the Decision is paid based on the availability of funds. And this is the same procedure followed for final Decisions, but this has nothing to do with exequatur because the idea is with this standard to make a foreign Decision valid in the territory (...)\"* Tr: 137:16-138:1 A further clarification was added: \"*This is an administrative court judge that verifies the existence of the funds. If the funds are not available the Executive is requested to make those funds available, and then if the Executive does not make those funds available, assets are attached so that that execution is carried out immediately. It doesn't mean that if the Executive doesn't provide the funds, this is an order that will not be fulfilled*.\" Tr: 143:17-144:3. In addition, the parties discussed on the requirement to pay a 3 per cent charge to initiate this process. Tr: 140:11-142:22\n\n91.\n\nAccording to the explanations provided by Argentina, particularly during the hearing, (i) the award creditor must contact Argentina and commence the local proceedings;122 (ii) the local proceedings require the submission of a certified copy of the award to an Argentinian administrative court; (iii) the court will then verify that the decision is against the State and will inquire with the pertinent authority of the Government of Argentina as to whether the accounts that are used to pay the debts of the State have the necessary funds to pay for the award; (iv) if there are funds the award would be paid; (v) if there are no funds, the judge may order the Government to obtain the funds and pay; (vi) if the Government does not pay, the court may order the attachment of assets.123\n\nTr: 15: 6-16\n\nTr: 137:3-138:1\n\n92.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee considers that the overall interpretation of Argentina of Articles 53 and 54, as presented in these annulment proceedings, is not consistent with the ICSID Convention.\n\n93.\n\nAccording to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"(1) Each Contracting State shall ***recognize*** an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and ***enforce*** the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.\n\n(2) A party ***seeking recognition or enforcement*** in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.\n\n(3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n94.\n\nThe plain meaning of the wording in the aforementioned Article leaves no doubt: on the one hand, it imposes, as already discussed above, an obligation on Contracting States, not only on the State party to the arbitration. On the other, it refers to the recognition and enforcement of the awards under the ICSID Convention.\n\n95.\n\nThe recognition and enforcement of awards are also addressed in other international treaties, the most relevant being the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The terms \"recognition\" and \"enforcement\" have been widely analyzed in the context of international arbitration and it is now settled that the process seeking for recognition and enforcement of an award takes place when the award debtor does not voluntarily comply with the terms of the award.124 In other words, obtaining recognition and enforcement is not a requirement for compliance with an award, but merely a mechanism by which an award creditor may invoke to compel compliance if the award debtor does not voluntarily abide by and comply with the terms of the award. Further it must be noted that the reference to recognition and enforcement connotes two stages: the recognition stage is to incorporate the award into the legal system of a given jurisdiction and the enforcement stage corresponds to the proceedings to force compliance of the award by the debtor, which may include the attachment of assets in execution of the court judgment. These stages are well established and evidenced in Articles 54 and 55.\n\n*\"In practice, the overwhelming majority of international arbitral awards are complied with voluntarily and, when they are not, they are usually recognized and enforced\".* Born, Gary B. *International Commercial Arbitration.* Kluwer Law International, 2009, Volume II. p. 2711\n\n96.\n\nThere is, however, a fundamental difference between enforcement of awards under the New York Convention and the ICSID Convention. The ICSID Convention requires a contracting State to enforce an ICSID award (as far as it concerns pecuniary obligations) \"as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\". It is an automatic recognition process where no court proceedings are envisaged, which admits no review by courts and no grounds to resist recognition. This is in contrast with New York Convention which does not provide for such automatic recognition. Article III obliges the enforcing state to enforce the award in accordance with its own rules of procedure, subject, inter alia, to the conditions laid down in the New York Convention, including Article V which sets out specific grounds by which an award may be refused recognition and enforcement by a court, and thus is not incorporated into the legal system of the given State.\n\n97.\n\nArgentina claims that the proceedings for payment of the award are not the equivalent of an exequatur or a revision. *Ad arguendo,* this may be true with respect to the stage of enforcement of the award, where the local procedures - and the courts - may come into play according to Articles 54(3) and 55. However the allegation that these proceedings must be undertaken (including what seems to be a non-automatic recognition stage) as a condition for Argentina's compliance with the award, suggests that Argentina is not willing to comply with its obligations under Article 53 to abide by and comply with the terms of the award, but will rather insist that the award creditor must subject itself to the process envisaged in Article 54.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, the Committee is not convinced, and the record does not contain clear evidence, that under Argentinian law the monetary obligations under a final decision of a local court cannot be voluntarily complied with unless a judicial proceeding is commenced to seek funds for compliance.\n\n99.\n\nIn sum, the obligation to enforce the award contained in Article 54 is an obligation imposed on all Contracting States and thus, different in scope from the obligation of Article 53. While the latter imposes on the party to the arbitration the obligation to comply with the award, the former obliges all Contracting States, whether or not a party to the given arbitration, to enforce the pecuniary obligations of the award as it were a final decision of their own courts. Steps to secure recognition and enforcement of an award is only required when the award has not been voluntarily complied with and not as a requisite for payment.\n\n100.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Committee concludes that a State party to the arbitration, must (like a foreign investor party) abide by and comply with an ICSID award, and as a Contracting Party a State cannot force the award creditor to submit to local court proceedings to seek payment of the pecuniary obligations of the award, as envisaged by Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**Risk of non-recovery**\n------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded that if it were to lift the stay, it would render it very difficult or impossible for Argentina to recover the amounts paid out to Total under the award.\n\n102.\n\nPrior committees have considered the risk of non-recovery of payments made by a respondent State on account of an award that is eventually rendered null as a relevant factor to determine whether the stay of enforcement of the award should be continued. In conducting this assessment, some committees have considered the profile of the claimant in order to assess this risk. Particularly, the committee in Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo\u00a0signaled that since claimant was a natural person, whose assets and activities were difficult to localize, thus posing difficulties in recoupment.125\n\n*Mr. Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, November 30, 2004, \u00b624\n\n103.\n\nHowever, in this case Total, a large international company, has assets in Argentina and elsewhere, and the amount of the award represents a relatively small percentage of the assets and revenues of Total. There is nothing in the record that suggests that Total would refuse payment in the event the award is annulled, nor is there persuasive evidence that an attachment of assets of Total may affect the company to such as extent as to prevent payment to Argentina if the Committee were to annul the award.\n\n**Balance of Interests**\n------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn balancing the interests of the parties in these annulment proceedings the Committee considers, first, that aside from a general statement that lifting the stay would prevent Argentina from using funds that it otherwise needs to satisfy the needs of Argentinians, there is no concrete allegation, much less evidence, of the existence of special circumstances that merit extending the stay of enforcement.\n\n105.\n\nSecond, that the mere fact of the application for annulment being serious or not evidently dilatory is not sufficient to continue the stay of enforcement.\n\n106.\n\nThird, that for the reasons explained in paragraphs 103 to 105 above, there seems to be no risk of non-recovery in the event the award were partially to totally annulled.\n\n107.\n\nLast, but not least, the Committee has found that Argentina is under an unconditional duty to \"abide by and comply with\" the Award according to Article 53. Argentina cannot insist in that it is complying with the ICSID Convention, and rely on such alleged compliance as a factor to maintain the stay, if at the same time it insists in forcing Total to activate Article 54 as a condition for payment. Total may, if Argentina refuses to comply with the award, enforce it under Article 54. The insistence of Argentina that it has no obligation to comply in the absence of Total going through its national judicial procedures implementing Article 54 must necessarily lead to the conclusion that Argentina is not willing to abide with its Article 53 obligations to comply with the award.\n\n108.\n\nThe above considerations lead the Committee to conclude, that in the balance of interest, the stay of enforcement of the Award should be lifted and it will so decide.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n109.\n\nThe decision on costs for proceedings related to the stay of the award will be made together with the final decision on the application for annulment.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\nThe Committee, based on the above considerations:\n\n1. Rejects the request from Argentina to continue the stay of enforcement of the Final Award rendered on November 27, 2013, in ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic.*\n\n2.

On March 27, 2014 the Argentine Republic lodged an Application for Annulment and Stay of Enforcement of the Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID Case\u00a0No. ARB/04/1 Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic on November 27, 2013.\n2. On April 2, 2014 the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for\u00a0Annulment pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 50(2)(a) and (b). In accordance with\u00a0Arbitration Rule 54(2) the Secretary-General informed the parties of the provisional\u00a0stay of enforcement of the Award.\n3. The ad hoc Committee was constituted on May 27, 2014. In accordance with Article\u00a052(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council\u00a0appointed as members of the ad hoc Committee Mr. Eduardo Zuleta Jaramillo a\u00a0national of Colombia, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos Howell of a national of Guatemala, and\u00a0Ms. Teresa Cheng a national of China. Mr. Eduardo Zuleta Jaramillo was appointed\u00a0Chairman of the Committee.\n4. In accordance with the procedural timetable agreed by the Parties, on July 11, 2014\u00a0both Parties submitted observations on the Application for Stay of Enforcement of\u00a0the Award lodged by the Argentine Republic. On August 12, 2014, both Parties\u00a0submitted a second round of observations on the briefs of the counterparty.\n5. On October 6, 2014 the ad hoc Committee held with the parties a first procedural\u00a0session and a hearing on the Application for Stay of Enforcement of the Award at the\u00a0Centre's headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n6. On October 21, 2014, the ad hoc Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 on issues\u00a0of procedure.\n7. On December 4, 2014, the Committee rendered a Decision on the Application for\u00a0Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n8. On December 22, 2014, the Argentine Republic submitted its Memorial on\u00a0Annulment, followed by a courtesy translation on January 6, 2015. On March 9, 2015,\u00a0Total S.A. submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, followed by a courtesy\u00a0translation on March 20, 2015. On May 4, 2015, the Argentine Republic filed its\u00a0Reply on Annulment followed by a courtesy translation on May 19, 2015, as well as\u00a0the revised original version (in Spanish). On July 10, 2015 Total submitted its\u00a0Rejoinder on Annulment followed by a courtesy translation on July 22, 2015.\n9. On July 27, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent the Parties a letter from Ms. Teresa\u00a0Cheng advising the parties that on April 2015 she had been contacted by lawyers from\u00a0Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Hong Kong office) in a matter already\u00a0concluded. Ms. Cheng said the matter involved oral advice on an issue that was not\u00a0related to investment law or disputes between States and investors and that it mainly\u00a0concerned disputes between shareholders that had nothing to do with Total S.A. or\u00a0with the Argentine Republic. The lawyers of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP\u00a0involved in that matter are not the lawyers of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP\u00a0(New York office) that are before the Committee in this proceeding. Ms. Cheng stated\u00a0that she understood that this situation did not pose a conflict of interest, but out of an\u00a0abundance of caution she considered it appropriate to communicate this circumstance\u00a0to the parties.\n10. On July 29, 2015, the Argentine Republic sent a letter to the members of the\u00a0Annulment Committees of which Ms. Cheng is a member, in which it requested Ms.\u00a0Cheng to clarify certain questions referred to in said letter.\n11. On August 4, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent to the Parties the response furnished\u00a0by Ms. Cheng to questions raised by the Argentine Republic on July 29, 2015.\n12. On August 5, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent to the parties Ms. Teresa Cheng's letter\u00a0in response to a request from the Argentine Republic on August 3, requiring that Ms.\u00a0Cheng disclose all relationships she has or had with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer\u00a0LLP.\n13. On August 6, 2015 the Argentine Republic filed a Proposal for Disqualification of\u00a0Ms. Teresa Cheng in English and Spanish, under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention\u00a0and Arbitration Rule 9. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(6) on the same day, the Centre\u00a0informed the parties that the proceeding was suspended until the majority of the ad\u00a0hoc Committee, comprising Mr. Zuleta and Mr. Castellanos, decided on the\u00a0Disqualification Proposal.\n14. On August 7, 2015, Mr. Zuleta and Mr. Castellanos, established a procedural\u00a0timetable for the submissions of the Parties in respect of the Disqualification\u00a0Proposal. An expedited timetable was set in response to the state of the proceedings\u00a0at the time Ms. Cheng's declaration and Argentina's disqualification proposal were\u00a0filed.\n15. Complying with the procedural timetable, the Argentine Republic submitted\u00a0additional observations on the Proposal to Disqualify on August 12, 2015 and a\u00a0courtesy translation on August 14, 2015. Total submitted observations on the\u00a0Proposal to Disqualify on August 17, 2015 and a courtesy translation on August 19,\u00a02015. Ms. Teresa Cheng furnished explanations in accordance with Arbitration Rule\u00a09(3) in English and Spanish on August 18, 2015.\n16. The Argentine Republic sent a letter dated August 19, 2015 to Ms. Cheng in English\u00a0and Spanish, requesting additional information. Ms. Cheng sent a reply to Argentina's\u00a0request in English and Spanish on August 20, 2015.\n17. Both parties submitted final observations on the Disqualification Proposal on August\u00a024, 2015 and courtesy translations on August 26, 2015.\nII. POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON THE PROPOSED\u00a0DISQUALIFICATION OF TERESA CHENG\nA. Position of the Argentine Republic\n18. The Argentine Republic (\u201cArgentina\u201d or the \u201cRespondent\u201d) requested that Ms. Teresa\u00a0Cheng to resign from her position as a member of the ad hoc Committee in these\u00a0annulment proceedings, and if she did not do so, the majority of the Committee should\u00a0accept the proposal to disqualify her. In addition, Argentina requested that Total S.A.\u00a0(\u201cTotal\u201d or the \u201cClaimant\u201d) be ordered to pay all costs and expenses arising in\u00a0connection with the Disqualification Proposal based on its failure to disclose the\u00a0relationships between its law firm and one of the members of the ad hoc Committee.\n19. The Respondent stated that it understands that the timetable established to consider\u00a0the disqualification proposal was based on the late disclosure by Ms. Cheng of her\u00a0relationship with the law firm representing Total in the present annulment proceeding.\u00a0Nevertheless, Respondent asked the majority of the Committee to take the necessary\u00a0time to consider and decide this delicate issue that affects the integrity of the\u00a0proceedings, and even to evaluate the postponement of the hearing on annulment\u00a0fixed for September 1 and 2, 2015.1\na. Grounds for the Disqualification Proposal and Application of the Procedure\u00a0under the ICSID Convention to the disqualification of a member of the ad\u00a0hoc Committee\n20. In its Additional Observations on the Proposal of the Argentine Republic to\u00a0Disqualify Teresa Cheng, Argentina responded to the arguments raised by the\u00a0Claimant about the timing of the submission of the Disqualification Proposal and its\u00a0purpose, as well as to the application of the disqualification mechanism provided for\u00a0in the ICSID Convention for annulment proceedings.\n21. With regard to the timing of submission of the Disqualification Proposal, Argentina\u00a0stated that this is due to the late disclosure of Ms. Cheng, who waited until the\u00a0annulment submissions were filed and the hearing was only one month away to\u00a0inform the Parties about advice given to Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer\u00a0(\u201cFreshfields\u201d) in April 2015 and other revelations which she should have done\u00a0before providing the advice in question and before accepting her appointment as\u00a0member of this ad hoc Committee.2\n22. Argentina emphasizes that, contrary to Claimant's statements, the Disqualification\u00a0Proposal was not filed for any tactical or dilatory reasons, but as a result of Ms.\u00a0Cheng's disclosures.3 The submission of disqualification proposals is not an\u00a0exclusive practice of the Argentine Republic in the context of investment arbitration.4\n1 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, 117-8.\n2 Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, 118.\n3 Ibid., 119.\n4 Ibid., 120.\nDisqualification proposals submitted by Respondent have been based upon justified grounds, in such a way that in one of those cases the proposal was accepted and in\u00a0the other the arbitrator resigned.5 Argentina also refers to the case of EDF\u00a0International S.A., SAUR Internacional S.A. and Leon Participaciones Argentinas\u00a0S.A. v. Argentine Republic, an annulment committee of which Ms. Cheng is also a\u00a0member and in which the existence of a conflict of interest affecting one of the\u00a0arbitrators of the tribunal has been extensively discussed.6\n23. Furthermore, according to Argentina, the procedure provided for in the ICSID\u00a0Convention for disqualifying an arbitrator is applicable to the disqualification of a\u00a0member of an annulment committee.\n24. Argentina indicates that Total failed to identify a single case that concluded that the\u00a0mechanism for disqualification is not applicable to annulment proceedings. On the\u00a0contrary, the Respondent points to two cases in which this mechanism has already\u00a0been used in the disqualification of members of annulment committees\u2014Compama\u00a0de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic\u00a0(\u201cVivendi I\u201d) and Nations Energy v. Panama1 \u2014 and recalls the considerations of\u00a0those decisions in that regard.8\n25. The Respondent criticizes Claimant's stance on the inapplicability of the mechanism\u00a0for disqualification to annulment proceedings based on the procedure of appointment\u00a0of annulment committee members. Argentina argues that regardless of who appoints\u00a0an annulment committee member, or the fact that the latter does not have jurisdiction\u00a0to decide the merits of the dispute, does not mean that said persons are exempted from\u00a0acting with independence and impartiality.9\n26. Argentina also notes that because the annulment committee members are selected\u00a0from the Panel of Arbitrators, they must meet the general qualities required by Article\u00a014(1) of the Convention, namely that they must inspire upon full confidence in both\u00a0their impartiality and independent judgment10 These requirements are even more\u00a0relevant in respect of annulment committees, for if a circumstance of this kind would\u00a0eventually affect a member of a committee, the disqualification mechanism would be\u00a0the only remedy available and there would be no possibility of subsequent control, as\u00a0is the case with arbitration proceedings.11\nb. The standard for disqualification proposed by Argentina\n21. The Republic of Argentina proposed the disqualification of Ms. Teresa Cheng as a member of the ad hoc Annulment Committee because, in its opinion, Ms. Cheng\n5 Ibid., \"21-22.\n6 Ibid., K22.\nI Ibid., \u20222-1.\n8 Ibid., \u2022\u202223-27.\n9 Ibid., \u2022\u202228-29.\n10 Ibid., \u202230.\nII Ibid., \u202231.\u00a0manifestly lacks the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14 of the ICSID\u00a0Convention.12\n28. Regarding the legal standard applicable to the disqualification, Argentina states that\u00a0Article 57 of the ICSID Convention requires that there be a manifest absence of the\u00a0qualities required of arbitrators by Article 14(1) of the Convention, insofar as the lack\u00a0of the required qualities can be perceived as obvious and evident.13\n29. The disqualification of a member of an annulment committee proceeds given that\u00a0Article 52 of the ICSID Convention incorporates Rule 9 of the Arbitration Rules into\u00a0the annulment process. Referring to the disqualification of the president of the ad hoc\u00a0committee in the Vivendi I case, the Respondent concludes that committee members\u00a0must be and appear to be independent and impartial, and that no other procedure exists\u00a0under the Convention to decide on proposals for disqualification.14\n30. In accordance with Article 14(1), the persons designated to serve as arbitrators and\u00a0members of annulment committees must inspire full confidence in their impartiality\u00a0and in their independence of judgment, so that the lack of these qualities warrants\u00a0their disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.15 According to\u00a0Argentina, there is consensus that Article 14(1) encompasses a duty to act with both\u00a0independence and impartiality.16\n31. The Respondent explains that the standard that must be satisfied under Articles 57\u00a0and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention for a challenge to be successful is the appearance\u00a0of dependence or predisposition or bias.17 Citing the disqualification decision in the\u00a0case of Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani\u00a0v. Republic of Kazakhstan, Argentina indicates that this appearance must be\u00a0evidenced by a third party based on a reasonable evaluation of the facts in the present\u00a0case.18 For this reason, arbitrators and members of annulment committees have a legal\u00a0duty to disclose any circumstances that might give rise to a challenge to their\u00a0independence or impartiality, including \u201c... the duty to disclose any contractual or\u00a0work relationship with any of the law firms involved in the dispute without any time\u00a0limits, given that the relevant factor is not how such relationships are valued by the\u00a0arbitrator or member of the Annulment Committee but rather how they may be\u00a0perceived by the parties.\u201d19\n12 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, 17.\n13 Ibid., 19.\n14 Ibid., 110.\n15 Ibid., 111.\n16 Ibid., 112.\n17 Ibid., 1113-14; Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, 131: \u201cIn\u00a0this regard, it is sufficient to refer to the most recent decisions on disqualification rendered in ICSID proceedings, which\u00a0confirm that the challenge mechanism of ICSID does not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient\u00a0to establish that there is an evident appearance of dependence or bias based on a reasonable evaluation of the facts of the\u00a0case from the point of view of a third-party observer.\u201d\n18 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, 115.\n19 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, 116.\nc. Grounds for the Proposal for Disqualification\n32. Argentina bases its proposal for disqualification on three main grounds: (i) the alleged\u00a0contractual relationship between Freshfields, the Claimant's law firm in this\u00a0annulment proceeding, and a member of the ad-hoc Committee; (ii) Ms. Teresa\u00a0Cheng's relationship with Claimants' counsels, her breaches of the duty of disclosure\u00a0and her lack of transparency; and (iii) failure to disclose other relationships with\u00a0Claimant's law firm.\ni. Contractual relationship between Ms. Cheng and Freshfields\n33. Respondent argues that Ms. Cheng has direct links with Freshfields and has been\u00a0instructed by said law firm, and therefore she should be removed from this annulment\u00a020\u00a0committee.\n34. In fact, Argentina argues that Ms. Cheng failed to disclose remunerated contractual\u00a0relationships with the law firm representing the Claimant, including those links that\u00a0occurred prior to her appointment as a member of the ad hoc Committee, as well as\u00a0a contemporaneous relationship that was only disclosed until three months after it had\u00a0occurred.21\n35. The remunerated contractual relationships referred to by Argentina are: (i) oral advice\u00a0given on a matter of domestic law to a Chinese company (the \u201cChinese Company\u201d),\u00a0which was requested by the lawyers of Freshfields' Hong Kong office;22 and (ii)\u00a0acting as legal counsel instructed by Freshfields in a case concerning the Decision on\u00a0Stay Application of the Hong Kong Telecommunications Appeal Board in 2008.23\n36. Argentina also refers to the two-month internship of Ms. Cheng's son in Freshfields'\u00a0Paris office in 201124 and her relationships with some members/partners and/or\u00a0former members/partners of Freshfields in professional associations.25\n37. According to the Argentine Republic, none of these relationships were included by\u00a0Ms. Cheng in her statement under Arbitration Rule 6(2)(b) of May 22, 2014.26\n38. According to the Respondent, this situation is apposite to the one that led to the\u00a0disqualification of one of the arbitrators in the case of Favianca v. Venezuela,\u00a0concerning a consultancy agreement with a law firm representing interests against\u00a0one of the parties to the arbitration. On that occasion, the arbitrator in question\n20 Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, \\*3; \\*'\\*33-34.\n21 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, \\*25; \\*30.\n22 Ibid., \\*\\*2-3.\n23 Ibid., \\*5.\n24 Ibid., \\*5.\n25 In this regard, Argentina highlights a series of relationships in this type of association between Ms. Cheng and Mr. Jan\u00a0Paulsson, \u201c... who has great influence in the firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.\u201d Argentine Republic's Additional\u00a0Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, \\*54.\n26 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, \\*\\*18-21, \\*25.\u00a0resigned for the sake of transparency and the others considered his future contractual\u00a0link would affect his independence and impartiality.27\n39. Argentina deems that in the context of ICSID there is no doubt that contractual or\u00a0work relationships between an arbitrator and a law firm involved in a specific case\u00a0must be disclosed in the first session of the tribunal or prior to that, pursuant to\u00a0Arbitration Rule 6(2). This is so because no person can be a judge of his or her own\u00a0conflict and because what must be taken into account in particular is not what the\u00a0arbitrators deem to be relevant but what the parties consider may affect their\u00a0independent judgment.28\n40. Specifically with regard to the advice given by Ms. Cheng to the Chinese Company,\u00a0Argentina points out that the difference underlined by Total and Ms. Cheng between\u00a0barrister and solicitor is irrelevant because it was Freshfields who sought for and gave\u00a0instructions to Ms. Cheng. Thanks to Freshfields, Ms. Cheng received US$5,000,\u00a0which cannot be taken as a minor sum. In any case, Argentina refers to\u00a0disqualification decisions that confirmed that when considering a conflict of interest,\u00a0whether the link involves payment or not and whether or not it makes an impact on\u00a0the arbitrator's income is irrelevant.29\n41. Contrary to what Claimant states, the link between an arbitrator and the counsel of\u00a0one of the parties has been considered a link that affects the arbitrator's independence,\u00a0or at least its appearance. In this regard, Argentina refers, inter alia, to the case of\u00a0Blue Bank v. Venezuela, where the proposal for disqualification of an arbitrator was\u00a0admitted because of the latter's links with the counsel of a party to an arbitration\u00a0against Venezuela and to the Grand River v. United States where the disqualification\u00a0proposal was admitted based on advice that did not concern a dispute between an\u00a0investor and a State.30\n42. Finally, Respondent refers to Ms. Cheng's modification of the declaration made when\u00a0accepting her appointment as a member of this Annulment Committee, since she did\u00a0not include the names of the law firms representing the parties, as she had done before\u00a0when accepting other appointments to committees in matters involving Argentina as\u00a0a party.31\n43. According to Argentina these facts and the past links considered together leave no\u00a0doubt that it is impossible to trust Ms. Cheng's independence and impartiality of\u00a0judgment.32\n27 Ibid., \\*\\*22-2-l.\n28 Ibid., \\*26.\n29 Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, \\*'\\*38-43.\n30 Ibid., \\*\\*44-50.\n31 Ibid., \\*51.\n32 Ibid., \\*\\*50-55.\nii. Breaches of the Duty of Disclosure and Lack of Transparency\n44. Argentina considers that Ms. Cheng's relationship with Freshfields, her breaches of\u00a0the duty of disclosure, and her lack of transparency require that she be removed from\u00a0the ad hoc Committee. According to Argentina, Ms. Cheng should have disclosed the\u00a0acceptance of instructions from Freshfields in the course of the annulment proceeding\u00a0and by not doing so, she precluded the Respondent from objecting to such\u00a0relationship.33\n45. For Respondent, it is unacceptable that a member of an ICSID annulment committee\u00a0states that she was not obliged to reveal that she had been engaged by the law firm\u00a0representing one of the parties during the course of the annulment proceedings, and\u00a0that this had only been revealed because of a potential appointment as arbitrator.34\u00a0This situation is aggravated by the fact that Freshfields represents interests against\u00a0Argentina in nine other arbitrations.35\n46. Concerning the statement made by Ms. Cheng on Article 3.3.9 of the IBA Guidelines,\u00a0the Respondent considers that these guidelines are not applicable, but notes that they\u00a0do not make a distinction between the office to which lawyers of a law firm belong\u00a0to for the purposes of establishing the duty to reveal and the existence of conflicts of\u00a0interest.36 In any case, such a distinction would be at odds with the standard set forth\u00a0in the ICSID Convention. According to Argentina, if the criteria of the IBA\u00a0Guidelines were to be applied, the situation of Ms. Cheng would fall within Article\u00a02.3.2 of the waivable red list which covers situations in which the arbitrator currently\u00a0advises the law firm acting as counsel for one of the parties. This situation could only\u00a0be expressly waived by the parties, after they become aware of the conflict. By not\u00a0informing of this situation, Ms. Cheng deprived the parties of their right to provide\u00a0their views on the matter.37\n47. In addition, the information provided by Ms. Cheng was ambiguous and incomplete.38\u00a0In fact, it was only until August 5th and at the request of Argentina that Ms. Cheng\u00a0disclosed other relationships with Freshfields,39 including one in which she acted as\u00a0lawyer in a matter that ended in 2008.\n48. Argentina disagrees with Ms. Cheng that there is no obligation to disclose\u00a0information dating more than three years ago. This period results from the IBA\u00a0Guidelines, which are merely indicative for this arbitration and were not the rule that\u00a0Ms. Cheng herself had in mind at the time of accepting her appointment as a member\u00a0of this ad hoc Committee.40 This information, as well as the fact that her own son had\u00a0participated in an internship at Freshfields' Paris office, was not revealed by Ms.\n33 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, \\*'\\*'33-35.\n34 Ibid. ,\\*36.\n35 Ibid.,\\*35.\n36 Ibid., \\*\\*37-39.\n37 Ibid., \\*\\*40-41.\n38 Ibid., \\*\\*42-43.\n39 Ibid., \\*45.\n40 Ibid., \\*\\*47-52.\nCheng at the time of accepting other four appointments in cases involving the Argentine Republic.41\n49. According to the Respondent, the timing of the declaration made by arbitrators and\u00a0members of annulment committees is essential to the transparency and impartiality\u00a0of the proceedings, to the extent that a contrary conduct constitutes a breach of\u00a0Arbitration Rule 6(2).42 Ms. Cheng justifies her failure to disclose professional links\u00a0with Freshfields by invoking \u201c... formal distinctions derived from specific domestic\u00a0rules.\u201d43 But in any case, from the text cited by Ms. Cheng in her observations to the\u00a0Parties, it follows that the solicitor is personally liable as a matter of professional\u00a0conduct for the payment of a barrister's fees and the barrister only acts under the\u00a0solicitor's instructions.44\n50. Thus, Argentina concludes that \u201ceven considering the applicable Hong Kong rules,\u00a0Freshfields was Ms. Cheng's professional client.\u201d45 The arguments presented by Ms.\u00a0Cheng and Total do not dispel the doubts about her lack of independent judgment;\u00a0the grounds for her disqualification exist from the moment when Ms. Cheng decided\u00a0to receive instructions from Freshfields and failed to disclose this information in a\u00a0timely manner.46\niii. Failure to inform about other relationships with Freshfields\n51. The duty to disclose for persons appointed as arbitrators or members of annulment\u00a0committees under Arbitration Rule 6(2) should include details of any professional\u00a0relationships with counsel to a party in the case in which he/she has been appointed,\u00a0including, out of an abundance of caution, public information.47 This duty to disclose\u00a0is a continuing obligation48 and has no cut-off date.49\n52. Regarding the scope of the duty of disclosure, Argentina states that the purpose of\u00a0Arbitration Rule 6(2)(b) is to expand the scope of the declarations of the arbitrators\u00a0to include any circumstances that might give rise to justifiable doubts, taken from the\u00a0standard for disclosure of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Thus, relying on the\u00a0Universal Compression v. Venezuela decision, Argentina asserts that arbitrators and\u00a0members of annulment committees have a duty to disclose any circumstance that can\u00a0give rise to questions on their independence or impartiality, including any relationship\u00a0with any of the law firms involved in the dispute in question.50 The former allows\n41Ibid., \\*\\*52-53.\n42 The Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, \\*59.\n43 Ibid., \\*62.\n44 Ibid., \\*\\* 64-75.\n45 Ibid., \\*75.\n46 Ibid., \\*\\*78-79.\n47 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, \\*\\*55-56.\n48 Ibid., \\*58.\n49 Ibid., \\* 59.\n50 The Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, \\*\\*82-84.\u00a0parties to have access to all relevant information concerning an arbitrator's\u00a0appointment.51\n53. The Respondent did not have the opportunity to submit its observations on the\u00a0contractual relationship of Freshfields with Ms. Cheng, to which it would have\u00a0emphatically objected.52 Likewise, Ms. Cheng failed to tell the truth in the declaration\u00a0filed under Arbitration Rule 6(2) at the time she was appointed to this Committee.53\n54. Argentina concludes that Ms. Cheng should have disclosed all her links, both past\u00a0and present, with the Claimant's counsel in a timely fashion.54\nB. Position of Total\n55. Total asked the majority of the members of the Committee to reject the\u00a0disqualification proposal formulated by the Argentine Republic because it had no\u00a0basis on the ICSID Convention or to reject the disqualification proposal based on the\u00a0merits. In addition, Total requested that Argentina be ordered to pay the costs in\u00a0which it incurred because of this Disqualification Proposal.\n56. Total is of the opinion that the Disqualification Proposal concerning Ms. Cheng is\u00a0consistent with the conduct of the Respondent in other ICSID proceedings where it\u00a0has sought to challenge a member of the panel based on the weakest of grounds.55\u00a0Total is of the opinion that Argentina should not be allowed to derail the pending\u00a0annulment hearing and therefore asks the other members of the Committee to decide\u00a0this matter promptly.56\na. The standard for disqualification according to Total\n57. According to Total there is no basis in the ICSID Convention for seeking\u00a0disqualification of annulment committee members. This is so because Arbitration\u00a0Rule 9 applies only to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, which does not appear in\u00a0the provisions of the ICSID Convention applicable to the annulment proceeding\u00a0through Article 52(4).57\n58. The fact that annulment committee members are appointed by the chairman of\u00a0ICSID's Administrative Council, based on the qualifications of Article 52(3) of the\u00a0Convention supports this conclusion.58 Committee members only have the limited\n51 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, \\*60.\n52 Ibid., \\* 62.\n53 Ibid., \\*63.\n54 Argentine Republic's Additional Observations on the Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, \\*87.\n55 In Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, Total refers to \u201celeven... tactical... challenges\u201d brought by\u00a0Argentina against Mr. Andres Rigo, Mr. Guido Tawil, Mr. Albert Jan van den Berg, Ms. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Mr.\u00a0Yves Fortier, Mr. Pierre Tercier, Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov, Mr. Judd Kessler, Mr. Claus von Wobeser, and Mr. Francisco\u00a0Orrego Vicuna. None of these challenges was successful. See: Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated\u00a0August 17, 2015, \\*1 and footnote 1.\n56 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, \\*2.\n57 Ibid., \\*16-19.\n58 Ibid., \\*17.\ntask of reviewing the procedural propriety of the award.59 The Articles of the Convention incorporated into annulment proceedings by Article 52(4) of the ICSID\u00a0Convention, as well as the arbitral rules applicable to annulment proceedings through\u00a0Arbitration Rule 53, apply mutatis mutandis, i.e., making all the changes that are\u00a0necessary in view of the differences between arbitration and annulment\u00a0proceedings.60\n59. In the event the remaining members of the Committee conclude that the rules on\u00a0disqualification do apply to annulment proceedings, the Claimant sets out its position\u00a0on this matter.\n60. Total agrees with Argentina that the standards for disqualification of a member of an\u00a0annulment committee, which provide that disqualification may be sought when there\u00a0is a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention,\u00a0are applicable, which, as generally accepted, includes the qualities of impartiality and\u00a0independence.61 The manifest standard implies that it does not suffice to prove the\u00a0appearance of dependence or bias, but instead the existence of bias or dependence\u00a0must be evident or obvious, in the sense that it can be discerned with little effort and\u00a0without deeper analysis.62 This burden is high and must be based on objective facts:\u00a0\u201cArticle 57 imposes an \u201cobjective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the\u00a0evidence by a third party.\u201d The subjective perceptions or suppositions of the party\u00a0requesting disqualification are irrelevant.\u201d63\n61. As regards to the IBA Guidelines, Total acknowledges that they reflect international\u00a0standards on conflict of interest64 and states that even Argentina recognizes that they\u00a0are not binding.65 However, in its letter of August 24, 2015, it pointed out that such\u00a0Guidelines refer to situations in which \u201cjustifiable doubts\u201d may exist about an\u00a0arbitrator's independence or impartiality, and not to the standard provided for in the\u00a0ICSID Convention concerning a manifest lack of either quality.66\nb. Opposition to the grounds for the Disqualification Proposal\n62. Total replies to the grounds of Argentina's Disqualification Proposal with two main\u00a0arguments: (i) Ms. Cheng's advice to a third party in an unrelated matter does not\u00a0warrant disqualification and (ii) the timing of Ms. Cheng's declaration does not\u00a0warrant disqualification.\n59 Ibid., 117.\n60 Ibid., fl 20-21.\n61 Ibid., 123\n62 Ibid., 1124-25.\n63 Ibid., 124.\n64 Letter from Total dated August 24, 2015, p. 1.\n65 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, 147; Letter from Total dated August 24,\u00a02015, p. 1.\n66 Letter from Total dated August 24, 2015, p. 1.\ni. Ms. Cheng's advice to a third party in an unrelated matter does not warrant disqualification\n63. Total indicates that Ms. Cheng's profession is as a barrister in Hong Kong and in\u00a0view of her knowledge and experience of procedures applicable in the courts she is\u00a0available for consultation on complex issues by clients through solicitors. Such\u00a0consultation is for the benefit of the client and not the solicitor's law firm, and the\u00a0cost of such consultation is passed through as a disbursement to the client.67\n64. According to Total, Argentina has mischaracterized two facts. The first is that the\u00a0client that consulted Ms. Cheng\u2014the Chinese Company\u2014is not a party to this\u00a0arbitration and neither is the law firm Freshfields, thus she was not obliged under\u00a0Arbitration Rule 6 to reveal her contact with them. The second fact is that Ms. Cheng\u00a0and Freshfields have not acted as co-counsel in the matter in question.68\n65. Total argues that Argentina cannot find a single case in which an arbitrator has been\u00a0disqualified on analogous facts.69 In the case of Grand River Enterprises v. United\u00a0States, to which the less stringent standards under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\u00a0applied, the disqualification of the arbitrator was accepted because he was then\u00a0engaged in separate legal proceedings against the respondent State where the\u00a0underlying issue was found to be similar to the one in the arbitration.70 In addition,\u00a0Argentina refers to the cases of Favianca v. Venezuela and Nations Energy v.\u00a0Panama, which relate to different factual situations and that involved the resignation\u00a0of the arbitrators challenged.71\n66. Total notes that Argentina neglects to discuss the conclusions of the challenge in the\u00a0Vivendi I case, where the majority of the committee found that mere professional\u00a0relationships between an arbitrator's law firm and a party is not sufficient to sustain\u00a0a challenge.72 There is far less basis for the approach taken by Argentina here than\u00a0there was in the Vivendi v. Argentina case. There is no kind of relationship between\u00a0Ms. Cheng and the Claimant\u2014Total\u2014and the advice she gave the Chinese Company\u00a0implied around US$5,000. Her relationship with Freshfields was \u201cde minimis\u201d and\u00a0her links with Total non-existent.73\n67. Finally, Total disputes the application of Article 2.3.2 of the IBA Guidelines invoked\u00a0by Argentina, because in its opinion, this provision covers situations in which there\u00a0is an attorney-client relationship between the arbitrator and the law firm acting as\u00a0counsel for one of the parties. Since Ms. Cheng has never represented or advised\u00a0Freshfields this provision is not applicable to the case in question.74\n67 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, 11 6-7.\n68 Ibid., 18.\n69 Ibid., 126.\n70 Ibid., 127.\n71 Ibid., 11 28-33.\n72 Ibid., 133.\n73 Ibid., 1133-34.\n74 Ibid., 135.\n68. According to Total, Articles 2.3.2 and 3.3.9 of the IBA Guidelines do not apply to the\u00a0facts of this case, since Ms. Cheng confirmed that she did not have a co-counsel nor\u00a0an attorney-client relationship with Freshfields.75\nii. The timing of the Declaration\n69. Total argues that the obligation to disclose under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) arises\u00a0out of relationships with the parties to the dispute and not de minimis indirect work\u00a0for a client of one of the counsel to one of the parties to the dispute.76 There was\u00a0therefore no duty on Ms. Cheng to disclose the instruction for the Chinese Company\u00a0and she did so only ex abundante cautela.77 Furthermore, Ms. Cheng's failure to\u00a0distinguish between Argentina's counsel and the State as a party at the time of the\u00a0disclosures is explained by the fact that Argentina's Procurador del Tesoro is not\u00a0only an agent of the State but also acts as its representative.78\n70. Argentina cites no authority for the proposition that the duty to disclose is without\u00a0any time limits. This proposition is at odds with common sense and the respective\u00a0time limitation set by the IBA Guidelines following consultation with all stakeholders\u00a0in the arbitral process as a sensible cut-off date.79 On the contrary, the authority\u00a0Argentina cites represents the position of a single commentator whose views run\u00a0counter to the proposition that the standard against which disqualification proposals\u00a0are to be assessed in ICSID arbitration is an objective one and states that the\u00a0disclosure of any relationship with the parties should be made out of an abundance of\u00a080\ncaution.80\n71. Total distinguishes this case from the case presented in Universal Compression v.\u00a0Venezuela, where the arbitrator was appointed by the claimant and failed to disclose\u00a0that he had acted as co-counsel with the claimant's counsel in a separate investment\u00a0arbitration. The challenge was rejected because Venezuela did not demonstrate that\u00a0this situation would give the claimant a privileged position and because the\u00a0arbitrator's failure to disclose was deemed an \u201chonest exercise of discretion\u201d by the\u00a0arbitrator that did not impact his independence or impartiality.81\n72. The Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID reached the same conclusion,\u00a0rejecting the proposal for disqualification of the arbitrator appointed by Venezuela\u00a0for having failed to disclose repeat appointments by said State. In his decision he\u00a0expressed the opinion that these appointments were in the public domain, that the\u00a0Venezuelan appointments represented only a fraction of the arbitrator's income and\n75 Ibid., 135.\n76 Letter from Total dated August 24, 2015, p. 2.\n77 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, 138.\n78 Letter from Total dated August 24, 2015, p. 2.\n79 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, 139.\n80 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, 139.\n81 Ibid., 1140-41.\ntherefore the arbitrator's decision not to disclose in advance was deemed an \u201chonest exercise of discretion.\u201d82\n73. According to Total, the case of Ms. Cheng is still more benign. Her only relationship\u00a0with Freshfields was as an advisor to a third party in an unrelated matter in which she\u00a0was briefly involved.83 This relationship is not as relevant as that which existed in the\u00a0case of Universal Compression v. Venezuela, because in advising the Chinese\u00a0Company Ms. Cheng's work would represent a fraction of less than one quarter of\u00a0one percent of her income.84 As in that case, the decision of Ms. Cheng not to disclose\u00a0brief and remote relations with third parties also represented by Freshfields deserves\u00a0the same characterization as an honest exercise of discretion.85\n74. Specifically, Total has five arguments to contest the reasons given by Argentina to\u00a0disqualify Ms. Cheng from this Committee because of the advice she gave to the\u00a0Chinese Company: (i) the contention that Ms. Cheng chose not to disclose the\u00a0engagement because of her role in this proceeding is mere speculation and as such\u00a0cannot give rise to a finding of manifest partiality or dependence;86 (ii) Ms. Cheng\u00a0was not obliged to disclose de minimis advice given to a third party and only did so\u00a0out of an abundance of caution;87 (iii) even if the standard of Article 3.3.9 of the IBA\u00a0Guidelines were applicable, Ms. Cheng would not obliged to disclose her advice to a\u00a0third party because she did not act as co-counsel to a law firm representing one of the\u00a0Parties;88 (iv) Section 2.3.2 of the IBA Guidelines is not applicable;89 and (v)\u00a0Argentina is speculating on the possible relationship between the object of the advice\u00a0rendered by Ms. Cheng and this annulment proceeding.90\n75. Finally, Total refers to the reasons why the new disclosures made by Ms. Cheng in\u00a0the letter dated August 5, 2015 do not warrant disqualification: (i) Argentina does not\u00a0explain in what way the information provided by Ms. Cheng in such letter was\u00a0ambiguous and incomplete;91 (ii) Ms. Cheng revealed facts prior to the last three years\u00a0in an exercise of honest discretion, prompted by the Defendant's persistent\u00a0questioning;92 and (iii) contrary to what Argentina has suggested, there was no reason\u00a0to reveal that Ms. Cheng's son interned at Freshfields.93 These disclosures do not\u00a0imply the recognition by Ms. Cheng of a prior omission, but were the result of\u00a0questions from Argentina and demonstrate the efforts she has made to ensure\u00a0transparency amidst concerns about her independence and impartiality.94\n82 Ibid., 142.\n83 Ibid., 141.\n84 Ibid., 143.\n85 Ibid., 143.\n86 Ibid., 145.\n87 Ibid., 146.\n88 Ibid., 147.\n89 Ibid., 148.\n90 Ibid., 11 49-50.\n91 Ibid., 1151-52.\n92 Ibid., 153.\n93 Ibid., 155.\n94 Letter from Total dated August 24, 2015, p. 2.\nIII. TERESA CHENG'S RESPONSE\n76. On August 18, 2015, Ms. Cheng responded to the comments of the Parties on the\u00a0Disqualification Proposal made by Argentina. Ms. Cheng stated that she would not\u00a0comment on the merits of the challenge, and made a number of clarifications on the\u00a0allegations of the Parties.\n77. First, Ms. Cheng stated that in accordance with the Rules of the Hong Kong Bar\u00a0Association, as a barrister she has no contractual relationship with the instructing\u00a0lawyer (solicitor) or his firm. Because her advice is not addressed to the instructing\u00a0solicitor but to the lay client and it is the lay client who pays for her services, Article\u00a02.3.2 of the IBA Guidelines is not applicable.95\n78. In addition, Ms. Cheng stated that under Arbitration Rule 6(2)(a) there is no\u00a0requirement to disclose any relationship with the parties' legal representatives, but in\u00a0her declaration of May 22, 2014 she mentioned Argentina's Procuradora del Tesoro\u00a0because the latter is one of the official representatives of Argentina and may be seen\u00a0as equivalent to the state party.96\n79. Ms. Cheng indicated that only when she received the written submissions on the\u00a0Disqualification Proposal did she learn that Freshfields has been acting on behalf of\u00a0a party against Argentina in nine (9) cases. Ms. Cheng also stated that the information\u00a0contained in the letter dated August 5, 2015 was submitted in response to the broad\u00a0question raised by Argentina and that when accepting the appointment in this case\u00a0she did not consider that these issues would affect her independent judgment. As a\u00a0result, they were not disclosed.\n80. On the IBA Guidelines, Ms. Cheng stated that she adopted the guidance of such\u00a0Guidelines in compliance with the period of three years referred to in her letter dated\u00a0August 5 and from Articles 3.3.8 and 3.3.9. In addition, Ms. Cheng explained that\u00a0Article 3.3.9 does not apply as she has not represented a party in a legal matter; she\u00a0had only provided independent advice to the lay client.97\n81. In response to another letter from Argentina dated August 19, 2015 requesting further\u00a0information, Ms. Cheng stated as follows:\na. The oral advice related to an overview of Hong Kong court procedures dealing with interlocutory applications relating to the appointment of\u00a0interim receiver;\nb. Regarding the possible appointment as an arbitrator in a case that gave rise to her note dated July 27, 2015, she had already confirmed that no\u00a0appointment was made;\n95 Teresa Cheng's Letter dated August 18, 2015, Courtesy Translation, p. 1-2 of 4.\n96 Ibid., p. 3 of 4.\n97 Ibid., p. 4 of 4.\nc. Regarding designations or acting with former Freshfields partners she\u00a0highlighted the word \u201cformer\u201d in Argentina's communication. These\u00a0professional relationships have nothing to do with Freshfields; and\nd. She had nothing further to add.98\nIV. ANALYSIS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE\nA. On the disqualification procedure applicable to members of ICSID annulment committee\n82. First, the majority of the Committee must consider Total's argument on the lack of\u00a0grounds for seeking disqualification in annulment proceedings under the ICSID\u00a0Convention. This proposition is based, first, on the fact that Article 52(4) of the ICSID\u00a0Convention, which lists the provisions applicable to annulment proceedings, did not\u00a0incorporate standards for disqualification, and second, on the way in which\u00a0annulment committee members are appointed, without the intervention of the\u00a0parties.99 Argentina disagreed with this conclusion, because, in its view, the\u00a0disqualification of a member of an annulment committee proceeds to the extent that\u00a0Article 52 of the ICSID Convention incorporates Rule 9 of the Arbitration Rules into\u00a0the annulment procedure.100\n83. The majority of the Committee shares the position of Argentina and considers that in\u00a0the ICSID Convention there is a basis on which to seek the disqualification of a\u00a0member of an ad hoc Committee.\n84. Indeed, Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention does not refer to Chapter V of the\u00a0Convention in which the rules for Replacement and Disqualification of Conciliators\u00a0and Arbitrators are included. The absence of express incorporation of these provisions\u00a0within Article 52(4) of the Convention may raise doubts and controversies about the\u00a0application of the rules for the disqualification of arbitrators to annulment committee\u00a0members.101\n85. However, even if one accepts that there were doubts in the ICSID Convention, these\u00a0were dispelled by the Administrative Council through the Arbitration Rules. As the\u00a0majority of the Committee explained in the challenge to the President in the Vivendi\u00a0I case, the ICSID Administrative Council is empowered to adopt the rules of\u00a0procedure for conciliation and arbitration proceedings (Articles 6(1)(c) and 6(3) of\u00a0the Convention).102 In exercising these powers, the Administrative Council\u00a0incorporated Rule 53 in the Arbitration Rules:\n98 Email from the ICSID Secretariat to the Parties sending Ms. Teresa Cheng's message, dated August 20, 2015.\n99 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, \\*\\* 16-21.\n100 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, \\*10.\n101 Compaaia de Aguas del Aconquija and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic, Decision on the Challenge to the\u00a0President of the Committee, (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), October 3, 2001, \\*\\*'5-7.\n102 Ibid., \\*\\*7-9.\n\u201c... these Rules shall apply mutatis mutandis to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the\u00a0Tribunal or Committee.\u201d\n86. The incorporation of the Arbitration Rules to annulment proceedings via Rule 53\u00a0extends to Arbitration Rule 9, which contains the procedure for disqualification. For\u00a0this reason, the procedure for disqualification provided for in Arbitration Rule 9 is\u00a0also applicable to members of ICSID annulment committees.103\n87. As regards to Arbitration Rule 53, Total highlights the expression mutatis mutandis\u00a0(all necessary changes having been made) because there are important differences\u00a0between arbitration proceedings and annulment proceedings that warrant the\u00a0exclusion of some of the Arbitration Rules in the context of annulment of ICSID\u00a0awards. One such difference is that members of ad hoc Committees are appointed by\u00a0an independent third party (i.e. the Chairman of the Administrative Council) subject\u00a0to the restrictions of Article 52(3) of the Convention.104\n88. The majority of the Committee disagrees with this interpretation with regard to\u00a0annulment proceedings. First, both arbitrators and annulment committee members\u00a0must comply with the qualities of independence and impartiality. Indeed, annulment\u00a0committee members must be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative\u00a0Council based on the Panel of Arbitrators,105 comprising only those who comply with\u00a0the characteristics set forth in Article 14(1).106 These qualities are not replaced\u00a0because of the mode of appointment of committee members. The fact that on one\u00a0occasion it is the parties and on another it is a third party that appoints persons who\u00a0will be part of the committee or of the tribunal does not eliminate or decrease the need\u00a0for them to comply with these characteristics.\n89. Second, it must be remembered that the procedure for disqualification is intended to\u00a0ensure that arbitrators preserve the qualities of independence and impartiality not only\u00a0at the time of appointment but throughout the proceeding.\n90. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is clear in stating that disqualification may be\u00a0proposed when there is a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of\u00a0Article 14. Therefore, it could not be argued that the drafters of the Convention only\u00a0wanted to allow the procedure to be applicable to the disqualification of arbitrators\u00a0and not annulment committee members, insofar as the latter must meet the same\n103 Ibid., \u2022\u20227-9.\n104 Opposition to Argentina's Disqualification Proposal, dated August 17, 2015, \u2022\u2022 20-21.\n105 Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n106 Article 12 and Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. See also: \u201cConsistently with this Code of Ethics, Arbitration Rule\u00a06 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which is directly applicable here, imposes the obligation to declare \u201cpast and present\u00a0professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties\u201d. The fundamental principle is that arbitrators shall\u00a0be and remain independent and impartial; in terms of Article 14(1) of the Convention, they must be able to be \u201crelied on to\u00a0exercise independent judgment\u201d. Exactly the same principle applies to the members of ad hoc Committees. The role of the\u00a0other members of this Committee is to determine whether there is \u201ca manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph\u00a0(1) of Article 14. \u201d \u201cCompania de Aguas del Aconquija and Vivendi Universal v. The Argentine Republic, Decision on the\u00a0Challenge to the President of the Committee, (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), October 3, 2001, \u202218.\u00a0qualifications that the disqualification process seeks to protect.107 The majority of the\u00a0Committee also notes that because there are no other proceedings in the ICSID system\u00a0to disqualify annulment committees members,108 the existing procedure referred to in\u00a0Articles 57, 58 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9 should\u00a0apply.\n91. Based on the above reasons, the majority of the Committee considers that there is\u00a0indeed a procedure in the ICSID Convention that allows it to consider and decide the\u00a0Disqualification Proposal filed by Argentina against Teresa Cheng and that the\u00a0procedure is the same one as specified for the disqualification of arbitrators.\nB. The Legal Standard for Disqualification under the ICSID Convention\n92. The Parties agree that the relevant provisions for assessing the disqualification\u00a0requested by Argentina are in Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention and\u00a0Arbitration Rules 6 and 9.\n93. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention states:\n\u201cA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities\u00a0required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may,\u00a0in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he\u00a0was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\u201d\n94. Also, Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention incorporates the qualities that persons\u00a0designated to serve on the Panels should have:\n\u201cPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or\u00a0finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence\u00a0in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the\u00a0Panel of Arbitrators.\u201d\n95. Rules 6 and 9 refer to declarations by the arbitrator and the disqualification procedure.\u00a0Rule 6(2) refers to the declaration that each arbitrator must sign. In the declaration\u00a0the arbitrator must state that he shall judge fairly and declare (a) his \u201cpast and present\u00a0professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties\u201d and (b) any\u00a0other circumstance that might cause his reliability for independent judgment to be\u00a0questioned by a party.\n96. Rule 9, meanwhile, requires the challenged arbitrator to \u201cwithout delay\u201d furnish\u00a0explanations and the majority of the Tribunal or Committee to \u201cpromptly\u201d consider\u00a0and vote on the proposal.\n107 Compaaia de Aguas del Aconquija and Vivendi Universal v. The Argentine Republic, Decision on the Challenge to the\u00a0President of the Committee, (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), October 3, 2001, 119-10.\n108 Ibid., 111.\n97. In its pleadings, the Parties and Ms. Cheng referred to the IBA Guidelines on\u00a0Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration, although they differ in the extent of\u00a0its application to this disqualification proposal.\n98. The majority of the Committee considers that the IBA Guidelines are a very useful\u00a0tool, insofar as they reflect a transnational consensus on their subject-matter, and\u00a0therefore have been used as reference for handling issues related to conflicts of\u00a0interest in international arbitration. However, as has been repeatedly stated in\u00a0previous decisions concerning disqualification in ICSID cases, these Guidelines are\u00a0merely indicative and not binding.109 In addition, the IBA Guidelines relate mainly\u00a0to standards applicable to the duty to disclose and not to the standards applicable to a\u00a0disqualification proposal. Indeed, the IBA Guidelines themselves clarify that the fact\u00a0of requiring disclosure by an arbitrator does not imply doubt about the latter's\u00a0impartiality and independence, as the standard of disclosure is different from the\u00a0standard for disqualification.110\n99. Accordingly, this decision is taken within the framework of the ICSID Convention\u00a0and the Arbitration Rules and especially Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID\u00a0Convention and Arbitration Rules 6 and 9.\n100.Under the ICSID Convention, the general rule is that the arbitrators or annulment committee members must have the qualities of independence and impartiality. The\u00a0parties agree with this proposition. Previous decisions on the disqualification of\u00a0arbitrators and annulment committee members have clarified the meaning of these two\u00a0qualities as well:\n\u201cImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition toward a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence\u00a0and impartiality both \u201cprotect parties against the arbitrators being influenced by\u00a0factors other than those related to the merits of the case.\u201d111 [Original text in\u00a0English]\n109 See for example: Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v.

Indeed, the standard for disclosure differs from the\u00a0standard for challenge.\u201d IBA Guidelines, 2014, Introduction, p. iii.\n111 Original text [in English]: \u201cImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party.

Kazakhstan, Decision\u00a0on the proposal to disqualify a member of the Tribunal (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13), March 20, 2014, ^53.\n101.Article 57 of the ICSID Convention specifies that the disqualification proposal must be on account of any \u201cmanifest lack\u201d of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the\u00a0Convention. The parties to this dispute agree that the fact that said lack is manifest\u00a0refers to the ease with which it can be detected, so that it is clear or obvious and can\u00a0be discerned with little effort and without deep analysis.112\n102. The majority of the Committee considers that in order to determine whether there is\u00a0a manifest lack of impartiality and independence an objective standard must be\u00a0applied, based on the reasonable evaluation that a third party would make of the\u00a0available evidence, should apply. Although, as stated by Argentina, it is not the\u00a0discretion of the arbitrator or the committee member that determines the existence of\u00a0impartiality and independence for purposes of deciding the issue of disqualification,\u00a0the mere subjective criterion of the party requesting the disqualification is neither\u00a0sufficient to meet the standard of the ICSID Convention:\n\u201cThe applicable legal standard is an \u201cobjective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\u201d As a consequence, the subjective belief\u00a0of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the\u00a0requirements of the Convention.\u201d113 [Original text in English]\n103.If the standard were to be based solely on the perception of the party requesting the disqualification, this would mean that any challenge would have to be accepted with\u00a0the only requirement being that the party making the claim affirm that his perception\u00a0is that the challenged arbitrator lacks impartiality or independence.\n104.The standard for assessing the disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is also a strict and relatively high standard and has two constituent\u00a0elements: (a) there must be a fact or set of facts (b) of such a nature or kind that a third\u00a0party can conclude after a reasonable assessment of the evidence, that there is a\u00a0manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1).114\n105.The party requesting the disqualification must therefore demonstrate (a) the facts that give rise to the challenge; and (b) that such facts reasonably assessed by a third party\n112 Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v.

According to\u00a0Article 58 of the ICSID Convention, there is no remedy or mechanism for review of\u00a0the decision on a disqualification proposal rendered by the majority of the tribunal or\u00a0the committee or by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\nC. Decision on the disqualification of Ms. Cheng\na. Ms. Cheng's relationship with Freshfields\n107.It is undisputed that the disclosures made by Ms. Cheng giving rise to the challenge made by Argentina do not refer to the Parties in this annulment proceeding. None of\u00a0Ms. Cheng's disclosures and none of the arguments put forward by the Parties refer to\u00a0relationships between Ms. Cheng and Total or between Ms. Cheng and the Argentine\u00a0Republic.\n108.Ms. Cheng's declarations indicate that neither the services provided in 2015, that were the subject of disclosure in her letter dated July 27, 2015, nor her work in 2008, which\u00a0is dealt with in her letter dated August 5, 2015, refer to this annulment proceeding, or\u00a0the arbitration that gave rise to the award, whose annulment is now being sought, or\u00a0matters or cases that somehow relate to the annulment proceeding or the arbitration.\u00a0There is no disqualification proposal based on links with the parties or because of the\u00a0subject-matters dealt with in those services provided by Ms. Cheng.\n109.The relevant fact for purposes of deciding the disqualification is, therefore, the relationship that Argentina alleges exists between Ms. Cheng and the firm Freshfields\u00a0that represents Total in these annulment proceedings.\n110.Argentina considers that a remunerated contractual relationship exists between Freshfields and Ms. Cheng that, analyzed under the standards of the ICSID Convention\u00a0and the Arbitration Rules, affects the independence and impartiality of Ms. Cheng.\n115 Fabrica de Vidrios de los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Decision on the Parties'\u00a0Proposals to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20), November 12, 2013, fl63-65.\nHowever, Argentina has not established the existence of that contractual relationship or a relationship of dependency between Ms. Cheng and Freshfields that meets the\u00a0standards of the above-mentioned standards and the ICSID Convention.\n111.Ms. Cheng stated that in 2015 she gave oral advice to the Chinese Company on an issue of Hong Kong domestic law, at the request of the lawyers of the Hong Kong\u00a0office of Freshfields.116 She further notes that the request was made to her in her\u00a0capacity as a barrister, that the total time spent on this matter was four hours, for which\u00a0she received remuneration at a barrister's hourly rate.117\n112.The majority does not find in the record evidence of the existence of a relationship of dependency of Ms. Cheng with respect to Freshfields of such importance as to make\u00a0manifest her failure to comply with the qualifications required by Article 14(1) of the\u00a0ICSID Convention.\n113.The information provided by Ms. Cheng indicates that this was an isolated task for a company that has no relationship or connection with the Parties in this proceeding\u2014\u00a0Total and the Argentine Republic\u2014and on an issue of Hong Kong domestic law,\u00a0unrelated to this proceeding or to the arbitration that gave rise to the award whose\u00a0annulment is now being sought.118\n114.Argentina points out that Ms. Cheng's professional and economic link was with Freshfields and from that concludes that Ms. Cheng is not independent. Ms. Cheng\u00a0states that her relationship was with the Chinese Company and Freshfields'\u00a0intervention was merely to request service for that company and to process the\u00a0payments that would be made by the aforementioned company as the entity\u00a0responsible for them.\n115. The information furnished by Ms. Cheng indicates that the service was provided to\u00a0the Chinese Company and that it was this company that paid for the service provided\u00a0by Ms. Cheng. Beyond her own interpretation of the role of barristers and solicitors or\u00a0the rights and obligations of each one under the law of Hong Kong, the majority of the\u00a0Committee does not find that Argentina has proved that there was a contractual\u00a0relationship between Freshfields and Ms. Cheng in connection to those services, let\u00a0alone that such a relationship -if it had existed- created a relationship of dependency\u00a0between Freshfields and Ms. Cheng, or that it is manifest that it affected her\u00a0independence.\n116.It is undisputed that it was the Hong Kong office of Freshfields that asked Ms. Cheng to provide the service to the Chinese Company. But that fact alone is not sufficient to\u00a0conclude that because Freshfields is the lawyer for the Claimant in this annulment\u00a0proceeding, Ms. Cheng should automatically be disqualified. It is neither enough, as\n116 Teresa Cheng's Letter to the Parties, dated July 27, 2015; Ms. Teresa Cheng's response to questions submitted by the\u00a0Argentine Republic, dated August 4, 2015; Teresa Cheng's Letter dated August 18, Courtesy Translation.\n117 Ms. Cheng's response to questions submitted by the Argentine Republic, dated August 4, 2015.\n118 Teresa Cheng's Letter dated August 18, 2015, Courtesy Translation. pp. 1-2 of 4; Teresa Cheng's Letter to the Parties,\u00a0dated July 27, 2015; Ms. Cheng response to questions submitted by the Argentine Republic, dated August 4, 2015.\u00a0argued by Total, to dismiss the disqualification to take into account that different\u00a0offices within the same firm are involved. The majority of the Committee must assess\u00a0all the circumstances of this specific case, not to set general parameters but to\u00a0determine whether, in light of the facts established and a reasonable assessment of the\u00a0evidence, Ms. Cheng's lack of independence is manifest.\n117.An objective analysis of all the facts and circumstances that appear to have been demonstrated in this case, including the beneficiary of the service, the duration thereof,\u00a0the amount involved, the non-intervention of any of the lawyers acting in this case or\u00a0who acted in the arbitration, and the lack of link between the service provided and the\u00a0Parties, or the issues raised in this case lead the majority of the Committee to conclude\u00a0with respect to the advice provided by Ms. Cheng to the Chinese Company that neither\u00a0the contractual relationship alleged by Argentina or a circumstance of enough\u00a0relevance do not seem to have been established in any way, to consider that in the case\u00a0of Ms. Cheng there is a manifest absence of the qualities required by Article 14(1).\n118.Regarding the IBA Guidelines, nothing in the information provided in the request for disqualification and in Ms. Cheng's response even suggests that Ms. Cheng and\u00a0Freshfields have '\u201cacted together ...as co-counsel\u201d as required by Rule 3.3.9. of the\u00a0Guidelines cited.119 The premise of such Guideline refers generally to acting as cocounsel in the same case, although it could include joint action on issues that are not\u00a0contentious. Neither premise appears to be proven in the case under consideration.\n119. Regarding Guideline 2.3.2.,120 it is not been alleged, let alone proved, that there has\u00a0been any kind of representation of Freshfields by Ms. Cheng, nor that Ms. Cheng has\u00a0advised Freshfields. The advice was provided to a third party, the Chinese Company,\u00a0and the fact that Freshfields had requested the service does not render Ms. Cheng an\u00a0advisor of Freshfields.\n120. With regard to the service provided by Ms. Cheng in the case of Hutchison Telephone\u00a0Company Limited et al. v. The Telecommunications Authority, Commerce and\u00a0Economic Development Bureau (Government of the Hong Kong Special\u00a0Administrative Region) on the Decision on Stay Application of the Hong Kong\u00a0Telecommunications Appeal Board in 2008,121 the contractual relationship or\u00a0dependence of Ms. Cheng regarding Freshfields, as alleged by Argentina, has not been\u00a0proved. On the contrary, the available information indicates that Ms. Cheng acted at\u00a0the request of Freshfields for the above-mentioned company and for the benefit of said\u00a0company and her task concluded with the decision on appeal in 2008, i.e. seven years\u00a0ago.\n119 IBA Guidelines 3.3.9. \u201cThe arbitrator and another arbitrator, or counsel for one of the parties in the arbitration, currently\u00a0act or have acted together within the past three years as co-counsel.\u201d\n120 IBA Guidelines 2.3.2. \u201cThe arbitrator currently represents or advises the lawyer or law firm acting as counsel for one\u00a0of the Parties.\u201d\n121 Ms. Cheng's response to questions submitted by the Argentine Republic, dated August 5, 2015; Teresa Cheng's Letter\u00a0dated August 18, 2015, Courtesy Translation. p. 3-4 of 4.\n121.This service, which should be subjected to the same analysis as above regarding the service provided in 2015, according to available information did not create a\u00a0contractual relationship with Freshfields or a link resulting in a manifest impediment\u00a0for Ms. Cheng to judge a matter fairly and render an independent and impartial\u00a0judgment in this case.\n122.In short, the contractual relationship that Argentina alleges exists between Ms. Cheng and Freshfields refers to two specific legal services, of short duration, provided by Ms.\u00a0Cheng to different companies, which have nothing to do with this arbitration, on\u00a0matters of Hong Kong Law, with a lapse of seven years between the two, and the\u00a0common denominator of which is that in both cases the request for the service to the\u00a0client was made by Freshfields through lawyers that have no involvement in this\u00a0arbitration. Nothing in the record proves that these two services are the basis of or have\u00a0resulted in a contractual relationship between Freshfields and Ms. Cheng or have\u00a0generated a situation that complies with the standard required by the ICSID\u00a0Convention for a successful challenge.\n123.As noted in Vivendi I:\n\u201cTo summarise, we agree with earlier panels which have had to interpret and apply Article 57 that the mere existence of some professional\u00a0relationship with a party is not an automatic basis for disqualification of\u00a0an arbitrator or Committee member. All the circumstances need to be\u00a0considered in order to determine whether the relationship is significant\u00a0enough to justify entertaining reasonable doubts as to the capacity of the\u00a0arbitrator or member to render a decision freely and independently.\u201d122\n124. Similarly the decision on disqualification in Nations Energy v. Panama stated:\n\u201c(,..)Like other professionals living and working in the world, arbitrators have a variety of complex connections with all sorts of persons and\u00a0institutions.\nThe mere existence of some professional relationship between Respondent's counsel and an ICSID-appointed arbitrator is not an\u00a0automatic basis for disqualification of an arbitrator based on lack of\u00a0impartiality and independence as Article 57 states. \u201cAll the circumstances\u00a0need to be considered in order to determine whether the relationship is\u00a0significant enough to justify entertaining reasonable doubts as to the\u00a0capacity of the arbitrator or member to render a decision freely and\u00a0independently (...) \u201d123 [Free translation].\n125. As for the other circumstances revealed by Ms. Cheng in response to questions from\u00a0Argentina, over which Argentina alleges that when analyzed as a whole, they\n122 ('ompaaia de Aguas del Aconquija and Vivendi Universal v.

[Citations omitted]\ndemonstrate the relationship between Freshfields and Ms. Cheng, the majority of the Committee finds that such circumstances, when considered in isolation or analyzed as\u00a0a whole, do not lead to the conclusion that Ms. Cheng has a link with Freshfields and\u00a0that in account of such a link she lacks the ability to give an independent and impartial\u00a0judgment in this case.\n126.Neither the participation of Ms. Cheng's son for two months in 2011 in an internship program at Freshfields, which did not result in a contract with Ms. Cheng's son; nor\u00a0the participation of Ms. Cheng as arbitrator in a case involving Freshfields; nor the\u00a0alleged relationships of Ms. Cheng with former Freshfields partners, which did not go\u00a0beyond mere speculation as to their scope; let alone the participation of Ms. Cheng\u00a0over several years in academic forums or institutions where she met Mr. Jan Paulsson,\u00a0a former partner of Freshfields, are facts that show, as required by the ICSID\u00a0Convention, a manifest lack of impartiality and independence on the part of Ms.\u00a0Cheng.\n127.These are isolated facts that occurred over many years, which have no connection with each other. Argentina had the burden to show the connection between these facts\u00a0and how they affected the independence of Ms. Cheng. Neither the connection nor the\u00a0result of such connection has been demonstrated in Argentina's disqualification\u00a0proposal.\nb. Ms. Cheng's failure to disclose\n128.As noted above by the majority of the Committee, under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules (Rule 6(2)) the arbitrator is required to disclose his past and\u00a0present professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties, and any\u00a0other circumstance that might cause the arbitrator's reliability for independent\u00a0judgment to be questioned by a party.\n129.Argentina considers that the fact that Ms. Cheng did not reveal the services provided to the Chinese Company at the request of Freshfields, at the time of signing her\u00a0declaration in this case, is a circumstance that shows a lack of transparency and also\u00a0involves a breach of her disclosure obligation under the ICSID Convention, which\u00a0makes it necessary that she be removed from this case.\n130.Respondent also is of the opinion that the failure to disclose the other circumstances that she later disclosed after the several questions raised by Argentina, at the time of\u00a0signing the declaration, also leads to the conclusion that Ms. Cheng was not\u00a0transparent and failed to comply with her duty of disclosure, therefore the challenge\u00a0must be accepted.\n131.Argentina's request for disqualification appears to be based on two premises. First, the failure to disclose a relationship or circumstance that the party requesting the\u00a0disqualification considers relevant constitutes per se a situation in which admittance of\u00a0the challenge is warranted, as there would have been a breach of the duty of disclosure\u00a0and lack of transparency that cast doubt on the impartiality and independence of the\u00a0arbitrator.124 Second, it is not important how the arbitrator or the annulment committee\u00a0member values the circumstance or relationship in question, for purposes of disclosure,\u00a0but rather how such circumstance or relationship may be perceived by the parties.125\n132.The majority of the Committee does not agree with Argentina regarding the abovementioned premises.\n133.As has been recognized in several decisions on disqualification under the ICSID Convention when the arbitrators and annulment committee members make the\u00a0declaration referred to in Rule 6(2) they are making an honest exercise of discretion.126\u00a0The arbitrator or annulment committee member determines, in his sole discretion, that\u00a0is, with a subjective criterion, if in his opinion a particular circumstance may be\u00a0perceived by the parties as a circumstance that affects his ability to make an\u00a0independent judgment.\n134. In reviewing the circumstances disclosed by the arbitrator or the committee member,\u00a0the party or parties to the arbitration or the annulment proceeding will make an\u00a0evaluation of whether in their judgment, according to their perception\u2014again a\u00a0subjective criterion\u2014such circumstance can affect the independence or impartiality\u00a0of the arbitrator or annulment committee member.\n135.The criterion for deciding the proposal for disqualification, as noted above127 and as repeatedly stated in the decisions on disqualification under the ICSID Convention and\u00a0the Arbitration Rules is an objective criterion. It is not the subjective judgment of the\u00a0arbitrator or annulment committee member, i.e., one's perception for purposes of the\u00a0declaration; nor is it the subjective judgment of the party, i.e., one's perception for\u00a0purposes of submitting the challenge.\n136.Not only is there no rule in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules from which one can conclude that the failure to disclose a circumstance per se implies the absence\u00a0of the requirements of the oft-quoted Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention but there\u00a0is no basis whatsoever to conclude, as Argentina appears to be doing, that if the party\u00a0considers that a circumstance should have been disclosed and the arbitrator or\u00a0committee member did not disclose it, that is enough for the challenge to be successful.\n137.In the present case, when submitting her disclosure declaration Ms. Cheng was of the opinion that the services provided to the Chinese Company did not warrant any\u00a0disclosure. Apparently, as she had doubt about the interpretation of paragraph 3.3.9 of\u00a0the IBA Guidelines, she then decided to disclose the provision of those services,\n124 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, \\* \\*'55-63.\n125 Ibid., \\*16, \\*26.\n126 Universal Compression International Holdings v.

It is true that the timing of the disclosure, given the\u00a0proximity of the hearings, might not have been the most convenient, but it cannot be\u00a0derived from this circumstance that this is a malicious act or a breach of Ms. Cheng's\u00a0duties as a member of this Committee.\n140.Ms. Cheng explained that when she was filling out her Form of Acceptance for this case, she did not consider it necessary to disclose the matters Argentina questioned\u00a0owing to the nature of the parties and of the dispute, the legal issues, and the identity\u00a0of the lawyers involved in the matters. She also explained that sometime later when\u00a0she had some doubts about the scope of above-mentioned Guideline 3.3.9. she decided\u00a0ex abundante cautela and without changing her interpretation about the scope of this\u00a0Guideline, to disclose the above-mentioned services.\n141.The majority of the Committee is of the opinion that the non-disclosure or later disclosure of the services provided to the Chinese Company by Ms. Cheng, in an\u00a0honest exercise of discretion, does not by itself necessarily involve a lack of\u00a0independence or impartiality on the part of Ms. Cheng. Nor does merely failing to\u00a0disclose facts that she disclosed in response to questions from Argentina affect Ms.\u00a0Cheng's impartiality or independence.\n142.Only an analysis of the facts disclosed, all together and in context, will help determine whether these facts are sufficient to demonstrate manifestly that Ms. Cheng is not\u00a0independent or is not impartial. If that were the determination, the lack of disclosure\u00a0of such facts would certainly constitute a serious breach by the arbitrator of her duty\u00a0of disclosure but it would be the facts, not the lack of disclosure per se, that would\u00a0allow the challenge to be admitted.\n143.The majority of the Committee has already noted that neither the services provided by Ms. Cheng to third parties at the request of Freshfields nor the other circumstances\u00a0disclosed in order to respond to questions from Argentina imply that Ms. Cheng lacks\u00a0the requirements under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. The mere fact of not\u00a0having disclosed them does not change this analysis.\n144.Finally, as to the dates on which the facts were disclosed by Ms. Cheng in response to Argentina's questions, the majority of the Committee agrees with Argentina that the\u00a0three years covered by the IBA Guidelines, assuming that Guideline 3.3.9. is\n128 Teresa Cheng's Letter to the parties, dated July 27, 2015.\n129 Teresa Cheng's Letter dated August 18, 2015, Courtesy Translation. p. 3 of 4.\u00a0applicable, are indicative and not a time limit making it unnecessary to declare\u00a0anything before three years ago. It is necessary to analyze each particular situation.\u00a0But the majority of the Committee does not share the view about \u201cthe duty to disclose\u00a0any contractual or work relationship with any of the law firms involved in the dispute\u00a0without any time limits, given that the relevant factor is not how such relationships are\u00a0valued by the arbitrator or member of the Annulment Committee but rather how they may\u00a0be perceived by the parties.\u201d130 The time elapsed is one of several factors to be\u00a0evaluated by both the arbitrator in her declaration and persons contemplating a\u00a0possible challenge, and there is no general obligation that imposes upon the arbitrator\u00a0the duty to submit a declaration without considering a time limit therein.\nV. DECISION OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE\n145. For the reasons stated, the majority of the Annulment Committee decides to:\na. Reject the Argentine Republic's proposal for disqualification of Ms. Teresa Cheng.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lift the stay of the annulment proceedings pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the\nArbitration Rules, which shall continue in accordance with the procedural timetable.\nc. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leave the decision on costs for a later stage in these proceedings.\n[Signed]\nEduardo Zuleta Jaramillo\n  \n[Signed]\nAlvaro Castellanos Howell\n  \n130 Grounds for the Argentine Republic's Proposal to Disqualify Ms. Teresa Cheng, dated August 12, 2015, ^16."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2016-02-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **LIST OF DEFINED TERMS** | |\n| Argentina or Respondent | The Argentine Republic |\n| Argentina-France BIT or the BIT or the Treaty | Agreement between the Republic of France and Argentina on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, entered into on June 28, 1990 |\n| Argentina\u2019s Application | Application for annulment of the award filed by the Argentine Republic on March 27, 2014 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Articles on State Responsibility | International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of 2001. |\n| Award | *Award on the case Total S.A. v.

THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Total S.A. In this proceeding Total S.A. is represented by:\n\nMr. Nigel Blackaby\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP Washington, DC, USA\n\nMr. Noah Rubins Mr. Ben Love\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP Paris, France\n\nMr. Sam Hunter Jones Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP London, United Kingdom\n\nMr. Luis Erize Mr. Sergio Porteiro Abeledo Gottheil Abogados SC Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n2.\n\nRespondent is the Argentine Republic. In this proceeding, the Argentine Republic was represented until December 22, 2015 by:\n\nDra. Angelina Maria Esther Abbona\n\nProcuradora del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nAs of December 23, 2015 the Argentine Republic is represented by:\n\nDr. Carlos Francisco Balbin\n\nProcurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n3.\n\nArgentina seeks the annulment of the Award rendered on November 27, 2013 and of the Decisions on Jurisdiction and Liability which form integral part of the Award.\n\n4.\n\nThrough the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal declared that the dispute between Total and Argentina was within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal, since jurisdictional requirements set out in the Argentina-France BIT and in the ICSID Convention were met. Pursuant to the Decision on Liability the Tribunal upheld Total's submission concerning Argentina's obligation to grant Fair and Equitable Treatment to Total S.A. under the Argentina-France BIT. In the Award, the Tribunal ordered Argentina to compensate Total for the damages caused to its investments in Argentina for the violations of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, Argentina filed an application requesting the Annulment of the Decisions and the Award. The Application for Annulment was submitted within the time period provided for by Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nIn its Application, Argentina requested the Stay of Enforcement of the Award provided for in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n7.\n\nOn April 2, 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for Annulment pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 50(2)(a) and (b). In accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2) the Secretary-General informed the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties the proposed names for the appointment of the *ad hoc* Committee. ICSID proposed the appointment of Ms. Teresa Cheng, a national of China, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos, a national of Guatemala and Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a national of Colombia. Ms. Cheng, Mr. Castellanos and Mr. Zuleta were all members of the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, designated by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council (Ms. Cheng and Mr. Zuleta) and by Guatemala (Mr. Castellanos).\n\n9.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted. The Committee was composed of Ms. Teresa Cheng, Mr. Alvaro Castellanos and Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, as Chairman of the Committee. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Natali Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 9, 2014, the Committee requested the Parties to confer on the date of the First Session and the timetable for the exchange of written submissions on Argentina's request for the continuation ofthe stay of enforcement ofthe Award. On June 16.2014, Total submitted a letter to the Committee on behalf of both Parties requesting for additional time to confer on these matters. On June 18, 2014, the Committee granted additional time until June 26, 2014.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, the Parties agreed to hold the First Session in Washington D.C. on August 15, 2014. In addition, the Parties agreed to file their First Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement ofthe Award on July 11.2014, with translations due July 18, 2014 and their Second Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award on July 25, 2014, with translations due August 1, 2014. Argentina confirmed that this was the agreement reached by the Parties by letter dated June 30, 2014.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 11, 2014, the Parties filed their First Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 11, 2014, after conferring with the Parties, the *ad hoc* Committee changed the date of the First Session to October 6, 2014.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated July 24, 2014, Argentina requested the Committee to extend time limits for the discussion of the Parties on procedural matters to be discussed at the First Session until July 28, 2014 and to extend the deadline of the Second Submission on the Request for Stay of Enforcement of the Award until August 12, 2014. The Claimant confirmed its agreement to extend these two deadlines by email dated July 25, 2014. On the same date, the Committee granted the two time extensions. The Parties submitted their comments and points of difference to the Procedural Order No. 1, on July 29, 2014.\n\n15.\n\nOn August 12.2014, the Parties presented their Second Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 6, 2014 the *ad hoc* Committee held with the Parties the First Session at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During this session, the Parties made oral submissions on Argentina's request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award and on the items of the Procedural Order No. 1 on which the Parties had not reached agreement.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 whereby the Parties agreed on the number of written pleadings that each of them would submit, the corresponding deadlines for their submission and reserved dates for the hearing on annulment. The Parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. It was agreed that the proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in effect as of January 1.2003. The Parties agreed on several other procedural matters, *inter alia,* that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceedings would be the seat of ICSID in Washington, DC.\n\n18.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, the Committee issued a decision concerning the termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award, whereby it: (i) rejected the request from Argentina to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award rendered on November 27, 2013; and (ii) ordered the lifting of the stay of enforcement of the Award effective as of the date thereof.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 22, 2014 and on March 9, 2015, Argentina and Total filed a Memorial and a Counter-Memorial on annulment, respectively. On Footnote 52 of its Memorial on Annulment, Argentina requested leave to submit documents related to (i) an administrative claim lodged by Transportadora de Gas del Norte S.A (TGN) and (ii) a judicial proceeding initiated by TGN against the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services in 2012.\n\n20.\n\nOn April 29, 2015 Argentina filed a request for the Committee to decide on the admissibility of new evidence, holding that these documents were relevant to the discussion on double recovery and the Tribunal's failure to apply the applicable law. On May 1, 2015, Total filed observations on Argentina's request. On May 4, 2015, Argentina filed a Reply on annulment.\n\n21.\n\nOn May 12, 2015 the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2, whereby it rejected Argentina's request for leave to submit the new evidence. The Committee based its decision on the fact that it did not find any exceptional circumstances that demand the admission of the documents requested by Argentina into the record, considering the nature and purpose of ICSID annulment proceedings.\n\n22.\n\nTotal filed a Rejoinder on Annulment on July 10, 2015.\n\n23.\n\nOn July 27.2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent the Parties a letter from Ms. Teresa Cheng advising them that on April 2015 she had been contacted by lawyers from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Hong Kong office) in a matter that had already concluded. Ms. Cheng said the matter involved oral advice on an issue that was not related to investment law or disputes between States and investors and that it mainly concerned disputes between shareholders under Hong Kong law that had nothing to do with Total S.A. or with the Argentine Republic. The lawyers of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Hong Kong office) involved in that matter were not the lawyers of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP that are before the Committee in this proceeding. Ms. Cheng stated that she understood that this situation did not pose a conflict of interest, but out of an abundance of caution, she considered it appropriate to communicate this circumstance to the Parties.\n\n24.\n\nOn July 29, 2015, the Argentine Republic sent a letter to the Committee requesting Ms. Cheng to clarify certain questions referred to in her letter of July 27, 2015.\n\n25.\n\nOn August 4, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent to the Parties the response furnished by Ms. Cheng to questions raised by the Argentine Republic on July 29, 2015.\n\n26.\n\nOn August 3, 2015, the Argentine Republic requested Ms. Cheng to disclose all her present or past relationships with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. On August 5, 2015, the ICSID Secretariat sent to the Parties Ms. Teresa Cheng's response\n\n27.\n\nOn August 6, 2015, the Argentine Republic filed a Proposal for the Disqualification of Ms. Teresa Cheng, under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9. On the same day ICSID informed the Parties of the suspension of proceedings in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 9(6), until the majority ofthe *ad hoc* Committee, comprising Mr. Zuleta and Mr. Castellanos, decided on the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n28.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Mr. Zuleta and Mr. Castellanos established a procedural timetable for the submissions of the Parties in respect of the Disqualification Proposal. An expedited timetable was set in response to the state of the proceedings at the time Ms. Cheng's declaration and Argentina's Disqualification Proposal were filed.\n\n29.\n\nAccordingly, on August 12 and August 17, 2015 Argentina and Total filed observations on the Proposal for Disqualification, respectively. On August 18, 2015 Ms. Cheng furnished explanations regarding the Proposal for Disqualification in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 9(3). Both Parties simultaneously filed further observations on August 24, 2015.\n\n30.\n\nThe Argentine Republic sent a letter to Ms. Cheng, dated August 19.2015, requesting additional information. Ms. Cheng sent a reply to Argentina's request on August 20, 2015.\n\n31.\n\nOn August 26.2015, the majority of the Committee composed of Mr. Zuleta and Mr. Castellanos rejected the Argentine Republic's proposal for the disqualification of Ms. Teresa Cheng. The proceedings resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n32.\n\nOn September 1 and 2, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee held a Hearing on Annulment at the seat of ICSID in Washington D.C, as established by Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n33.\n\nOn September 9.2015, Argentina requested the Committee to grant leave to the Parties to submit post-hearing briefs. On 14 September 2015, Total asked the Committee to reject Argentina's request for post-hearing briefs.\n\n34.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Argentina addressed the members of the *ad hoc* Committee requesting them to inform any past or present links with the Claimant or its related persons and/or their counsels in investment international arbitrations against the Argentine Republic. As to Ms. Cheng, Argentina expressly stated that there was no need to mention her links with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. By letter dated November 10, 2015 the members of the Committee responded this request indicating that under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules they had nothing further to declare regarding their previously submitted declarations under Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n35.\n\nOn September 23, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3, whereby it rejected Argentina's request for leave to submit post-hearing briefs.\n\n36.\n\nOn November 10.2015, the Parties submitted their statements of costs regarding the Annulment Proceeding.\n\n37.\n\nOn December 23, 2015, Argentina informed the Centre of the resignation of Mrs. Abbona and the appointment of Mr. Balbin as the new *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina.*\n\n38.\n\nOn December 24, 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee declared the proceeding closed in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**III. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nArgentina requests the annulment of the Decisions and the Award on the basis that (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (ICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) there have been serious departures from fundamental rules of procedure (ICSID Convention, Article 52 (1)(d)); and (iii) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (ICSID Convention, Article 52 (1)(e)).1\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b61-3.\n\n40.\n\nTotal rejects Argentina's request for annulment because in its view Respondent seeks for a review of substance of the Decisions and the Award in order to overturn the Tribunal's decisions on such basis.2\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6l-3.\n\n41.\n\nThis section addresses the submissions of the Parties on the three grounds of annulment invoked by Argentina and provides a summary of the claims and reliefs sought by each Party. This section does not reproduce the entire position of each Party, but a summary of their main submissions. The Committee has carefully reviewed all claims, reasoning, documents and legal authorities submitted by the Parties, and the fact that a reasoning, document or legal authority is not cited or referred to in the following section does not mean that it has not been considered and analyzed by the Committee.\n\n**A. Position of the Argentine Republic**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nArgentina submits that the three grounds for annulment that are the basis for its Application touch upon five different issues referred to in the Decisions and the Award. Thus, Argentina first provided an overview of the standards for annulment that it considered applicable and then explained how each issue gave rise to one or several grounds for annulment. In this section, the Committee will follow Argentina's submissions in the manner in which they were presented to provide a complete overview of its submissions.\n\n**a. The Standards for Annulment**\n----------------------------------\n\n1. **General Standard**\n-----------------------\n\n43.\n\nArgentina submits that the incorporation of an annulment mechanism was the *quid pro quo* of the acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction by States as a means to protect the integrity of such jurisdiction.3 The object and purpose of these proceeding is the \"control of the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process in all of its facets\"4. Argentina holds that annulment proceedings aim at procuring integrity of the tribunal, integrity of the procedure and integrity of the award.5\n\nMem., \u00b6l2.\n\nMem., \u00b6 13, footnotes omitted.\n\nMem., \u00b6l3; Reply, \u00b64.\n\n44.\n\nThe standards for annulment must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), with a view to giving full effect to them. A restrictive interpretation is contrary to the rules of interpretation of treaties, to the ICSID Convention and to the Arbitration Rules6 and would result in depriving ICSID awards of a legitimate review.7\n\nMem., \u00b6l4.\n\nMem., \u00b6l6.\n\n45.\n\nArgentina contests Total's assertions that it is seeking a revision of the Decisions and the Award by the *ad hoc* Committee as if it had filed a request for appeal in regards to the decisions of the Tribunal on jurisdiction or on its interpretation of the law.8 Argentina's Application is based on three of the grounds provided in Article 52 (1) of the ICSID Convention, according to the legal standard described below.\n\nReply, \u00b65-6; Tr.:24:19-25:4.\n\n**2. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn Argentina's view, the power of arbitral tribunals exclusively arises from the agreement between the Parties, and consequently, a tribunal exceeds its powers when it acts in contravention of the Parties' consent.9 Such excess of powers relates to three main categories: (i) the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable law and (iii) the issues raised by the parties.10\n\nMem., \u00b619.\n\nMem, \u00b620; Reply, \u00b66.\n\n47.\n\nThe first category refers to instances in which the tribunal incorrectly finds or rejects jurisdiction, or exceeds the scope of such jurisdiction.11 Manifest excess of powers can also refer to a tribunal's failure to apply the applicable law, which determines the framework within which the parties have authorized the tribunal to make a decision.12 Lastly, a tribunal can manifestly exceed its powers when it fails to decide over matters subject to its jurisdiction or decides matters that were not subject to it.13\n\nMem.,\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. '\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b623-24.\n\nMem, \u00b6 **1** 25.\n\n48.\n\nIn its Reply, Argentina clarifies that it is not seeking a revision by the Committee of the Tribunal's interpretation of the law, as Total wrongly contends.14 Argentina did not invoke an error in the application of the law, but a failure to apply the applicable law.15 Neither did it submit that a mere error of law is a ground for annulment.16\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b65-10.\n\nReply, \u00b68.\n\nTr.:201:17-20.\n\n49.\n\nAs to jurisdiction, Respondent does not request the Committee for a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's jurisdiction but for an analysis on the existence of manifest excess of jurisdictional powers by the Tribunal, as prior annulment committees have done so.17\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b611-12.\n\n**3. Serious Departure of Fundamental Rules of Procedure**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nArgentina considers that the provision in Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention concerning a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure was designed to safeguard the basic fairness and integrity of the arbitration process, including the so-called principles of natural justice.18\n\nMem., \u00b626.\n\n51.\n\nThe obligation to preserve the fundamental rules of procedure is not limited to the Arbitration Rules. It refers to the minimum standards of procedure that must be respected as a matter of international law, including, *inter alia,* the right of both parties to be heard, the right of defense, equality between the parties, etc.19 Annulment committees, and not tribunals, have the task of evaluating whether a fundamental rule of procedure has been breached.20\n\nMem.,\u00b6\u00b626-28.\n\nTr.:239: 3-17; 241:1-16.\n\n**4. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nAn essential aspect of ICSID arbitration is the tribunal's duty to provide reasons in awards.21 Argentina submits that failure to state reasons may appear in different forms:\n\n\"Failure to state the reasons for an award may appear in different forms, including: (i) a total absence of reasons for the award, including the giving of merely frivolous reasons; (ii) a total failure to state reasons for a particular point, which is material for the solution; (iii) the statement of genuinely contradictory reasons; and (iv) the statement of reasons which are insufficient to bring about the solution or inadequate to explain the result arrived at by the tribunal.\u2019\u201922\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b629-30.\n\nMem., \u00b6 31, footnotes omitted.\n\n53.\n\nFailure to state reasons for the award prevents the parties from understanding the reasoning of the tribunal to reach a decision. In consequence, the tribunal must provide reasons in an express manner, and neither the parties nor annulment committees are entitled to speculate about the potential reasons that might justify the conclusion reached by the tribunal. The factors that led to the tribunal's conclusion must be specified with some measure of coherence and consistency.23\n\nMem,\u00b6\u00b629-33.\n\n54.\n\nFinally, unlike other grounds for annulment, failure to state reasons is not qualified as \"manifestly\" or \"serious/\u201924\n\nMem, \u00b633.\n\n55.\n\nArgentina opines that Total's proposition, based on Professor Reisman's opinion, that annulment committees should reconstruct the tribunal's implicit reasons, is incompatible with the ICSID Convention. This position entails the dangers of speculating on what is implicit in a tribunal's finding and is contrary to the requirement under the ICSID Convention regarding that reasons be stated.25\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b616-17.\n\n**b. Reasons for Annulment**\n----------------------------\n\n1. **Reasons for Annulment Relating to the Applicable Law and Claimant\u2019s Derivative Claim**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nArgentina claims that annulment is warranted on reasons related to the applicable law and Claimant's derivative claim on the grounds of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention) and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n57.\n\nRespondent states that, in accordance with Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT, the Tribunal had a duty to apply the provisions of the BIT; Argentine law, including the rules on the conflict of laws; special agreements concluded in relation to the investment; and the relevant principles of international law.26 The Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law because it did not apply the domestic law, along with the BIT and international law in its analysis of Total's iu *s standi.27* This constitutes a ground for annulment, especially since the Tribunal did not provide reasons for its failure to apply Argentine law, which it considered immaterial for the determination of whether the rights in question belonged to Total.28 If the Tribunal had applied Argentine law it would, for instance, have concluded that Total was not entitled to part of the compensation or that TGN had to recover part of the compensation because the interests of creditors were involved.29\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b634-36.\n\nTr.: 199:19-22; 200:9-15; Mem, \u00b634.\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b634-37.\n\nTr.:210:7-13.\n\n58.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal expressly recognized that the rights and assets did not belong to Total but to the domestic companies.30 However, it exercised jurisdiction over the case arguing that claims with respect to Total's indirect and minority shareholding in the domestic companies are disputes relating to an investment, under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and under Article 8(1) of the BIT.31\n\nMem, \u00b638.\n\nMem, \u00b639.\n\n59.\n\nArgentina contests the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction over rights vested in Argentine companies that were not parties to this arbitration.32 Relying on decisions from the International Court of Justice, Argentina holds that general international law does not permit indirect or derivative actions, unless the possibility of submitting such actions has been expressly provided for in an appropriate instrument.33 In its Reply, Argentina refers to the decision in *CMS Gas* *Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,34* to dismiss Total's claim that previous annulment committees have consistently rejected its allegations on shareholder claims.35\n\nMem, \u00b640.\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b640-41, \u00b6\u00b655-56.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Annulment Proceeding. [CA/S v. *Argentina].*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b631-32.\n\n60.\n\nArgentina also explained that under its domestic law, the corporation is the only person entitled to assert its own rights. A shareholder may not submit a claim alleging the breach of the rights of the company, such as Total did.36 An investment treaty does not create a new kind of shareholding, for the provisions of the BIT could not introduce regulatory changes in the laws of the host State. Shareholding cannot be interpreted in a vacuum for \" *...when a shareholder brings a claim coming out of an investment, the issues related to the rights that arise from that kind of investment must arise from the domestic legal order. \"37*\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b650-54.\n\nTr.:15:5-19.\n\n61.\n\nRespondent claims that Total recognizes this failure to apply Argentine law and finds it justified, in spite of contradictions to its own statements according to which Argentine law determines the extent of property rights constituting the investment under domestic law.38 This contradiction is evident in other sections of the Decision on Liability where the Tribunal established that Argentine law determines the content and scope of Total's economic rights and that it is crucial to identify the content of said rights, but it still deems it immaterial regarding standing and ownership.39\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b622-23.\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b626-28.\n\n62.\n\nFurther, Argentina rejects Total's proposition that tribunals have discretion to assess the interaction between national and international law, since it does not consider that tribunals have such discretion nor that they are able to consider \"immaterial\" one of the established sources of law.40\n\nReply, \u00b621.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction on Total's claims for damages, which referred to contracts and companies that are not involved in the arbitration.41 The Tribunal allowed Total to raise a claim over its interests in Argentine companies, who are in turn allowed to file local proceedings based on the same facts, therefore the Tribunal made possible a double recovery.42 In fact, while the arbitration and these proceedings are conducted, the renegotiation process with the local companies is still ongoing. The damage to Claimant and the domestic companies is the same, and thus, as stated by the committee in *CMS v. Argentina,* these would be parallel proceedings in different fora.43\n\nMem, \u00b642.\n\nMem, \u00b643.\n\nTr.:202:14-22; 203:1-10.\n\n64.\n\nArgentina asserts that the Tribunal did not explain in any of its Decisions in what way the rights of different persons over the same assets were reconciled, which provisions allowed investors to bring claims for assets belonging to others, or which provision in the BIT led the Tribunal to the conclusion that Argentine law was immaterial to this question.44 Expanding the Tribunal's jurisdiction to allow a shareholder to benefit from the ICSID system to bring claims based on rights that do not belong to him, amounts to a manifest excess of powers.45\n\nMem., \u00b644.\n\nMem., \u00b645.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the investment protected under the BIT consists of minority shareholding. This reason confuses the legal standing that a shareholder might have with the substantial rights arising from his or her shares.46\n\nMem., \u00b647.\n\n66.\n\nSince the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in acting beyond the scope of its jurisdiction and failed to state the reasons upon which its subject-matter jurisdiction was based, \"the three Decisions of the Tribunal must be annulled.\"47\n\nMem., \u00b648.\n\n**2. Reasons for Annulment Relating to the Renegotiation Process and the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nArgentina claims that annulment is warranted on reasons related to the renegotiation process and the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard on the grounds of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention); and serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).48\n\nMem., **1** 70; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 54 and 58.\n\n68.\n\nAt the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration proceeding, the Tribunal dismissed Argentina's objection to jurisdiction that the dispute was contractual in nature because it considered that Total had not asked the Tribunal to evaluate the renegotiation process under Argentina's regulations nor to enter into the merits of this process.49 In contradiction with this conclusion, the Tribunal found Argentina liable for violating the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard because of the inconclusive results of the renegotiation process of tariffs in the gas transportation sector.50\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b657-59.\n\nReply, \u00b635.\n\n69.\n\nBy holding Argentina liable because of an issue excluded from its competence, the Tribunal adversely affected the principles of due process.51 In fact, Argentina could not know until it read the Decision on Liability that the Tribunal would use the results of the renegotiation process to issue a finding of liability given that the Tribunal had actually stated that Claimant had not requested an evaluation of that process and that said issue was outside its competence. By unexpectedly contradicting these conclusions, the Tribunal departed from the guarantee of due process, violated the right of defense of Argentina and substantially deprived it from the right to be heard, all of which warrant annulment on the ground of serious departure of fundamental rules of procedure.52\n\nMem, \u00b662.\n\nMem., \u00b669.\n\n70.\n\nMoreover, Argentina clarifies that it only referred to the renegotiation process during the hearing, in order to respond to a question from the Tribunal and this statement cannot be taken as an appropriate defense on the merits of the renegotiation process.53\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b655-58; Tr.:27:4-14.\n\n71.\n\nThe contradiction on the renegotiation process also merits annulment since contradictory reasons cancel each other out and amount to a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52 (1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.54 The Tribunal did not explain why it could consider the renegotiation process that it had previously excluded from its own competence.55 In turn, this excess of the Tribunal's competence implies an *ultra petita* ruling and is thus a manifest excess of powers in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.56\n\nMem., \u00b663.\n\nMem., \u00b664.\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b665-66.\n\n72.\n\nIn its Reply, Argentina rejected Total's assertions that it had taken isolated statements of the Award or analyzed them regardless of the context in which they were made. A simple reading of the Decisions evidences the manifest contradiction in which the Tribunal incurred and confirms that the Tribunal indeed analyzed the renegotiation process.57\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b640-44; \u00b6\u00b645-50.\n\n73.\n\nIn addition, contrary to Total's submission, Argentina argues that under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention the notification of a breach to the tribunal is not necessary for it to have an opportunity to cure the situation. The Committee must not go back to Arbitration Rule 27, as suggested by Claimant, for it shall decide on the serious violation of a rule of procedure.58\n\nTr.:235:13-22; 236: 4-16; 240:7-241:16.\n\n**3. Reasons for Annulment Relating to Argentine Emergency Law Provisions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nArgentina claims that annulment is warranted on reasons related to the Argentine Emergency Law provisions on the grounds of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention) and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n75.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the emergency doctrine under Argentine Law in respect to Total's claims, which was one of the defenses raised by it during the arbitration.59 The Tribunal failed to apply domestic law *in totum* as a source of law indicated in Article 8(4) of the BIT.60 The analysis of the measures adopted by Argentina under the BIT did not release the Tribunal from examining such measures under Argentine laws on emergency.61 The Tribunal should have considered the application of the emergency doctrine in order to determine the extent of the property rights that pertain to Claimant's investment.62 Referring to *M.I.N.E. v. Republic of Guinea,* Argentina recalls that a tribunal's disregard of the parties' agreement on the applicable law would imply a derogation from the terms of reference with which it was authorized to function.63\n\nMem, \u00b672.\n\nMem, \u00b672; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.\n\nMem, \u00b676.\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b664-65.\n\nReply, \u00b614; \u00b659.\n\n76.\n\nIn light of this failure to apply the applicable law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based, because it did not specify the alleged conflict with the BIT that purportedly prevented the application of the emergency doctrine or the circumstances that relieved the Tribunal from applying this doctrine as part of the applicable law.64\n\nMem., \u00b6 77; Tr.:212:14-17.\n\n77.\n\nFurther, Argentina disagrees with Total in that tribunals are not required to apply the proper provision or a particular rule of that law. Argentina opines that even if failure to apply a particular provision of domestic law may not amount to failure to apply the applicable law, the complete failure to consider the whole of a doctrine of domestic law, prominently invoked by one of the parties as a defense, does in fact constitute a failure to apply the law and merits annulment of the award.65\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b661-63.\n\n78.\n\nIn its Reply, Argentina submits that the Tribunal's failure to apply the emergency law is not justified under Article 8(4) of the BIT nor under Article 27 of the VCLT or Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. In fact, the ILC recognizes that compliance with domestic law is relevant in the question of international responsibility and that Article 27 of the VCLT may be qualified in light of domestic law.66\n\nReply,\u00b6\u00b667-69.\n\n79.\n\nLikewise, Argentina argues that the application of the emergency doctrine could have led the Tribunal to decide that there was not a breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in the BIT.67\n\nTr.:214:16-22; 215: 1-20.\n\n**4. Reasons for Annulment relating to Article 5(3) of the BIT and the Necessity Defense**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nArgentina claims that annulment is warranted on reasons related to Article 5(3) of the BIT and the necessity defense on the grounds of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1) (b) of the ICSID Convention) and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n81.\n\nArgentina's fourth reason for annulment refers to the Tribunal's approach to two of the fundamental defenses it raised in the arbitration: the application of Article 5(3) of the BIT and the necessity defense under customary international law.\n\n82.\n\nFirst, Argentina argued that since the measures challenged by Claimant were aimed at responding to a state of national emergency the only applicable provision of the BIT was Article 5(3). This article provides for no less favorable treatment to foreign investors than that afforded to domestic investors or to investors of the most-favored nation, whose investments have suffered losses because of war, armed conflict or a state of national emergency.68\n\nMem,\u00b6\u00b679-80.\n\n83.\n\nAccordingly, Argentina states that in order for this provision to have effect, the only obligation of the State during a state of national emergency was to grant French investors no less favorable treatment than that accorded to its own investors or to investors from a third state.69 Citing *L.E.S.I. S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A. v. Algeria,*70 Argentina holds that the provision in Article 5(3) of the BIT abrogates other provisions in the BIT in situations of emergency.71\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b679-80.\n\n*Lesi S.p.A. and Astaldi, S.p.A.* v. *People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3).\n\nMem, \u00b681.\n\n84.\n\nNevertheless, defying all logic, the Tribunal found that Article 5(3) of the BIT was not applicable to an economic emergency, unless it lead to a national emergency where losses that have occurred are a result of war or civil disturbance. The Tribunal did not provide reasons for its conclusion, which rendered this provision ineffective and meaningless, in spite of the fact that it acknowledged Article 5(3) as a \"war and civil disturbance\" provision that operates only when compensation has been granted to its own investors or to a third party's investors. For these reasons, the Tribunal exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons for its conclusions.72\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b682-84.\n\n85.\n\nArgentina clarifies that its claim is that the Tribunal failed to apply the law and not that it applied it erroneously.73 In addition, Respondent holds that the Tribunal created a condition that was not incorporated in the text of the BIT - that the provision only operates when a party to the Treaty has granted compensation for losses to its own investors or those of a third country.74\n\nReply, \u00b672.\n\nReply, **1** 76.\n\n86.\n\nAs a second reason, Argentina argued that the Tribunal failed to apply the necessity defense under customary international law, as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. The Tribunal recognized that it had to assess this defense in light of the criteria of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, nonetheless it concluded that Argentina failed to show that those measures were the only way for the State to safeguard essential interests against a grave and imminent peril. This conclusion applies to the Tribunal's findings in regards to Total's investments in the power generation, hydrocarbon exploration and production sectors and in regards to measures concerning TGN.75\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b685-88.\n\n87.\n\nYet, the Tribunal did not specify the legal standard for \"essential interests\" and \"only way\", which is precisely why the *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v Argentine Republic76* award was annulled.77 Therefore, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision and manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to apply the law.78\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3).\n\nMem., \u00b687; Reply, \u00b680.\n\nMem, \u00b688.\n\n88.\n\nArgentina replies to Total's assertions that the legal standards concerning \"essential interests\" and \"only way\" were explained in paragraphs 221-223 and footnotes 266-267 of the Decision on Liability. These sections of the decision only contain a discussion of the facts of the case in connection with the necessity defense and do not include any legal standards.79\n\nReply, \u00b682.\n\n89.\n\nRespondent also submits that Total's posture that under Article 27 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility a finding of state of necessity would have been without prejudice to Argentina's obligation to compensate it for its loss is not true. Article 27 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that the invocation of grounds for precluding the wrongfulness of an act is *without prejudice* to the question of compensation and does not attempt to specify in which circumstances compensation could be due. This reasoning was adopted by the annulment committee in *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v Argentine Republic,* which stated that if the necessity defense had been applied the tribunal might have found Argentina not liable for a breach of the bilateral investment treaty in question. In any case, even if Total's reading of Article 27 were adopted, the Tribunal's statement admitting the necessity defense would inevitably have an impact on the operative part of the Award and in an assessment of an eventual compensation.80\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b683-86.\n\n**5. Reasons for Annulment Relating to the Assessment of Damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nArgentina claims that annulment is warranted on reasons related to the Tribunal's assessment of damages on the ground of failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n91.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal made three contradictory statements in its assessment of damages that do not enable the reader to understand its motives. This results in a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, since two genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out.81 Moreover, these contradictions pertain to an outcome-determinative point of the decision, which is the payment of compensation by the Argentine Republic.82\n\nMem, \u00b689.\n\nMem, \u00b696.\n\n92.\n\nRespondent identifies a first contradiction in the adjustments made on price variation in the first semester of 2002. In the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal held that the failure to readjust the tariffs, following the enactment of the Emergency Law and in the height of the crisis could be justified provided that Argentina subsequently pursued renegotiations to re-establish the equilibrium of the tariffs as established by law. However, in rendering the Award the Tribunal held that it could not accept the different approach suggested by Argentina that adjustments should not take into account the price variations of the first semester of 2002.83\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b690-91, Reply, \u00b6\u00b689-91.\n\n93.\n\nSecond, in the calculation of the evolution of the local prices of TGN's tariffs, the Award concluded that with a view to adjust TGN's tariffs in the *but-for* scenario, it would apply the index of costs calculated by the valuation experts presented by Argentina in accordance with its evolution since the beginning of2002. Yet the Tribunal contradicted the findings of the Decision on Liability since it was not able to apply the index of costs since the beginning of 2002.84 The Tribunal conducted a tariff review taking into account the evolution in the index of costs according to developments as from 2002, which was in practice similar to the extraordinary tariff review, and transferred the impact of the devaluation on consumers.85\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b692-93.\n\nReply, \u00b692.\n\n94.\n\nThe third contradiction relates to the tariff adjustments and the debt incurred by TGN. In the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal noted that Total had been unable to repay or renegotiate the debt incurred in US Dollars as a consequence of the devaluation of TGN's assets and revenues because of the monetary crisis in Argentina. The Tribunal stated that it could not share Total's views that the pesification was a breach of its treaty rights, yet in addressing the *but-for* scenario, the Tribunal held that Total had demonstrated that periodically adjusted tariffs would have allowed TGN to service its foreign denominated debt.86\n\nMem, \u00b6\u00b694-95.\n\n95.\n\nClaimant justifies the latter contradiction based on the fact that the Tribunal had more evidence at its disposal when rendering the Award. However, \"... *the Tribunal did not add new evidence to perform this analysis but accepted Claimant's arguments that TGN used cash flows of revenues from its export business to repay its debC\"87* Finally, Argentina submits that Total is speculating when it affirms that if the Tribunal had not assumed the full service of TGN's debt but a restructuring, the resulting damages would be higher.88\n\nReply, \u00b694.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b695-96.\n\n**c. Argentina\u2019s Submissions on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nArgentina dismisses Total's assertions that it raised a wholly unmeritorious application. Applying for annulment of an award is a specific right granted under the ICSID Convention to protect the integrity of the ICSID arbitration system, thus recourse to annulment cannot be interpreted against the party that uses it. Therefore, to impose costs on Argentina for exercising its right would be detrimental to the confidence of States parties in these proceedings.89\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b698-102.\n\n97.\n\nEven if the Committee rejects Argentina's arguments, it would not be appropriate to order Respondent to pay for costs because its application has not been frivolous and because it has not acted in bad faith.90\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b698-102.\n\n**B. Position of Total**\n------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAccording to Total, annulment under the ICSID Convention is an exceptional remedy available only where the procedural integrity of the proceedings would be jeopardized, based on five narrow grounds concerning fundamental procedural errors. The ICSID Convention excludes any review of the substance of the award.91 Argentina views annulment as a process available as a matter of course and has sought annulment of every adverse award against it, regardless of the merits of its position.92\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b61-2.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b62-5.\n\n99.\n\nArgentina has asked the Committee to conduct a *de novo* review and to overturn the decision of the Tribunal on that basis. Respondent applied for annulment based on three grounds of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, but it abandoned arguments that it had presented in its Request for Annulment93 and was not able to produce arguments for several of the claimed deficiencies.94\n\nRej., \u00b64.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b64.\n\n100.\n\nThe overall weakness of Argentina's position is evident in the near universal rejection of its prior applications for annulment, which were construed upon rehashed arguments that it has consistently raised.95\n\nC-Mem., \u00b65.\n\n101.\n\nTotal responded to Argentina's pleadings following each of the reasons that according to Respondent justified annulment. Total first established the applicable standard for each of the grounds for annulment and then presented its rebuttal to each of Argentina's reasons for annulment.\n\n**a. The Tribunal Did Not Manifestly Exceed its Powers**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Standard for Annulment under Article 52 (1) (b)**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nTotal acknowledges that the adjudicative power of ICSID tribunals stems from the parties' agreement. In certain situations, an excess of jurisdiction or a failure to apply the law may give rise to annulment.96 However, both for jurisdictional decisions and for failure to apply the law, any excess of powers must be *manifest97*\n\nC-Mem., \u00b67.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b67.\n\n103.\n\nArgentina advances a lesser degree of legal error to trigger annulment because in its view failure to apply the law, regardless of its generality or specificity, constitutes a manifest excess of powers. It relies on *Wena v. Egypt,* which actually discerns between a failure to apply the applicable law and an error in the application of the law.98\n\nRej \u00b68.\n\n104.\n\nTotal outlines three conditions concerning annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the excess of powers must be manifest; (ii) a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is not permitted; and (iii) an erroneous application of the law does not entail a manifest excess of powers.99\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b68-24.\n\n105.\n\nFirst, Article 52(1)(b) requires that an excess of powers be manifest before annulment can be justified. An annulment committee may not review the tribunal's interpretation of the law and thus the excess of powers shall be self-evident on a simple reading and does not require elaborate interpretations of the tribunal's reasoning. The committee must verify the excess of powers without consulting the evidence before the tribunal. In addition, a manifest excess of powers will only be annullable if it would result determinative.100\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b68-13.\n\n106.\n\nIn addition, Total submits that Argentina's interpretation of excess of jurisdictional powers discards the fact that under Article 52(1)(b) the excess of powers must be manifest and thus that an *ctd hoc* committee cannot conduct a *de novo* review of any decision of the tribunal.101 A reasonable new review of the findings of jurisdiction of the tribunal, without demonstrating the *manifest* standard, will neglect the principle of *competence-competence,* under which the tribunal shall settle any question pertaining to its competence.102\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b617.\n\n107.\n\nAs a third point, Total recalls that a failure to apply the chosen law may amount to a manifest excess of powers, but the erroneous application of the law or partial application of it does not. This principle has been consistently applied in annulment proceedings. Argentina attempts to relitigate issues as it incorporates within its complaints the misapplication ofthe law.103\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b619-20.\n\n108.\n\nRespondent criticizes the misapplication of specific provisions or rules of law, disregarding that to find an excess of powers for failure to apply the law there must have been a failure to apply the law *in toto.104* This interpretation is also contrary to prior decisions on annulment.105 Tribunals have the power to determine the relevance of the legal provisions of the law and they are not obliged to apply every particular provision invoked by a party.106\n\nC-Mem, \u00b622.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b623.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b624.\n\n**2. Argentina has not established that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. *The Tribunal did not exceed its powers in finding jurisdiction over Total's claims*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nTotal criticizes Argentina's allegation concerning a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal in regards to its finding on competence over Total's investment in local companies, in contravention with particular provisions of domestic law and international law. In Total's view, Argentina requests the Committee to undertake a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's finding on jurisdiction.107\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b625-26.\n\n110.\n\nTotal concedes that jurisdictional decisions are annullable on the ground of manifest excess of powers only when the decision to exercise jurisdiction is self-evident. A difference of opinion in respect to the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction is insufficient.108\n\nRej., \u00b610.\n\n111.\n\nContrary to Argentina's beliefs, the Tribunal did apply the applicable law -the BIT and the ICSID Convention- and concluded that the BIT afforded protection to Total's investments because it specifically included minority shareholding within the definition of investment.109 Therefore, the Tribunal rejected Argentina's characterization of Total's claims as derivative claims in the Decision on Jurisdiction.110 Total raises two additional points: (1) investment treaties grant independent and often superior protections than those existing in domestic law111; and (2) annulment committees have consistently rejected annulment requests premised on Argentina's position on shareholder claims.112\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b627-29.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b628.\n\nTr.: 107: 8-108:4.\n\nRej., \u00b615.\n\n112.\n\nTotal states that the discretion tribunals have to assess the interaction between national and international law is generally recognized and that previous annulment committees have consistently rejected similar arguments advanced by Argentina.113 Particularly, Total refers to the decision in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*,114 where the annulment committee confirmed the tribunal's conclusion on the standing of the investor. This committee stated that the BIT determines the types of interests protected under its scope and that it did not have a mandate to reach independent conclusions on the proper interpretation of the treaty.115\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b629-30,\u00b632.\n\n*Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Annulment Proceeding. *[\"Azurix* v. *Argentina \u2019]*\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b630-31.\n\n113.\n\nFurther, Total responds to Argentina's allegations on erroneous application of international law by recalling that the Tribunal expressly applied the terms of the BIT as *lex specialis* rules of international law. The annulment committee in *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic116* rejected a similar argument, affirming that whether an investor may claim for measures that affected its investment in a locally incorporated company is a matter of interpretation of the BIT and cannot be analyzed by an *ctd hoc* committee.117\n\n*Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Annulment Proceeding.\n\nC-Mem. \u00b6 34.\n\n114.\n\nFinally, Total argues that Argentina failed to explain how its complaint on double recovery, routinely rejected by annulment committees, constitutes a manifest excess of powers. Particularly, the committee in *El Paso Energy International v. Argentine Republic118* characterized these arguments as complaints typical of an appeal and stated that the possibility of double recovery is an issue to be assessed by the tribunal and not the *ad hoc* committee.119\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15), Annulment Proceeding.\n\nC-Mem,\u00b6\u00b635-36.\n\n115.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Total points out that the BIT circumscribes the Tribunal's jurisdiction.120 This was the position taken by the *CMS v. Argentina* annulment committee.121\n\nRej., \u00b6 **12.**\n\nRej., \u00b615.\n\n116.\n\nArgentina misinterprets the decision of *Postov\u00e1 Banka, AS e Istrokapitcil Se v. Hellenic Republic.122* for this tribunal considered that the default proposition was that a shareholder's investment under a bilateral investment treaty are its shares in a local company and not the assets of the company itself. The Tribunal's finding that Total's shareholding constitutes a protected investment under the BIT is consistent with the approach of the *Postovci Banka* tribunal.123\n\n*Postov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and ISTROKAPEE4L SE* v. *Hellenic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/8), Annulment Proceeding.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n117.\n\nDuring the hearings on annulment, Total argued that if the Tribunal had applied Argentine law, it would have reached the same conclusion on shareholder claims because there is no provision in Argentine law that refers to questions of international law.124 Furthermore, Argentine law recognizes the supremacy of international law, and where there is a conflict between a domestic and an international law, there is *renvoi* to international law.125\n\nTr.:264:12-265:12.\n\nTr.: 266:20-268:13.\n\nii. *The Tribunal did not exceed its powers in finding a breach of Article 3 of the BIT*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nTotal asserts that the determination on whether there has been a manifest excess of powers in the Tribunal's ruling on the renegotiation process depends on a reading of the whole text in its proper context. Argentina misinterprets the Tribunal's decisions.126\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6 39.\n\n119.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal did not restrict its ability to take the conduct of the renegotiation process into account for potential treaty breaches. The Tribunal stated that it was not competent to rule on the renegotiation process as a matter of Argentine Law but specified that the fair and equitable treatment claim was factually premised on the renegotiation process.127 The Tribunal's ruling held that Argentina had breached Article 3 of the BIT by failing to restore the economic equilibrium of TGN's tariffs;128 the Tribunal assessed this failure under international law standards.129\n\nC-Mem, \u00b640.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b641.\n\nRej., \u00b619.\n\n120.\n\nTotal contests Argentina's allegations that the Tribunal made an *ultra petita* ruling because Total had not asked it to consider Argentina's conduct with respect to the renegotiation process. Claimant recalls paragraphs 31 and 68 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, where it is clearly stated that Total had actually requested the Tribunal to consider breaches of the BIT by Argentina arising out of the ongoing renegotiation process. This was exactly what the Tribunal did in its Decision on Liability.130\n\nC-Mem, \u00b642; Rej., \u00b620.\n\n121.\n\nTotal submits that the Tribunal was very careful to avoid a possibility of double recovery, however if eventually, after fourteen years, the renegotiation process comes to an end, compensation to one entity and compensation to another does not amount to double recovery.131\n\nTr.: 285:6-286:18.\n\niii. *The Tribunal did not exceed its powers in its application of the Argentine emergency doctrine*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIn regards to Argentina's criticism on the application of the Argentine emergency doctrine by the Tribunal, Total considers this another instance in which Respondent seeks for a review of the Tribunal's application of the law.132\n\nC-Mem, \u00b643.\n\n123.\n\nIn the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal applied both international and domestic law in a reasoned manner. It first considered which law to apply to each question and concluded that the provisions of the emergency doctrine in Argentine law were not relevant to determine the extent of obligations arising under the BIT. In Total's view, this type of characterization is a necessary part of applying the applicable law, as Argentine law and international law apply to different aspects of the dispute. Thus, Argentina is unable to meet the standard under Article 52 (1) (b) that the Tribunal failed to apply the law *in toto.133*\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b643-47.\n\n124.\n\nAt the hearing, Total explained that domestic law does not offer defenses for breaches of international law.134 In addition, even by applying Argentine emergency doctrine, the result would not have been outcome-determinative: the Tribunal would have reached the same decision, because as it was acknowledged by Argentina, the doctrine under international law was applicable too, and would have trumped the Argentine defense.135\n\nTr.:74:13-75: 8.\n\nTr.:75: 14-22; 76: 1-10.\n\niv. *The Tribunal did not exceed its powers in interpreting Article 5(3) of the BIT*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nSimilarly, Total deems Argentina's arguments based on the interpretation of Article 5(3) of the BIT a disagreement with the Tribunal's application of this provision rather than an allegation that the Tribunal manifestly failed to apply the applicable law.136 The Tribunal concluded that Article 5(3) of the BIT did not correspond to a \"non-precluded measures\" clause, as Argentina requested. Thus, the Tribunal concluded that Article 5(3) of the BIT does not cover the measures adopted by Argentina.137\n\nRej., \u00b623.\n\nTr.:146:21-147:14.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal, as it is empowered to do so, distinguished national emergencies (for which the provision could be potentially applicable) and economic emergencies such as the one that Argentina experienced in the early 2000s, and concluded that this provision did not cover economic emergencies. Argentina's argument is based on an erroneous application of the law and therefore falls outside the scope of annulment under the ICSID Convention.138\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b648-52.\n\nv. *The Tribunal did not exceed its powers in interpreting the customary international law defense of necessity*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nTotal posits that Argentina's arguments on the failure to apply the law based on the way in which the Tribunal applied the necessity defense under customary international law also concerns the application of the legal rule, instead of a failure to apply the law at all.139\n\nC-Mem, \u00b653.\n\n128.\n\nAccording to Total, the Tribunal addressed the necessity defense and applied the standards reflected in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States. Argentina's argument that the Tribunal failed to elaborate upon the requirements of the \"only way\" to safeguard the \"essential interests\" of the State disregards several pages of the Decision on Liability. Total refers to the reasoning of the Tribunal in paragraphs 221-224 and footnotes 266-267 of the Decision on Liability, and distinguishes this case from the annulment decision in *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp, Ponderosa Assets LP v. Argentine Republic,* which in turn has been widely criticized for going beyond the scope of ICSID annulment.140\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b654-58.\n\n129.\n\nTotal argues that the doctrine of necessity requires the party invoking it to show that the measures in question were the only way to safeguard essential interests of the State. Since no further definition was required, the Tribunal turned to the factual analysis. It concluded that Argentina was unable to prove that freezing the tariffs was the \"only way\" to protect its interest.141\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b626-27.\n\n130.\n\nIn any event, Total states that under Article 27 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a finding of a state of necessity would have been without prejudice to Argentina's obligation to compensate Total for its loss, and therefore Argentina's criticism of the Tribunal's reasoning would not have had any dispositive effect on the outcome of the case.142\n\nC-Mem., \u00b659.\n\n**b. The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1. **Standard for Annulment under Article 52 (1) (e)**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nTotal submits that a violation of the duty to provide a reasoned award (Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention) may yield grounds for annulment as Failure to State Reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention), in limited circumstances.143\n\nC-Mem., \u00b660.\n\n132.\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee cannot annul an award on the basis that it disagrees with the reasons provided by a tribunal. An actionable failure to state reasons arises from a total absence of reasons, contradictory reasons or incoherent reasons that do not allow the reader to follow the logic of the arguments. However, Argentina is questioning the *quality!* of the Tribunal's reasoning, rather than alleging that the reasoning is unintelligible.144\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b660-64.\n\n133.\n\nNeither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provide the manner in which tribunals must give reasons. As such, reasons may be implicit and annulment committees can reconstruct the tribunal's reasoning.145\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b665.\n\n134.\n\nIn addition, the failure to state reasons must relate to a point essential to the tribunal's decision, in order for it to be annullable.146\n\nC-Mem, \u00b666.\n\n135.\n\nContradictory reasons may exceptionally constitute a failure to state reasons where they prevent the reader from understanding the tribunal's motives. Prior annulment committees have set a high threshold, whereby the reasons must be genuinely contradictory in that they cancel each other out and that they refer to a point that is necessary to the tribunal's decision. Also, committees must distinguish contradictory reasons from conflicting considerations, as they may risk acting as an appellate body.147\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b667-70.\n\n**2. Argentina has not established that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in its Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. *The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in finding jurisdiction over Total's claims*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nTotal responds to Respondent's allegations that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in finding competence over Total's claims, recalling that the Tribunal dedicated an entire section of its Decision on Jurisdiction to address the issues that form the basis of Argentina's concerns. However, Argentina proposes an alternative reasoning contending that the Tribunal failed to state reasons by neglecting to explain how the treaty allows claims relating to assets and rights that belong to non-covered investors. The Tribunal expressly stated that its competence was based on the rights of Total under the BIT and not the rights of Total's subsidiaries under Argentine law.148\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b671-73.\n\nii. *The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in finding a breach of Article 3 of the BIT*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nTotal submits that Argentina misrepresents the Tribunal's approach in its dealing with the renegotiation process in the Decision on Jurisdiction and in the Decision on Liability, in an attempt to create a contradiction.149 The Tribunal did not take \"... *a decision on the merits of the renegotiation process under Argentine law, but rather a consideration that the failure of the renegotiation process (which was by no means the only measure available for Argentina to reestablish equilibrium in the gas transportation tariffs) contributed to the unfair treatment that Argentina meted out to Total's investment.\"150*\n\nC-Mem, \u00b675.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b675.\n\n138.\n\nAdditionally, Total signals that, similarly to the situation in *Azurix v. Argentina,* there is no contradiction in the Tribunal excluding the compliance with the renegotiation process with domestic law from its jurisdiction and then considering it as a part of a factual basis for treaty breaches. The Tribunal simply dealt with questions of national and international law separately when exercising jurisdiction.151\n\nC-Mem, \u00b677.\n\niii. *The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in its application of the Argentine emergency doctrine*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nOnce again, Total points out that Argentina attempts to create the semblance of a missing reason by mischaracterizing the Tribunal's decision. However, the Tribunal presented its reasoning concerning the application of Argentine law and, in the same paragraph cited by Respondent, it concluded that the fact that a domestic measure challenged by Total might be legitimate in Argentina's legal system would not relieve the Tribunal from examining whether Argentina has nevertheless breached the BIT.152\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b679-80.\n\niv. *The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in interpreting Article 5(3) of the BIT*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nTotal submits that the Tribunal found that Article 5(3) of the BIT does not excuse the parties from their obligations, but provides an additional guarantee to investors. The Tribunal concluded that this clause did not apply in Total's case because Argentina's measures were taken in the context of an economic emergency that did not rise to the level of a national emergency.153 Total posits that this conclusion is evident from the wording of the provision and that the Tribunal's interpretation merely reflected this fact.154\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b681-82.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b683.\n\n141.\n\nIn fact, paragraph 229 of the Decision on Liability contains the reasons for this conclusion: Article 5(3) of the BIT must carry its meaning according to its text and function and therefore it is not applicable to an economic emergency unless such emergency leads to a national emergency.155\n\nRej.,\u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n142.\n\nIn any event, even if the Tribunal incorrectly applied Article 5(3) of the BIT, it would have not had an impact on the outcome of the arbitration, as this clause is an *additional guaranty* to the investor.156 In addition, Total argues that the Tribunal fully addressed and justified its decision.157\n\nRej.,\u00b639.\n\nTr.:148:14-149:ll\n\nv. *The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in interpreting the customary international law defense of necessity*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nTotal recalls that the Tribunal expressly addressed Argentina's necessity defense at length on the Decision on Liability. The Tribunal defined the legal standards and explained its conclusions, thus Argentina has not established that it is impossible to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal.158\n\nC-Mem, \u00b684.\n\n144.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Total further argues that Argentina does not distinguish between the grounds that give rise to annulment for the Tribunal's dealing of the defense of necessity that relate to failure to state reasons and manifest excess of powers.159\n\nRej.,\u00b640.\n\nvi. *The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in its assessment of damages*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nTotal argues that a consideration of the whole decision in light of the record before the Tribunal dispels any doubts as to the alleged existence of contradictory statements in the Tribunal's assessment of damages.160\n\nMem., \u00b685.\n\n146.\n\nFirst, Total states that there is no contradiction. The Tribunal found that the pesification and subsequent failure to readjust tariffs might be understandable, as it was limited to the period of economic difficulties (first semester of 2002). The Tribunal chose a valuation date as of 1 July 2002 because the measures adopted by Argentina after that date were unfair and inequitable. Total clarifies that *\"ftjariff adjustments in the second half of2002 therefore would have taken into account price variations in the first half of2002 because that is the way in which tariffs were calculated in Argentina, not because of an assumption that measures taken during the first half of 2002 were wrongful.* \"161 There is no contradiction in the Tribunal's approach to the timing of Argentina's wrongful measures.162\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b686-88.\n\nRej.,\u00b641.\n\n147.\n\nSecond, Total deems incomprehensible Argentina's argument on the alleged contradiction regarding the indexing of TGN tariffs in the **but-for** scenario and the finding in the Decision on Liability that Argentina could have been expected to exclude gas tariffs from pesification. In this decision, the Tribunal did not find Argentina at fault under the BIT for the devaluation of its currency and the pesification of gas tariffs, but considered unfair and unequitable the blocking of mechanisms that were at Argentina's disposal to respect the fundamental expectations of investors. The blocking of the periodic adjustment of tariffs according to inflation was eliminated from the **but-for** scenario in the Award.163\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b689-90.\n\n148.\n\nIn Total's words: \"A finding that no extraordinary tariff review was required is entirely consistent with an assumption that tariffs would have adjusted naturally according to the indexation of the *but-for* scenario.\"164 Argentina criticizes the Tribunal's findings on the quantification of damages but does not identify a failure to state reasons.165\n\nRej., \u00b642.\n\nRej., \u00b643.\n\n149.\n\nFinally, Total does not see a contradiction between the Tribunal's conclusion in the Award that TGN would have remained solvent in the **but-for** scenario and its decision that the pesification did not violate the BIT. The Tribunal concluded that had TGN's tariffs been adjusted for inflation the resulting cash-flow would have allowed it to service its foreign debt. The Tribunal included the full impact on pesification in both the actual and the **but-for** scenarios because it decided to adjust costs and tariffs.166\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6\u00b690-91.\n\n150.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal's conclusion in the Award that TGN would have been able to service its foreign debt in the *but- for* scenario only was delivered after the Tribunal examined additional evidence submitted by the Parties after the Decision on Liability was rendered.167 Argentina chose to ignore this evidence which refers to the expert analysis submitted in accordance with Procedural Order No. 7.168 In any case, Total argues that even if a contradiction existed, it would not have been outcome determinative since the resulting damages would actually be higher.169\n\nC-Mem, \u00b692.\n\nRej., \u00b646.\n\nC-Mem, \u00b693.\n\n**c. The Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. **Standard for Annulment under Article 52 (1) (d)**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nArticle 52 (1)(d) establishes the possibility of annulling a decision where there is a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. This ground requires the rule to be fundamental, to relate to an element of due process, and to be serious, insofar as it causes the tribunal to reach a substantially different result.170 Also, as per Arbitration Rule 27, a party cannot rely on a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure that it did not raise during the arbitration, or else it would have waived its right to request annulment on that basis.171\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b694-95.\n\nTr.:166:10-168:2\n\n152.\n\nTotal contests Argentina's allegations that it could not have known that the Tribunal would rule on the renegotiation process until the Decision on Liability, by recalling that such a claim was not raised during the arbitral proceedings. Total states that the Parties had been able to address the issue of the renegotiation process in their pleadings, thus both Parties were aware that this issue was potentially relevant to the Tribunal's consideration on liability. There was nothing improper at the hearing and Argentina's due process rights were fully respected.172 Argentina's response shows dissatisfaction with its own oral responses to these questions. Respondent's complaint is difficult to understand because it was able to furnish arguments in its Rejoinder on the Merits and in post-hearing submissions.173\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b697-99.\n\nRej., \u00b649.\n\n153.\n\nEven if the Committee accepts Argentina was in fact deprived of the right to be heard, it should be noted that Argentina waived the right to complain about such deprivation in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 by not raising the matter during three years between the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability.174\n\nTr.:276: 3-8.\n\n**d. Total\u2019s Submissions on Costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nTotal requests the Committee to order that Argentina bear all costs and expenses of Total in connection with these annulment proceedings. Argentina's application for annulment is unmeritorious. For the past decade, Argentina has sought to annul every award rendered against it as a matter of reflex, in order to exert pressure on its judgment creditors to accept a reduced or delayed payment. This behavior must not go uncounted when considering the allocation of costs.175\n\nC-Mem, \u00b6100.\n\n155.\n\nArticle 52(4) of the ICSID Convention on costs is expressly incorporated in annulment proceedings and therefore the shifting of costs is equally appropriate in these proceedings. *Ad hoc* committees have ordered unsuccessful applicants to pay costs in cases in which the request was completely rejected, the application fundamentally lacked merit and when the applicant was routinely late in paying ICSID advances. Should Argentina's application be dismissed in its entirety, all those elements would exist.176\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6101-102.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIn order to arrive to the conclusions contained in this Decision on Annulment, the Committee reviewed and considered all the arguments of the Parties and the documents submitted by them in this proceeding. The fact that the Committee does not specifically mention a given argument or reasoning does not mean that it has not considered it. In their submissions the Parties produced and cited numerous awards and decisions dealing with matters that they consider relevant to this Decision on Annulment. The Committee has also considered these documents carefully and may have taken into account the reasoning and findings of the committees referred to during the proceeding as well as other committees on annulment.\n\n157.\n\nHowever, in coming to a decision on the matter of annulment raised by Argentina, the Committee must perform, and in fact has performed, an independent analysis of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules, and the particular facts of this annulment case.\n\n**A. Scope of the Annulment Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that ICSID awards are binding on the disputing parties, may not be appealed, and are not subject to any remedies except those provided for in the ICSID Convention.177\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012; \u00b612 [\"ICSID Background Paper on Annulment\"]; Mem, \u00b615; C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6l-2\n\n159.\n\nAs explained in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, during the deliberations of the Convention from which the grounds for annulment derive, *\"(...) the ILC decided that no appeal against an arbitral award should be allowed, but that the validity of an award might be challenged \u2018within rigidly fixed limits.'\"178* The Committee notes that the usage of qualifiers such as \"manifest,\" \"serious,\" and \"fundamental\" suggest that the powers of an *ad hoc* committee to annul an ICSID award were intended to be limited within the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) of the Convention. As one commentator indicated, annulment is an exceptional remedy.179\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment; \u00b612, referring to the Documents of the Fifth Session Including the Report of the Commission to the General Assembly of 1953. Footnotes omitted.\n\nAron Broches, Observations on the Finality of ICSID Awards, 6 ICSID Rev. -FILJ 321 (1991),p.329\n\n160.\n\nIn addition, \"[t]he limited and exceptional nature of the annulment remedy expressed in the drafting history of the Convention has been repeatedly confirmed by ICSID Secretary-Generals in Reports to the Administrative Council of ICSID, papers and lectures.\"180\n\n*See ibid.,* fn. 136, \"Report of Secretary-General Ibrahim F.I. Shihata to the Administrative Council at its Twentieth Annual Meeting 3 (October 2, 1986): \"The history of the Convention makes it clear that the draftsmen intended to: (i) assure the finality of ICSID awards; (ii) distinguish carefully an annulment proceeding from an appeal; and (iii) construe narrowly the ground for annulment, so that this procedure remained exceptional;\" Report of Secretary-General Ibrahim F.I. Shihata to the Administrative Council at its Twenty-Second Annual Meeting (September 27-29, 1988): \"It may be expected that use of the annulment procedure would be a rare event because of the seriousness of the shortcomings against which it is meant to be a safeguard. It is also wrong to confuse the annulment proceeding with an appeals process which is not possible in respect of awards issued by ICSID\u2019s tribunals; Broches, supra note 15, at 354 & 355; Annex 4, para. 28.\" ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 74 and Footnote, 136.\n\n161.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Argentina in that the grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted in accordance with the treaty interpretation principles contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.\n\n162.\n\nThis means that Article 52(1) should be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the ICSID Convention in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. If necessary to confirm the meaning of the interpretation according to Article 31, or if the interpretation under Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, then, according to Article 32 of the VCLT recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\n\n163.\n\nIt is not disputed that the grounds for annulment provided by Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention are exhaustive and are the only grounds under which an award may be annulled.\n\n164.\n\nArticle 53 ofthe ICSID Convention provides for the fundamental features of an arbitration award and confirms the well-established doctrine of finality in arbitration and the binding effect of the awards on the parties.181 The said article confirms also that the only recourse against the award available to the parties is limited to what is set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and that no appeal is allowed.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 53.\n\n165.\n\nTherefore, it is also undisputed that an annulment committee should not review the merits. It is not the duty of an ad *hoc* committee under the ICSID Convention to revisit the merits of the case, or to comment on what it would have decided on the merits had it acted as an arbitral tribunal. Annulment is an exceptional recourse that should consider the finality of the award.\n\n166.\n\nThus, the grounds for annulment should be interpreted as being exhaustive, considering their object and purpose, as an exceptional remedy, against an award that is otherwise considered final and binding. Nothing in the text of the ICSID Convention or in the preparatory works suggests that the interpretation of the grounds for annulment should consider that *\"ICSID awards are not subject to the remedies typically available against awards under other arbitration rules, which may generally be resorted to before domestic courts during award enforcement proceedings.182*\n\nMem., \u00b616.\n\n167.\n\nICSID *ad hoc* committees have affirmed in their decisions, and this Committee agrees, that\n\n(a) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled;\n\n(b) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an *ad hoc* committee is limited; (c) *****ad hoc***** committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an *****ad hoc***** Committee cannot substitute the tribunal's determination on the merits for its own; (d) *****ad hoc***** committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards; (e) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly: and (f) an *****ad hoc***** committee's authority to annul is circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an *****ad hoc***** committee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, *i.e.,* either partial or full.183\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b675. Footnotes omitted.\n\n168.\n\nIt is under the above general standard and scope that this Committee will review each of the grounds for annulment submitted by Respondent. The Committee will refer to each ground for annulment, define the standard that applies to each such ground and then analyze the claims of Argentina with respect to each ground to determine whether or not the Decisions and the Award should be annulled.\n\n**B. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because:\n\n(a) The Tribunal had a duty to apply both international law and the domestic law of Argentina, as established in Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT. In analyzing Total's *ins standi,* the Tribunal failed to apply Argentine law, along with the BIT and international law, which amounts to a failure to apply the applicable law. The Tribunal did not provide the reasons for such failure.\n\n(b) The Tribunal exercised jurisdiction over Total's claims as a shareholder and awarded damages, despite the fact that neither general international law nor Argentine law permit indirect actions such as those brought by Total and admitted by the Tribunal.\n\n(c) The Tribunal first stated\u2014in its Decision on Jurisdiction\u2014that it did not have jurisdiction to decide on the merits of the renegotiation process and then contradicted itself\u2014in its Decision on Liability\u2014in holding the Argentine Republic liable on the basis of the inconclusive result of the renegotiation process.\n\n(d) The Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law by not applying the emergency doctrine under Argentine law. The Tribunal was supposed to carry the examination of the emergency doctrine and the BIT, since Argentina had invoked that defense and Argentine law was part of the applicable law.\n\n(e) The Tribunal (i) failed to apply Article 5(3) of the BIT by rejecting the defense of necessity with regard to the measures adopted in relation to TGN; and (ii) did not state the reasons for its decision not to apply such Article to losses deriving from measures adopted by the government in a situation of national emergency.\n\n170.\n\nThe Committee will first define the standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention and then analyze the application of such standard with respect to each of the reasons for annulment submitted by Argentina.\n\n**a. Manifest Excess of Powers - The Standard**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Committee is of the view, and the Parties do not seem to dispute, that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires that there is an \"excess'\u2019 in the performance of the powers of the Tribunal and that such excess must be \"manifest.\"\n\n172.\n\nAs stated in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment: \"Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides that only instances of \"manifest\" excess of the Tribunal's powers may lead to an annulment, indicating a dual requirement of an \"excess\" that is \"manifest.\"184\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b683.\n\n173.\n\nAn excess of powers is manifest when it is \"(...) obvious, clear or self-evident, and which is discernable without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award.\"185 In the words of the *Wena v. Egypt* annulment committee: \"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"186\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b684.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on the Application by the Arab Republic of Egypt for Annulment of the Arbitral Award (February 5, 2002), \u00b625 *[\"Wena* v. *Egypt\"].*\n\n174.\n\nThe limited scope of Article 52(1)(b) was emphasized in the following passage from the annulment committee's decision in *CDC v. Seychelles:*\n\n\"As interpreted by various ad hoc Committees, the term \u2018manifest' means clear or \"self-evident\". Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other', is not manifest. As one commentator has put it, \u2018If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal's decision is based, the tribunal's determination is conclusive.'\"187\n\n*CDC Group PEC* v. *Republic of Seychelles,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision of the Ad-Hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Seychelles (June 29, 2005), \u00b641 *[\"CDC v. Seychelles\"]**.*\n\n175.\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing, an *ad hoc* committee under the ICSID Convention cannot annul an award on the ground that it's understanding of the facts, or interpretation of the law, or appreciation of evidence is different from that of the tribunal. If it so does, it will cross the line that separates annulment from appeal.188\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G.* v. *Argentine Republic*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1), Decision on Annulment (January 7.2015), \u00b6 186 [\"Daimler v. Argentina\"].\n\n176.\n\nThis Committee agrees with others that have stated that nothing in the ICSID Convention indicates that a different standard shall be applied to issues of jurisdiction. Therefore an award can only be annulled if the lack or excess of jurisdiction was manifest.189 This Committee considers that there is no difference in the standard of review applicable to a claim of manifest excess of powers on the basis of jurisdiction or on the merits.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Republic of Paraguay.* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29), Decision on Annulment (May 19.2014), \u00b6\u00b6114-115 *[\"SGS v. Paraguay\"].*\n\n177.\n\nThe same conclusion is reflected in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment:\n\n\"At the same time, ad hoc Committees have acknowledged the principle specifically provided by the Convention that the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence. This means that the Tribunal has the power to decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the parties' dispute based on the parties' arbitration agreement and the jurisdictional requirements in the ICSID Convention. In light of this principle, the drafting history suggests -and most ad hoc Committees have reasoned -that in order to annul an award based on a Tribunal's determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction, the excess of powers must be \u2018manifest'.\"190\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 89.\n\n178.\n\nThe ICSID's Secretariat Background Paper on Annulment recalls that \"[t]he drafters of the ICSID Convention anticipated an excess of powers when a Tribunal went beyond the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement, decided points which had not been submitted to it, or failed to apply the law agreed to by the parties.\"191\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 82.\n\n**b. Manifest Excess of Powers Relating to the Applicable Law - The Standard**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nAs indicated before, the annulment proceeding is not an appeal and therefore is not a mechanism to correct alleged errors of fact or law that the tribunal may have committed.192 Annulment under the ICSID Convention is a limited remedy.193\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *The United Arab Emirates,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki (June 5, 2007), \u00b6 24\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* \u00b6\u00b634.\n\n180.\n\nConsequently, when an allegation is made that there was a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the applicable law, it is not the role of an *ad hoc* committee to verify whether the interpretation of the law by the tribunal was correct, or whether it correctly ascertained the facts or whether it correctly appreciated the evidence. These are issues relevant to an appeal, but not for annulment proceedings in view of the limited grounds provided for under the ICSID Convention.\n\n181.\n\nAs stated by the *CDC v. Seychelles* annulment committee:\n\n\"(...) Regardless of our opinion of the correctness of the Tribunal's legal analysis, however, our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavored to apply English law. That it did so is made plain by its explicit statement in the Award that it did as well as by its repeated citation to relevant English authorities.'\u2019194\n\n*ibid.* \u00b645.\n\n182.\n\nThe *Daimler v. Argentina* committee portrayed the issue of applicable law in the same sense: \"What the Committee can do is to determine whether the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply it. As to the latter, there is a distinction between endeavoring to apply the correct law and correctly applying the law. While the former may provide a ground for annulment the latter is outside the scope of authority of an ad hoc annulment committee.'\u2019195\n\n*Daimler* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6191.\n\n183.\n\nThis conclusion is also supported in the findings of the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment: \"[t]he drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that a Tribunal's failure to apply the proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that erroneous application of the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest. As stated above, there is no basis for an annulment due to an incorrect decision by a Tribunal, a principle that has been expressly recognized by many ad hoc Committees.\"196\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b691 **.**\n\n184.\n\nThe Committee also considers that when more than one interpretation or approach in concluding what the applicable law is possible, an award cannot be annulled on the ground that it suffers from an exercise of excess of powers, much less a manifest excess of powers.\n\n185.\n\nIn sum, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. If the issue is susceptible of an argument \"one way or the other,\" is not manifest or if the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal's decision is based, then the tribunal's determination is conclusive.197\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles,* \u00b641.\n\n**C. Committee\u2019s decisions on applicable law**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Failure to apply Argentine law to determine the** ***ius standi*** **of Total**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nArgentina claims that, pursuant to Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT, the Tribunal had a duty to apply the provisions of the BIT; Argentine law, including the rules on the conflict of laws; special agreements concluded in relation to the investment; and the relevant principles of international law.198\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b635-36.\n\n187.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law because in its analysis of Total's *ius standi* it did not apply the domestic law of Argentina and international law, along with the BIT.199 In addition, the Tribunal did not provide reasons for its failure to apply the applicable law - Argentine law- but simply considered that such law was \"immaterial\" for the determination of whether the rights in question belonged to Total.200\n\nTr. 199:19-22; 200:9-15.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b634-37.\n\n188.\n\nThe scope of the manifest excess of powers as a ground for annulment has been discussed above both as regards the general standard and the standard that applies in the cases of alleged failure to apply the applicable law.\n\n189.\n\nAs stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD v. Chile,* in order to decide on the matter the Committee has to consider three questions: (1) what law was in truth applicable to a given issue, in accordance with Article 42 of the ICSID Convention; (2) what law did the Tribunal purport to apply to that issue; (3) whether there is any basis for concluding that the Tribunal's decision involved a manifest failure to apply the applicable law, in the limited sense explained in paragraphs 179-185 *supra.201*\n\nMTD *Equitv S.d.n. Bhd and* *MTD Chile S.A.* v. *Republic of Chile,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment (March 1, 2007), \u00b659 [\"MTD v. *Chile*\"].\n\n190.\n\nArticle 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n191.\n\nArticle 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT provides that:\n\n\"The ruling of the arbitral body shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the legislation of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law.\"\n\n192.\n\nRespondent considers that Argentine law should have been applied to the determination of Total's *ius standi* and that if Argentine law had been applied the Tribunal would have concluded that a shareholder could not submit a claim alleging the breach of the rights of the company, such as Total did.202 It also considers that general international law does not permit indirect or derivative actions, unless the possibility of submitting such actions has been expressly provided for in an appropriate instrument203.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b650-54.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b640-41, \u00b6\u00b655-56.\n\n193.\n\nThe first question204 that this Committee has to address is what law was in truth applicable to the given issue that the Tribunal had to decide, in accordance with Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee \u00b6 189 *supra.*\n\n194.\n\nThere is no doubt that in Article 8(4) the parties to the Argentina-France BIT agreed on the applicable law: the provisions of the Argentina-France BIT, the legislation of Argentina (as the Contracting Party which is a party to the particular dispute), including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law.\n\n195.\n\nThe Parties do not seem to dispute, and the Committee agrees, that there would be a manifest excess of powers if the parties to the given treaty have agreed on the applicable law and the Arbitral Tribunal fails to apply the agreed applicable law. In other words, failing to apply such agreed laws to the issue in dispute would meet the requisite standard for annulment.\n\n196.\n\nHowever, if the text of the treaty provides for several applicable laws, without providing a hierarchy or a rule as to which law should apply to a particular issue, and there is a dispute between the parties as to the law that should apply to decide a particular issue in dispute, it is for the arbitral tribunal to conclude what the applicable law is, based on the text of the treaty and the submissions of the parties before it. It is not for the *ad hoc* Committee to review the correctness of the approach taken by the Arbitral Tribunal, let alone the correctness of the conclusion on which is the applicable law for a particular issue.\n\n197.\n\nIf the parties, as in the case at hand, dispute the applicable law based on a different interpretation of the language of the treaty, it is for the arbitral tribunal to characterize the nature of the issue in dispute and decide which is the law that applies to the given issue. The Committee notes that there may be many different approaches or conclusions that tribunals have adopted or made in the past, and that there are differing views on how the law should be ascertained. Suffice it to note that the task for this Committee is not to review the findings of the Tribunal and substitute the applicable laws it finds or prefers in the annulment proceedings.\n\n198.\n\nHence in addressing the first question of what law was in truth applicable to a given issue in accordance with Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, this Committee stresses that it cannot review *de novo* the arguments of the Parties and come to a conclusion as to what is the applicable law under Article 42. This Committee takes the view that short of acting *ex aequo et bono* or where the error in applying the law is so grave that it is tantamount to a veritable case of nonapplication, a finding of the tribunal on what the applicable law is cannot be reviewed and challenged by an *ad hoc* committee.\n\n199.\n\nIt is clear for this Committee that an arbitral tribunal has the authority to interpret the text of the given treaty and to determine, based on the interpretation of the treaty, the approach that it will follow to identify the applicable law and to establish how such law applies to the issue in question. An *ad hoc* committee could not review the correctness of such interpretation.\n\n200.\n\nNothing in the Argentina-France BIT requires the Tribunal to apply all the laws listed in Article 8(4) to all issues in dispute, or to grant the treaty, or domestic law or international law a special hierarchy or preference to define an issue in dispute. It is thus for the Tribunal to interpret Article 8(4) the Argentina-France BIT and decide on the interplay between the different sources of law listed therein.\n\n201.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal first defined the issue that it had to decide, *i.e.,* whether the measures of Argentina that allegedly adversely affected the local companies, in which Total holds minority shareholdings are capable of constituting a breach of the protection afforded by the BIT and therefore, whether the case at hand was one of a \"dispute arising directly out of an investment\".205\n\n\"The question at issue here is whether the measures of Argentina that allegedly adversely affected the local companies, in which Total holds minority shareholdings and whose value was in him affected, are capable of constituting a breach of the protection afforded by the BIT to Total\u2019s investments as therein defined. If the answer is affinnative on the basis of a prima facie examination, then the present case is one of a \"dispute arising directly out of an investment\" on which this Tribunal has jurisdiction.\" Decision on Jurisdiction, 73.\n\n202.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal considered that Total was invoking treaty rights, and proceeded to analyze the definition of \"investment\" under the Argentina-France BIT, referring to its object and purpose and citing international case law, to conclude that:\n\n\"There is no reason to hold otherwise when minority shareholding in a local company incorporate are at issue in a situation such as the present one. The BIT specifically included minority shareholding within the definition of investment\".206 [...] The Tribunal finds therefore that claims with respect to Total's indirect and minority shareholdings in TGN, HPDA and Central Puerto are disputes relating to an investment, as defined in the BIT. Thus, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8.1 of the BIT with respect to these legal disputes arising directly out of an investment. The issue of whether Argentina's measures actually breached any of Total's treaty rights is one for the merits stage of the proceedings and has not been considered by the Tribunal at this stage.207\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b675.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b676.\n\n203.\n\nWhen addressing the objection on jurisdiction based on the alleged lack of *ius standi,* the Tribunal reiterates that Total's claims fall within the ambit of the BIT and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction,208 explains the reasons why the Barcelona Traction case209 and Argentine law do not apply210 and indicates that Total is invoking treaty rights as an investor under the Argentina-France BIT, and therefore Total's claims cannot *\"be defined as indirect claims (or \u2018\u2018derivative claims \"), as if Total was claiming on behalf or* in lieu *of its subsidiaries in respect to rights granted to the latter by the laws of Argentina. It is therefore irrelevant that such claims would be inadmissible under those laws and that they would not be amenable in any case to the jurisdiction of and ICSID arbitral tribunal,\"211*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b677.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b678.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b679-81.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b681.\n\n204.\n\nIn sum, in the case at hand, the arbitral tribunal first identified the issue in dispute, i.e., whether Total had an investment and thus, whether there was a *\u2018\u2018dispute arising directly out of an* *investment. \"212* Then it decided that the applicable law for that particular issue was the Argentina-France BIT and applied the definition of \"investment\" in the Argentina-France BIT to conclude that the definition included minority shareholders and therefore *\"claims with respect to Total's indirect and minority shareholdings in TGN. HPDA and Central Puerto are disputes relating to an investment, as defined in the BIT.* \"213 Considering that the disputes related to an investment, the Tribunal concluded that it had *\"jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8.1 of the BIT with respect to these legal disputes arising directly out of an investment. \"214*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 73.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 76.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 76.\n\n205.\n\nAs regards Argentine law, the Tribunal indicated that since there was an investment in accordance with the Argentina-France BIT and Total was invoking treaty rights under the Argentina-France BIT, the claims could not be considered indirect or derivative as if Total was claiming rights of its subsidiaries under Argentine law and therefore, *\"it is therefore irrelevant that such claims would be inadmissible under those laws and that they would not be amenable in any case to the jurisdiction of and ICSID arbitral tribunal. \"215*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 81.\n\n206.\n\nThe foregoing does not mean, as Argentina suggests, that the Tribunal has considered the Argentine legal system or Argentine law irrelevant. The Decisions and the Award must be read in context and not in an isolated manner. The Tribunal considered, as it results from the above paragraphs, that the issue in dispute was whether or not Total had an investment for purposes of the Argentina-France BIT, and thus whether the dispute related to an investment. The Tribunal decided that the issue in dispute had to be defined under the provisions of the Argentina-France BIT and not under Argentine law and explained the reasons for that decision.\n\n207.\n\nThe Parties differed as to which of the laws mentioned in the Argentina-France BIT applied to determine the **ius standi** of Total as an investor. The Arbitral Tribunal determined that, amongst the laws mentioned in the said treaty, the proper law to define the **ius standi** of Total as an investor was the Argentina-France BIT, and concluded that Argentine law was not applicable and thus that it was not relevant whether or not the claims were admissible under Argentine law. The Arbitral Tribunal characterized the issue in dispute and decided, based on the text of the Argentina-France BIT and the submissions of the Parties, which of the laws agreed upon by the parties to the treaty applied to the issue in dispute.\n\n208.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal followed a similar approach throughout the Decisions and the Award, *i.e.,* identifying the specific issue in dispute and then determining whether such particular issue is a matter that had to be defined under the Argentina-France BIT, the laws of Argentina, or principles of international law.216\n\n*e.g.* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b673-76.\n\n209.\n\nNeither the approach applied by the Tribunal to determine the applicable law nor the decision to apply the provisions of the Argentina-France BIT to the issue in dispute - *ius standi* of Total -amount to a disregard of the applicable law, much less a failure to apply Argentine law. Argentina considers that the Tribunal should have followed a different approach to determine the applicable law, and that such approach should have resulted in the application of Argentine law to define whether Total, being a minority shareholder, had the right to claim as an investor.\n\n210.\n\nAs already mentioned by this Committee,217 nothing in the Argentina-France BIT requires the Tribunal to apply all the laws listed in Article 8(4) to all issues in dispute or to grant a given law a special hierarchy to define an issue in dispute. What Argentina is asking this Committee is to review *de novo* not only the interpretation of the Arbitral Tribunal that led it to conclude that the applicable law is the Argentina-France BIT, but also to reconsider the arguments before the Tribunal on what the applicable law is and to conclude that the Arbitral Tribunal should have applied Argentine law to determine whether Total had an investment protected under the Argentina-France BIT. This would amount to an appeal of the Decisions of the Arbitral Tribunal, which is precluded upon a proper interpretation of the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee \u00b6 200 *supra.*\n\n211.\n\nThe reasoned decision of the Arbitral Tribunal to apply the Argentina-France BIT as the proper law to the issue in question, and not to apply Argentine law or the Barcelona Traction case, as claimed by Argentina, does not involve a manifest disregard of the applicable law in the limited sense explained above. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**b. Failure to apply the applicable law as regards the emergency doctrine under Argentine law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nArgentina questions the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal under paragraph 40 of the Decision on Liability. According to Argentina, the Tribunal never applied the emergency doctrine under Argentine law, which was one of the defenses raised by the Argentine Republic. However, in paragraph 39 of the Decision on Liability the Tribunal held that it had to determine the precise content and extent of Total's economic rights under Argentina's legal system in respect of Total's claims under the BIT, wherever necessary in order to ascertain whether a breach of the BIT had occurred.\n\n213.\n\nArgentina criticizes that the Arbitral Tribunal reasoned that Argentine law would play a role in determining the scope of Total's economic rights under Argentina's legal system, while the provisions of the emergency doctrine in Argentine law would not be relevant to the extent of obligations under the Argentina-France BIT.218 According to Argentina, the Tribunal should have considered the application of Argentine law, *i.e.,* the emergency doctrine, for purposes of determining in the light of this doctrine the extent of the property rights that constitute Claimant's investment.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b664-65.\n\n214.\n\nAccording to Argentina, regardless of the position adopted by the Arbitral Tribunal with regard to the resolution of potential conflicts between international and domestic law, so long as such conflict does not arise, the Tribunal should have applied both sources of law, as provided for in Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT. The failure to apply the domestic law, together with the BIT and international law, amounted to yet another case of failure to apply the applicable law.\n\n215.\n\nIn paragraph 39 of its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal affirmed that:\n\n\"39. *The first question concerns the role of Argentina's domestic law in determining the content and the extent of Total's economic rights as they exist in Argentina's legal system.* In this regard the Tribunal believes that Argentine law has a broader role than that of just determining factual matters. The content and the scope of Total's economic rights (in Total's words, \"Argentina's commitments to Total\") must be determined by the Tribunal in light of Argentina's legal principles and provisions. Moreover, the extensive reliance by the Claimant on Argentina's acts of a legislative and administrative nature governing the gas, electricity and hydrocarbons sectors, as well as the extensive discussion between the parties regarding the content and extent of Total's rights in respect of the operation of its investments, is a recognition that Argentina's domestic law plays a prominent role. Thus, the Tribunal shall determine the precise content and extent of Total's economic rights under Argentina's legal system in respect of Total's claims under the BIT, wherever necessary in order to ascertain whether a breach of the BIT has occurred.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n216.\n\nIn paragraph 40, in turn, the Tribunal reasoned as follows:\n\n\"40. *The second question regards the relevance that Argentina claims the emergency doctrine under Argentine law to have in determining whether a breach of the BIT has taken place.* In this regard the Tribunal makes the following observations. First, since Total complains of breaches of the BIT, the Tribunal must apply principally the BIT, as interpreted under international law, to resolve any matter raised. This means that the Tribunal must assess Argentina's responsibility under the BIT by applying the treaty itself and the relevant rules of customary international law. The Tribunal cannot accept Argentina's position that, by invoking the emergency principle as it exists under Argentine law, Argentina can avoid international responsibility for violation of the treaty. This would contradict the fundamental principle of international law according to which \u2014a party may not invoke its internal law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty (Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties). Secondly, the Tribunal notes that any complaint by Total that Argentina's measures are in breach of domestic law is not raised per se but is used by Total to support Total's claims under the BIT. Therefore the fact that any domestic measure challenged by Total might be legitimate in Argentina's legal system thanks to the emergency doctrine would not relieve the Tribunal from examining whether Argentina has nevertheless thereby breached the BIT.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n217.\n\nAn arbitral tribunal has the authority to characterize the issue in dispute, interpret the provisions of the treaty as to applicable law and determine the law that applies to the given issue.219 An *ad hoc* committee could not review such interpretation on grounds of manifest excess of powers, unless it is manifest, evident, that the arbitral tribunal failed to apply a law pursuant to the terms of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee \u00b6 197 *supra.*\n\n218.\n\nThe Committee has already established220 that the Argentina-France BIT does not require the Arbitral Tribunal to apply all the laws listed in Article 8(4) to all issues in dispute, or to grant a given law a special hierarchy to define an issue in dispute. In the case at hand, the Tribunal identified two different questions, characterized the issue in dispute, and then decided which law should apply to each specific question.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6195-197 *supra.*\n\n219.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considered the question related to \"the role of Argentina's domestic law in determining the content and the extent of Total's economic rights as they exist in Argentina's legal system\"221 and concluded that in order to determine such content and extent the laws of Argentina had a broader rule than just determining factual matters.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b63 9.\n\n220.\n\nSecond, the Arbitral Tribunal considered whether the emergency doctrine under Argentine law was, as claimed by Argentina, relevant to determine whether a breach of the BIT has taken place.\n\n221.\n\nIn this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal reasoned that (a) the responsibility of Argentina under the Argentina-France BIT must be assessed by applying the treaty itself and the relevant rules of customary international law; (b) Argentina cannot avoid international responsibility for violation of the Argentina-France BIT by invoking the emergency principle under Argentine law (Article 27 of the VCLT); and (c) the fact that any domestic measure might be legitimate in Argentina's legal system thanks to the emergency doctrine would not relieve the Tribunal from examining whether Argentina has nevertheless thereby breached the BIT.\n\n222.\n\nThe Committee considers that in paragraphs 39 and 40 of the Decision on Liability the Tribunal characterized each issue that it had to decide, determined which law should apply to each such issue, and explained the reasons therefor. There is no failure to apply the law, as Argentina suggests, but a reasoned decision as to which law should apply to each specific issue. What Argentina is asking this Committee is either to apply all the laws listed in Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT, to conclude that the Argentine emergency doctrine should have prevailed, or to consider that Argentine law, not the Argentina-France BIT, should have applied to the question of the emergency doctrine. This would amount to an appeal of the decisions of the Arbitral Tribunal, which is precluded upon a proper interpretation of the ICSID Convention. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**c. Failure to apply Article 5(3) of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nArgentina claims that throughout the arbitration proceedings it held that since the measures challenged by Claimant were aimed at responding to a state of national emergency, the only applicable provision was Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n224.\n\nArgentina holds that in order for such provision to have a useful effect, the only obligation to be fulfilled by the State in a state of national emergency\u2014or in any of the abovementioned cases\u2014 was to grant the French investors treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors from third States. However, the Arbitral Tribunal considered that Article 5(3) is not applicable to an economic emergency, unless the economic emergency, which hits one of the parties to the BIT, has led to a national emergency where losses have occurred such as those that are a result of war, uprising or any other kind of civil disturbance.\n\n225.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal never stated the reasons for its decision and rendered Article 5(3) ineffective in stating that such provision does not apply to losses deriving from measures adopted by the government in a situation of national emergency, when the State is normally liable only for its measures (and therefore, in accordance with the TribunaFs interpretation, Article 5(3) would have no useful effect). The TribunaFs suggestion that Article 5(3) of the BIT only applies when compensation of losses has been granted by a Party to its own investors or to investors of a third Party creates a condition that has not been established in the text of the provision.\n\n226.\n\nThe Committee does not agree with Argentina and considers that there is no failure to apply Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, but rather a disagreement of Argentina with the interpretation of the said article by the Arbitral Tribunal and with the conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal arising from such interpretation.\n\n227.\n\nIn paragraph 229 of the Decision on Liability the Tribunal indicated that Article 5(3) is not applicable to an economic emergency unless it has led to a national emergency where losses have occurred such as those that are a result of war, uprising or any other kind of civil disturbance. The Tribunal interpreted the aforesaid article and concluded that in the case at hand a national economic emergency was not covered by the article in question and explained the reasons therefor. The provision was considered and the Tribunal expressed the reasoning for its interpretation of the article. There is no failure to apply the applicable law.\n\n228.\n\nArgentina considers that the interpretation of the Arbitral Tribunal would render Article 5(3) ineffective and proposes its own interpretation. It is not for the Committee to review the interpretation of the Tribunal or to review whether such interpretation is correct. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**d. Failure to Apply the Necessity Defense under Customary International law.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nArgentina invoked the defense of necessity under customary international law as a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act contrary to the obligation allegedly violated.\n\n230.\n\nAccording to Argentina, in the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal rejected the defense of necessity with regard to the measures adopted in relation to TGN, because the Argentine Republic had allegedly failed to show that those measures were the only way for the State to safeguard essential interests against a grave and imminent peril. However, the Tribunal never specified the legal standards to be met in relation to the \"necessity\" of protection of essential interest and the \"only way\" requirement.\n\n231.\n\nArgentina holds that similar conclusions may be drawn as regards the finding of the Tribunal in connection with the power generation and the hydrocarbon exploration and production sectors.\n\n232.\n\nConsequently, according to Argentina, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to apply the law it was supposed to apply.\n\n233.\n\nIn the Decision on Liability, the Arbitral Tribunal specifically analyzed the defense of necessity under customary international law.222\n\nDecision on Liability \u00b6\u00b6220-224.\n\n234.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal initially explained (a) that it was for Argentina, as the party raising the defense, to prove that the elements required under Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility were met,223 (b) the reasons for considering that the Arbitral Tribunal should only have to evaluate the defense of necessity in respect of the failure of Argentina to readjust the gas tariffs;224 and (c) what such evaluation of the defense of necessity entails, *i.e,* the \"essential interests\" and \"only way\" requirements.225\n\nDecision on Liability \u00b6 221.\n\nDecision on Liability \u00b6 221.\n\nIn this regard, in \u00b6 221 of the Decision on Liability the Arbitral Tribunal stresses that \"More specifically, this entails, first, ascertaining whether the protracted freezing of the gas distribution tariff as of 2002 in breach of the BIT was necessary to safeguard Argentina\u2019s essential interests in preserving its people and their security in face of the economic and social emergency of 2001. Second, the Tribunal must determine whether such freezing, if necessary, was the only way to safeguard such alleged essential interest.\" Footnotes omitted.\n\n235.\n\nThe Decision on Liability, together with the footnotes thereto, discuss the \"essential interests\" and \"only way\" requirements as characterized and claimed by Argentina,226 and after such discussion the Tribunal concludes that:\n\n\"Argentina has failed to prove the defense of necessity under customary international law as concerns the measures adopted in relation to Total\u2019s investments in TGN found to be in breach of the BIT. It is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine whether the further conditions required under customary international law for Argentina to avail itself of the defense of necessity have been fulfilled. Nor does the Tribunal have to analyze Total\u2019s counter-arguments in respect of those conditions. The Tribunal concludes that Argentina\u2019s defense based on the state of necessity under customary international law is groundless.\"227\n\nDecision on Liability \u00b6\u00b6220-224.\n\nDecision on Liability \u00b6224.\n\n236.\n\nFinally, in connection with Total's claims as to its investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons, in paragraph 482 of the Decision on Liability the Arbitral Tribunal indicated that:\n\n\"Argentina has raised the defense of necessity under customary international law also in respect of Total\u2019s claims as to its investments in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. As in the case of Total\u2019s other investments, the Tribunal must therefore examine this defense in the light of the criteria stated in Article 25 ILC Articles on State Responsibility as it relates to measures adopted by Argentina in breach of the BIT.\"228\n\nDecision on Liability \u00b6482.\n\n237.\n\nIn footnotes 674 and 675 of paragraph 482 of the Decision on Liability, the Arbitral Tribunal refers to the analysis of the state of necessity under paragraph 220 and following, to conclude that Argentina had not met its burden of proof of the defense of necessity and therefore such defense is groundless.229\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6482, fn. 674 and 675.\n\n238.\n\nThe reading of the above mentioned paragraphs of the Decision on Liability leads the Committee to conclude that Argentina is not correct in claiming that the Tribunal never specified the legal standards to be met in relation to the necessity of protection of essential interest and the \"only way\" requirement. On the contrary, what the said paragraphs indicate is that Argentina defined what it considered to be the standards of the \"necessity\" of protection of \"essential interest\" and the \"only way\" requirement and failed to prove the standards it had defined.\n\n239.\n\nIn sum, the Decision on Liability does not reject the legal standards claimed by Argentina to apply standards that the Tribunal did not define, as suggested by Argentina. The Decision on Liability takes the standards claimed by Argentina, the facts that Argentina presents in support of such standards, and concludes that Argentina failed to prove its own standards. This does not amount to a failure to apply the applicable law. It is simply a disagreement of Argentina with the legal analysis and conclusions of the Arbitral Tribunal. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**D. Manifest excess of powers relating to jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Standard**\n-------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe ICSID Background Paper on Annulment summarizes the standard for annulment for excess of powers related to jurisdiction, as identified by tribunals and *ad hoc* committees, by indicating that *\"there may be an excess of powers if a Tribunal incorrectly concludes that it has jurisdiction when in fact jurisdiction is lacking or when the Tribunal exceeds the scope of its jurisdiction. It has been recognized, in the inverse case, that a Tribunal\u2019s rejection of jurisdiction when jurisdiction exists also amounts to an excess ofpowers''230*\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b688.\n\n241.\n\nArbitral tribunals are the judges of their own competence and therefore, they are empowered to decide whether they have jurisdiction to hear the parties' dispute, considering the arbitration agreement and the Convention's jurisdictional requirements.231\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b689.\n\n242.\n\nThe requirement of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention that the excess of powers must be manifest applies equally to jurisdictional decisions and to a failure to apply the proper governing law. This means that an *ad hoc* committee cannot generally review *de novo* the decision of the tribunal on jurisdiction. An *ad hoc* Committee could only annul an award for manifest excess powers related to jurisdiction if it is obvious, clear or self-evident, without the need for an elaborate analysis of the decision, that the tribunal exercised jurisdiction that it does not have or failed to exercise jurisdiction that it has.\n\n243.\n\nIn the words of the *Azurix v. Argentina* committee:\n\n\"If... reasonable minds might differ as to whether or not the tribunal has jurisdiction, that issue falls to be resolved definitively by the tribunal in exercise of its power under Article 41 before the award is given, rather than by an ad hoc committee under Article 52(1)(b) after the award has been given.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if it is subsequently seen to be arguable whether or not the tribunal's decision under Article 41 was correct, it cannot be said that the tribunal manifestly lacked jurisdiction, and there is no basis for an ad hoc committee in purported exercise of its power under Article 52(1)(b) to substitute its own decision for that of the tribunal. As the tribunal's decision under Article 41 must be treated as conclusive, is such a case there is also no occasion for an ad hoc committee to express its own view on whether or not the tribunal had jurisdiction.\"232\n\n*Azurix Corp, v* *Argentina,* Decision on the Application for Annulment (1 September 2009), \u00b6 68-69.\n\n244.\n\nThe Committee will review, under the aforementioned standard, the claims by Argentina related to manifest excess of powers for excess jurisdiction\n\n**b. Excess jurisdiction because neither general international law nor Argentine lawpermit indirect actions such as those brought by Total and admitted by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal exercised jurisdiction over rights vested in Argentine companies that were not parties to this arbitration.233 In the view of Argentina, general international law does not permit indirect or derivative actions, unless the possibility of submitting such actions has been expressly provided for in an appropriate instrument.234\n\nMem., \u00b6 40.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b640-41, \u00b6\u00b655-56.\n\n246.\n\nArgentina considers that under Argentine law, only the corporation would be entitled to assert its own rights. A shareholder may not submit a claim alleging the breach of the rights of the company.235 An investment treaty does not create a new kind of shareholding for the provisions of the BIT could not introduce changes in the laws of the host State.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b650-54.\n\n247.\n\nIn sum, Argentina claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it impermissibly assumed jurisdiction despite the fact that neither international law nor Argentine law, which are applicable laws to the dispute pursuant to the Argentina-France BIT, allow indirect or derivative claims.\n\n248.\n\nAs mentioned before in this Decision on Annulment,236 the Tribunal considered \"whether the measures of Argentina that allegedly adversely affected the local companies, in which Total holds minority shareholdings and whose value was in turn affected, are capable of constituting a breach of the protection afforded by the BIT to Total's investments as therein defined\"237 and concluded that the \"BIT specifically includes minority shareholdings within the definition of investment\"238 and that the \"claims with respect to Total's indirect and minority shareholdings in TGN, HPDA and Central Puerto are disputes relating to an investment, as defined in the BIT.\"239\n\nSee \u00b6 204-205 *supra.*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b673.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b675.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b676.\n\n249.\n\nIn its finding in favor of jurisdiction the Tribunal considered that the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention were the law relevant to determine standing to bring claims under the BIT and specifically rejected Argentina's characterization of Total's claims as derivative claims and its contention that Argentine law must be applied to disallow these claims. It also analyzed and rejected Argentina's contention that international law should be applied and that under the ICJ jurisprudence the claims were derivative or indirect claims.240\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b667-81,\u00b690.\n\n250.\n\nArgentina was not able to substantiate in these annulment proceedings that the Arbitral Tribunal was manifestly in excess of its powers in concluding that it had jurisdiction. There is nothing in the provisions of the Argentina-France BIT related to applicable law that imposes on a Tribunal a particular hierarchy, or a particular method of interpretation or application of the laws that it lists as applicable. Argentina simply disagrees with the decision of the Tribunal as to the interpretation and application of the interaction between the particular legal provisions mentioned in Article 8(4) the Argentina-France BIT and asks the Committee to revisit the issue and to conclude that it was Argentine law, not international law nor the Argentina-France BIT, that should be applicable, and that under such laws the claims were derivative or indirect. This would entail a *de novo* review by this Committee, which is not permitted under the ICSID Convention. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**c. Excess jurisdiction related to the renegotiation process.**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nArgentina holds that at the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration proceedings it objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because the dispute was contractual in nature. Total challenged such objection to jurisdiction. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal rejected the objection in question and indicated that Total had not asked the Tribunal to evaluate the renegotiation process under Argentina's regulations nor to enter into the merit of the renegotiation process on which the Tribunal would have no competence.\n\n252.\n\nHowever, according to Argentina, in its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal contradicted itself and held Argentina liable for violating the fair and equitable treatment standard due to the inconclusive results of the renegotiation process. By holding Argentina liable in its Decision on Liability on the basis of that which the Tribunal had excluded from its competence in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal exceeded its competence, which amounts to a manifest excess of powers in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n253.\n\nIn paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, when addressing the objection filed by Argentina, the Tribunal expressed:\n\n\"For the purpose of ascertaining jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers the above claims to fall within its competence since, prima facie, they present conduct by Argentina that may constitute a violation of the BIT obligations and standards of protection to which Total as a French investor is entitled. Total has clearly not asked this Tribunal to evaluate the renegotiation process under Argentina's regulations nor to enter into the merit of this process, on which - as Argentina points out - this Tribunal would have no competence. On the contrary Total claims that the renegotiation process is itself in breach of the BIT and that, by invoking such process under its domestic law, Argentina attempts to evade its international obligations, including that of arbitrating the dispute in accordance with Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n\"In the light of the above, the Tribunal cannot accept Argentina's arguments that the present dispute is not a legal dispute involving the application of the BIT under international law. Nor can the Tribunal accept that it is a contractual dispute involving the renegotiation process.\"241\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b668-69.\n\n254.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal analyzes the freezing of tariffs since 2002 and the process of review of the tariffs undertaken by Argentina, including the proposed renegotiation thereof.242 The Tribunal considered that *\"the failure of the renegotiation process in 2002 to lead to re-adjustments, notwithstanding the legal provisions enacted for that purpose, might be understandable in view of the political and economic emergency of that period:'\u2019243*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6166 -175.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 171.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal further reasoned that this was not true after President Kirchner's election and the creation through UNIREN of a general mechanism to carry out tariff re-adjustments and that it had been recognized that Argentina's economy quickly recovered from the crisis\u2014by the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004. UNIREN was required to conclude the renegotiation process by 31 December 2004 and as late as April 2007 UNIREN proposed a final **Acta Acuerdo** that would not have remedied the lack of readjustment of the past. After analyzing the conditions in the proposed **Acta Acuerdo** the Tribunal stated: *\"Total submits that these conditions represent an additional breach of the fair and equitable treatment required under Article 3 of the BIT:\u2019244*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6173.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded as follows:\n\n\"In sum, from the passage of Emergency Law onwards, Argentina's public authorities repeatedly established new deadlines, causing protracted delays in the renegotiation of concessions and licenses (the tariff regime included) in the public utility sector for almost six years. At the same time, any automatic semi-annual adjustment (such as the one originally provided linked to the US PPI) had been discontinued.\n\nAs mentioned above, the failure to promptly readjust the tariffs when the Emergency Law was enacted and during the height of the crisis could have been justified, provided that Argentina subsequently had pursued successful renegotiations to re-establish the equilibrium of the tariffs as provided by law. This, however, has not happened due to the inconclusive results of the renegotiation process entrusted by Argentina to UNIREN. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that, in this respect, Argentina is in breach of its BIT obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment to Total under Article 3 in respect of Total's investment in TGN.\"245\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6174-175.\n\n257.\n\nThe Committee sees no contradiction, much less an excess jurisdiction, in the Decision on Jurisdiction when compared to the relevant paragraphs of the Decision of Liability as regards the renegotiation process.\n\n258.\n\nTotal claimed that the renegotiating process was in itself a breach of the Argentina-France BIT and that by invoking such process under its domestic law, Argentina was attempting to evade its international obligations, including that of arbitrating the dispute. In the Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal considered that it had no jurisdiction to *\u2018\u2018evaluate the renegotiation process under Argentina's regulations nor to enter into the merit of this process. \"246*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 68.\n\n259.\n\nThe Decision on Liability did not, as suggested by Argentina, undertake a review of the renegotiation process under Argentine law or regulations or the legal merits of such renegotiation process. There is nothing in the said Decision on Liability that suggests that the Tribunal undertook such a review. Neither the text of the above quoted paragraphs, on which Argentina bases its claim of excess of powers, nor other sections of the Decision on Liability contain an evaluation of the renegotiation process based on Argentina's regulations, *e.g.,* a review of the validity or effects of such process under Argentine law or regulations.\n\n260.\n\nIn the Decision on Liability the Tribunal considered the renegotiation process as a fact, as part of the conduct of Argentina, to determine whether the conduct of Argentina in connection with the freezing of tariffs, including the conduct of Argentina in connection with the renegotiating process, constituted a violation of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n261.\n\nSuch review of the conduct during the renegotiation process does not entail, as suggested by Argentina, a review of the merits of the renegotiation itself, which review is a matter of Argentine law. By considering that the renegotiation process was delayed, that it was not concluded, that it was incapable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the tariffs and therefore, that Argentina violated *\"its BIT obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment to Total under Article 3 in respect of Total's investment in TGN,* \"247 the Tribunal is not making any assessment of the merits or legality of the renegotiation itself, but an assessment whether the conduct of Argentina as regards the renegotiation constitutes a violation of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6175.\n\n262.\n\nConsequently, there is no contradiction between the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability and it is clear for the Committee that the Tribunal did not review the renegotiation process under Argentine law nor its legal merits and therefore there is no cause for annulment for the alleged manifest excess of powers in connection with the renegotiation process. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**E. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nArgentina considers that the Arbitral Tribunal failed to state reasons:\n\na. In finding jurisdiction over Total's claims;\n\nb. In finding a breach of Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT;\n\nc. In its application of the Argentine emergency doctrine;\n\nd. In interpreting Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT;\n\ne. In interpreting the customary international law defense of necessity; and\n\nf. In its assessment of damages.\n\n**a. The Standard**\n-------------------\n\n264.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award may be annulled if it has \"failed to state the reasons on which it is based\". ICSID *Ad hoc* committees have considered that annulment under this ground requires a failure by the arbitral tribunal to comply with its obligation of rendering an award that allows readers to comprehend and follow its reasoning.248\n\n*Daimler* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 74; *Maritime International Nominees Establishment* v. *Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award (December 22, 1989), *[\"M.I.N.E.* v. *Guinea\"]* \u00b6 5.09 (\"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\")\n\n265.\n\nAs indicated by the *Impregilo v. Argentina ad hoc* committee, for this requirement to be established, an *ad hoc* Committee should not be concerned with the correctness of the tribunal's reasoning but its analysis should be confined to ascertaining whether the reasoning would allow an informed reader to understand how the tribunal reached its conclusions.249\n\n*Impregilo* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 180.\n\n266.\n\nThe ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, quoting decisions of other *ad hoc* committees, explained that \"the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.\"250\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6106.\n\n267.\n\nAs stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *M.I.N.E. v. Guinea,* \"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point **B,** and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"251 The *ad hoc* Committee considers that this ground for annulment refers to a \u2018minimum requirement' only, which is based on the duty of the arbitral tribunal to identify and let the parties know the factual and legal premises that led the tribunal to its decision. If the tribunal gives such sequence of reasons, there would not be basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(e),252\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea,* \u00b6\u00b65.08 - 5.09.\n\n*Wena* v. *Egypt,* \u00b6\u00b679 and 81.\n\n268.\n\nThe Parties in these annulment proceedings do not seem to dispute the two tests provided for by the *ad hoc* committee in *Daimler v Argentina* as tests that must be satisfied before an *ad hoc* committee can annul an award based on contradictory reasons. First, the reasons must be genuinely contradictory in that they cancel each other out so as to amount to no reasons at all. Second, the point with regard to which these reasons are given is necessary for the tribunal's decision.253\n\n*Daimler* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 77.\n\n269.\n\nIn sum, as already stated by the *Daimler v. Argentina ad hoc* committee, the standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is, therefore, high. It does not permit an *ad hoc* committee to second guess the reasoning of the tribunal and imposes on the applicant the burden of proving that the reasoning of the tribunal on a point that is essential for the outcome of the case was either absent, unintelligible, contradictory or frivolous. In order to succeed, the applicant must discharge this burden.254\n\n*Daimler* v. *Argentina, \u00b679**.*\n\n270.\n\nPrior annulment committees have recalled that the standard under Article 52(1)(e) is a minimum standard that allows a reasonable reader to understand the award.255 As stated by the *MTD v. Chile* annulment committee:\n\n\"In the end the question is whether an informed reader of the Award would understand the reasons given by the Tribunal and would discern no material contradiction in them.\"256 This ground for annulment only concerns the absence of reasons and not their quality or correctness.\"257\n\n*Wena* v. *Egypt,* \u00b6 79; *SGS* v. *Paraguay,* \u00b6\u00b6139-140.\n\nADD v. *Chile,* \u00b6 *92.*\n\n*Compania Aguas del Aconquija S.A*. *& Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, (July 3.2002), \u00b6\u00b664-65; *CDC* v. *Seychelles,* \u00b6\u00b670 and 75.\n\n271.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) does not allow a committee to assess the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasoning in the award or to inquire into the quality of the reasons.258\n\n*Impregilo* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 181.\n\n**b. Failure to state reasons in finding jurisdiction over Total\u2019s claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nArgentina claims that the Tribunal failed to apply Argentine law and international law as the applicable laws to determine that it had jurisdiction over Total's claims259 and that it in so doing it incurred in a failure to state reasons that merits annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Decision on Liability and the Award.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 *56-66 supra.*\n\n273.\n\nAs already mentioned in this Decision on Annulment,260 the Tribunal characterized the issue to be decided, determined the law applicable to such issue (the Argentina-France BIT), established the consequences of such application and then analyzed and rejected Argentina's reasoning that Total's claims were derivative claims, explaining the reasons for such rejection.261\n\nSee \u00b6 207 *supra.*\n\nSee Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b677-81.\n\n274.\n\nIn its submissions in this annulment proceedings Argentina disagrees with such reasoning and presents an alternative approach - application of Argentine law - which it considers the appropriate one, and then claims that not having adopted that approach constitutes both a manifest excess of powers and a failure to state reasons.\n\n275.\n\nHere, again, Argentina is asking this Committee to review *de novo* the finding of the applicability of the Argentina-France BIT by the Arbitral Tribunal to conclude that the Tribunal should have applied Argentine law to define whether Total had an investment protected under the Argentina-France BIT. This would amount to an appeal of the decisions of the arbitral tribunal, which appeal is expressly banned by the provisions of the ICSID Convention. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**c. Failure to state reasons in finding a breach of Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT.**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nArgentina claims that there is a contradiction between the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability as the former denies jurisdiction to review the renegotiation process under Argentine law or the merits of such process and the latter takes into consideration the renegotiation process in determining liability. The failure to state reasons results from not having explained the reasons for such alleged contradiction.\n\n277.\n\nThe Committee has already found that no such contradiction exists262 and therefore the allegation on failure to sate reasons in finding a breach of Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT is groundless and must be rejected. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\nSee \u00b6 251-261 *supra.*\n\n**d. Failure to state reasons in its application of the Argentine emergency doctrine**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nArgentina holds that the Arbitral Tribunal failed to state reasons in connection with the emergency doctrine because it did not specify the alleged conflict with the BIT that purportedly prevented the application of the emergency doctrine, or the circumstances that relieved the Tribunal from applying the emergency doctrine as part of the applicable law.263\n\nSee Memorial on Annulment \u00b6 77.\n\n279.\n\nThe Committee has already referred to the alleged failure to apply the Argentine law as regards the emergency doctrine and referred, *inter alia,* to paragraph 40 of the Decision on Liability, where the Tribunal expressed the reasons for its decision and concluded that *\"the fact that any domestic measure challenged by Total might be legitimate in Argentina's legal system thanks to the emergency doctrine would not relieve the Tribunal from examining whether Argentina has nevertheless thereby breached the BIT.\"264*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 40.\n\n280.\n\nThe Committee has also indicated that the decision on the emergency doctrine is a reasoned decision265 and that the Tribunal adopted an interpretation of the Argentina-France BIT as to the determination of the applicable law to each issue under dispute.266\n\nSee \u00b6 212-222 *supra.*\n\nSee \u00b6 222 *supra.*\n\n281.\n\nArgentina asks this Committee to review such interpretation, and to consider that the proper method is to apply all applicable laws referred to in Article 8.4 of the Argentina-France BIT to the issue in dispute and then to explain how the potential conflict between the applicable laws can be solved.\n\n282.\n\nAgain, this is a request for second -guessing the reasoning of the Tribunal, that is not permitted under the limited grounds for annulment of the ICSID Convention.\n\n283.\n\nThis ground for annulment is thus rejected.\n\n**e. Failure to state reasons in interpreting Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nAs already mentioned and analyzed by the Committee,267 under paragraph 229 of the Decision on Liability the Tribunal discussed the reasons for considering that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT is not applicable to an economic emergency unless it has led to a national emergency where losses have occurred such as those that are a result of war, uprising or any other kind of civil disturbance. The Tribunal advanced its interpretation of the aforesaid article to conclude that a national economic emergency was not covered by the article in question and explained the reasons therefore. The Arbitral Tribunal expressed the reasoning for its interpretation of the article. There is no failure to apply the applicable law, much less a lack of reasoning.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6223-228 *supra.*\n\n285.\n\nArgentina is asking this Committee to second-guess the interpretation of Article 5(3) of the BIT. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**f. Failure to state reasons in interpreting the customary international law defense of necessity**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Committee refers to the analysis made under *d. Failure to Apply the Necessity Defense under Customary International law* (\u00b6229 *et seq. supra)* as regards paragraphs 220-224 of the Decision on Liability and the footnotes thereto. The Arbitral Tribunal reasoned its decision and concluded that Argentina did not prove the standards that it had claimed.\n\n287.\n\nArgentina disagrees with the interpretation and the conclusion but has not been able to prove to this Committee that there was no reasoning on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal or that the reasons invoked by the Arbitral Tribunal are contradictory and cancel each other so as to amount to no reasoning at all.\n\n288.\n\nThis ground for annulment is thus rejected.\n\n**g. Failure to state reasons in its assessment of damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nArgentina considers that there are three different contradictions in the decisions of the Arbitral Tribunal related to the assessment of damages, which contradictions result in a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.268 Such contradictions pertain to an outcome-determinative point of the decision, which is the payment of compensation by the Argentine Republic.269\n\nMem., \u00b689.\n\nMem., \u00b696.\n\n290.\n\nSuch contradictions, according to Argentina, refer to:\n\n1) The adjustments made on price variation in the first semester of 2002.\n\n2) The calculation of the evolution of the local prices of TGN's tariffs.\n\n3) The tariff adjustments and the debt incurred by TGN.\n\n291.\n\nThe Committee will refer to each alleged contradiction separately.\n\n1. **The adjustments made on price variation in the first semester of 2002.**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Committee finds no contradiction.\n\n293.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability the Arbitral Tribunal found that the measures predating July 1, 2002 \"might be understandable\" but that the ones taken thereafter were unfair and inequitable.270 In the Award, the Arbitral Tribunal, making express reference to the pertinent paragraphs of the Decision on Liability, rejects the position of Argentina to the effect that the calculation of readjustment of the domestic tariffs should not take into account the price variations of the first semester of 2002.271\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6171-175.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.\n\n294.\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Tribunal, the tariffs should be readjusted every six months based on the evolution of local prices of the previous six months272 and therefore, the price variations of the first semester of 2002 should be considered.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 183; Award, \u00b6 62.\n\n295.\n\nIn sum, for purposes of the calculation of the readjustment, and considering that such calculation should consider the index of local prices of the previous month, because that was the way in which tariffs were calculated in Argentina, the Arbitral Tribunal applied a price index corresponding to the first semester of 2002.\n\n296.\n\nArgentina fails to explain how applying a price variation index corresponding to the first semester of 2002, changes or contradicts the conclusion that the measures taken before July 1, 2002 were not wrongful. Argentina fails to show there is a lack of reasoning. The Committee finds that the Arbitral Tribunal reasoned its decision on a logical manner. This ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**2. The calculation of the evolution of the local prices of TGN\u2019s tariffs.**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe reasoning presented by Argentina as regards this alleged contradiction is unconvincing.\n\n298.\n\nFirst, if the alleged contradiction is that a finding that no extraordinary review was required is inconsistent with an assumption that tariffs would have adjusted naturally according to indexation under the *but-for* scenario, the Committee sees no contradiction as both conclusions are perfectly compatible. Second, if the alleged contradiction is that the Arbitral Tribunal applied a cost basis for the projection of the tariffs with which Argentina does not agree, this would be a review of the decision on the merits that this Committee is not allowed to undertake.\n\n299.\n\nThis ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**3. The tariff adjustments and the debt incurred by TGN.**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nArgentina finds a contradiction between the conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal in the Award that Total would have been able to service its debt if tariffs had been adjusted where, at the same time, it had found that Total had been unable to repay its debt as a consequence of the devaluation\u2014a circumstance for which Argentina was not held liable\u2014and that the effects of the pesification were not to be included in the calculation of damages.273\n\nMem., \u00b6 94.\n\n301.\n\nThe Committee considers that there is no such contradiction and that even assuming that the alleged contradiction exists, Argentina has failed to prove that the same would be outcome determinative. The Arbitral Tribunal found pesification itself to be in compliance with the Argentina-France BIT and therefore that pesification should be incorporated into both the actual and **but-for** scenarios. However, this would not mean that tariffs could not rise in the *but-for* scenario. The Tribunal found that the fair and equitable treatment standard required a reasonable indexation of tariffs after pesification and such increase in tariffs in the **but-for** scenario seem to have led the Tribunal to conclude that TGN would have remained solvent had there not been a wrongful conduct of Argentina.\n\n302.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Claimant in that, based on the above, the Award was consistent, incorporating pesification into both scenarios, and assuming reasonable tariff increases in the counterfactual, in contrast to the frozen tariffs of the actual scenario.\n\n303.\n\nIn its submissions to this Committee Total convincingly explained that even if there were a contradiction, as alleged by Argentina, had TGN been unable to pay its debt, it would have restructured, resulting in more value for equity-holders like TGN and a greater damages figure. This would mean that the alleged contradiction would not be outcome determinative.\n\n304.\n\nThis ground for annulment is thus rejected.\n\nF. **Serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nAs already mentioned in this Annulment Decision,274 Argentina considers that there is a contradiction between the Decision on Jurisdiction, where the Arbitral Tribunal considered that it had no jurisdiction to evaluate the renegotiation process under Argentina's regulations nor to enter into the merit of this process, and the Decision on Liability, where the Arbitral Tribunal held Argentina liable for violating the fair and equitable treatment standard due to the inconclusive results of the renegotiation process.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 262 and 277 *supra.*\n\n306.\n\nArgentina claims that as a result of the aforesaid contradiction, it was prevented from exercising its right of defense and to be heard in regards to the renegotiation and therefore, that there was a serious departure from a rule of procedure in that Argentina was not allowed to properly prepare its defense.\n\n307.\n\nOnly when Argentina received the Decision on Liability did it find that the Arbitral Tribunal, which had excluded the renegotiation process in the Decision on Jurisdiction, had considered such process in finding liability.\n\n**a. The standard**\n-------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree that Article 52(1)(d) provides the possibility for annulment where there is a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and that the procedural irregularity must have been serious, meaning that it caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had that rule been observed.275\n\nC-Mem, \u00b695.\n\n309.\n\nThey also agree that the rule that has been violated must be fundamental and relate to an element of due process, such as suitable opportunity for rebuttal, the right of defense, equality between the parties, deliberation among the members of the tribunal, the independence and impartiality of the members of the tribunal, and the proper handling of evidence and allocation of the burden of proof.276\n\nMem., \u00b628.\n\n310.\n\nThe *Daimler v. Argentina ad hoc* committee, invoked by both parties in this case, held that according to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention a departure from a procedural rule justifies annulment of the award provided that (i) the given departure is serious; and (ii) the rule in question is fundamental.277 A departure is serious if it deprives a party of the protection afforded by the said rule.\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina,* \u00b6 262.\n\n311.\n\nAs stated in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention it may be concluded that *\"(...) the ground of a 'serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure' has a wide connotation including principles of natural justice, but that it excludes the Tribunal\u2018s failure to observe ordinary arbitration rules. The phrase 'fundamental rules of procedure' was explained by the drafters as a reference to principles\"278*\n\nICSID Background Paper on Annulment, **\u00b6** 99.\n\n312.\n\nThe Parties do not seem to dispute the determinations of other committees as regard the word \"serious\", meaning that not any departure from a rule of procedure can lead to the annulment of an award; it must be \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"279\n\n*Impregilo* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6 163.\n\n313.\n\nIn the words of the *ad hoc* committee in *CDC v. Seychelles:*\n\n\"A departure is serious where it is \u2018substantial and [is] such as to deprive the party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\u2019 In other words, \u2018the violation of such rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.\u2019 As for what rules of procedure are fundamental, the drafters of the Convention refrained from attempting to enumerate them, but the consensus seems to be that only rules of natural justice - rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding - are fundamental.\"280\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* \u00b649.\n\n314.\n\nWith respect to the rules of procedure that are to be considered fundamental, the Committee considers that they are the rules of natural justice i.e., rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding.281 Both parties agree that the fundamental rules of procedure include: (i) the equal treatment of the parties; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) an independent and impartial Tribunal; (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof; and (v) deliberations among members of the Tribunal.\n\n*Daimler* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6265.\n\n**b. Serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure in connection with the renegotiation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Committee has already found that there is no contradiction between the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability as regards the renegotiation and that the claim by Argentina that the alleged contradiction is a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) is unfounded.282\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6276-277 *supra.*\n\n316.\n\nIn the Decision on Liability the Arbitral Tribunal did not, as Argentina contends, analyze the renegotiation process under Argentine law or the merits of such process. It referred to such renegotiation as a factual matter, as part of the conduct of Argentina that led the Arbitral Tribunal to conclude that there was a violation of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n317.\n\nFor Argentina to succeed in the claim for annulment under Article 52(1)(d), it should have demonstrated that the Arbitral Tribunal in its Decision on Liability decided on issues that it had excluded from jurisdiction, *i.e.,* on the legal merits of such renegotiation. But Argentina failed in such demonstration. In the Decision on Liability the Tribunal analyzed the renegotiation process as a fact, as part of the conduct of Argentina; to determine whether the conduct of Argentina in connection with the freezing of tariffs and the conduct of Argentina in connection with the renegotiating process constituted a violation of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n318.\n\nIn sum, in the Decision on Liability the Tribunal did not assess the merits or legality of the renegotiation itself, which matters it excluded in the Decision on Jurisdiction, and therefore there was no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n319.\n\nThis ground for annulment is therefore rejected.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Committee must now turn to the question of the costs of these annulment proceedings, pursuant to Articles 52(4) and 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n321.\n\nTotal considers that Argentina should bear all of the costs and expenses of these annulment proceedings, for its application is unmeritorious and it responds to Argentina's practice of seeking annulment of every unfavorable award rendered against it, repeating most arguments that other committees have previously rejected.283\n\nRej.,\u00b6\u00b6 50-52.\n\n322.\n\nArgentina holds that even if the Committee rejects its application, it would not be appropriate to make an order on costs since it has exercised its rights under the ICSID Convention and in doing so, it has not acted in bad faith nor lodged a frivolous claim.284 On November 10, 2015 the Parties submitted their Statements for Costs in these annulment proceedings.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b695-102.\n\n323.\n\nPrior *ad hoc* committees have followed a practice to order parties to bear legal costs equally, even when the application for annulment has not succeeded.285 This Committee has carefully considered whether such practice should be followed and whether or not the result of such practice may be anomalous. In particular, the Committee reviewed whether Claimant should bear costs at all, given that every ground for annulment presented by Argentina has been rejected.\n\n*Daimler* v. *Argentina,* \u00b6\u00b6305-306; *SGS* v. *Paraguay,* \u00b6153.\n\n324.\n\nFinally, the Committee decided that Argentina should bear the costs of the annulment proceedings (which it has already paid) and with respect to legal costs, this Committee decided to follow the aforesaid practice and order that each Party should bear its own legal costs.\n\n**VI. DECISION OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the *ad hoc* Committee unanimously decides:\n\n**i.** To dismiss in its entirety the Application for Annulment of the Award submitted by the Argentine Republic.\n\n**ii.** That each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\niii. That the Respondent, the Argentine Republic, shall bear the costs of the proceeding, comprising the fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and the costs of using the ICSID facilities."}]}
