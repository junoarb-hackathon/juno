Alexandrov Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP 1501 K Street N.W. Washington, D.C. 20005\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn December 24, 2002, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received a request for arbitration from Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A. against the Republic of Peru. The dispute concerned a pasta factory in the Municipality of Lima and was brought to ICSID under the ICSID Convention. Claimants invoked the dispute settlement provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile (the BIT).\n\n4.\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General registered the request on March 23, 2003 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, and notified the parties, pursuant to Institution Rule 7, that the request had been registered inviting them to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n5.\n\nAccording to the agreement of the parties, the Tribunal would be composed by three members, one appointed by each party and the third arbitrator, who would be designated as President of the Tribunal, by agreement of the parties. If the parties failed to agree on the presiding arbitrator, the Secretary-General would appoint the President of the Tribunal. Accordingly, Claimants appointed Mr. Jan Paulsson, a national of France, as an arbitrator. Respondent appointed Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of Spain, as an arbitrator. The parties having failed to agree on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, the Acting Secretary-General, after consulting with the parties, appointed Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a national of the United States of America, to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn August 1, 2003, pursuant to Article 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that all the arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceeding to have begun, on that date. By that same letter, the parties were informed that Ms. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn August 7, 2003, Respondent filed a request for suspension of the proceedings, in view of the fact that \"Claimants' Request for Arbitration [was] (...) the subject of a concurrent State-to-State dispute between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile.\" Pursuant to the Tribunal's instructions, the parties filed on September 11, 2003 their briefs on Respondent's request for suspension. The Tribunal also invited the parties to present oral arguments on this issue during the first session.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held on September 15, 2003 at the Hague, the Netherlands. At this session, the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been duly constituted, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, indicating that they had no objection in this regard. An exchange of views took place regarding the place of arbitration and the objections to jurisdiction raised by Respondent during the course of the session. It was decided that the place of arbitration would be the seat of Centre in Washington, D.C. and that the proceedings on the merits would be suspended pursuant to Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules. After consultation with the parties, the Tribunal set up a schedule for the filing of pleadings on jurisdiction.\n\n9.\n\nDuring the course of the first session, the Tribunal also heard oral arguments on Respondent's request for suspension of August 7, 2003. By a decision communicated through the Secretariat on September 16, 2003, the Tribunal found that the conditions for a suspension of the proceedings were not met and confirmed the schedule for the submission of pleadings on the objections to jurisdiction.\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to the schedule for the filing of pleadings, Respondent filed its memorial on jurisdiction on December 15, 2003 and Claimants submitted their countermemorial on jurisdiction on March 15, 2004. The reply and the rejoinder on jurisdiction were filed on May 17, 2004 and July 16, 2004, respectively.\n\n11.\n\nOn August 24, 2004, the Tribunal issued directions regarding the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction. Pursuant to those directions, the parties filed documents to be used during the hearing on jurisdiction on August 26, 2004. The Tribunal convened at the premises of the World Bank in Washington D.C. on September 2 and 3, 2004 to hear the parties' oral arguments on jurisdiction. The parties were represented as follows:\n\nAttending on behalf of Claimants:\n\nEdmundo Eluchans Urenda, Edmundo Eluchans y Cia.  \n Gonzalo Molina Arizt\u00eda, Edmundo Eluchans y Cia.  \n Robert Volterra, Herbert Smith  \n Alejandro Escobar, Herbert Smith\n\nAttending on behalf of Respondent:\n\nRoberto Rodriguez, Counselor, Embassy of Peru  \n Alejandro Riveros, Counselor, Embassy of Peru  \n Alvaro Rey de Castro, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru  \n C\u00e9sar Julio Pantoja Carrera, Office of the State Attorney General of Peru  \n Stephen M. Schwebel  \n Daniel M. Price, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP   \nStanimir A. Alexandrov, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP   \nNicol\u00e1s Lloreda, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP  \n Lisa A. Crosby, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP   \nCarlos Carpio, Law Offices of Rodrigo, Elias & Medrano\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal heard, on behalf of Respondent, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, Mr. Daniel M. Price, Mr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov and Mr. Alejandro Riveros, and on behalf of Claimant, Mr. Robert Volterra, Mr. Alejandro Escobar and Mr. Edmundo Eluchans Urenda. During the course of the hearing, the parties answered questions from the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nTranscripts in English and Spanish of the hearing on jurisdiction were prepared and distributed to the parties and the members of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn November 2, 2004, following receipt of a communication from the Claimants, dated October 27, 2004, to which they attached a decision by Dr. Pablo S\u00e1nchez Velarde, Supervisory Prosecutor for Anti-Corruption, dated August 31, 2004, the Tribunal invited the parties to comment thereon by November 16, 2004. Their respective comments, with additional exhibits, were received by the Tribunal on the aforementioned date.\n\n**III. THE REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration states that the First Claimant is a company constituted in accordance with the laws of Chile. It is the owner of more than 98% of the shares of the Second Claimant. By virtue of this Chilean ownership, and in accordance with the terms of Article 8.3 of the Peru-Chile BIT, the Second Claimant is also to be treated as a Chilean investor for the purposes of the dispute resolution provisions of the Peru-Chile BIT.\n\n16.\n\nThe Second Claimant is the owner of a property situated at la Avenida Prolongaci\u00f3n de los Defensores del Morro n\u00b0 1277, in the district of Chorrillos in the City of Lima, where it has constructed an industrial plant for the manufacture and sale of pasta.\n\n17.\n\nThe First Claimant is a market leader in Chile in the production of pasta and related products. It decided to expand its activities to other countries and in 1995 concentrated on Peru and quickly achieved a pre-eminent position in the market in this country. The production and operation of the Second Claimant's plant in Lima was intended to supply both the local and export markets. The total amount of the investment in Peru was more than $150 million.\n\n18.\n\nClaimants submit that they obtained all of the necessary authorizations and administrative and municipal permits in accordance with the laws, regulations and practice usual in Peru for the construction of the industrial plant. Nevertheless, at the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998 the Municipalidad Metropolitana de Lima (Municipality of Lima) annulled the permits granted to the Second Claimant for the construction of its industrial plant, referring to environmental problems and supposed deficiencies relating to the granting of the permits. The annulment of the permits and the grounds on which they were based were, without exception, the object of judicial proceedings in Peru. The judicial proceedings concluded in favor of the Second Claimant. Claimants state that these judicial proceedings have been resolved definitively and irrevocably according to Peruvian law, and are now *res judicata.* No public or private entity has ever sought to challenge these judicial decisions.\n\n19.\n\nThe Second Claimant's plant is constructed close to, but not within, a protected wetland called los Pantanos de Villa. At the appropriate time the Second Claimant had submitted two environmental impact studies. The second of these studies was duly approved by INRENA (Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales, the competent Peruvian state entity in environmental matters, within the Ministry of Agriculture), through a Resoluci\u00f3n Directorial that directed the Second Claimant to comply with various environmental requirements. Claimants state that since the date of the approval of its environmental impact study, the plant has been monitored periodically by INRENA and has always been found to conform to the environmental standards required by Peruvian law and regulations. Claimants contend that the plant does not use water from the marsh or wetlands, nor from subterranean wells in the area, having its own system of piped supply and disposal of water. Similarly, the noise and light levels of the plant have been measured and shown to be clearly below the requirements of the regulations and directives. In its totality the plant enjoys ISO 14,001 international certification, which has been obtained by few factories in Peru.\n\n20.\n\nAfter that the Municipality de Chorrillos granted the Second Claimant its operating license in December 1999, the Second Claimant developed its business without legal interference until the revocation of its license in August 2001. The Council of Municipality of Lima promulgated Acuerdos de Consejo 258 and 259 (hereafter Decree 258 and Decree 259 respectively) on August 16, 2001 (officially published on August 22, 2001). Decree 258, (entitled *Ordering that the Council of the Municipality of Lima request the Congress of the Republic to declare the preservation, maintenance and protection of the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa a matter of public necessity*), contained a provision (Article 3) charging the Mayor of Lima to present to the Peruvian legislature proposals for the legislative expropriation by reason of public necessity of all areas necessary for the permanent preservation, maintenance, and protection of the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa. After a lengthy preamble, the operative part of Decree 258 reads as follows:\n\n\"*IT IS HEREBY DECREED:*\n\n*Article 1.- The Council of the Municipality of Lima, representing the Municipality of Lima, shall, after studying any technical reports that it considers relevant, adopt all decisions, administrative actions, resolutions and, in general, measures necessary to ensure a comprehensive and final solution for the preservation, maintenance and permanent protection of the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa.*\n\n*Article 2.- The Council of the Municipality of Lima, representing the Municipality of Lima, shall request the Congress of the Republic to declare that the preservation, maintenance and permanent protection of the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa are a matter of public necessity.*\n\n*Article 3.- The Council of the Municipality of Lima, representing the Municipality of Lima, shall, after studying any technical reports prepared following public bidding, with the participation of the Universities and Professional Associations, propose to the Congress of the Republic legislation for expropriation on grounds of public necessity concerning the relevant areas constituting the Reserve and the adjacent areas surrounding it, as necessary to ensure a comprehensive and final solution for the presevation, maintenance and permanent protection of the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa.*\n\n*For registration, information, publication and enforcement.*\n\n*ALBERTO ANDRADE CARMONA*\n\n*Mayor of Lima\"*\n\n21.\n\nDecree 259, (entitled Revocation of *Lucchetti Per\u00fa S.A's Municipal operating license and order for the permanent closure of its establishment*) specifically revoked the operating license of the Second Claimant. After a lengthy preamble, the operative part of Decree 259 reads as follows:\n\n\"*IT IS HEREBY DECREED:*\n\n*Article 1.- The municipal operating license granted by Municipal Resolution No. 6856-98-MDCH to Lucchetti Per\u00fa S.A. for its industrial plant situated at an unnumbered location on Avenida Prolongaci\u00f3n Defensores del Morro, 20.5 km. along the Panamericana Sur highway, Chorrillos, for the manufacture and sale of pasta is hereby revoked.*\n\n*Article 2.- The industrial establishment referred to in the preceding article shall be closed and entirely removed; this shall be done within a maximum of twelve months from the day following the publication of this Decree.*\n\n*Article 3.- The Council of the Municipality of Lima shall establish an Ad Hoc Technical Commission to study and recommend measures for the effective implementation of the provisions of the preceding article, with a membership including representatives of civil society and of institutions devoted to the preservation and protection of the environment and biological diversity.*\n\n*Article 4.- The relevant civil and criminal proceedings shall be instituted to protect the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa, the Municipality of Lima, its authorities and the neighbors of the capital of the Republic.*\n\n*For registration, information, publication and enforcement.*\n\n*ALBERTO ANDRADE CARMONA Mayor of Lima\"*\n\n22.\n\nClaimants state that the liability of the State of Peru in this situation is twofold. First, the acts of the Municipality of Lima are imputable to the State in accordance with ICSID jurisprudence and international law. Second, the State has a direct responsibility in that a substantial period of time has passed since the promulgation of these Decrees and the State has not complied with its obligation under the Peru-Chile BIT to correct the situation and protect the investment. Claimants contend that Decree 258 is unconstitutional and illegal under Peruvian domestic law and international law for various reasons. In addition, Decree 259 contains a clear threat to the rights of the investor.\n\n23.\n\nClaimants allege further that Respondent is in breach of its obligations under three distinct Articles of the Peru-Chile BIT: Article 3.2 (protection in accordance with the law, and from unjust or discriminatory measures); Article 4.1 (guarantees of just and equitable, national and most-favored-nation treatment); and Article 6.1 (protection from illegal, discriminatory or uncompensated expropriation). These Articles of the Peru-Chile BIT read as follows:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 3*\n\n***Promotion and Protection of Investments***\n\n*1....*\n\n*2. Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory the investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not adversely affect the* *administration, maintenance, use, usufruct, expansion, sale or liquidation of such investments by unjustified or discriminatory measures.*\n\n*ARTICLE 4*\n\n***Treatment of Investments***\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee fair and equitable* *treatment within its territory for investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Such treatment shall be no less favorable than that* *granted by each Contracting Party to the investments of its own investors made within its territory, or that granted by each Contracting Party to* *investments of investors of the most-favored nation made within its territory, if the latter treatment is more favorable.*\n\n*ARTICLE 6*\n\n***Expropriation and Compensation***\n\n*1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall adopt any measure* *directly or indirectly depriving an investor of the other Contracting Party of an investment, unless the following conditions are met:*\n\n*a) The measures are adopted in pursuance of the law and in accordance with the relevant constitutional rules;*\n\n*b) The measures are not discriminatory;*\n\n*c) The measures are accompanied by arrangements for the payment of immediate, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation* *shall be based on the market value of the investments made on a date* *immediately prior to the date on which the measure is publicly announced. In the event of any delay in the payment of compensation,* *interest shall accrue, at a commercial rate established on the basis of the real market value, from the date of expropriation or loss until the* *date of payment. The legality of any such expropriations, nationalizations or similar measures and the amount of compensation shall be subject to revision in accordance with due legal process.\"*\n\n24.\n\nClaimants state that Decrees 258 and 259 and subsequent acts have caused enormous losses and damages to their investment and violated their rights. In these circumstances Claimants seek the following relief from this Tribunal:\n\n*\" 1. The Peruvian State should be declared to have violated the obligations assumed under the APPI and the applicable principles of international law and therefore to be liable to the Claimants.*\n\n*2. The Claimants should be granted compensation for the consequential damage and loss of earnings associated with the investment made, all amounts to be indicated in the request for arbitration.*\n\n*3. The Claimants should be reimbursed for the costs incurred in this arbitration, including professional fees.*\n\n*4. The Claimants should be paid the appropriate interest applicable prior to and subsequent to the award, the rate and method of calculation to be indicated in the request for arbitration.*\n\n*5. The Claimants should be granted other forms of compensation and reparation to be specified.\"*\n\n**IV. RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nRespondent raises the following three objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:\n\n1. Lack of Jurisdiction *Ratione Temporis* *.*\n\n(i) The provisions of the BIT do not apply to disputes and controversies that arose before the BIT entered into force;\n\n(ii) the BIT entered into force on August 3, 2001;\n\n(iii) the dispute between the Claimant and the Peruvian authorities began in 1997-1998;\n\n(iv) therefore, because the dispute arose before the BIT entered into force, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.\n\nThis submission is based on Article 2 of the BIT (\u00c1mbito de Aplicaci\u00f3n), which provides as follows:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 2*\n\n***Scope***\n\n*This Treaty shall apply to investments made before or after its entry into* *force by investors of one Contracting Party, in accordance with the legal provisions of the other Contracting Party and in the latter's territory. It* *shall not, however, apply to differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force.\"*\n\nThere is no dispute that the BIT entered into force on August 3, 2001. Claimants submit that the dispute began after the BIT came into force, and that, therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\nAccording to Claimants, this dispute relates to the two 2001 Decrees of the Municipality of Lima described in Paragraph 20 above. The dispute was first raised by Claimants in a letter addressed to the President of the Republic of Peru dated October 3, 2001.\n\n2. Lack of Jurisdiction due to Prior Submission to Local Courts.\n\n(i) Under Article 8 of the BIT, an investor's choice to submit a dispute to local courts is final and binding;\n\n(ii) Claimants have previously submitted this dispute to the courts of Peru;\n\n(iii) therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear this dispute.\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 8*\n\n***Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor***\n\n*1. The Parties involved shall hold consultations with a view to obtaining* *an amicable solution to disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n*2. If such consultations do not produce a solution within six months* *following the date of the request for settlement, the investor may refer the dispute to:*\n\n*-the competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, or*\n\n*-international arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the* *Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, signed in Washington on 18 March 1965.*\n\n*Once the investor has referred the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made or* *to the arbitral tribunal, the choice of one or other procedure shall be final.*\n\n*3. For the purposes of this Article, any juridical person constituted in accordance with the legislation of one of the Parties, in which investors of the other Contracting Party were majority share-holders prior to the occurrence of the dispute, shall be treated, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the above-mentioned Washington Convention, as a juridical person of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n*4. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on both Parties.\"*\n\nClaimants deny that there has been any prior submission of this dispute to the Peruvian courts.\n\n3. Lack of Jurisdiction *Ratione Materiae.*\n\n(i) The BIT only applies to \u2018investments' made in accordance with the legal provisions by the other Contracting Party;\n\n(ii) the definition of \u2018investments' in Article 1 of the BIT confines its meaning to investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, namely, Peru;\n\n(iii) Claimants have violated numerous laws and regulations of Peru governing the construction and operation of their plant;\n\n(iv) therefore, the plant is not a protected \u2018investment' within the meaning of Article 1 of the BIT and is outside the BIT's scope pursuant to Article 2.\n\nArticle 1.2 of the BIT defines an investment in the following terms:\n\n*\"2. The term \"investment\" refers to any kind of asset, provided that the investment was made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made and shall* *include particularly but not exclusively:*\n\n*a) Movable and immovable property and any other rights in rem such as easements, mortgages, usufructs and pledges;*\n\n*b) Shares and any other form of participation in companies;*\n\n*c) Loans, securities, rights to money and any other benefit of economic* *value;*\n\n*d) Intellectual and industrial property rights, including copyright, patents, trademarks, technological processes and know-how, goodwill and other similar rights;*\n\n*e) Commercial concessions granted by law or by contract, including concessions for the exploration, cultivation, extraction or exploitation of natural resources.\"*\n\nArticle 2 defines the scope of application of the BIT in the following terms:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 2*\n\n***Scope***\n\n*This Treaty shall apply to investments made before or after its entry into* *force by investors of one Contracting Party, in accordance with the legal provisions of the other Contracting Party and in the latter's territory. It* *shall not, however, apply to differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force.\"*\n\nClaimants submit that its investment in Peru has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Peru.\n\n26.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that anyone of the three objections to jurisdiction is well founded, it will have to dismiss this case.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION** ***R*** ***ATIONE***  ***T*** ***EMPORIS***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nRespondent submits that the Request for Arbitration relates to a continuing dispute that arose in 1997 and is therefore outside the scope of the Peru-Chile BIT. According to Claimants the dispute arose as a result of the promulgation of Decrees 258 and 259 after the BIT entered into force.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants commenced the construction of their plant without obtaining the necessary urban habilitation and environmental approvals and that their approach throughout the construction process was to build their plant quickly, without regard for Peruvian laws and regulations, in the expectation that they could then present a *fait accompli* to the municipal authorities who would feel pressured to approve the project and grant the necessary permits after the fact. Claimants submit that they complied with the laws and regulations of Peru, cooperated with the authorities, and in some cases, such as with regard to the conditions imposed by INRENA, exceeded the necessary standards and adopted additional measures. Claimants point to the opposition to the construction of their plant, beginning around August 1997, by the Mayor of Lima, Alberto Andrade Carmona. That opposition was motivated by political considerations and was a factor in the subsequent administrative interference with the construction of the plant.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to examine the possible motives for the administrative measures in relation to the plant between August 1997 and January 1998. It is sufficient to note that there were a series of administrative measures that negatively affected the progress of construction. These included the following:\n\n(i) August 18, 1997 : The Municipality of Chorrillos issued a stop work notice (*notificaci\u00f3n de paralizaci\u00f3n de obra*) to Claimants;\n\n(ii) September 25, 1997 : The Council of the Municipality of Lima issued Acuerdo de Consejo 111 (*Decree 111*) which ordered work on the construction of the plant to cease immediately. The decree also created a special Commission (*Comisi\u00f3n Ruiz de Somocurcio*) to review the authorizations for Claimants' plant and to make proposals to improve the urban and environmental control of Pantanos de Villa. The operative part of Decree 111 read as follows:\n\n*\"IT IS HEREBY DECREED:*\n\n*1. - It is declared advisable and necessary to order the immediate cessation of work on the construction of the Planta Lucchetti Per\u00fa,* *S.A. as soon as possible and subject to accountability.*\n\n*2. - A Special Commission shall be established consisting of:*\n\n*Jorge Ruiz de Somocurcio, presiding* *Santiago Agurto Calvo*  \n*Ricardo Giesecke Sara Lafosse*  \n*Luzmila Zapata Garc\u00eda*  \n*Lu\u00eds Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00ednez*  \n*Olimpia M\u00e9ndez Le\u00f3n*  \n*Martha Moyano Delgado*\n\n*with responsibility for reviewing the administrative formalities observed by LUCCHETTI S.A., and recommending to the Council of the Municipality the appropriate approach and corrective measures, including preventive measures and stronger urban and environmental control of the natural area and the area of influence of Pantanos de Villa.*\n\n*3. - The opinion of the Commission for Services to the City and the Environment and the Legal Affairs Commission will be sought, and a legal report will be prepared detailing the additional and specific actions to be taken in this regard.*\n\n*For registration, information and enforcement.*\n\n*ALBERTO ANDRADE CARMONA*\n\n*Mayor of Lima\"*\n\nThe Comisi\u00f3n Ruiz de Somocurcio issued its report on October 17, 1997. It made the following findings relating to Claimants' plant:\n\n*\"Conclusions and Recommendations* *:*\n\n*1. The procedures for urban authorization and granting of a construction license for the industrial plant Lucchetti Per\u00fa S.A. located in the area adjacent to Pantanos de Villa, Chorrillos district, infringed and violated specific provisions of the National Construction Regulations, the Environmental Code, rules and agreements on environmental protection and the Regulations on Construction Licenses.*\n\n*2..The proposed industrial plant Lucchetti Per\u00fa S.A. poses an imminent* *environmental threat to the Natural Protected Area of Pantanos de Villa, Chorrillos district. Since it has been determined that in the present case* *there has been infringement of the rules of public policy in the matter, the Council of the Municipality of Lima must order the cessation of construction, in view of the fact that the Chorrillos District Municipality has not issued a stop work order, and the competent organs, subject to accountability, must* *proceed to cancel the relevant provisional construction license and impose the most severe penalties applicable, restoring the principle of authority.\"*\n\n(iii) October 21, 1997 : The Council of the Municipality of Lima promulgated Acuerdo de Consejo 126 (*Decree 126*), which established the special Regulatory Zone of Pantanos de Villa. Decree 126 included the following provisions:\n\n*\"IT IS HEREBY DECREED:*\n\n*Article 1.- The \"Special Regulatory Zone of Pantanos de Villa\" shall be established.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Article 4.- All procedures of urban authorization, construction licenses,* *licenses to operate establishments and other administrative actions of a municipal nature, whatever the stage reached, concerning applications to* *develop inside the \"Special Regulatory Zone of Pantanos de Villa\" described in Articles 1 and 2 of this Decree shall be suspended. This* *suspension shall cover the actions of the District Municipalities with* *jurisdiction over the buffer zone of the Metropolitan Ecological Area Pantanos de Villa.\"*\n\n(iv) January 2, 1998 : The Provincial Technical Commission of the Municipality of Lima issued Acuerdo 01 (Decree 01) (*Administrative acts authorizing*\n\n*construction of industrial plant on land located in the district of Chorrillos are declared null and void*). After a lengthy preamble, the operative part of Decree 01 read as follows:\n\n*\"IT IS HEREBY DECREED:*\n\n*1.- The final construction license allegedly granted as a result of* *administrative inaction, as well as any other express or presumed* *administrative action authorizing construction work on the industrial plant to be built by LUCCHETTI PERU S.A. on the land covering an area of 59,943.00 m2 between the avenida Los H\u00e9roes de Villa and the former Panamericana Sur highway (avenida Huaylas), lots 1A and 2 at Villa Baja,* *Chorrillos district, province and department of Lima, are declared null and void.*\n\n*2.- The location of the project mentioned in the preceding paragraph is* *declared unsuitable, because it does not meet the operational standards for Light Industry (I-2) corresponding instead to a High Industry Zone (I-3), in* *accordance with the parameters established in the General Zoning Regulations of Metropolitan Lima and the National Construction Regulations.*\n\n*3. - The approval given by the District Technical Commission of the District Municipality of Chorrillos for the Architect's Project submitted by LUCCHETTI PERU S.A. referred to in the preceding paragraphs, as well as other subsequent actions relying on that irregular approval, are declared null and void.*\n\n*4. - This decree shall at once be transmitted to the District Municipality of Chorrillos for immediate implementation and other relevant purposes, subject to accountability, and the Municipal Directorate of Urban Development of the Council of Metropolitan Lima shall be informed of the action taken.*\n\n*5. - This decree shall at once be transmitted to LUCCHETTI PERU S.A. and to the General Inspectorate of the Council of Metropolitan Lima.*\n\n*Lima, 2 January 1998\"*\n\n30.\n\nClaimants' response to this decree and the revocation of its construction license was to seek judicial assistance to enable the construction and operation of the plant to proceed.\n\n31.\n\nClaimants began legal proceedings in January 1998 with an action of Amparo Constitucional against the Provincial Council of the Municipality of Lima, the Mayor of the Municipality of Lima (Alberto Andrade Carmona), and the District Council of the Municipal District of Chorrillos. The relief sought in the Amparo Constitucional action included the following: the immediate suspension of the effects of Decree 01; an order that the Mayor abstain from making threats, carrying out or executing, whether by himself or his subordinates, any act or fact of demolition, or any act that implied the transfer or loss by Claimants of their legitimate property rights in their plant; the nonapplication to Claimants of Article 4 of Decree 126 of October 21, 1997; and the suspension and non-application of the stop work notice issued by the Municipal District of Chorrillos in accordance with Decree 111 of the Council of the Municipality of Lima. As part of their Amparo Constitucional action, Claimants applied for immediate orders by way of precautionary measures.\n\n32.\n\nThe Amparo Constitucional action resulted in four separate judgments, all in favor of Claimants:\n\n(i) January 19, 1998 : The First Transitory Corporate Court Specialized in Public Law (*Primer Juzgado Corporativo Transitorio Especializado en Derecho P\u00fablico*) declared well-founded Claimants' application for precautionary measures and granted Claimants the relief sought in the Amparo Constitucional action, including the suspension of Decree 01 and of Article 4 of Decree 126, as well as the stop work notice relating to the construction of Claimants' plant.\n\n(ii) February 6, 1998 : Claimants obtained a Judgment in the Amparo Constitucional action from the Specialized Public Law Court of Lima, first instance (*Primer Juzgado Corporativo Transitorio Especializado en Derecho P\u00fablico*) which read as follows:\n\n*JUDGMENT:*\n\n*DISMISSING the Respondent's defense of lack of authority to act put forward by the cited MUNICIPALITY OF LIMA and the related request to include the DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY OF CHORRILLOS as coperpetrator of the above-mentioned violation of the regulations, and ALLOWING the complaint against the Provincial Council of the Municipality of Lima and against Andrade Carmona, Mayor of the Municipality of Lima.*\n\nIn addition to granting various other requests sought by Claimants, the judge ordered, on February 9, that the judgment be transmitted to the Office of the Public Prosecutor.\n\n(iii) March 4, 1998 : The Sala Corporativa Transitoria Especializada en Derecho P\u00fablico, confirmed on appeal the order made on January 19, 1998 in respect of the precautionary measures. It also ordered the enforcement of this decision on March 13, 1998.\n\n(iv) May 18, 1998 : The Sala Corporativa Transitoria Especializada en Derecho P\u00fablico confirmed, with a minor amendment, the judgment in the Amparo Constitucional action.\n\n33.\n\nOn March 16, 1998 Claimants instituted an Enforcement Action seeking a judicial order in relation to the continuation of the works at Claimants' plant under police supervision. It appears that the judgment at first instance in the Enforcement action was dated April 23, 1998. The judgment on appeal (*La Sala Corporativa Transitoria Especializada en Derecho P\u00fablico*), dated September 11, 1998, dismissed the jurisdictional and procedural objections of Respondent and also ordered the Municipality of Lima to approve the definitive plans and authorize the construction of Claimants' plant.\n\n34.\n\nOn December 9, 1998 the Public Law Court (*Primer Juzgado Corporativo Transitorio Especializado en Derecho P\u00fablico*), first instance, issued a judgment in Claimants' favor with regard to Ordinance 184 of the Council of the Municipality of Lima, dated September 4, 1998, relating to the regulation, conservation and development of Pantanos de Villa (*Ordinance 184 action*). The judgment found that provisions of Ordinance 184 would prevent the execution of the September 11, 1998 judgment in the Enforcement Action, and therefore ruled:\n\n*The effects of Ordinance 184 adopted by the Council of the Municipality of Lima, dated September 4, 1998 and published in the Official Gazette \"El Peruano\" on November 11, 1998, are INAPPLICABLE to the Claimant Lucchetti Peru Sociedad An\u00f3nima and the work may proceed.*\n\n35.\n\nOn December 23, 1998 the Municipality of Chorrillos issued a construction license to Claimants. On December 29, 1998 it also issued an operating license for the manufacture and sale on a continuous twenty-four hour basis of pasta products at Claimants' plant. The Preamble to the operating license specifically stated that Ordinance 184 did not apply to Claimants' plant by virtue of the earlier judicial order:\n\n*That, despite the foregoing and despite the fact that Complainant's industrial plant is located in the Regulatory Zone established by Ordinance 184, by virtue of the order of the First Public Law Court in the Amparo proceedings whereby, in execution of judgment, by decision of December 9, 1996, the effects of Ordinance 184 of the Council of the Municipality were declared INAPPLICABLE to the Claimant.*\n\n36.\n\nClaimants submit that the aforementioned judicial decisions in their favor are final and conclusive. The dispute with the Municipality of Lima in 1998 was therefore definitively resolved by the courts at that time. There can thus be no possible continuity between the dispute with the Municipality of Lima in 1998 and the dispute between Claimants and the Republic of Peru that arose on August 22, 2001.\n\n37.\n\nIt is Respondent's submission that the judgments referred to above are part of an ongoing dispute that \"was suppressed, not settled, by the judgments\". It contends that the Tribunal \"should consider the corrupt and egregious circumstances under which the judgments were attained\". It also submits that for this Tribunal to attribute \"any preclusive significance to those illicitly obtained judgments for purposes of permitting Claimants to gain access to the ICSID forum would constitute a gross miscarriage of justice and subvert the rule of law\" *.*\n\n**VI. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 2 of the BIT provides that the BIT applies to investments made either before or after the BIT entered into force. It further specifies, however, that it does not apply to differences or to disputes that arose prior to its entry into force. Therefore, before proceeding further, the Tribunal must decide when the present dispute arose. If it arose before the BIT entered into force, the Tribunal will lack jurisdiction to hear the dispute. It will have jurisdiction if it finds that the dispute arose after the BIT's entry into force. The parties take diametrically opposed positions on this question.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to deal with the present dispute because it had fully crystallized before the entry into force of the BIT and, while it continued beyond that date, the later events did not generate a new dispute but merely continued the earlier dispute. In its view, Article 2 of the BIT consequently bars the Tribunal from dealing with this claim.\n\n40.\n\nClaimants submit that there were two disputes and that the earlier dispute had been finally resolved in 1998 with the judgments in their favor by the Peruvian courts. According to Claimants, the dispute now before the Tribunal arose in 2001 after the BIT had entered into force. It was triggered by Decrees 258 and 259, which resulted in the cancellation of Claimants' production license and the order for the removal of their plant.\n\n41.\n\nIn support of its contention that there was only one dispute and that it arose before the BIT entered into force and continued beyond that date, Respondent submits that the subject matter of the dispute was the same in 1997/98 as in 2001 when Decrees 258 and 259 were adopted, and that the conflict between Claimants and the municipal authorities during that entire period of time amounted to an interrelated series of events which together make up a single dispute. In response to Claimants' submission that the 1998 Peruvian judgments had become *res judicata* and thus had effectively terminated the first dispute, Respondent argues that the concept of *res judicata*, which is designed to prevent the relitigation of claims, does not address the question the Tribunal has to decide. This is so, it submits, because *res judicata* does not speak to the factual question whether a dispute underlying the litigation continues between the parties. Respondent contends, moreover, that the judgments in question were obtained by corrupt conduct and therefore could not be deemed to have ended the dispute between the parties that began in 1997.\n\n42.\n\nClaimants submit that the present dispute arose after the entry into force of the BIT. In their view, this is a new dispute because it is defined by reference to the obligations of Respondent under the BIT. The dispute concerns Decrees 258 and 259. They were promulgated after the BIT entered into force and gave rise to the present dispute because they violated Claimants' rights under the BIT. Claimants further submit that measures taken after the entry into force of the BIT give rise to a new dispute even if they refer to facts or events that occurred prior thereto. According to Claimants, the specific measures at issue in the present dispute took place after the entry into force of the BIT. They thus differ in substance and content from the measures that gave rise to the earlier dispute. In this regard, Claimants assert that Decree 01 had declared Lucchetti Peru's construction license void *ab initio*, whereas Decree 259 revoked its license to operate the plant. They also submit that the grounds adduced in justification of Decree 01 differ from those advanced for Decree 259, the former allegedly involving a violation of the applicable zoning requirements for light industries, whereas the latter points to non-compliance with various environmental conditions on the basis of which the license was supposedly granted. Claimants emphasize further that between the time of the adoption of these two decrees, the construction of the factory had been completed and was manufacturing pasta for a period of two and a half years before Decree 259 was promulgated.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent counters Claimants' arguments by alleging that the conflict of legal interests which had in the 1997-98 period crystallized into a dispute \u2014 with the adoption of Decree 01 (1998) and the litigation in the Peruvian courts \u2014 did not become a new dispute simply because Claimants formulated their claim as a violation of the BIT. Respondent sees no merit in Claimants' contention that acts or legal measures that occur after the entry into force of the BIT must be deemed to give rise to a new dispute under Article 2 of the BIT. Respondent also denies Claimants' contention that the judgments entered in Claimants' favor by the Peruvian courts were capable of resolving the earlier dispute. These fraudulent judgments did not and could not end the dispute. Rather, according to Respondent, they were an episode in the ongoing dispute between the parties. In this connection, Respondent considers that it is irrelevant to the task of this Tribunal whether or not the Peruvian judgments are sound as a matter of Peruvian law. What is relevant and what the Tribunal must determine is whether the subject matter of the 1997-98 dispute is the same as that relating to Decrees 258 and 259. If it is, then the judgments cannot as a matter of law be deemed to have ended the ongoing dispute and, according to Respondent, the Tribunal must declare that it lacks jurisdiction under Article 2 of the BIT. Respondent also points to Claimants' efforts to obtain the \"regularization\" of the construction of their factory in July 2001 \u2014 by that date neither the BIT nor Decrees 258 and 259 were in effect \u2014 as evidence that Claimants themselves considered that the Peruvian judgments had not ended the earlier dispute. The regularization process was not completed until 2003.\n\n44.\n\nRespondent next addresses Claimants' submission that the subject matter dealt with in Decree 259 differs from that of Decree 01. It is Respondent's position that the issues that were litigated in 1998 did not deal only with the legality of Claimants' construction license as contended by Claimants. They involved instead a series of legal measures bearing on Claimants' failure to comply with applicable Peruvian rules and regulations. In Respondent's view, Decrees 258 and 259 are merely the latest legal measures Claimants have challenged in connection with the construction and operation of their factory. Moreover, when the content of Decree 01 (1998) together with the other measures adopted by the municipal authorities are compared with Decree 259 (2001), it becomes evident that they dealt with and were motivated by environmental concerns.\n\n45.\n\nAs for Claimants' contention that the present dispute is a new dispute because it is formulated as a claim under the BIT, Respondent submits that the issue to be determined by the Tribunal does not turn on the form in which a claim has been put forward, but on the question whether the dispute arose before or after the entry into force of the BIT. Respondent consequently does not accept Claimants' assumption that the *ratione temporis* reservation set out in Article 2 of the BIT can be circumvented by formulating the claim as a BIT claim. In its view, to accept Claimants' position would render the *ratione temporis* reservation a legal nullity. That, Respondent submits, would violate generally accepted canons of treaty interpretation.\n\n46.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's contention that Decree 259 was merely one more episode in an ongoing dispute. In their view, there would not have been a dispute between the parties had Decree 259 not been enacted. Its adoption marks the beginning of the dispute now before the Tribunal. Claimants also assert that the contention that the Peruvian court judgments merely suspended the pending dispute is untenable. In their view, Peru's obligation under the BIT to protect Claimants' investment in Peru did not arise until after the entry into force of the BIT. That obligation was violated by Decree 259, which was promulgated after the effective date of the BIT. No continuity can therefore exist between what occurred in 1998 and the publication of Decree 259.\n\n47.\n\nClaimants assert further that Article 2 of the BIT does not reverse the accepted international law rule concerning the non-retroactive effect of treaties. They claim that Article 2 does not prevent the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over a dispute concerning the violation of the BIT simply because it can be related in some form to an earlier dispute that arose before the BIT had entered into force and that was resolved before that date. Claimants also submit that an analysis of the relevant international jurisprudence supports their conclusion that the present dispute arose after the BIT's date of the entry into force. Pursuant to that jurisprudence, Claimants argue that the date when the present dispute arose must be determined by reference to its origin. Its origin, in Claimants' view, was the promulgation of Decrees 258 and 259. It follows, according to Claimants, that the adoption of Decree 01 in 1998 cannot be the origin of the present dispute because the application of that decree was resolved in the *amparo* proceedings before the Peruvian courts.\n\n**VII. FINDINGS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that as a legal concept, the term dispute has an accepted meaning. It has been authoritatively defined as a \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons,\"1 or as a \"situation in which two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance\" of a legal obligation.2 In short, a dispute can be held to exist when the parties assert clearly conflicting legal or factual claims bearing on their respective rights or obligations or that \"the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other.\"3\n\nMavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. United Kingdom), Judgment of 30 August 1924 (Merits), 1924 P.C.I.J. (ser. A), No. 2, p. 11.\n\nInterpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, Advisory Opinion of March 1950, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 65 at 74\n\nSouth West Africa, Preliminary Objections. Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 319, at 328.\n\n49.\n\nIt is clear, and that does not appear to be in dispute between the parties, that by 1998, after Decree 01 was adopted and Claimants challenged that decree in the *amparo* proceedings, a dispute had arisen between Claimants and the municipal authorities of Lima. The Tribunal finds that at that point in time, the parties were locked in a dispute in which each side held conflicting views regarding their respective rights and obligations.\n\n50.\n\nThe parties disagree, however, as to whether the earlier dispute ended with the judgments rendered by the Peruvian courts in Claimants' favor or whether it continued and came to a head in 2001 with the adoption of Decrees 258 and 259. The Tribunal must therefore now consider whether, in light of other here relevant factors, the present dispute is or is not a new dispute. In addressing that issue, the Tribunal must examine the facts that gave rise to the 2001 dispute and those that culminated in the 1998 dispute, seeking to determine in each instance whether and to what extent the subject matter or facts that were the real cause of the disputes differ from or are identical to the other.4 According to a recent ICSID case, the critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter.5 The Tribunal considers that, whether the focus is on the \"real causes\" of the dispute or on its \"subject matter\", it will in each instance have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.\n\nSee Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Preliminary Objection), 1939 P.C.I.J., p. 64 at 82.\n\nCMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina, Case No. ARB/ 01/ 8, 17 July 2003, 42 ILM 788, para. 109 (2003)\n\n51.\n\nIt is undisputed that the subject matter or origin of the 2001 dispute, if it was a new dispute, was the promulgation of Decrees 258 and 259. Decree 258 was designed to establish a regulatory framework for the permanent protection of the Pantanos de Villa as an ecological reserve. It authorized the municipal authorities of Lima to adopt measures necessary to achieve that objective. Decree 259 ordered the revocation of Claimants' operating license for the production of pasta and decreed the closing and removal of the factory. The lengthy preamble to Decree 259 lists the findings in justification of the decision. The list invokes Lucchetti's failure to comply, since 1997, with the legal rules applicable the construction of the plant near the Pantanos de Villa, thus endangering that ecological reserve. It makes reference to the litigation instituted by Lucchetti against the municipality's efforts to protect the region's environment and notes that the revelations contained in recently released videos and in testimony before a congressional committee indicate that there was corruption in the procurement of the judgments in Lucchetti's favor. The preamble then takes note of various relevant legislative and regulatory measures, including Decree No. 126-97-MML. This decree created the Zona de Reglamentaci\u00f3n Especial Pantanos de Villa, which was declared of ecological interest to the municipality. The preamble also refers to Decree 01 of January 2, 1998 and notes that the decree declared null and void the construction license Lucchetti allegedly received due to administrative inaction as well as the approval of its architectural plans for the construction of the factory. Next, the preamble takes note of the *amparo* action instituted by Lucchetti to set aside Decree 01 and Article 4 of Decree 126-97 and to obtain authorization for the operation of the industrial plant. The preamble invokes Resolution No. 6856-98-MDCH of December 29, 1998 which, having been issued \"in compliance with the fraudulent judicial decisions rendered in the judicial proceedings in question,\" granted Lucchetti a municipal operating license for its pasta factory and the sale of its product. Finally, the preamble points out that Resolution No. 6556-98 specified in its Article 2 that the license in question was granted on condition that there be full observance of the limitations and restrictions provided for in the applicable environmental impact study and that there be avoidance of other environmentally harmful activities such as, for example, the emission of noxious gases and fumes.\n\n52.\n\nIn setting out the administrative, legislative and judicial history of Claimants' efforts to obtain permission for and to operate their pasta factory in the vicinity of the environmental reserve of Pantanos de Villa, Decree 259 related the action it mandated directly to the measures the municipal authorities took in 1998 in order to force Claimants to comply with the environmental and zoning requirements applicable to the construction of their pasta factory. It also focuses on the failure of the municipal authorities to achieve their objective because of the judgments entered in Claimants' favor in 1998 that forced them to issue the licenses they had previously denied Claimants.\n\n53.\n\nThe reasons for the adoption of Decree 259 were thus directly related to the considerations that gave rise to the 1997/98 dispute: the municipality's stated commitment to protect the environmental integrity of the Pantanos de Villa and its repeated efforts to compel Claimants to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the construction of their factory in the vicinity of that environmental reserve. The subject matter of the earlier dispute thus did not differ from the municipality's action in 2001 which prompted Claimants to institute the present proceedings. In that sense, too, the disputes have the same origin or source: the municipality's desire to ensure that its environmental policies are complied with and Claimants' efforts to block their application to the construction and production of the pasta factory. The Tribunal consequently considers that the present dispute had crystallized by 1998. The adoption of Decrees 258 and 259 and their challenge by Claimants merely continued the earlier dispute.\n\n54.\n\nBefore concluding, however, that the above finding is determinative of the outcome of this case, the Tribunal considers that it should address the further question whether there are other legally relevant elements that would compel a ruling that the 2001 dispute must nevertheless be treated as a new dispute. In this regard, Claimants point to the fact that Decree 259 revoked their operating license whereas Decree 01 voided their construction license and that the earlier dispute involved only Decree 01, which was concerned with construction issues rather than the environmental issue dealt with in Decrees 258 and 259. They also note that their plant had been in operation for more than two years before Decree 259 was issued. There was thus a substantial time gap between the adoption of Decree 259 and the judgments of 1998 which, according to Claimants, put an end to the earlier dispute, and had become *res judicata*. Finally, Claimants assert that their claim before this Tribunal alleges a violation of the BIT, which was not yet in effect in 1998. It must thus be seen as a new dispute \u2014 a proceeding to enforce BIT rights and obligations that did not exist in 1998. They consider that as a BIT claim, it does not come within the provisions of the *ratione temporis* reservation set forth in Article 2 of the BIT.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the issues in dispute in 1998 did not concern only matters dealt with in Decree 01. The dispute involved a series of legal measures that addressed environmental matters, among them Decrees 01 and 126, and Official Letter 771-MML-DMDU, which formed the basis for Claimants' successful *amparo* action. Thereafter, moreover, the municipality enacted Ordinance 184, which established a comprehensive environmental regulatory scheme and required activities not in compliance with the plan to be brought into compliance therewith within a five-year period. Claimants successfully challenged that ordinance as applied to them in the same court that granted their *amparo* action. That ruling compelled the municipal authorities to grant Claimants their construction and operating license. It is thus clear that the issues in dispute in 1998 dealt with the same environmental concerns reflected in Decrees 258 and 259 of 2001, and that those concerns did not only focus on the construction but also the operation of the plant.\n\n56.\n\nAs for the time that elapsed between the judgments rendered in Claimants' favor in 1998 and Decree 259, that fact alone will not transform an ongoing dispute into two disputes, unless the evidence indicates that the earlier dispute had come to an end or had not as yet crystallized into a dispute.6 Here the municipality continued throughout to seek to apply its environmental regulatory scheme to Claimants' plant, only to be blocked in its efforts by the various judicial proceedings Claimants instituted and which the municipality vigorously contested and sought to circumvent. See, *e.g*., Ordinance 184. Moreover, the municipality adopted Decrees 258 and 259 as soon as it concluded that the disclosures about the manner in which the judgments had been procured enabled it to reassert its earlier position and to apply its environmental regulatory scheme to Claimants' operations. That the municipality never considered that its dispute with Claimant had ended with the judgments is further evidenced by the language of the preamble to Decree 259 which, as has been seen above, recounts and relies on the municipality's earlier efforts to force Claimants to comply with its environmental rules and regulations. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that the lapse of two and half years between these judgments and the adoption of Decrees 258 and 259 does not in and of itself compel the conclusion that the earlier dispute had come to an end and that a new dispute arose in 2001. The Tribunal considers, moreover, that Decrees 258 and 259 did not generate a new dispute notwithstanding the fact that the 1998 judgments had become *res judicata* under Peruvian law. The *res judicata* status of these judgments, standing alone, does not compel that result since the facts before the Tribunal indicate, as has already been shown, that the original dispute continued. Moreover, the public controversy concerning these judgments, stimulated by the continuing judicial and parliamentary inquiries relating to them, further demonstrates that, as a practical matter, the *res judicata* status of the judgments was not deemed to have put an end to the dispute.\n\n*Cf.* Maffezini v. Spain (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/97/77, 16 ICSID Review 212, paras 90-98 (2001). Here the tribunal had before it a provision similar to Article 2 of the BIT in the present case. It found that the events leading to a dispute had been the subject of discussions between the parties for a number of years before the entry into effect of the BIT there in issue. These discussions did not produce \"the conflict of legal views and interests\" necessary to transform them into a dispute until after the entry into force of the BIT. Therefore, the challenged dispute was not barred by the BIT. *Id.*, para. 96. In the present case, \"the conflict of legal views and interests\" had crystallized prior to the entry into force of the BIT. Had that been the case in Maffezini, its tribunal would have reached the same conclusion as this Tribunal.\n\n57.\n\nTurning now to the question concerning the alleged illegalities surrounding the manner in which the 1998 judgments were procured, the Tribunal is of the view that, if proved, they would provide an independent ground for holding that the judgments could not have had the effect of terminating the earlier dispute. However, since the Tribunal has already concluded on other grounds that these judgments did not end the dispute, it is unnecessary for it to address this issue.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, Claimants contend that in these proceedings they invoke rights and obligations arising under the BIT and that they therefore are entitled to have the Tribunal adjudicate this claim. According to them, moreover, being a BIT claim, the present dispute is not and cannot be the same dispute as the one that existed prior to the BIT's entry into force.\n\n59.\n\nIt is true, of course, that Claimants are entitled to have this Tribunal adjudge rights and obligations set forth in the BIT. But this is so only if and when the claim seeks the adjudication of a dispute which, pursuant to Article 2 of the BIT, is not a dispute that arose prior to that treaty's entry into force. The allegation of a BIT claim, however meritorious it might be on the merits, does not and cannot have the effect of nullifying or depriving of any meaning the *ratione temporis* reservation spelled out in Article 2 of the BIT.7 Further, a pre-BIT dispute can relate to the same subject matter as a post-BIT dispute and, by that very fact, run afoul of Article 2. That, as has been seen above, is the case here.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Asian Agricultural Products, LTD. (AAPL) v. Sri Lanka, ICSID Case No. ARB/ 87 /3, 6 ICSID Review 526 (1991), where the tribunal points out that \"nothing is better settled, as a canon of interpretation in all systems of law, than that a clause must be so interpreted as to give it a meaning rather than so as to deprive it of meaning.\" *Id.*, para. 40, Rule (E).\n\n60.\n\nGiven that the present Award is responsive to a jurisdictional objection, the factual and legal propositions at the heart of Lucchetti's substantive case have naturally not been tested. Lucchetti contends that it was invited to invest in Peru, made its investment properly, expended tens of millions of dollars in building the most advanced industrial installations in the country, and established a model of operational success, employing a substantial workforce and making good, competitive products with export potential. Lucchetti also stresses that it has not been alleged (let alone proved) that its establishment in Peru as an investor was procured by irregular means. It is therefore in a fundamentally different position than someone whose initial agreement is said to have been procured by fraud or corruption. Most of all, it claims that its assets have been spoliated in a purely arbitrary and pretextual fashion.\n\n61.\n\nLucchetti may therefore consider it a harsh result that its effort at obtaining an international remedy is brought to a halt before the merits of its contentions are even examined. Such a conclusion, however, would not be warranted in light of the fact that Lucchetti did not have an *a priori* entitlement to this international forum. It cannot say that it made its investment in reliance on the BIT, for the simple reason that the treaty did not exist until years after Lucchetti had acquired the site, built its factory, and was well into the second year of full production. It cannot conceivably contend that it invested in reliance on the existence of this international remedy.\n\n62.\n\nThe only question entertained by this Tribunal is precisely whether the claim brought by Lucchetti falls within the scope of Peru's consent to international adjudication under the BIT. Lucchetti has not satisfied the Tribunal that this is the case, and thus finds itself in the same situation as it would have been if the BIT had not come into existence. Its substantive contentions remain as they were, to be advanced, negotiated, or adjudicated in such a manner and before such instances as it may find available.\n\n**VIII.

These are always matters of judgement, sometimes quite delicate\u00a0judgement, and, if I find myself coming down on the other side of the line from\u00a0them, I doubt whether the distance between us is all that great. Because,\u00a0however, I take a sterner view than they do of the manifold shortcomings of the\u00a0Tribunal's Award, I should explain why I do so, in the interests of the ICSID\u00a0system as a whole, and as a pointer for future Tribunals.\n\n2.\n\nThere are two essential features to this case, the first being that the proceedings\u00a0had been dismissed in limine on jurisdictional grounds, without the Claimant\u00a0being allowed a hearing on the merits of its claims, and the second being that the\u00a0ground for doing so was the reach ratione temporis of the consent to ICSID\u00a0jurisdiction under the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) which the Claimant had\u00a0invoked.\n\n3.\n\nThe first of these two features is, to my way of thinking, fundamental. It plays\u00a0itself out against the background of the well-recognized fact that the whole aim\u00a0behind the Washington Convention which created ICSID - and indeed a principal\u00a0aim behind the entire network of investment treaties of which the present BIT is\u00a0one example - was to create a procedure for the settlement of disputes between\u00a0investors and host States which would be entirely separate from and independent\u00a0of the national courts of the host State. The question therefore is: what\u00a0requirements does this state of affairs impose on an ICSID Tribunal faced with a\u00a0claim by the host State, as Respondent before it, that that fundamental objective\u00a0has not been achieved in the particular circumstances of a particular claim? What\u00a0is a Claimant (one might say \u2018an ICSID Claimant') entitled to expect of the\u00a0Tribunal, and what indeed are we all, as users of the ICSID system, entitled to expect when that sort of claim is put forward? A further question is then (though subsidiary to the first): if the case is one under a BIT, what impact does the\u00a0fundamental aim just described have on the assessment of the \u2018object and\u00a0purpose' (to borrow a phrase from the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties)\u00a0of the BIT itself, and hence on its interpretation?\n\n4.\n\nThere is obviously room for some discussion as to what the standard of\u00a0\u2018manifestness' under Article 52(1) of the Washington Convention should be\u00a0understood to mean in relation to jurisdictional error on the part of a Tribunal, and\u00a0indeed the question is very properly addressed at paragraphs 99-101 of the ad hoc\u00a0Committee's Decision. No doubt the Committee is right to say that there is no\u00a0warrant for holding the notion of \u2018manifestness' to mean anything different for\u00a0one head of annulment under the Article than for another. But that does not, to\u00a0my mind, stand in the way at all of insisting that, when a Tribunal proposes to\u00a0non-suit a Claimant at the initial stage, i.e. so as to preclude any airing of the\u00a0claims on their merits (or demerits), the grounds for doing so must be clear and\u00a0strong, and in particular that they must be clearly explained and justified, so as to\u00a0enable the Claimant (not to mention other consumers of the ICSID system) to\u00a0understand what the Tribunal has done and why. Where, on the other hand, the case is not sufficiently clear as to enable the issue to be convincingly determined in limine, the proper course is plainly that provided for in Article 41(2) of the Convention and in the Arbitration Rules, namely to join the preliminary objection\u00a0to the merits, and determine it then on the basis of full and complete argument.\u00a0The converse of this proposition is of course that, if a Tribunal chooses to decline\u00a0jurisdiction at the preliminary stage without adequately explaining the reasons\u00a0why, then one is at once within the area of annullable error - if not on the basis of\u00a0an excess of powers, then at least on the basis of a failure to give reasons (though,\u00a0as the ad hoc Committee correctly observes at paragraph 72 of the Decision, it is\u00a0quite possible to conceive of circumstances in which two grounds for annulment\u00a0should not be thought of as operating in isolation, but instead as reinforcing one\u00a0another).\n\n5.\n\nTo determine whether the Tribunal did in fact adequately explain the reasons for\u00a0its conclusion, I have to move to the second of the essential features identified in\u00a0paragraph 2 above, i.e. that the ground on which the Tribunal chose1 to decline\u00a0jurisdiction was the reach ratione temporis of the consent to ICSID jurisdiction\u00a0under the BIT. In making this choice the Tribunal (again I borrow from the\u00a0Committee's Decision at paragraph 67) took upon itself the need first to\u00a0determine what was meant by the term \u2018dispute' in the second sentence of Article\u00a02 of the BIT, and then to decide whether the circumstances of the case before it\u00a0met or did not meet that meaning. As the Committee rightly puts it, the first is a\u00a0straightforward question of treaty interpretation, the second of its application,\u00a0reflecting the pairing often found in dispute settlement clauses so that they cover\u00a0disputes over \u2018the interpretation or application' of the treaty (as, for example, in\u00a0Article 8 of the present BIT). The Committee also has my complete support\u00a0when it says that the indisputable requirement, in respect of the first of these,\u00a0treaty interpretation, is to apply the rules laid down in Article 31 and subsequent\u00a0Articles of the Vienna Convention. The Committee goes on to say that, even\u00a0while the Tribunal failed to describe what rules of treaty interpretation it was\u00a0applying, it (the Committee) has no basis for concluding that the Tribunal\u00a0disregarded any significant element of the well-known and widely recognised\u00a0international rules of treaty interpretation. Indeed, one may add, that sort of\u00a0failing would be surprising in the extreme in the case of a Tribunal of such\u00a0distinction, and such wide experience specifically in the field of public\u00a0international law.\n\nThe term \u2018chose' refers to nothing more than that, as duly noted by the Committee in paragraph 67 of the Decision, the Tribunal, faced with a series of Preliminary Objections by the Respondent, elected to rest the entire weight of its decision on one of them alone - not in itself an objectionable course, though it would have been equally open to the Tribunal to have canvassed in its Award all of the grounds as argued before it, and to have adopted one or more of them in the alternative (assuming them to be well founded).\n\n6.\n\nBut to suppose that the Tribunal must have applied the proper rules of treaty\u00a0interpretation is not, to my way of thinking, the end of the matter. The real\u00a0question, as I have suggested above, is whether they adequately explained what they were doing in the interpretative process, and did so specifically with the very particular care needed from a Tribunal proposing, on the basis of the\u00a0interpretative outcome, to decline jurisdiction altogether. And the only way to\u00a0answer that question, given that the Tribunal (somewhat surprisingly, I think) did\u00a0neglect to tell us what they were doing, is to look to what the Tribunal actually\u00a0did as evidence of what rules they were applying. It is precisely in that area that I\u00a0part company with my colleagues, and find the Award so defective that I would\u00a0be prepared to annul it.\n\n7.\n\nTo explain why, I need to go in some greater detail into the interpretation of\u00a0Article 2 of the BIT, not in order to determine its \u2018correct' interpretation (as the\u00a0Committee rightly says, that would amount to appeal, not annulment), but in order\u00a0to bring out the elements that on any analysis must necessarily have formed part\u00a0of a properly-conducted interpretative process.\n\n8.\n\nThe Vienna Convention tells us that the essence of treaty interpretation lies in\u00a0extracting the ordinary meaning of the terms used, in their context, and in the light\u00a0of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole. It goes on to add that other\u00a0indicators of the intention of the Treaty Parties may be admissible in defined\u00a0circumstances for defined purposes. So when the issue was, as here, how the\u00a0term \u2018dispute' was to be understood for the purposes of Article 2 of the BIT, one\u00a0would have expected a number of straightforward enquiries to have been\u00a0undertaken, including: a textual analysis of the provision in question and its\u00a0purpose; an analysis of other connected provisions of the treaty; an examination\u00a0of other places in the treaty where the same terms had been used, to see what light\u00a0that might throw on the intentions behind Article 2; a discussion of the object and\u00a0purpose of the treaty as a whole as a guide to the interpretation of Article 2; a\u00a0search for whatever other material might be available to illuminate the precise\u00a0intentions of the Treaty Parties in agreeing to Article 2; and so on and so forth.\u00a0There is nothing special about this list; the items in it are simply the normal tools\u00a0of treaty interpretation.\n\n9.\n\nAt this point a digression is however in order, to bring out an unusual, though not\u00a0insignificant, aspect of the broader background against which the exercise in\u00a0treaty interpretation was taking place. Every case of the interpretation of a BIT\u00a0by an ICSID Tribunal shares this unusual feature, namely that the Tribunal has to\u00a0find the meaning of a bilateral instrument, one of the Parties to which (the\u00a0Respondent) will be a party before the Tribunal, while the other Treaty Party by\u00a0definition will not. Or, to put the matter the other way round, one of the parties\u00a0to the arbitration before the Tribunal (but not the other) will have been a stranger\u00a0to the treaty negotiation (see paragraph 70 of the Committee's Decision). That\u00a0circumstance surely imposes a particular duty of caution on the Tribunal: it can\u00a0clearly not discount assertions put forward in argument by the Respondent as to\u00a0the intentions behind the BIT and its negotiation (since that is authentic\u00a0information which may be of importance), but it must at the same time treat them\u00a0with all due caution, in the interests of its overriding duty to treat the parties to the\u00a0arbitration on a basis of complete equality (since it is also possible that assertions\u00a0by the Respondent may be incomplete, misleading or even self-serving). In other\u00a0words, it must be very rarely indeed that an ICSID Tribunal, confronted with a\u00a0disputed issue of interpretation of a BIT, will accept at its face value the\u00a0assertions of the Respondent as to its meaning without some sufficient objective\u00a0evidence to back them up.\n\n10.\n\nThe point can be put quite vividly in another way. At issue in the interpretation of Article 2 of the BIT was not Peru's consent to ICSID jurisdiction, taken as it were as a subject on its own; what was at issue was the mutual acceptance of\u00a0ICSID jurisdiction by both of the Parties as part of the bargain they agreed to in\u00a0the BIT. When it came to pre-treaty investment by their nationals in one\u00a0another's territory, Peru was not accepting any less jurisdiction than Chile, nor\u00a0was Chile accepting any more jurisdiction than Peru. So, although it may on the\u00a0surface have appeared, in terms of the forensic situation before the Tribunal, that\u00a0the question for determination was how far one of the two litigating parties before\u00a0it had consented to its jurisdiction, the underlying element of mutuality must\u00a0surely have been obvious to a Tribunal of this eminence even if neither of the\u00a0parties brought it out four-square in its argument.\n\n11.\n\nThat last consideration leads in turn to another particular feature of the present\u00a0case. If what I have said in the last two paragraphs conjures up the image of the\u00a0\u2018absent Contracting Party', it seems that that party (Chile) was not quite as absent\u00a0as all that. The Committee says, in paragraph 79 of the Decision, that the\u00a0information about Chile's views on Article 2 is scarce. This must surely rank as\u00a0a considerable understatement. For we know that the Tribunal at an early stage\u00a0in the proceedings turned down an application by the Respondent itself (Peru) to\u00a0suspend the arbitration until the question of the correct interpretation of Article 2\u00a0in relation to Lucchetti's investment had been established in a State-to-State\u00a0arbitration Peru was initiating under Article 8 of the BIT (see paragraph 9 of the\u00a0Award). From this it must necessarily follow that there was a formal\u00a0disagreement between the two Treaty Parties on this question, and that the\u00a0Tribunal had been made fully aware at least of its existence, if not of the\u00a0particular positions being advocated by each Treaty Party. Is that not in and of\u00a0itself yet another reason for handling with extra caution, as suggested above,\u00a0arguments on the question advanced before the Tribunal by the only Treaty Party\u00a0that was in fact present before it?\n\n12.\n\nIt needs no lengthy analysis of the Tribunal's Award to discover that virtually\u00a0none of the expectations set out in paragraph 8 above is fulfilled in it. As the\u00a0Committee points out in paragraphs 92-94 of the Decision, there is no discussion\u00a0of the fact that Article 2 refers equally in its second sentence to \u2018differences' on\u00a0the same footing as \u2018disputes' (though that might be explained by the fact that\u00a0neither of the parties made anything of this point). But there is virtually no\u00a0discussion either of the fact that that sentence is in form an exception to the\u00a0general principle of retroactivity expressly laid down in the first sentence, and of\u00a0the implications of that for its interpretation; or of the fact that the term \u2018dispute'\u00a0is used elsewhere, in two Articles, Articles 8 & 9, either of which, on its face,\u00a0would appear to cover Lucchetti's investment unless the exception in Article 2\u00a0applied; or of the object and purpose of the BIT and its possible significance for\u00a0interpretative purposes. Therefore, applying the touchstone set out in paragraph\u00a06 above, the only possible conclusion - whatever supposition one is inclined to\u00a0make about the rules of interpretation the Tribunal \u2018must surely have' brought\u00a0into play - is that the actual evidence of their Award does not sustain the\u00a0supposition that the Tribunal did diligently and systematically apply the Vienna\u00a0Convention rules at all, let alone with the particular care the situation would seem\u00a0to have dictated.\n\n13.\n\nI am tempted to leave the matter there, but duty dictates a more precise indication\u00a0of how the Award fails to meet in this respect the accepted standard of reasoning.\u00a0The key passages in this respect are paragraphs 48 and 59; they constitute the\u00a0Tribunal's own findings on the ratione temporis exception, and follow on from a\u00a0lengthy section summarizing the respective submissions of the parties, but their\u00a0striking feature is that neither paragraph recapitulates the language of Article 2 or\u00a0seeks to subject it to any form of analysis of any kind. Paragraph 48, more\u00a0strikingly still, launches directly into a brief discussion of the \u2018accepted meaning'\u00a0of \u2018dispute' as a \u2018legal concept' in international law without the slightest\u00a0discussion to establish what the Treaty Parties may have intended in the specific\u00a0context of Article 2, with its first sentence expressly making the BIT substantively\u00a0retrospective. The ad hoc Committee must surely be close to the mark when it\u00a0surmises (at paragraph 80) that the purpose behind the second sentence was \u201cto\u00a0prevent that, where a dispute or a difference had arisen at a time when the BIT did\u00a0not exist, the investor would be provided with new ammunition as a result of the\u00a0subsequent entry into force of the BIT\u201d, but of that surmise there is not a trace in\u00a0the terms of the Award itself. Moreover, even if the surmise is shown to be\u00a0correct, the story doesn't end there; it must necessarily presuppose some\u00a0examination of whether the Treaty Parties, for the purpose of putting that\u00a0common intention into effect, did or did not have in mind, beyond the subject\u00a0around which the \u2018dispute' revolved, some identity of parties, some identity of the\u00a0legal obligations in play, some identity of the actions or omissions constituting the\u00a0matters in dispute. Instead, more or less all that the reader finds, following the\u00a0establishment in the abstract of what \u2018dispute' means (paragraph 48), is the ex\u00a0cathedra assertion (paragraph 50) that what the Tribunal has to determine is\u00a0whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute\u00a0continued to be central to the later dispute. No authority is given for this\u00a0proposition arising out of the BIT itself; the only authority is a very old decision\u00a0of the Permanent Court of International Justice (and a recent ICSID Award which\u00a0the ad hoc Committee rightly finds to be out of context, and therefore irrelevant to\u00a0the point at issue). Finally, when the reader does encounter at the end something\u00a0approaching (though only very approximately) a textual analysis of Article 2 of\u00a0the BIT (paragraph 59), it is in a form which treats the meaning of the second\u00a0sentence of the Article as already having been conclusively determined, so that\u00a0the assertion of a claim under the intervening BIT (retrospective though the BIT\u00a0is) cannot be allowed to \u2018nullify' the second sentence or \u2018deprive it' of any (sic!)\u00a0meaning.\n\n14.\n\nNone of this is of course to say that the Tribunal's reading of what Article 2 as a\u00a0whole properly means is not a tenable one. But there are other tenable\u00a0interpretations too. And between the premise (that \u2018dispute' has a given\u00a0meaning), and the conclusion (that there is a given test to determine whether a\u00a0particular dispute continues in being or not), and the confirmatory conclusion\u00a0(that the application of this test to the premise can't be set aside by invoking the\u00a0BIT), there lie a whole series of steps in the logical chain. Virtually none of\u00a0these appears on the face of the Award; they have to be inferred by the educated\u00a0reader; and in consequence the Award clearly fails to meet the accepted\u00a0requirement (as enunciated in the Annulment Decision in MINE v. Guinea) that \u201c...the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law ... the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from\u00a0Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\u201d\n\n15.\n\nThat would be enough in itself, but I feel I must touch as well on another problem\u00a0area which the ad hoc Committee deals with in its Decision, but too perfunctorily\u00a0as I see it. I have referred above to the Tribunal's twofold task - of interpreting\u00a0the BIT and then applying it; this problem area relates to the second of those.\u00a0Whereas treaty interpretation can often be a detached exercise, it is virtually\u00a0inevitable that treaty application will entail to some extent an assessment of the\u00a0facts of the particular case and their correlation with the legal rights and\u00a0obligations in play. So it is in this instance. The ad hoc Committee points out,\u00a0referring to paragraph 53 of the Award, that \u201cthere is no doubt that what Lucchetti\u00a0refers to as the Municipality of Lima's subjective assertions did become a crucial\u00a0element in the Tribunal's ultimate decision\u201d, and goes on to discuss (in paragraph\u00a0122 of its Decision) whether Lucchetti was or was not given adequate opportunity\u00a0to make its case against these assertions. With everything the Committee says in\u00a0these two paragraphs I am in complete agreement. But for me the question does\u00a0not stop there, the crucial issue being, not whether the parties had adequate\u00a0opportunity to advance their factual cases, but what steps the Tribunal took to\u00a0evaluate them, given that (as indicated) they became a \u2018crucial element' in its\u00a0decision. To my mind, it is inescapable that every \u2018crucial element' in an ICSID\u00a0Tribunal's decision has to be the subject of a finding by the Tribunal; that, if the\u00a0element is a factual element which is in dispute between the parties, the finding\u00a0has to be the result of a proper fact-finding procedure; and that the elements and\u00a0steps in this procedure must be spelled out in the Award. When one looks at the\u00a0text of the Award, however, all that can be discovered (the key passages are at\u00a0paragraphs 51-53) is two paragraphs summarizing the recitals whose bona fides\u00a0the Claimant was challenging, followed without a break by the conclusion that the\u00a0dispute was therefore the \u2018same dispute' as the pre-BIT one.\n\n16.\n\nThe only conclusion I can draw is that the Tribunal simply failed to put to the\u00a0proof by any recognized fact-finding process these factual assertions by the\u00a0Respondent, and the challenge to them by the Claimant, and that this constitutes\u00a0in the circumstances (i.e. because the facts in issue became a \u2018critical element' in\u00a0the Award) a \u201cserious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\u201d within the\u00a0meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the Washington Convention.\n\n17.\n\nTo be sure, the waters were muddied to a considerable extent, as the proceedings\u00a0developed, by the introduction on the part of the Claimant of the argument that\u00a0the Tribunal was somehow under an obligation provisionally to accept its (the\u00a0Claimant's) version of the facts for the purpose of deciding whether the Tribunal\u00a0did have jurisdiction or not. The ad hoc Committee disposes of this argument\u00a0summarily, and is quite right to do so. It is one thing to say that factual matters\u00a0can or should be provisionally accepted at the preliminary phase, because there\u00a0will be a full opportunity to put them to the test definitively later on. But if\u00a0particular facts are a critical element in the establishment of jurisdiction itself, so\u00a0that the decision to accept or to deny jurisdiction disposes of them once and for all\u00a0for this purpose, how can it be seriously claimed that those facts should be\u00a0assumed rather than proved? However - and this is the essential point - the\u00a0dismissal of that argument should not be converted into exactly the same mistake,\u00a0but with the situation turned on its head. If the Claimant's facts can't simply be\u00a0assumed for the purpose of upholding jurisdiction, then surely it follows that the\u00a0Respondent's facts can't simply be assumed for the purpose of denying it.\n\n18.\n\nFor these reasons, I would set the annulment bar rather lower than my colleagues,\u00a0and find that this case crosses it."}], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**Claimants** : Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A.

SUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n-----------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe First Claimant, Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A., whose previous name was Empresas Lucchetti, S.A., is a Chilean company and owns the majority of the shares of the Second Claimant, Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A., previously Lucchetti Peru, S.A. In this Decision, the two Claimants are treated as one unit, and the name *\"Lucchetti\"* is used indiscriminately to designate both or one of them, as the case may be.\n\n2.\n\nLucchetti was the owner of a property in the municipal district of Chorrillos in the City of Lima, where it constructed a plant for the manufacture and sale of pasta. The plant was constructed close to, but not within, a protected wetland called Pantanos de Villa.\n\n3.\n\nOn 18 August 1997, the Municipality of Chorrillos issued a stop work notice to Lucchetti. On 25 September 1997, the Council of the Municipality of Lima issued Decree 111 which ordered work on the construction of the plant to cease immediately. A Special Commission (known as *\"the Somocurcio Commission\"*) was set up to review the administrative formalities observed by Lucchetti and to make recommendations to the Council of the Municipality for the improvement of the urban and environmental control of Pantanos de Villa.\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 October 1997, the Somocurcio Commission issued its report in which it found that the procedures for urban authorisation and granting of a construction licence for Lucchetti's plant infringed environmental rules and posed an imminent environmental threat to the Natural Protected Area of Pantanos de Villa. On 21 October 1997, the Council of the Municipality of Lima promulgated Decree 126 which established the Special Regulatory Zone of Pantanos de Villa and ordered the suspension of all procedures of urban authorisations, construction and other licences, whatever the stage reached, concerning applications to develop inside the Special Regulatory Zone of Pantanos de Villa.\n\n5.\n\nOn January 2, 1998, the Provincial Technical Commission of the Municipality of Lima issued Decree 01 in which Lucchetti's construction licence and all other acts authorising construction work on the industrial plant to be built by Lucchetti at the relevant site were declared null and void.\n\n6.\n\nIn January 1998, Lucchetti began legal proceedings by bringing an *amparo* action against the Provincial Council of the Municipality of Lima, the Mayor of the Municipality of Lima and the District Council of the Municipal District of Chorrillos. This action resulted in the following judgments:\n\n(a) a decision of 19 January 1998 by which the Primer Juzgado Corporativo Transitorio Especializado en Derecho P\u00fablico (\"*First Transitory Corporate Court Specialised in Public Law*\"), declared Lucchetti's request for precautionary measures well-founded and granted Lucchetti the relief sought, including the suspension of Decree 01, the relevant part of Decree 126 and the stop work notice relating to the construction of the plant,\n\n(b) a judgment of 6 February 1998 in which the same Court of first instance allowed the complaint against the Provincial Council of the Municipality of Lima and the Mayor of the Municipality of Lima,\n\n(c) a judgment in second instance issued by the Sala Corporativa Transitoria Especializada en Derecho P\u00fablico (\"*Transitory Corporate Court Specialised in Public Law*\") on 4 March 1998 in which the judgment of 19 January 1998 was confirmed on appeal, and\n\n(d) a judgment of 18 May 1998 in which the judgment of 6 February 1998, with a minor amendment, was confirmed on appeal.\n\n7.\n\nOn 16 March 1998, Lucchetti instituted an enforcement action. The claim for enforcement was granted in a judgment of 23 April 1998 and, on appeal, in a judgment of 11 September 1998.\n\n8.\n\nAn Ordinance 184, adopted by the Council of the Municipality of Lima on 4 September 1998, was declared in a court judgment of 9 December 1998 to be inapplicable in so far as it would have prevented the execution of the judgment of 11 September 1998.\n\n9.\n\nConsequently, on 23 December 1998, the Municipality of Chorrillos issued a construction licence to Lucchetti. On 29 December 1998, it also issued an operating licence for the manufacture and sale of pasta products at Lucchetti's plant. The plant was completed and in operation until August 2001.\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 August 2001, the Council of the Municipality of Lima issued Decrees 258 and 259 which were published on 22 August 2001.\n\n11.\n\nDecree 258 charged the Mayor of Lima to present to the Peruvian legislature proposals for the legislative expropriation by reason of public necessity of all areas necessary for the permanent preservation, maintenance and protection of the Ecological Reserve of Pantanos de Villa.\n\n12.\n\nDecree 259 specifically revoked Lucchetti's operating licence. It read in relevant parts as follows:\n\n\"Article 1. The municipal operating licence granted by Municipal Resolution No. 6856-98-MDCH to Lucchetti Per\u00fa S.A. for its industrial plant situated at an unnumbered location on Avenida Prolongaci\u00f3n Defensores del Morro, 20.5 km along the Panamericana Sur highway, Chorrillos, for the manufacture and sale of pasta is hereby revoked.\n\nArticle 2. The industrial establishment referred to in the preceding article shall be closed and entirely removed; this shall be done within a maximum of twelve months from the day following the publication of this Decree.\"\n\n13.\n\nThe reasons were set out at some length in the preamble to the Decree. The preamble referred to Lucchetti's failure to observe zoning and environmental regulations applicable to the construction of the plant near Pantanos de Villa. It also referred to the court proceedings instituted by Lucchetti and noted revelations of illegalities in these proceedings which had resulted in judgments in Lucchetti's favour. The preamble stated that the operating licence of 29 December 1998 had been issued in compliance with the fraudulent judicial decisions rendered in the judicial proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Decree 259, Lucchetti's establishment was closed and Lucchetti was forced to terminate its construction and business activities.\n\nII. THE INVESTMENT TREATY\n-------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile (hereinafter called \"*the BIT\"*) is dated 2 February 2000 and entered into force on 3 August 2001. It contains, *inter alia*, the following provisions (translation from Spanish):\n\n**\"Article 1***Definitions*\n\nFor the purposes of the present Convention:\n\n1. The term \u2018investor' means, for each of the Contracting Parties, the following subjects which have made or make an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the present Agreement:\n\n(a) natural persons who, according to the law of that Contracting Party, are considered to be its nationals;\n\n(b) legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other entities, which are constituted or otherwise duly organised under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat together with their effective economic activities in the territory of that same Contracting Party;\n\n(c) legal entities constituted under the law of any country, which are effectively controlled by investors referenced in (a) and (b) above.\n\n2. The term \u2018investment' refers to any kind of asset, provided that the investment was made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made and shall include particularly but not exclusively:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property and any other rights *in rem* such as easements, mortgages, usufructs and pledges;\n\n(b) shares and any other form of participation in companies;\n\n(c) loans, securities, rights in money and any other benefit of economic value;\n\n(d) intellectual and industrial property rights, including copyright, patents, trademarks, technological processes and know-how, goodwill and other similar rights;\n\n(e) commercial concessions granted by law or by contract, including concessions for the exploration, cultivation, extraction or exploitation of natural resources.\n\n3. The term \u2018territory' means, in addition to the areas included within the terrestrial limits, the adjacent maritime zones and the air space over which the Contracting Parties exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction in accordance with their own laws and international law.\n\n**Article 2***Scope*\n\nThis Treaty shall apply to investments made before or after its entry into force by investors of one Contracting Party, in accordance with the legal provisions of the other Contracting Party and in the latter's territory. It shall not, however, apply to differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force.\n\n**Article 3***Promotion and Protection of Investments*\n\n1. (...)\n\n2. Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory the investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party, and shall not adversely affect the administration, maintenance, use, usufruct, expansion, sale or liquidation of such investments by unjustified or discriminatory measures.\n\n**Article 4***Treatment of Investments*\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee fair and equitable treatment within its territory for investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Such treatment shall be no less favourable than that granted by each Contracting Party to the investments of its own investors made within its territory or that granted by each Contracting Party to investments of investors of the most-favoured nation made within its territory, if the latter treatment is more favourable.\n\n2. If a Contracting Party accords special advantages to investors of any third country by virtue of an agreement establishing a free trade area, a customs union or a common market, or by virtue of an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation, such Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(...)\n\n**Article 6***Expropriation and Compensation*\n\n1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall adopt any measure directly or indirectly depriving an investor of the other Contracting Party of an investment, unless the following conditions are met:\n\na) The measures are adopted in pursuance of the law and in accordance with the relevant constitutional rules.\n\nb) The measures are not discriminatory.\n\nc) The measures are accompanied by arrangements for the payment of immediate, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall be based on the market value of the investments made on a date immediately prior to the date on which the measure is publicly announced. In the event of any delay in the payment of compensation, interest shall accrue, at a commercial rate established on the basis of the real market value, from the date of expropriation or loss until the date of payment. The legality of any such expropriations, nationalisations or similar measures and the amount of compensation shall be subject to revision in accordance with due legal process.\n\n(...)\n\n**Article 8***Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor*\n\n1. The Parties involved shall hold consultations with a view to obtaining an amicable solution to disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party,\n\n2. If such consultations do not produce a solution within six months following the date of the request for settlement, the investor may refer the dispute to:\n\n- the competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, or\n\n- international arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, signed in Washington on 18 March 1965.\n\nOnce the investor has referred the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made or to the arbitral tribunal, the choice of one or other procedure shall be final.\n\n3. For the purposes of this Article, any juridical person constituted in accordance with the legislation of one of the Parties, in which investors of the other Contracting Party were majority share-holders prior to the occurrence of the dispute, shall be treated, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the above-mentioned Washington Convention, as a juridical person of the other Contracting Party.\n\n4. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on both Parties.\n\n(\u2026)\"\n\nIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S AWARD\n-------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 24 December 2002, Lucchetti, referring to the BIT, submitted to ICSID a request for arbitration against the Republic of Peru.\n\n17.\n\nOn August 1, 2003 the Arbitral Tribunal (hereinafter called *\"the Tribunal\"*) was deemed to have been constituted. It was composed of Judge Thomas Buergenthal, President, Mr. Jan Paulsson and Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades.\n\n18.\n\nDuring the arbitral proceeding, Lucchetti argued before the Tribunal that the Republic of Peru was responsible under the BIT for the revocation of their licence and that the Republic of Peru was in breach of the following articles of the BIT:\n\n(a) Article 3.2 which provides for the protection of investments in accordance with the law, and from unjust or discriminatory measures,\n\n(b) Article 4.1 which guarantees investors a just and equitable, national and most-favoured nation treatment, and\n\n(c) Article 6.1 which provides for protection from illegal, discriminatory or uncompensated expropriation.\n\n19.\n\nThe Republic of Peru argued that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, *ratione materiae* and due to prior submission of the dispute to local courts.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal rendered its Award on 7 February 2005. In this Award, the Tribunal found in essence as follows:\n\n\"48. The Tribunal notes that as a legal concept, the term dispute has an accepted meaning. It has been authoritatively defined as a \u2018a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons,'3 or as a \u2018situation in which two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance' of a legal obligation.4 In short, a dispute can be held to exist when the parties assert clearly conflicting legal or factual claims bearing on their respective rights or obligations or that \u2018the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other'5.\n\n49. It is clear, and that does not appear to be in dispute between the parties, that by 1998, after Decree 01 was adopted and Claimants challenged that decree in the *amparo* proceedings, a dispute had arisen between Claimants and the municipal authorities of Lima. The Tribunal finds that at that point in time, the parties were locked in a dispute in which each side held conflicting views regarding their respective rights and obligations.\n\n50. The parties disagree, however, as to whether the earlier dispute ended with the judgments rendered by the Peruvian courts in Claimants' favor or whether it continued and came to a head in 2001 with the adoption of Decrees 258 and 259. The Tribunal must therefore now consider whether, in light of other here relevant factors, the present dispute is or is not a new dispute. In addressing that issue, the Tribunal must examine the facts that gave rise to the 2001 dispute and those that culminated in the 1998 dispute, seeking to determine in each instance whether and to what extent the subject matter or facts that were the real cause of the disputes differ from or are identical to the other.6 According to a recent ICSID case, the critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same subject matter.7 The Tribunal considers that, whether the focus is on the \u2018real causes' of the dispute or on its \u2018subject matter', it will in each instance have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.\n\n51. It is undisputed that the subject matter or origin of the 2001 dispute, if it was a new dispute, was the promulgation of Decrees 258 and 259. Decree 258 was designed to establish a regulatory framework for the permanent protection of the Pantanos de Villa as an ecological reserve. It authorized the municipal authorities of Lima to adopt measures necessary to achieve that objective. Decree 259 ordered the revocation of Claimants' operating license for the production of pasta and decreed the closing and removal of the factory. The lengthy preamble to Decree 259 lists the findings in justification of the decision. The list invokes Lucchetti's failure to comply, since 1997, with the legal rules applicable the construction of the plant near the Pantanos de Villa, thus endangering that ecological reserve. It makes reference to the litigation instituted by Lucchetti against the municipality's efforts to protect the region's environment and notes that the revelations contained in recently released videos and in testimony before a congressional committee indicate that there was corruption in the procurement of the judgments in Lucchetti's favor. The preamble then takes note of various relevant legislative and regulatory measures, including Decree No. 126-97-MML. This decree created the Zona de Reglamentaci\u00f3n Especial Pantanos de Villa, which was declared of ecological interest to the municipality. The preamble also refers to Decree 01 of January 2, 1998 and notes that the decree declared null and void the construction license Lucchetti allegedly received due to administrative inaction as well as the approval of its architectural plans for the construction of the factory. Next, the preamble takes note of the *amparo* action instituted by Lucchetti to set aside Decree 01 and Article 4 of Decree 126-97 and to obtain authorization for the operation of the industrial plant. The preamble invokes Resolution No. 6856-98-MDCH of December 29, 1998 which, having been issued \u2018in compliance with the fraudulent judicial decisions rendered in the judicial proceedings in question,' granted Lucchetti a municipal operating license for its pasta factory and the sale of its product. Finally, the preamble points out that Resolution No. 6556-98 specified in its Article 2 that the license in question was granted on condition that there be full observance of the limitations and restrictions provided for in the applicable environmental impact study and that there be avoidance of other environmentally harmful activities such as, for example, the emission of noxious gases and fumes.\n\n52. In setting out the administrative, legislative and judicial history of Claimants' efforts to obtain permission for and to operate their pasta factory in the vicinity of the environmental reserve of Pantanos de Villa, Decree 259 related the action it mandated directly to the measures the municipal authorities took in 1998 in order to force Claimants to comply with the environmental and zoning requirements applicable to the construction of their pasta factory. It also focuses on the failure of the municipal authorities to achieve their objective because of the judgments entered in Claimants' favor in 1998 that forced them to issue the licenses they had previously denied Claimants.\n\n53. The reasons for the adoption of Decree 259 were thus directly related to the considerations that gave rise to the 1997/98 dispute: the municipality's stated commitment to protect the environmental integrity of the Pantanos de Villa and its repeated efforts to compel Claimants to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the construction of their factory in the vicinity of that environmental reserve. The subject matter of the earlier dispute thus did not differ from the municipality's action in 2001 which prompted Claimants to institute the present proceedings. In that sense, too, the disputes have the same origin or source: the municipality's desire to ensure that its environmental policies are complied with and Claimants' efforts to block their application to the construction and production of the pasta factory. The Tribunal consequently considers that the present dispute had crystallized by 1998. The adoption of Decrees 258 and 259 and their challenge by Claimants merely continued the earlier dispute.\n\nMavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v.

Argentina, Case No. ARB/ 01/ 8, July 17, 2003, 42 ILM 788, para. 109 (2003).\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeded to examine Lucchetti's arguments:\n\n(a) that Decree 259 had revoked their operating licence whereas Decree 01 had voided their construction licence and that the earlier dispute involved only Decree 01, which was concerned with construction issues rather than the environmental issue dealt with in Decrees 258 and 259,\n\n(b) that their plant had been in operation for more than two years before Decree 259 was issued, and that there was therefore a substantial gap between the adoption of Decree 259 and the judgments of 1998 which had put an end to the earlier dispute, and had become *res judicata*, and\n\n(c) that their claim before the Tribunal alleged a violation of the BIT, which was not yet in effect in 1998, and must therefore be seen as relating to a new dispute - a proceeding to enforce BIT rights and obligations that did not exist in 1998 - and that, as a BIT claim, it did not come within the provisions of the *ratione temporis* reservation set forth in Article 2 of the BIT.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal's findings on these points were as follows:\n\n\"55. The Tribunal finds that the issues in dispute in 1998 did not concern only matters dealt with in Decree 01. The dispute involved a series of legal measures that addressed environmental matters, among them Decrees 01 and 126, and Official Letter 771-MML-DMDU, which formed the basis for Claimants' successful *amparo* action. Thereafter, moreover, the municipality enacted Ordinance 184, which established a comprehensive environmental regulatory scheme and required activities not in compliance with the plan to be brought into compliance therewith within a five-year period. Claimants successfully challenged that ordinance as applied to them in the same court that granted their *amparo* action. That ruling compelled the municipal authorities to grant Claimants their construction and operating license. It is thus clear that the issues in dispute in 1998 dealt with the same environmental concerns reflected in Decrees 258 and 259 of 2001, and that those concerns did not only focus on the construction but also the operation of the plant.\n\n56. As for the time that elapsed between the judgments rendered in Claimants' favor in 1998 and Decree 259, that fact alone will not transform an ongoing dispute into two disputes, unless the evidence indicates that the earlier dispute had come to an end or had not as yet crystallized into a dispute.8 Here the municipality continued throughout to seek to apply its environmental regulatory scheme to Claimants' plant, only to be blocked in its efforts by the various judicial proceedings Claimants instituted and which the municipality vigorously contested and sought to circumvent. See, e.g., Ordinance 184. Moreover, the municipality adopted Decrees 258 and 259 as soon as it concluded that the disclosures about the manner in which the judgments had been procured enabled it to reassert its earlier position and to apply its environmental regulatory scheme to Claimants' operations. That the municipality never considered that its dispute with Claimant had ended with the judgments is further evidenced by the language of the preamble to Decree 259 which, as has been seen above, recounts and relies on the municipality's earlier efforts to force Claimants to comply with its environmental rules and regulations. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that the lapse of two and half years between these judgments and the adoption of Decrees 258 and 259 does not in and of itself compel the conclusion that the earlier dispute had come to an end and that a new dispute arose in 2001. The Tribunal considers, moreover, that Decrees 258 and 259 did not generate a new dispute notwithstanding the fact that the 1998 judgments had become *res judicata* under Peruvian law. The *res judicata* status of these judgments, standing alone, does not compel that result since the facts before the Tribunal indicate, as has already been shown, that the original dispute continued. Moreover, the public controversy concerning these judgments, stimulated by the continuing judicial and parliamentary inquiries relating to them, further demonstrates that, as a practical matter, the *res judicata* status of the judgments was not deemed to have put an end to the dispute.\n\n57. Turning now to the question concerning the alleged illegalities surrounding the manner in which the 1998 judgments were procured, the Tribunal is of the view that, if proved, they would provide an independent ground for holding that the judgments could not have had the effect of terminating the earlier dispute. However, since the Tribunal has already concluded on other grounds that these judgments did not end the dispute, it is unnecessary for it to address this issue.\n\n58. Finally, Claimants contend that in these proceedings they invoke rights and obligations arising under the BIT and that they therefore are entitled to have the Tribunal adjudicate this claim. According to them, moreover, being a BIT claim, the present dispute is not and cannot be the same dispute as the one that existed prior to the BIT's entry into force.\n\n59. It is true, of course, that Claimants are entitled to have this Tribunal adjudge rights and obligations set forth in the BIT. But this is so only if and when the claim seeks the adjudication of a dispute which, pursuant to Article 2 of the BIT, is not a dispute that arose prior to that treaty's entry into force. The allegation of a BIT claim, however meritorious it might be on the merits, does not and cannot have the effect of nullifying or depriving of any meaning the *ratione temporis* reservation spelled out in Article 2 of the BIT.9 Further, a preBIT dispute can relate to the same subject matter as a post-BIT dispute and, by that very fact, run afoul of Article 2. That, as has been seen above, is the case here.\"\n\n*Cf.* Maffezini v. Spain (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/97/77, 16 ICSID Review 212, paras 90-98 (2001). Here the tribunal had before it a provision similar to Article 2 of the BIT in the present case. It found that the events leading to a dispute had been the subject of discussions between the parties for a number of years before the entry into effect of the BIT there in issue. These discussions did not produce \"the conflict of legal views and interests\" necessary to transform them into a dispute until after the entry into force of the BIT. Therefore, the challenged dispute was not barred by the BIT. *Id.*, para. 96. In the present case, \"the conflict of legal views and interests\" had crystallized prior to the entry into force of the BIT. Had that been the case in Maffezini, its tribunal would have reached the same conclusion as this Tribunal.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Asian Agricultural Products, LTD. (AAPL) v. Sri Lanka, ICSID Case No. ARB/ 87 /3, 6 ICSID Review 526 (1991), where the tribunal points out that \"nothing is better settled, as a canon of interpretation in all systems of law, than that a clause must be so interpreted as to give it a meaning rather than so as to deprive it of meaning.\" *Id.*, para. 40, Rule (E).\n\nIV. PROCEDURE\n-------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 6 June 2005, pursuant to Article 52 of the Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter called \"*the ICSID Convention\"*) and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Lucchetti submitted to ICSID a Request for Annulment of the Tribunal's Award of 7 February 2005. Pursuant to Rule 50(2)(a) of the Arbitration Rules, ICSID registered the application for annulment on 1 July 2005.\n\n24.\n\nAfter consultation with the parties, ICSID appointed Sir Franklin Berman, Justice Hans Danelius and Professor Andrea Giardina to serve on the *Ad hoc* Committee set up for the annulment proceedings. In accordance with the Arbitration Rules, the *Ad hoc* Committee was deemed to be constituted and the annulment proceedings deemed to have begun on 17 November 2005. Mr. Danelius accepted to serve as President of the *Ad hoc* Committee.\n\n25.\n\nMs. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Senior Counsel, and Ms. Natali Sequeira, Counsel, served as Secretaries of the *Ad hoc* Committee.\n\n26.\n\nAt its first session held in Washington, D.C. on 16 February 2006, the *Ad hoc* Committee adopted a time schedule and took other decisions relating to the annulment proceedings. In accordance with the time schedule, the parties filed,\n\n(a) Lucchetti a Memorial on 18 May 2006,\n\n(b) the Republic of Peru a Counter-Memorial on 17 August 2006,\n\n(c) Lucchetti a Reply on 16 October 2006, and\n\n(d) the Republic of Peru a Rejoinder on 15 December 2006.\n\n27.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee held a pre-hearing conference by telephone with the parties on 9 January 2007.\n\n28.\n\nThe final hearing was held in Washington, D.C. on 20 and 21 February 2007.\n\nV. CLAIMS AND ARGUMENTS\n-----------------------\n\n29.\n\nBoth parties have presented extensive arguments in writing and orally before the *Ad hoc* Committee. The Committee has examined these arguments in their entirety. The arguments which have appeared to the Committee to be the most important ones are summarised below.\n\n*1. Lucchetti*\n--------------\n\n30.\n\nLucchetti claims the annulment of the Tribunal's Award on the following three grounds.\n\n31.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal arrogated to itself an authority it did not properly possess, to determine that a government measure taken after an investment treaty's entry into force fell outside that treaty's coverage, simply because its \"subject matter\" was the same as earlier government measures which were formally, legally and irrevocably invalidated by the local courts, and because the government never ceased to resent this chapter of history and continued to stir the flames of public opinion. By deferring to public opinion and the government's subjective beliefs rather than recognised legal principles on *ratione temporis* and finality of judgments, the Tribunal also failed to apply the proper law. In doing so, it also failed to exercise the jurisdiction that it properly possessed. All of these errors constitute manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n32.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. It is accepted as a general principle in international proceedings that resolution of jurisdictional questions must be based on the claimant's factual allegations as pleaded, not on the respondent's counter-allegations of fact, unless a tribunal wishes to make evidentiary findings at the jurisdictional stage. The Tribunal seriously departed from this fundamental rule of procedure by deferring entirely to the Lima Council's stated motivations for its 2001 Decrees, rather than crediting, for purposes of jurisdiction, Lucchetti's offer to demonstrate that these motivations were mere pretexts. The Tribunal's deference to the Lima Council's one-sided explanations also led to a serious departure from the fundamental rule of procedure known as the \"presumption of innocence\", because it permitted the mere fact of corruption allegations regarding pre-Treaty events to eliminate an investor's access to ICSID, regardless of the truth or falsity of the allegations and in the face of the investor's express request that it be permitted to clear its name if the corruption allegations had any bearing on the jurisdictional analysis.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal compounded its other errors by presenting genuinely contradictory reasons for its ruling, and by failing to deal with critical questions raised by Lucchetti, both of which constitute \"failure to state reasons\" within the scope of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*a) Manifest excess of powers*\n------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Lima Council tried to destroy Lucchetti's investment through illegal measures in late 1997 and early 1998 for reasons of political opportunism, but Lucchetti obtained relief from the courts and an operating licence. Lucchetti's facility was then operating unimpeded for two and a half years until August 2001 when Decree 259 was issued which destroyed Lucchetti's achievements without any due process, in clear discrimination vis-\u00e0-vis other investors and in gross violation of Peruvian law and the BIT. The explanations given for this act were merely pretexts for politically motivated action.\n\n35.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal declined to exercise jurisdiction over Lucchetti's claims under the BIT by applying the *ratione temporis* exception in the BIT. This was not consistent with previous *ratione temporis* jurisprudence.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal was wrong in equating the test in the BIT (whether the dispute arose prior to the entry into force of the BIT) with a different test, i.e. whether the dispute concerned the \"same subject matter\" or what was the \"real cause\" of the dispute. The relevant date is the date on which the government authorities took the actions that were alleged to have violated Lucchetti's rights and destroyed its investment. Those actions were the promulgation of Decrees 258 and 259. The fact that the dispute had historical antecedents does not matter.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal opined that a \"same subject matter\" test would turn on whether the facts that gave rise to the 1997-1998 dispute \"continued to be central\" to the 2001 dispute. The Tribunal gave no explanation of what it means for a fact to \"be central\" to an ICSID dispute, but essentially assumed in its analysis that facts are central if they are relevant and necessary history to later events, without asking whether such historical facts would be sufficient on their own to create the dispute with which ICSID is presented.\n\n38.\n\nHaving substituted a \"same subject matter\" test and \"central fact\" interpretative tool for the test actually dictated by the BIT, the Tribunal found determinative that the Lima Council explained its 2001 acts with reference to preceding events. The Tribunal concluded that the Council's explanation demonstrated that its 2001 acts \"merely continued the earlier dispute\" that predated the BIT's effective date, rather than constituting a \"new\" dispute arising after that effective date. The Tribunal disregarded for purposes of its jurisdictional review Lucchetti's offer to prove that the Council's stated reasons had been mere pretexts for new political action.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal likewise gave no weight to the objective facts (a) that the Lima Council had taken new action to destroy Lucchetti's investment after the BIT's entry into force, (b) that the earlier dispute predating the BIT had been conclusively resolved in the Peruvian courts as a matter of Peruvian law by judgments which were *res judicata*, and (c) that neither the Lima Council nor the Republic of Peru had ever attempted to overturn or nullify the court rulings, preferring to rest on the Council's extra-legal self-help in the form of the new decrees. The Tribunal thus disregarded the legal principles that govern finality of disputes and the related principles of repose and vested rights in the country in question. It should be noted that Peruvian law allows otherwise final judgments to be nullified in cases of judicial corruption within a six-month period running from the date the judgments otherwise become *res judicata*, as opposed to the date of discovery of the underlying corruption. However, this was not done, which means that the judgments remained valid and should be respected by the administrative authorities.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal also referred to the existence of \"public controversy\" about the 1998 judgments, meaning articles in the media and street demonstrations, as confirming as a \"practical matter\" that the earlier dispute had never really ended. The Tribunal thus substituted a \"practical matter\" test for recognised legal principles by referring to \"public controversy\" and to the lasting resentments of the authorities. The Tribunal failed to apply the proper law (international law with respect to treaty interpretation and Peruvian law regarding the finality of judgments) by resolving the questions as a \"practical matter\". The Claimants allege that the Tribunal's decision to give determinative weight to the Lima Council's stated motivations and to the existence of public controversy, rather than to objective factors grounded in Peruvian law and international jurisprudence, is ground for annulment in and of itself.\n\n41.\n\nIt is significant that the BIT Peru-Chile only excludes disputes having arisen before the entry into force (\"single exclusion\"), whereas some other treaties also exclude disputes over facts and acts that occurred prior to its entry into force (\"double exclusion\"). Under a single exclusion clause, the dispute cannot have arisen until after the contested government action which in this case was the promulgation of Decree 259.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal also disregarded the fact that the dispute in 1998 was a dispute with the municipal authorities of Lima, whereas Decree 259 gave rise to a dispute with the Republic of Peru.\n\n43.\n\nA tribunal's findings regarding jurisdiction are fully susceptible of review by an *ad hoc* committee. If the committee finds that the tribunal wrongly dismissed a case for lack of jurisdiction, annulment is the proper remedy under Article 52(1)(b). Consequently, if, in this case, the *Ad hoc* Committee finds that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, the Committee must annul the Tribunal's Award.\n\n44.\n\nDifferent views have been expressed as to the meaning of the term \"manifest\" in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The more rational interpretation is that the excess of powers should have \"serious implications\"10 and not that the excess is \"obvious\", but even if that latter criterion is chosen, there is ground for annulment in this case.\n\nICSID Case of *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, Decision on Annulment of 2 July 2002.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal's resolution of core legal issues by deferring simply to one party's subjective motivations and the weight of public opinion was a manifest excess of powers, within the meaning of the ICSID annulment standard.\n\n*b) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal's approach also seriously departs from the fundamental rule of procedure in international cases under which jurisdiction is to be based on the claimant's formulation of its claims, not on the respondent's defence. Certainly, international tribunals are empowered to resolve contested issues of fact for purposes of jurisdictional determinations. But where they decline to do so, they must ask whether the claimant has made out a *prima facie* case, namely on the assumption that the claimant can prove its assertions of fact.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal exceeded its power by disregarding Lucchetti's offer to prove that the stated reasons for Decree 259 were mere pretexts. The Tribunal gave determinative weight to these stated reasons rather than to objective factors and without leaving room for the possibility that Lucchetti might later prove the correctness of its assertions. Having decided not to test the facts in the course of the jurisdictional proceedings, the Tribunal did not have the authority to assume contested facts contrary to Lucchetti's pleading.\n\n48.\n\nThe consequence of this reasoning has even broader due process implications in this case, because much of the Lima Council's stated rationale stemmed from its assertions about purported corruption with respect to the 1998 judgments, while Lucchetti consistently denied that its representatives had engaged in any wrongdoing.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision-making technique flies in the face of universal notions about the presumption of innocence and requirements of due process. It allows government actors to destroy a foreign investment with impunity under an otherwise applicable international treaty, simply by declaring that the investor \"deserved it\" because of its supposed pre-treaty acts.\n\n50.\n\nIt is true that the Tribunal stated that it was unnecessary to address the issue of corruption, but it nevertheless based itself on the Lima Council's affirmation in Decree 259 that the 1998 judgments had been obtained by illegal means. This violates the presumption of innocence and the requirements of due process. Instead of letting the perception of Lucchetti's guilt permeate its reasoning, the Tribunal should have either taken evidence on the corruption issue, or deferred that issue for the merits. In any case, since the Tribunal stated that it did not consider the alleged corruption, the Award must stand or fall irrespective of these allegations.\n\n*c) Failure to state reasons*\n-----------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Tribunal presented contradictory reasons for its Award by basing itself on different and inconsistent standards such as the \"same subject matter\" and the \"same origin or source\" of the disputes, whether certain elements were \"central to the dispute\", when the dispute \"crystallised\", and whether, \"as a practical matter\", it was the same dispute. These standards were contradictory and unclear, and they made the Award contradictory and unclear.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal also failed to deal with Lucchetti's arguments:\n\n(a) that the preamble to Decree 259 was merely a pretext and that the real reasons for the Decree were political,\n\n(b) that the 1998 judgments were substantially correct, and\n\n(c) that there was a distinction between the dispute with the municipal authorities and the dispute with the Republic of Peru.\n\n*2. The Republic of Peru*\n-------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Republic of Peru contests Lucchetti's application for annulment and requests that it be rejected on the following grounds.\n\n*a) Manifest excess of powers*\n------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal did not err in its *ratione temporis* analysis and did not exceed its authority. The conclusion in regard to when a dispute arose depends on the circumstances of each case, and the Tribunal examined those circumstances fully. It examined whether the dispute regarding Decree 259 was the same dispute as before on the basis of different standards and reached the conclusion that it was the same dispute. The Tribunal's Award is consistent with previous jurisprudence, and its reasons are convincing.\n\n55.\n\nIn its examination, the Tribunal did consider the *res judicata* status of the 1998 judgments but found that the fact that they were *res judicata* under domestic law did not in itself lead to the conclusion that what happened thereafter was a new dispute.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal did not apply a \"practical matter\" test. Instead, it analysed the facts and found that the dispute was a continuation of the dispute that had crystallised between the parties by 1998. It also examined whether any other of the parties' arguments would compel a finding that it was a new dispute, but found that this was not the case. Only then did the Tribunal add its observation on the \"public controversy\" and the \"practical matter\". The Tribunal did not decide the case *ex aequo et bono* but applied international law to the interpretation of the BIT.\n\n57.\n\nHowever, even if the reasons in the Award were wrong, this would not justify annulment of the Award, because it is not within the province of an *ad hoc* committee to review a tribunal's finding that it lacked jurisdiction. Lucchetti's request for annulment is in reality an appeal against the Tribunal's decision that it did not have jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under Article 2 of the BIT. Appeals are not permitted, and the Committee may not review the Tribunal's findings of fact and law.\n\n58.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal did not \"manifestly\" exceed its powers in this case. The requirement that excess shall be manifest is intended to preclude a searching review of a tribunal's reasoning. \"Manifest\" has been defined as \"clear\" or \"self-evident\". Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face, which is not the case here.\n\n*b) Serious departure from of a fundamental rule of procedure*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nAccording to the Respondent the Tribunal did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure or even less commit a serious breach of such a rule.\n\n60.\n\nThe case-law according to which a tribunal shall, for purposes of jurisdiction, assume the facts alleged by the claimant to be true does not apply in this case where the alleged facts, i.e. the alleged pretextual character of the reasons in the preamble to Decree 259, do not relate to the merits of the case but to the question of jurisdiction itself. The Tribunal should therefore not assume as true the facts alleged by Lucchetti for purposes of jurisdiction but should itself determine whether the threshold jurisdictional requirements, including the *ratione temporis* limitation, were satisfied. Under Lucchetti's theory, the Tribunal had to accept Lucchetti's framing of the dispute as having arisen after the BIT's entry into force and decide whether it had jurisdiction on that basis alone, without any inquiry into the relevant facts. However, tribunals have routinely sought to satisfy themselves, as a matter of both fact and law, that all jurisdictional elements have been met. Lucchetti was never denied the opportunity to present its factual story.\n\n61.\n\nThere can be no question of a breach of the principle of presumption of innocence in view of the fact that the Tribunal explicitly stated in the Award that it was unnecessary to address the alleged illegalities. Consequently, the Tribunal did not examine the question of these illegalities, i.e. corruption and undue pressure on the courts, but based itself on other explanations given in the preamble to Decree 259.\n\n*c) Failure to state reasons*\n-----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent states that the reasons in the Tribunal's Award are clear and coherent.\n\n63.\n\nEven if the Tribunal had failed to address the three questions raised by Lucchetti, the Tribunal would not have committed an annullable offence. But in any case, the Tribunal dealt with the questions, the two first questions in determining whether the dispute was a new dispute and the last question - although it was not argued by Lucchetti - by the general finding that it did not have jurisdiction over Decrees 258 and 259.\n\nVI. THE *AD HOC* COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATIONS\n-------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn its Award of 7 February 2005, the Tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to hear the merits of Lucchetti's claim. It based this conclusion on Article 2 of the BIT which provides as follows:\n\n\"This Treaty shall apply to investments made before or after its entry into force by investors of one Contracting Party, in accordance with the legal provisions of the other Contracting Party and in the latter's territory. It shall not, however, apply to differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force.\"\n\n65.\n\nLucchetti requests the annulment of this Award, whereas the Republic of Peru contests this request. The parties have advanced before the *Ad hoc* Committee, at some length, their respective arguments why the Tribunal's Award should, or should not, be subject to annulment under three of the grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee will respond to these arguments and claims below.\n\n66.\n\nBefore doing so, however, the *Ad hoc* Committee finds it useful to make a few general reflections with regard to what appears to the Committee to be the central issues underlying these annulment proceedings, in particular because there are some aspects which, in the Committee's opinion, have not been sufficiently emphasised or developed by the parties.\n\n67.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee begins with the fact that in this case the Tribunal, faced with a series of jurisdictional objections by the Republic of Peru, decided to rest its dismissal of Lucchetti's case on the single objection based on the *ratione temporis* clause in Article 2 of the BIT. That decision itself is not open to challenge, and has not been challenged; in the Committee's view, it lies well within the discretion with which an ICSID tribunal is vested.\n\n68.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal thus came to turn on a discrete and relatively straightforward question of the interpretation and application of a bilateral treaty; the Tribunal was called upon to determine what a treaty provision meant, and then to apply it to the circumstances of the case before it. That is a process with which many international tribunals of various kinds have been confronted. The *Ad hoc* Committee makes however two general observations about the circumstances in which the Tribunal was to accomplish its task.\n\n69.\n\nThe first observation is that the question for interpretation did not, as so often, concern what could be called \"boilerplate\" provisions of the BIT (such as the standards for protection, or the meaning of \"investment\", or the nationality of individuals or companies) but concerned rather the scope of the clause which defined the consent to arbitration in this particular treaty. In this respect, the Tribunal had to take into account the specific intention of the two Contracting Parties, i.e. the Governments of Chile and Peru, for the purposes of the BIT, a task rendered more difficult by the fact that only one of the Contracting Parties, i.e. the Government of Peru, was a party to the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n70.\n\nThe second observation is that the outcome of the interpretative process, if it went against Lucchetti, would be conclusive, since it meant that Lucchetti would not be permitted to pursue its claims to a hearing on the merits. The interpretation that was made of the relevant clause in the BIT was therefore of crucial importance for Lucchetti as the investor.\n\n*1. The grounds for annulment*\n------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nAccording to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, a party may request annulment of an award on one or more of five specific grounds. Three of these grounds are at issue in the present case, i.e. *\"(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers\"*, *\"(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\"*, and *\"(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\"*. These three grounds deal with different aspects of the award. While ground (b), in so far as the present case is concerned, concerns the extent of the powers conferred on the tribunal under the BIT, ground (d) is aimed to ensure that the parties enjoy their right to be heard in a fair manner. Ground (e) differs from the other two grounds in that it does not concern the tribunal's powers or the conduct of the proceedings but the manner in which its award is drafted.\n\n72.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee notes that the three grounds are set out as separate in the ICSID Convention and considers that the facts of a case should in principle be examined separately in relation to each of these grounds. However, this is not to say that the grounds are entirely unrelated to each other. It may be that, in appropriate circumstances, one of those grounds could properly be seen as reinforcing another of them. For instance, a procedural defect, which is primarily to be examined under (d), might in some cases also be relevant as an element in the consideration of whether a tribunal has exceeded its powers under (b).\n\n73.\n\nBefore examining the present case in relation to grounds (b), (d) and (e), the *Ad hoc* Committee will state its view on certain general issues which are relevant to the consideration of the case as a whole.\n\n*2. The issue of alleged illegalities*\n--------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nIn the proceedings before the Tribunal and in the annulment proceedings before the *Ad hoc* Committee, the parties have devoted a great deal of attention to allegations of corruption and undue influence on the Peruvian courts which gave judgments in Lucchetti's favour in 1998. The *Ad hoc* Committee finds it appropriate to make a few general remarks on this issue and its significance in the Committee's examination of the present case.\n\n75.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee notes the Tribunal's unambiguous statement that it did not examine the issue of the \"alleged illegalities\". Having regard to this declaration in the Award, the Committee must accept that the Tribunal's findings were not influenced by the extensive evidence adduced by the Republic of Peru in support of its allegation that Lucchetti had induced Mr. Vladimiro Montesinos Torres, a senior Peruvian official, to take contact with Peruvian judges in order to make them give judgments in Lucchetti's favour.\n\n76.\n\nAlso at the final hearing before the *Ad hoc* Committee, the Republic of Peru showed excerpts of video recordings in order to sustain its argument that there had been illegal or inappropriate contacts between Lucchetti and Mr. Montesinos Torres and that the latter had exercised undue influence on the courts. However, in the circumstances of this case, the Committee cannot find this evidence to be relevant in the annulment proceedings.\n\n77.\n\nAn additional remark must be made, however. While the alleged illegalities did not affect the Tribunal's Award, it is true that they were referred to in the preamble to Decree 259 by which Lucchetti's licence to operate the pasta plant was annulled. In that preamble, the Council of Lima stated, *inter alia*,\n\n(a) that Lucchetti had \"obtained undue injunctions and judgments\" that were affirmed by the higher court,\n\n(b) that the interference of Mr. Montesinos Torres in the judicial proceedings had become known through videos and audio tapes which showed that the judicial decisions had in fact been \"dictated\" by Mr. Montesinos Torres and that the presiding judges had \"ruled under his influence and direction\", thereby \"depriving the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima, its Mayor, the members of the Technical Provincial Commission of Lima and the residents of Lima\" of constitutional rights, and\n\n(c) that \"in compliance with the fraudulent judicial rulings\" Lucchetti had been granted an operating licence.\n\n78.\n\nIt thus appears that the alleged undue influence on the courts was one of the elements on the basis of which the Council of Lima decided to withdraw Lucchetti's licence. Indirectly, therefore, the allegations of illegal acts, whether justified or not, played a certain role for the action taken against Lucchetti. The *Ad hoc* Committee will bear this in mind when examining the *ratione temporis* issue in this case.\n\n*3. The context of the ratione temporis exception*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nNo specific information has been provided as to how the Governments of Chile and Peru, when concluding the BIT, intended the temporal exception in Article 2 to be applied. The Government of Chile was not a party to the BIT proceedings and there is only scarce information about its views on the interpretation of the BIT. Consequently, the Tribunal has to interpret the relevant clause according to general principles of international law, as set out primarily in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (*\"the Vienna Convention\"*). According to Article 31(1) of that Convention, a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. It follows from Article 31(3) that other means of interpretation are subsequent agreements and practice and relevant rules of international law. Finally, Article 32 provides that there are supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\n\n80.\n\nHaving regard to the main rule in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the *Ad hoc* Committee finds that the second sentence of Article 2 of the BIT must be read in its context, i.e. together with the first sentence of the same Article which provides that the BIT shall apply to investments made both before and after the entry into force of the BIT. The main rule is therefore that the BIT shall be applicable also to previously made investments, and from this rule there shall be an exception according to the second sentence in regard to ongoing disputes or differences. The purpose of the exception must be assumed to be to prevent that, where a dispute or a difference had arisen at a time when the BIT did not exist, the investor would be provided with new ammunition as a result of the subsequent entry into force of the BIT. On the other hand, for the application of an exception of this kind, it should be required that the pre-existing dispute or difference can be clearly identified.\n\n*4. The res judicata issue*\n---------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe measures taken by the municipal authorities in 1997 and 1998 in regard to Lucchetti's investment, in particular the stop work notice of 18 August 1997, Decrees 111 and 126 from 1997 as well as Decree 01 from 1998, were followed by *amparo* proceedings brought by Lucchetti against the Municipality of Lima and others. These proceedings resulted in judgments which were favourable to Lucchetti. As a consequence of these judgments, the Municipality of Chorrillos issued, on 23 December 1998, a construction licence to Lucchetti and, on 29 December 1998, an operating licence for the manufacture and sale of pasta at Lucchetti's plant. These licences were undoubtedly a valuable economic asset for Lucchetti and they must have appeared to Lucchetti as a solid basis for further investment in the factory and for future business based on production in the plant.\n\n82.\n\nThe BIT was concluded on 2 February 2000 and entered into force on 3 August 2001, i.e. thirty days after the Contracting Parties had notified each other that their respective legal requirements for entry into force had been fulfilled.\n\n83.\n\nAt the time of the entry into force of the BIT, Lucchetti's business had been in operation for two and a half years on the basis of the licences issued in December 1998. As far as the *Ad hoc* Committee is aware, the Peruvian authorities had not during this long period taken any new measures in order to prevent Lucchetti from pursuing its activities. In these circumstances, and since the BIT was to apply also to existing investments, the Committee can well understand that Lucchetti believed that its investment, and the considerable economic value it represented, would enjoy protection under the BIT from the time of its entry into force.\n\n84.\n\nHowever, on 16 August 2001, i.e. less than two weeks after the entry into force of the BIT, the Council of the Municipality of Lima issued Decree 259 by which Lucchetti's operating licence from December 1998 was withdrawn. In the Decree it was alleged that Lucchetti had failed to comply with environmental regulations, i.e. matters that had essentially been examined and determined in previous judicial proceedings. As justification for the withdrawal of the licence despite the 1998 judgments, the Council of the Municipality stated in the preamble to the Decree that these judgments had been illegally obtained.\n\n85.\n\nThe judgments rendered by the Peruvian courts in the *amparo* proceedings had become *res judicata* under Peruvian law. Lucchetti attaches special importance to this fact, when arguing that the occurrences in 2001 gave rise to a new dispute. The Republic of Peru has objected that *res judicata* in this context is a matter of domestic law which should not be decisive for whether or not a new dispute has arisen within the meaning of the BIT. The Tribunal, in its Award, found that the *res judicata* status of the Peruvian judgments, standing alone, did not compel the result that the subsequent dispute was a new one, since the facts indicated that the original dispute continued.\n\n86.\n\nThe principle of *res judicata* is not only a characteristic feature of most domestic legal systems but is also an important principle of international law. In the recent judgment of the International Court of Justice (*\"ICJ\"*) in the *Case Concerning the Application of the* *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide*,11 the ICJ emphasised the fundamental character of that principle and pointed out that its underlying character and purposes are reflected in the judicial practice of the Court. However, the analysis in that judgment concerned the *res judicata* status of previous ICJ judgments and not of judgments rendered at national level.\n\n*Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), ICJ Judgment of 26 February 2007, paras. 115116.\n\n87.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee considers that a clear distinction must be made between *res judicata* at international and at national level. While an international judgment which is *res judicata* will in principle constitute a legal obstacle to a new examination of the same matter, *res judicata* at national level produces its legal effects at national level and will in international judicial proceedings not be more than a factual element. This must be so, because it cannot be left to each individual State to create, through its own rules of *res judicata*, obstacles to international adjudication. The Committee refers in this respect to the Case of *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, in which the tribunal stated that the decision on the legality of an investment could not be left up to the courts of the host State, since that would give the possibility to redefine the scope and consent of its own consent to ICSID jurisdiction unilaterally and at its complete discretion.12\n\nICSID Case of *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, Award of 2 August 2006, para. 213.\n\n88.\n\nThus, the *Ad hoc* Committee agrees in principle with the Republic of Peru and the Tribunal in considering that the fact that that the Peruvian judgments were *res judicata* cannot be decisive for the assessment under Article 2 of the BIT. While *res judicata* in respect of these judgments relates to finality under Peruvian law, the interpretation of the BIT is a matter of international law. Nevertheless, the *res judicata* character of the judgments under Peruvian law is one of several factual elements which should all be considered relevant to the application of the temporal exception in the BIT. Thus, the *res judicata* character of the 1998 judgments, while in no way decisive, should nevertheless be taken into account in the examination to be made under Article 2 of the BIT.\n\n*5. The wording of the ratione temporis exception*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe exception in Article 2 of the BIT relates to \"differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry into force\". Consequently, the central issue for the Tribunal was to determine whether the dispute in 2001 was, or was not, the continuation of the dispute that arose in 1997-1998.\n\n90.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal, basing itself on previous international case-law,13 found that \"a dispute\" could be defined as \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons\" or as a \"situation in which two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance\" of a legal obligation. The Tribunal added that a dispute could be held to exist when the parties assert clearly conflicting legal or factual claims bearing on their respective rights or obligations or, as stated by the ICJ,14 when \"the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other\".\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*, Greece v. United Kingdom, Judgment (Merits), 30 August 1924, 1924 PCIJ (ser. A), No. 2, and *Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania*, ICJ Advisory Opinion of March 1950, ICJ Reports 1950, p. 74.\n\n*South West Africa*, ICJ Judgment on Preliminary Objections, ICJ Reports 1962, p. 328.\n\n91.\n\nThe concept of \"dispute\" can clearly be defined in different ways depending on the context. However, the elements specified by the Tribunal to clarify the meaning of that concept for the purposes of the present case do not give rise to any remarks by the *Ad hoc* Committee.\n\n92.\n\nAs pointed out above, the context in which a specific term appears is an important element of interpretation according to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. In this respect, it cannot be disregarded that Article 2 refers not only to \"disputes\" but also to \"differences\". Although the parties did not specifically rely on this aspect of the provision, Lucchetti did refer to the Case of *Helnan International Hotels v. Egypt15* and pointed out that in that case there was a *ratione temporis* clause virtually identical to Article 2 of the present BIT. In *Helnan*, the tribunal commented on the terms \"divergence\" and \"dispute\" and found that \"they do not imply the same degree of animosity\". The tribunal considered that there would be a divergence \"when the parties hold different views but without necessarily pursuing the difference in an active manner\", while, in the case of a dispute, \"the difference of views forms the subject of an active exchange between the parties under circumstances which indicate that the parties wish to resolve the difference, be it before a third party or otherwise\".\n\nICSID Case of *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 17 October 2006.\n\n93.\n\nFor the parties it was not necessary to base their arguments on the additional concept of \"difference\", since they agreed that there had clearly been a dispute both before and after the BIT entered into force and only disagreed on whether or not it was one and the same dispute. Nevertheless, the context in which the term \"dispute\" appears is an element which, to some extent, helps understanding the provision which, when read as a whole, has been given a wide scope. It also makes it clear that a \"difference\" can be considered to persist in some circumstances even after there has been a resolution of a \"dispute\" by legal or other means.\n\n94.\n\nHowever, while the additional term \"difference\" widens the scope of Article 2 to a certain extent, the wording of the exception in the Article is in another respect more limited than the corresponding temporal clauses in many other treaties. While in the BIT an exception is made for disputes that arose prior to its entry into force (*\"single exclusion\"*), the exception in other treaties covers not only *disputes that arose* prior to the entry into force of the treaty but also *disputes over facts or situations that occurred* prior to its entry into force (*\"double exclusion\"*). This means that on this point the exception in the BIT is a narrow one in comparison with other treaties.\n\n95.\n\nWhere there is a double exclusion clause, jurisdiction can be denied even if the dispute arose after the entry into force of the treaty, provided that it related to events occurring prior to the entry into force.16 Where there is a single exclusion clause, this is not possible. In the *Maffezini* Case,17 the tribunal noted that events on which the parties disagreed had started before the entry into force of the BIT but that this did not mean that there was a legal dispute at that time. And in the *Jan de Nul* Case,18 the tribunal stated that the purpose of the single exclusion clause was to exclude treaty disputes which had \"crystallised\" before the entry into force of the BIT.\n\nSee, for instance, *Phosphates in Morocco*, Italy v. France, Judgment (Preliminary Objections), 14 June 1938, 1938 PCIJ 4.\n\nICSID Case of *Emilio Augustin Maffezini v. Spain*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 25 January 2000.\n\nICSID Case of Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, Decision on Jurisdiction of 16 June 2006\n\n96.\n\nIn so far as Lucchetti argues that the Tribunal disregarded the fact that the dispute in 1998 was a dispute with the municipal authorities of Lima, whereas Decree 259 gave rise to a dispute with the Republic of Peru, the *Ad hoc* Committee notes that, while this distinction is one of the elements to be taken into account, it can in no way be conclusive for whether there were two disputes, since it is clear that the Republic of Peru is responsible under the BIT for the acts of all Peruvian public authorities and that, consequently, once the dispute was to be raised to the international level, a claim had to be brought against the Republic of Peru.\n\n*6. The Ad hoc Committee's assessment*\n--------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee considers that, once the Tribunal reached the decision to rest its Award on the issue of the interpretation and application of Article 2 of the BIT, the Tribunal took upon itself the task of applying the standard rules of treaty interpretation to the facts of the case before it. And in turn the task of the *Ad hoc* Committee is to consider whether the manner in which the Tribunal approached and accomplished that task opened its Award to annulment under the Convention, as Lucchetti argues, or adequately met the requirements of the Convention, as the Republic of Peru responds. The word \"manner\" is specifically used here in order to emphasise that it is no part of the Committee's functions to review the decision itself which the Tribunal arrived at, still less to substitute its own views for those of the Tribunal, but merely to pass judgment on whether the manner in which the Tribunal carried out its functions met the requirements of the ICSID Convention.\n\n98.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee is naturally conscious that the manner in which it has described the Tribunal's task does not correspond exactly to how the parties to the annulment proceedings have framed their respective cases before it. Nevertheless it believes that the reference to the standard rules of treaty interpretation and to the application of these rules to the facts of the case brings out more clearly what the essential issues are, and corresponds at the same time to the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. It is widely accepted that a failure to apply the proper law may amount to an excess of powers by a tribunal, as referred to in Article 52(1)(b),19 whereas serious procedural deficiencies in the proceedings before a tribunal may give rise to the application of Article 52(1)(d). The failure to state reasons according to Article 52(1)(e) is of a separate character, since it aims at ensuring the parties' right to ascertain whether or to what extent a tribunal's findings are sufficiently based on the law and on a proper evaluation of relevant facts. The Committee will address the various grounds for annulment advanced by Lucchetti accordingly.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, paras. 167-170.\n\n*a) Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nWhere a tribunal assumes jurisdiction in a matter for which it lacks competence under the relevant BIT, it exceeds its powers. The same is true in the inverse case where a tribunal refuses or fails to exercise jurisdiction in a matter for which it is competent under the BIT. The *Ad hoc* Committee considers that these situations are analogous and should be assessed according to the same legal standards.\n\n100.\n\nHowever, the requirement in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not only that the Tribunal has exceeded its powers but that it has done so \"manifestly\". From the writings of legal scholars it appears that there are divergent views on the impact of this additional requirement of \"manifestness\". On the one hand, the view has been expressed that where an *ad hoc* committee finds that a tribunal has wrongly either exercised or failed to exercise jurisdiction, the award should be annulled, wholly or partly, without any further examination of whether the excess was manifest. On the other hand, it has been held by others that there should be no annulment when the tribunal has wrongly assumed, or failed to assume, jurisdiction, but its decision on this point was tenable, since in such a case the tribunal would not have manifestly acted contrary to the BIT.20\n\nAs to this divergence of views, see, for instance, Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, paras. 137-146\n\n101.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee, for its part, attaches weight to the fact that the wording of Article 52(1)(b) is general and makes no exception for issues of jurisdiction. Moreover, a request for annulment is not an appeal, which means that there should not be a full review of the tribunal's award. One general purpose of Article 52, including its sub-paragraph (1)(b), must be that an annulment should not occur easily. From this perspective, the Committee considers that the word \"manifest\" should be given considerable weight also when matters of jurisdiction are concerned.\n\n102.\n\nBearing in mind the requirement of \"manifestness\", the *Ad hoc* Committee will now examine whether the Tribunal exceeded its powers and, in the affirmative, whether it did so to such an extent as to justify annulment.\n\n103.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee first notes that, in its analysis of whether or not the dispute arose prior to the entry into force of the BIT, the Tribunal found that it should examine the facts that gave rise to the 2001 dispute and those that culminated in the 1997-1998 dispute, seeking to determine in each instance whether and to what extent the subject matter or facts that were the real cause of the disputes differed from or were identical to the other. In this respect, the Tribunal referred to the *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria* Case.21 The Tribunal also referred to the ICSID Case of *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*22 in which it was stated that the critical element in determining the existence of one or two disputes was whether or not they concerned \"the same subject matter\". The Tribunal made the remark that, whether the focus was on the \"real causes\" of the dispute or on its \"subject matter\", the Tribunal would in each case have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.\n\n*Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria* (Preliminary Objection), 1939 PCIJ, p. 82.\n\nICSID Case of *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 17 July 2003.\n\n104.\n\nLucchetti argues that the Tribunal was wrong in equating the test in the BIT, i.e. whether the dispute arose prior to the entry into force of the BIT, with a different test, i.e. whether the dispute concerned the same subject matter as the previous dispute and what was the real cause of the dispute.\n\n105.\n\nAs pointed out by Lucchetti, the *CMS Gas Transmission* Case to which the Tribunal referred differed considerably from the present case, since it concerned the application of a specific provision in the ICSID Convention, i.e. Article 46, which allows a tribunal, on certain conditions, to determine in the same arbitral proceedings incidental or additional claims or counter-claims arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute. The *Ad hoc* Committee shares the view that the purpose of this provision is different from that of the temporal exception in the BIT and that other considerations therefore apply to the present case.\n\n106.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also examined judgments and decisions more closely related to the present case23 and found references to the source of the dispute, the real cause of the dispute or to the event at the root of dispute. The Tribunal then applied those criteria to the present case and found that the facts were such that the dispute that had existed in 1997-1998 was the same as that which had again come to the surface in 2001 after the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n*Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria*, Belgium v. Bulgaria, Judgment of 4 April 1939 (Preliminary Objection), 1939 PCIJ 64, *Right of Passage over Indian Territory*, Portugal v. India, Judgment of 12 April 1960 (Merits), 31 I.L.R. 23 (1996), and ICSID Case of *Goetz et al. v. Republic of Burundi*, Award of 10 February 1999.\n\n107.\n\nLucchetti reproaches the Tribunal with having moved directly from a cursory look at the text of the second sentence of Article 2 to a conclusion about what test should be used to determine the existence of a \"dispute\" in that context, which, says Lucchetti further, is the wrong test. Lucchetti further argues that the Tribunal, by referring in its Award to a \"public controversy\" regarding Lucchetti's investment and to a resolution of the problems as a \"practical matter\", failed to apply the proper law.\n\n108.\n\nIn 1997-1998, i.e. before the entry into force of the BIT, the Municipality of Lima, when annulling Lucchetti's permits of construction, referred *inter alia* to environmental concerns, i.e. the necessity to protect Pantanos de Villa. When, in August 2001, the Municipality issued Decree 259 by which it revoked Lucchetti's operating licence, it again referred to the necessity of protecting Pantanos de Villa as one of the main reasons.\n\n109.\n\nOn the face of it, therefore, the reasons for the measures taken against Lucchetti were to a large extent the same or similar. However, Lucchetti contests that the reasons given in Decree 259 were the real reasons and asserts that in reality the operating licence was revoked for political reasons and not because of environmental concerns which in any case were not justified. In this respect the *Ad hoc* Committee notes that if Lucchetti is right in considering that the Municipality of Lima, in 2001, wished to terminate the operation of Lucchetti's plant not for environmental but for political reasons, it would seem likely that it had been for similar reasons that the Municipality of Lima had taken action against the plant in 1997-1998. Whether the reasons were environmental or political, there would thus seem to have been a certain link or similarity between the acts taken against Lucchetti in 1997-1998 and in 2001. This is one element which speaks in favour of the Tribunal's conclusion that the subject matter or the real cause had been the same in 2001 as in 1997-1998.\n\n110.\n\nHowever, there are other elements speaking in the opposite direction. These elements are essentially the following:\n\n(a) The dispute in 1997-1998 ended with a court judgment which became final (*res judicata*) and which appeared, and could be expected, to create, security for Lucchetti in respect of its investment.\n\n(b) During a rather long period of some two and a half years, Lucchetti continued its activities, as it seems, undisturbed.\n\n(c) When revoking Lucchetti's licence in 2001, the Municipality of Lima, i.e. an administrative authority, acted contrary to final court decisions, which was an action difficult to reconcile with the rule of law, including the right to judicial protection and respect for final judicial decisions. The fact that the Municipality did so on the basis of alleged illegalities which had not been proven in any judicial proceedings adds to the doubtful nature of the action.\n\n111.\n\nIt could well be argued that the facts and elements summarised in (a), (b) and (c) are sufficiently weighty to justify the conclusion that the dispute in 1997-1998 had ended and that a new and separate dispute arose when the Municipality of Lima took new action in 2001.\n\n112.\n\nHowever, the *Ad hoc* Committee does not consider it to be its task to determine whether the test employed by the Tribunal and the weight given by the Tribunal to various elements were \"right\" or \"wrong\". In the Committee's view, treaty interpretation is not an exact science, and it is frequently the case that there is more than one possible interpretation of a disputed provision, sometimes even several. It is no part of the Committee's function, as already indicated above, to purport to substitute its own view for that arrived at by the Tribunal. The interpretation of Article 2 adopted by the Tribunal is clearly a tenable one. Clearly also there are other tenable interpretations. The Committee is not charged with the task of determining whether one interpretation is \"better\" than another, or indeed which among several interpretations might be considered the \"best\" one. The Committee is concerned solely with the process by which the Tribunal moved from its premise to its conclusion.\n\n113.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee notes on this point first that the Tribunal did not identify or describe in its Award the rules of interpretation it proposed to apply. The applicable \"law\" can be considered to have been the rules codified in Article 31 and subsequent Articles of the Vienna Convention. The question therefore arises whether the Tribunal applied these rules or whether there was a failure in this regard amounting to an excess of powers.\n\n114.\n\nIndeed, there are some elements regarding the interpretation of Article 2 of the BIT which the *Ad hoc* Committee would have expected to find in an award applying international rules of treaty interpretation based on the Vienna Convention. It notes in this respect that the Award does not deal with the use of both \"dispute\" and \"difference\" in the second sentence of the Article and its significance for interpretation purposes. Nor is there in the Award an analysis of the two sentences in Article 2 and the relations between them (the first one having a retrospective reach and the second one being in the form of an exception) or any consideration of what might have been the joint intentions of the Contracting Parties. Further, the Award does not purport to examine the \"object and purpose\" of the BIT or its negotiating history in order to illuminate, if possible, what the Contracting Parties actually intended by including the second sentence in Article 2, and what they had specifically in mind when using the term \"dispute\" in that particular context.\n\n115.\n\nLucchetti has also criticised a remark in the Award about \"public controversy\" which Lucchetti considers inappropriate and irrelevant. The remark reads: *\"Moreover, the public controversy concerning these judgments, stimulated by the continuing judicial and parliamentary inquiries relating to them, further demonstrates that, as a practical matter, the res judicata status of the judgments was not deemed to have put an end to the dispute.\"* The remark appears at the end of the legal reasoning in the Award and follows upon legal arguments in favour of the Tribunal's previous conclusion. The sentence essentially has the character of an *obiter dictum* and cannot in any case be regarded as the basis of the Tribunal's conclusions.\n\n116.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 2 of the BIT, as it appears in the Award, does not reflect all relevant aspects of treaty interpretation according to the Vienna Convention, the Committee has no basis for concluding that the Tribunal disregarded any significant element of the well-known and widely recognised international rules of treaty interpretation. In any event, the Committee, which has also carefully examined all other arguments put forward by Lucchetti, cannot find that the Tribunal's reasoning in the Award, although summary and somewhat simplified in relation to the Vienna Convention, constituted an excess - and even less a manifest excess - of the Tribunal's powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.\n\n*b) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nLucchetti argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure in two respects, i.e., on the one hand, by not basing its decision regarding jurisdiction on Lucchetti's allegations but on the Republic of Peru's counter-allegations as to the facts and, on the other hand, by implicitly accepting the allegations regarding corruption in the preamble to Decree 259 in violation of Lucchetti's fundamental right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence. The Republic of Peru contests that any fundamental rule of procedure was violated in these respects.\n\n118.\n\nOn the first point, Lucchetti refers to a rule of international law, reflected in Judge Higgins's opinion in the *Oil Platform Case*24 and in several arbitral awards.25 According to Judge Higgins's opinion, the only way in which it can be determined whether a claimant's claims are sufficiently plausibly based upon the facts is to accept *pro tempore* the facts as alleged by the claimant to be true and to see whether on the basis of these claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of the relevant legal provisions. The Republic of Peru contests, however, that this doctrine applies to the circumstances of the present case where the question is not whether claims of facts relating to the merits could give rise to a breach of international law but whether or not there are facts constituting jurisdiction.\n\n*Case Concerning Oil Platforms*, Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America, Judgment (Preliminary Objection), 12 December 1996, 1996 ICJ 803.\n\nICSID Case of *Plama Consortium Ltd v. Bulgaria*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005, UNCITRAL Case of *Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic*, Decision on Jurisdiction over Counterclaim of 7 May 2004, ICSID Case of *Amco Asia Corp. et al. v. Indonesia*, Decision on Annulment of 16 May 1986, and ICSID Case of *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 6 August 2003.\n\n119.\n\nOn this point, the *Ad hoc* Committee shares the opinion of the Republic of Peru. The question as to whether or not the preamble to Decree 259 indicated the genuine reasons for the Decree or whether, as Lucchetti claims, the real reasons were of a political nature did not relate to the merits but to jurisdiction and could properly be examined at the stage of jurisdiction, provided that the parties were given the opportunity to present arguments and adduce evidence on the matter.\n\n120.\n\nBefore coming to any decision on this question, however, the *Ad hoc* Committee will first examine how the Tribunal proceeded to apply the interpretation it had adopted to the facts of the case. It is not necessary to rehearse at length the criticisms advanced by Lucchetti against the Tribunal's conclusion that, whatever the meaning of Article 2 of the BIT, the dispute brought before the Tribunal in 2003 was in effect a continuation of the dispute between Lucchetti and the Municipality of Lima in 1998. The Committee will concentrate its attention on what it finds to be the weightiest of those criticisms, namely that the Tribunal accepted on their face value the factual assertions contained in the preamble to Decree 259, despite Lucchetti's claim that these assertions were mere pretexts of a self-serving kind. Lucchetti claims further that it was deprived of a fair opportunity to demonstrate the untruthfulness of the Municipality of Lima's assertions, notably by the Tribunal's refusal to allow it to file a full Memorial on the Merits before the Tribunal proceeded to a decision on the Preliminary Objections.\n\n121.\n\nThis is a criticism of some weight. On the one hand, there is no doubt that what Lucchetti refers to as the Municipality of Lima's subjective assertions did become a crucial element in the Tribunal's ultimate decision. This appears from paragraph 53 of the Award, in which the Tribunal found as follows: *\"The reasons for the adoption of Decree 259 were thus directly related to the considerations that gave rise to the 1997/98 dispute (...) The subject matter of the earlier dispute thus did not differ from the municipality's action in 2001 which prompted Claimants to institute the present proceedings. In that sense, too, the disputes have the same origin or source (\u2026)*.\" The Committee notes on the other hand that the Tribunal, in a provisional decision, refused Lucchetti's request to submit its full Memorial on the Merits.\n\n122.\n\nGranted, therefore, that this factual element did become a crucial link in the chain of reasoning leading to the Tribunal's Award, the *Ad hoc* Committee is in no doubt that, if Lucchetti had in the event not been given a full opportunity to present its case on this issue, that would have amounted to a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" for the purposes of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. That being said, the Committee cannot find that the question turns in its entirety on whether the substantive Memorial was or was not filed before the proceedings on the Preliminary Objections. In the Committee's view an ICSID Tribunal is rightly vested with a wide margin of discretion as to how best to organise the proceedings in the particular case before it. Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules provides that, on the formal raising of a jurisdictional objection, the proceedings on the merits shall be suspended and the parties be given a time limit within which to file observations on the objection, and the Committee cannot find that it was unreasonable in itself not to permit at a first stage the filing of a full Memorial on the Merits. More important is that it would appear that Lucchetti was allowed full freedom to advance whatever points it wished in opposing the Preliminary Objections, and there are many ways open to a Tribunal to investigate and decide on any issue relevant to a Preliminary Objection before it, including in the last analysis joining the Objection to the merits under Rule 41(4).\n\n123.\n\nLucchetti thus had the possibility, by presenting arguments and adducing evidence, to try to convince the Tribunal, at the jurisdictional stage, that the reasons in the preamble to Decree 259 were false, and there is no basis for finding that whatever Lucchetti argued or adduced, or might have argued or adduced, in regard to the motives behind Decree 259 was, or would have been, disregarded by the Tribunal. Consequently, in this regard the proceedings cannot be considered to have been unfair to Lucchetti. It is true that the Tribunal could also *ex officio* have called for documents or evidence under Article 43 of the ICSID Convention or, alternatively, have joined the preliminary issue to the merits in order to allow its factual basis to be further explored. However, the decision whether or not to proceed in either of these manners was within the Tribunal's discretion and the fact of not doing so does not constitute a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n124.\n\nAs regards the further allegation that Lucchetti's right to presumption of innocence was violated, it is sufficient to point out that the Tribunal did not examine the issue of the alleged illegalities but founded its conclusions on other elements in the preamble to Decree 259. There can therefore be no question of a violation of Lucchetti's right to be presumed innocent of criminal offences.\n\n125.\n\nFor all these reasons and having regard also to Lucchetti's further argumentation on this point, the *Ad hoc* Committee finds that there has been no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*c) Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nLucchetti further alleges that the Tribunal's Award was contradictory and unclear, because the Tribunal had employed legal standards which were inherently contradictory. In Lucchetti's opinion, the reference to standards such as \"real cause\", \"same subject matter\", \"crystallise\" and \"practical matter\" rendered the Award inconsistent, and the use of such inconsistent standards amounted to a failure to state reasons according to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Lucchetti also alleges that the Tribunal failed to deal with some of Lucchetti's contentions. The Republic of Peru contests that the Tribunal's Award was unclear or contradictory or that any of Lucchetti's arguments were left unheeded by the Tribunal.\n\n127.\n\nA description of what the duty to state reasons requires, and what it does not require, is contained in the Annulment Decision in *MINE v. Guinea:*\n\n\"5.08 The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e) because it almost invariably draws an ad hoc Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a ground for annulment.\n\n5.09 In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"26\n\nICSID Case of *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea*, Decision of 22 December 1989.\n\n128.\n\nFrom the Decision on Annulment in the *Vivendi* Case,27 it also appears that annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in clear cases and that a failure to state reasons, in order to lead to annulment, must not only lack in any expressed rationale, but the relevant point must also be necessary to the tribunal's decision.\n\nICSID Case of *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002, para. 65.\n\n129.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee has found above that the Award does not give a full picture of the various elements which should be taken into account for treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention. However, in order to establish whether it was the dispute from 19971998 that continued after the BIT had entered into force, the Tribunal did refer to various standards adopted in international case-law and doctrine and set out the elements which the Tribunal found conclusive. The Committee cannot find in the Tribunal's reasoning any contradiction or lack of precision such as to leave a doubt about the legal or factual elements upon which the Tribunal based its conclusion. Moreover, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal examined all Lucchetti's arguments and finds that it dealt with them in the Award to such an extent and in such a manner as could reasonably be required.\n\n130.\n\nThe *Ad hoc* Committee therefore finds that the Award did not fail to state the reasons on which it was based within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*7.
