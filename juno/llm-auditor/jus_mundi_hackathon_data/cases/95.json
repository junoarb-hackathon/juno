INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case arises out of a dispute between Iskandar Safa and Akram Safa, natural persons having the nationality of Lebanon (the \"**Claimants**\"), and the Hellenic Republic (also the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Greece**,\" and together with the Claimants, the \"**Parties**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute was submitted by the Claimants to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 24 July 1997, which entered into force on 17 July 1999 (the \"**Treaty**\" or the \"**BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute arises out of measures allegedly taken by the Hellenic Republic in relation to\n\nthe Hellenic Shipyards S.A. (\"**HSY**\"), a company owning a shipyard located in Skaramangas, Greece, in which the Claimants are indirect shareholders.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 14 June 2016, the Claimants filed with ICSID an electronic copy of the Request for Arbitration dated 10 June 2016 (the \"**Request**\"), without the accompanying exhibits. On 16 June 2019, ICSID received a hard copy of the Request, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-18 and Legal Authorities CLex 1 through CLex 20.\n\n5.\n\nOn 5 July 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 6 September 2016, the Claimants informed ICSID that they opted for the formula provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In accordance with this provision, the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n7.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, following appointment by the Claimants pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Mr. Klaus Reichert (German/Irish) accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, following appointment by the Respondent pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Professor Brigitte Stern (French) accepted her appointment as arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 October 2016, the Claimants filed a request for the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint the arbitrator not yet appointed pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 December 2016, following appointment by agreement of the Parties, Dr. Veijo Heiskanen (Finnish) accepted his appointment as presiding arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nOn 22 December 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The members of the Tribunal are: Dr. Veijo Heiskanen, a national of Finland, as President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. Klaus Reichert, a national of Germany and Ireland, appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.

The Claimants were also invited to respond to any such additional submission by 22 February 2018.\n\n26.\n\nOn 19 February 2018, the Respondent sent a letter in response to the Tribunal's invitation to provide additional comments.\n\n27.\n\nOn 22 February 2018, the Claimants filed a request for a procedural order on confidentiality, requesting that the Tribunal order the Respondent \"not [to] disclose to the European Commission, whether directly or indirectly through any third Parties, any document or information submitted to the record of the current arbitration including Claimants' Memorial dated 30 October 2017 as well as any other memorials, communications, pleadings, witness statements, expert reports and exhibits, or any summary, excerpt or excerpts thereof.\"\n\n28.\n\nOn 23 February 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants' request by 28 February 2018.\n\n29.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, the Respondent provided its reply objecting to the Claimants' request of 22 February 2018.\n\n30.\n\nOn 5 March 2018, in view of the impending hearing before the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\"), the Tribunal communicated its decision to the Parties, rejecting the Claimants' Request for a Confidentiality Order and indicated that a reasoned decision would follow.\n\n31.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, further to its message of 5 March 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the Claimants' request of 22 February 2018.\n\n32.\n\nHaving considered the Respondent's submission of 23 March 2018 and the Claimants' submission of 28 March 2018, the Tribunal granted the Respondent an extension of time of two weeks to file its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Counter-Memorial on Merits until 23 April 2018.

Whether the Claimants Made an Investment Under the BIT And the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n210.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n214.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n216.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nFor purposes of the Tribunal's subject matter jurisdiction (*ratione materiae*) the relevant provisions are Article 1(1) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Article 1(1) of the BIT provides:\n\n*\"Investment\" means every kind of asset invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the latter's legislation, and in particular, though not exclusively incudes:*\n\n*(a) movable and immovable property and any rights in rem such as servitudes, ususfructus, mortgages, liens or pledges;*\n\n*(b) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company;*\n\n*(c) claims to money or to any performance under contract having an economic value as well as loans connected to an investment;*\n\n*(d) intellectual property rights; and*\n\n*(e) business concessions conferred by law or under contract or by decision of the executive authority in accordance with the law, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.*\n\n*A possible change in the form in which the investment have been made does not affect their character as investment.*\n\n245.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, in turn, provides that the jurisdiction of the Centre \"*shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment*.\" The ICSID Convention does not provide a definition of \"*investment*,\" but there is a consistent arbitral jurisprudence regarding the interpretation of the term. According to this interpretation, an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention involves a contribution of capital in the host State, which in turn implies (indeed by definition once there is a capital contribution) a certain duration and assumption of risk.288\n\n*See* the case law referred to in Cl. Mem., fn. 668.\n\n246.\n\nAs summarized above, the Respondent raises a number of arguments to support its objection that the Claimants have not made an \"*investment*,\" including that the Claimants have not proven that they held a 75.1% shareholding in HSY at all relevant times. According to the Respondent, there were several changes to the ownership structure of HSY, and the Claimants have failed to disclose such changes, although this was required by the Implementation Agreement.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not dispute that the Claimants did acquire indirect ownership in HSY, but complains that the Claimants have failed to account for the changes that have occurred in the ownership structure of HSY. The Tribunal notes that such changes, even if they may not have been fully accounted for, do not change the fact that the Claimants maintained indirect shareholding throughout the relevant period from the date the claims allegedly arose until the registration of the present case by the Secretary-General of the Centre. This is supported by the evidence on record.289 Whether or not the Implementation Agreement required the changes in the ownership of HSY to be notified to the Respondent is not relevant for the determination of whether the Claimants have made an investment for purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and in any event any such obligation was not incumbent on the Claimants but on the parties to the Implementation Agreement. The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent did not previously challenge the Claimants' indirect shareholding in HSY, including in the ICC2 Arbitration.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Share Purchase Agreement between [REDACTED] and Privinvest Shipbuilding S.\u00e0.r.l. concerning the acquisition of a 100% shareholding in [REDACTED] dated 22 September 2010 (**C- 0004**); Official List of Shareholders in [REDACTED] dated 9 September 2010 (**C-0326**); Share Purchase and Transfer Agreement between [REDACTED] and GSNH Concerning the Acquisition of 75.1% of the Shares in HSY dated 22 September 2010 (**C-0327**); HSY's Shareholder Book dated 22 September 2010 (**C-0328**); Share Transfer Agreement between [REDACTED] and Privinvest Shipbuilding S.\u00e0.r.l. regarding 100% of the shares in [REDACTED] dated 22 September 2010 (**C-0329**); Official List of Shareholders in [REDACTED] dated 4 October 2010 (**C-0330**); Certificate from the Commercial Registry in Beirut regarding Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL Holding dated 30 August 2018 (**C-0331**); Certificate from the Commercial Registry in Beirut regarding Privinvest Holding SAL dated 30 August 2018 (**C-0332**); Share Purchase and Transfer Agreement between Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL Holding and Logistics International SAL (Offshore) concerning the acquisition of a 50% shareholding in [REDACTED] dated 5 December 2011 (**C-0333**); Official List of Shareholders in [REDACTED] dated 5 December 2011 (**C-0334**); Certificate from the Commercial Registry in Beirut regarding Logistics International SAL (Offshore) dated 30 August 2018 (**C-0335**); Share Purchase and Transfer Agreement between Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL Holding and Logistics International SAL (Offshore) Concerning the Acquisition of a 30% Shareholding in [REDACTED] dated 28 November 2012 (**C-0336**); Official List of Shareholders in [REDACTED] dated 20 December 2012 (**C- 0337**); Certificate from the Commercial Registry in Beirut regarding Logistics International Holding SAL dated 30 August 2018 (**C-0338**); Share Purchase and Transfer Agreement between Logistics International SAL (Offshore) and Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL Holding Concerning the Acquisition of an 80% Shareholding in 2 [REDACTED] dated 25 February 2015 (**C-0339**); Official List of Shareholders in [REDACTED] dated 23 April 2015 (**C-0340**); and Certificate from the Commercial Registry in Beirut regarding PI DEV SAL Holding dated 7 September 2018 (**C-0341**).\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants must show beneficial interest in HSY since it was ADM and not a Privinvest company that was initially supposed to acquire the shares in HSY. The Tribunal is unable to follow the Respondent's objection. Beneficial ownership is only relevant if a party other than the legal owner wishes to bring a claim; the legal owner need not prove the negative, that is, that a party other than the legal owner is not the beneficial owner.\n\n249.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants' shareholding in HSY does not constitute an investment because the Claimants have not made a contribution of a sufficient duration and also have not assumed any risk. The Tribunal notes that while the purchase price (EUR 1) paid for HSY hardly qualifies as a capital contribution, the Claimants acquired the so-called [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED] and they have also extended, through companies they control, substantial shareholder loans to HSY by way of initial shareholder loans and additional shareholder loans.290 While the amount of the [REDACTED] is not evidenced, and while the precise amounts that were extended by way of the shareholder loans, as well as whether they are sufficiently supported by evidence, are disputed between the Parties,291 the Tribunal considers that there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the Claimants have made a substantial capital contribution of an extended duration and thus have also assumed the risk of losing this contribution in whole or in part. For purposes of determining whether the Claimants have made an investment, the Tribunal need not be in a position to precisely quantify the amount invested, so long as it is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence that a capital contribution has, in fact, been made.\n\nExpert Report of [REDACTED] (**C-0026**), paras. 8.3 and 8.10\u20138.11; Second Expert Report of [REDACTED] (**C-0320**), paras. 13.14\u2013 13.27. *Cf.* [REDACTED] First Report (**R-0020**), paras. 9.10 and 9.19.\n\n*Id.*\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Claimants' shareholding in HSY qualifies as an \"*investment*\" within the meaning of both Article 1(1) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**D. The Impact of the Cooling-Off Period on the Tribunal's Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n265.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent's objection regarding the cooling-off period is based on Article 9 of the BIT, which provides, in relevant part:\n\n*1. Disputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement, in relation to an investment of the former, shall, if possible, be settled by the disputing in an [sic] amicable way.*\n\n*2. If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from [sic] either party requested amicable settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute either to the competent court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made or to international arbitration.*\n\n*Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of such dispute to international arbitration.*\n\n283.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties disagree on whether: (i) Article 9(1) imposes a mandatory requirement for the Parties to seek amicable settlement; (ii) such requirement is a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility; (iii) the Claimants provided sufficient notice of the dispute; (iv) the Claimants complied with the six-months cooling-off period; and (v) it was futile for the Claimants to engage in attempts to settle the dispute amicably.\n\n284.\n\nThe preliminary factual question that arises is whether the Claimants have, in fact, complied with Article 9(1) of the BIT and sought amicable settlement of the dispute. When determining this matter, the Tribunal notes that the parties to the various transactions (in particular the Framework Agreement and the Implementation Agreement), which provide the context in which the present dispute arises, have conducted discussions since at least 2011 to seek a negotiated settlement of the issues that had arisen between them.354 These attempts were not successful, and subsequently, the parties commenced two separate ICC arbitrations to address these issues. These arbitrations arise largely out of the same factual circumstances as the present dispute. While the parties to these negotiations and arbitration proceedings are not formally the same as those to the present proceedings, Mr. Iskandar Safa, the first Claimant, was closely involved in the negotiations, as were the various ministers of the Respondent. Moreover, the claimants in the ICC1 Arbitration also brought claims specifically based on the Treaty, including claims for expropriation and breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.355 Consequently, although the ICC1 tribunal dismissed these claims for lack of jurisdiction, the Respondent was put on notice and was well informed of the existence of treaty claims well before the present case was filed, even though there had been no formal notice of dispute under the BIT. Accordingly, the relevant parties, including the Parties to this arbitration, had ample opportunity to settle all the issues that had arisen between them, including the treaty claims. In the circumstances, even if a formal notice of dispute under the Treaty was never served, it would be unduly formalistic for the Tribunal to conclude that the requirements of Article 9(1) and (2)\u00a0of the BIT have not been met.\n\n*See, e.g.*, the summons sent by HSY and Privinvest Shipbuilding to the Hellenic Republic dated 14 February 2012 (**C-0007**).\n\nAward in the ICC1 Arbitration (**C-0019**), paras. 855\u2013871.\n\n285.\n\nWhile the Claimants also raise in this arbitration complaints that they did not make in the ICC1 Arbitration, such complaints cannot be considered to fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction on that basis alone. They form part of the dispute between the Parties, as it has developed since its inception, and it would be unreasonable and inefficient to require that the Parties seek to negotiate and arbitrate these aspects of the overall dispute separately. The Tribunal notes that other investment treaty tribunals have reached similar conclusions in similar circumstances.356\n\n*Eiser* (**CL-0050**), para. 318; *Metalclad* (**CL-0011**), para. 67.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, considers that the Claimants have complied with the requirements of Article 9(1) and (2) of the BIT. In view of this finding, the Tribunal need not determine whether compliance with these provisions constitutes a jurisdictional requirement, or whether an alleged failure to comply with them should be considered a matter of admissibility.\n\n**E. The Impact of the ICC Proceedings on Admissibility of the Claimants' Claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n287.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent's case is, in substance, that some of the five \"assaults\" out of which the Claimants' claims arise are, at least in part, inadmissible because they are based on contract rather than treaty. According to the Respondent, \"the only claim with respect to which the essential basis of the claim is not contractual is the so-called 'defamation' campaign.\"457 The Claimants deny that any of their claims are essentially contractual and argue that, in any event, the claims are based on treaty, and not on contract, and, therefore have a different legal basis than the claims that the ICC1 claimants pursued in the ICC1 Arbitration.\n\nResp. Reply, para. 56. In its Counter-Memorial (para. 917), the Respondent alleged that \"of the four so-called 'assaults' it is really only the complaint relating to the Special Administration procedure that did not feature prominently in the ICC1 Arbitration.\"\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *Vivendi* annulment committee and the *Pantechniki* tribunal that the applicable standard for purposes of determining whether a claim constitutes a treaty claim or a contract claim, and whether it has already been litigated as a contract claim, is whether the \"essential basis\" of the claim is treaty or contract.458 As noted by the *Pantechniki* tribunal, \"the [t]ribunal must determine whether the claim truly does have an autonomous existence outside the contract.\"459 If this is not the case, the Claimants must live with the consequences of having elected to submit their claims to an ICC tribunal, just as the *Pantechniki* claimant had to live with the consequences of having elected to take its grievance to the national courts.460\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment (**RL-0053**), para. 98; *Pantechniki* (**CL-0041**), paras. 61 *et seq*.\n\n*Pantechniki* (**CL-0041**), para. 64.\n\n*Pantechniki* (**CL-0041**), para. 64.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal must, therefore, determine whether the Claimants' claims are treaty claims or contract claims, and, whether they have already been litigated as contract claims, in relation to all of the five alleged assaults on the Claimants' investments out of which the Claimants' claims arise. According to the Claimants, these five assaults are:\n\n(a) Deprivation of income: The Respondent allegedly deprived HSY of all sources of income by failing to pay under the Archimedes and Neptune II Programs, by failing to place further orders by the Hellenic Navy, and by frustrating HSY's chances of obtaining foreign navy work;\n\n(b) Deprivation of assets: The Respondent allegedly deprived HSY of all its assets as a result of a number of acts taken by the Respondent and entities controlled by it;\n\n(c) Takeover of control: The Respondent allegedly took over the shipyard and excluded the Claimants from the use and management of the shipyard;\n\n(d) Special Administration: The Respondent allegedly imposed a Special Administration on HSY in order to take the legal title to the shipyard; and\n\n(e) Defamation campaign: The Respondent allegedly engaged in a defamation campaign against the Claimants and their group of companies.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the Claimants' claims, to the extent that they are based on these five sets of facts, separately below.\n\n***a. Deprivation of Income***\n------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, when they acquired HSY, they were aware that HSY had two large submarine programs (Archimedes and Neptune II), but that they would not be able to work on civil shipbuilding orders for a period of fifteen years, due to the Military Decision. The only potential sources of income were therefore work for the Hellenic Navy, including the two existing programs (Archimedes and Neptune II), and for foreign navies. According to the Claimants, the Respondent, however, cut off HSY from all income by stopping payments under the Archimedes and Neptune II Programs, by failing to place further orders through the Hellenic Navy and by thwarting HSY's chances of obtaining foreign navy work.\n\n334.\n\nIn the ICC1 Arbitration, the ICC1 claimants made claims for payments under the Archimedes (Claim 1) and Neptune II (Claim 2) Programs, as well as for failure to provide promised work, including both for the Hellenic Navy and foreign navies (Claim 5).461 Under Claim 1, the ICC1 claimants claimed EUR 75.5 million plus interest corresponding to the allegedly outstanding contract price in connection with the construction of the three submarines (*Pipinos*, *Matrozos* and *Katsonis*) under the Archimedes Program.462 Claim 1 was granted in full by the ICC1 tribunal.463 Under Claim 2, the ICC1 claimants claimed EUR 882.75 million plus interest corresponding to the allegedly outstanding contract price in connection with the construction of submarines 5 and 6, the construction of which had not started, under the Neptune II Program, as well as for the value of \"excess materials\" supplied in connection with the program (which became unnecessary as the parties agreed to build two new submarines instead of modernizing two old submarines), in the amount of EUR 15 million plus interest.464 The ICC1 tribunal granted Claim 2 in part, awarding the ICC1 claimants EUR 64.5 million, plus interest, representing outstanding instalments in connection with the construction of submarines 5 and 6.465 The ICC1 tribunal further granted the ICC1 claimants' claim for excess materials, in the amount of EUR 15 million, plus interest.466 Under Claim 5, the ICC1 claimants argued that the Respondent was liable for breach of contract for failing to award HSY promised work, and claimed EUR 105,536,000 in compensation.467 This claim was dismissed by the ICC1 tribunal.468\n\nClaim 3 was a claim for declaratory relief that HSY had lawfully suspended its obligations arising under the Main Contracts, and that the Hellenic Republic was liable to indemnify and hold HSY harmless of its obligation to provide insurance payments for and maintenance works on the submarines built under the Archimedes and Neptune II Programs (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1361\u20131374). The ICC1 tribunal granted the claim for the former declaration, but not for the latter (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1424\u20131426).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 954\u2013962.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1074\u20131075, 1084\u20131092, 2216(5)\u2013(6).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1093\u20131099, 1163\u20131165. No claim was made for *Okeanos*, for which HSY carried out 80% of the repair work and was paid for this work in full; *Okeanos* was eventually included in the Finalization Agreement and the remaining work was completed by the Hellenic Navy.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1327\u20131335, 2216(7)\u2013 (8).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1357\u20131359, 2216(10)\u2013 (12).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1635\u20131654.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1661\u20131746, 2216(15).\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' claim for deprivation of income in this ICSID arbitration is based on the very same facts as the ICC1 claimants' Claims 1, 2 and 5 in the ICC1 Arbitration. While the claimants in the two arbitrations are not the same, and while the claims in the ICC1 Arbitration were based on breach of contract, the claims are in substance for compensation of the same loss. Accordingly, the essential basis of the Claimants' claims in this ICSID arbitration, to the extent that they are based on the alleged deprivation of income, is the same as that of contractual Claims 1, 2 and 5 brought by the ICC1 claimants in the ICC1 Arbitration. The Claimants' claims must therefore be considered, in substance, contract claims that have already been adjudicated. Consequently, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent's objection and dismisses the Claimants' claims as inadmissible insofar as they are based on the alleged loss of revenue.\n\n336.\n\nIn view of this conclusion, the Tribunal need not consider whether these claims also constitute an abuse of process.\n\n***b. Deprivation of Assets***\n------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent deprived HSY of all of its assets by (i) subjecting HSY to substantial claims from OSE, a State-owned railway company, and from tax authorities, despite the Respondent's promise that the Claimants would acquire a \"clean\" shipyard; (ii) excluding the Privinvest Group from any possibility of reacquiring the Concessionary Land, including Dock No. 5; (iii) issuing two illegal Acts of Imputation against HSY; and (iv) harassing HSY's senior management by initiating numerous criminal investigations against them, thereby depriving HSY of its \"human assets.\"\n\n338.\n\nIn the ICC1 Arbitration, the ICC1 claimants claimed that the Respondent failed to disclose to Privinvest that OSE was planning to sue HSY for over EUR 327 million (Claim 6);469 that the Respondent was in breach of the Implementation Agreement and obligated to reimburse HSY for the extraordinary contribution assessed by Greek tax authorities after the conclusion of the Implementation Agreement (Claim 7);470 that the Respondent was obliged to ensure that a Privinvest group company could reacquire the Dry-Dock Concession and that HSY could be granted the use of Dock No. 5 by a Privinvest group company (Claim 4.2);471 and that the amounts set out in the Acts of Imputation, in the amount of EUR 247 million, were not owed by HSY (Ancillary Claim 2).472 Claim 6 and Ancillary Claim 2 were granted by the ICC1 tribunal,473 whereas Claims 4.2 and 7 were dismissed.474\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1747\u20131755.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1824\u20131848.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1610\u20131622. In Claim 4.1, the ICC1 claimants claimed that the Hellenic Republic was responsible for mishandling the EU State aid case and claimed compensation (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1427\u20131454). The ICC1 tribunal found the respondent was in breach of the Framework Agreement and the Implementation Agreement, but dismissed the claim for compensation for lack of causation. As the claimants did not seek a declaratory relief, Claim 4.1 was dismissed (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1631\u20131634).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 2019\u20132035.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1822\u20131823 and 2216(16) (Claim 6), 2086 and 2216(22) (Ancillary Claim 2).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1632 and 2216(14) (Claim 4.2), 1976 and 2216(17) (Claim 7).\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' claims, to the extent they arise out of the alleged deprivation of assets, are, largely based on the same facts as the ICC1 claimants' Claims 4.2, 6, 7 and Ancillary Claim 2 in the ICC1 Arbitration. Accordingly, the essential basis of the Claimants' claims in this ICSID arbitration, to the extent that they arise out of the alleged deprivation of assets, is the same as that of contractual Claims 4.2, 6, 7 and Ancillary Claim 2, brought by the ICC1 claimants in the ICC1 Arbitration. To that extent, the Claimants' claims must, therefore, be considered, in substance, contract claims that have already been adjudicated. They are, therefore, inadmissible in this ICSID arbitration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not consider whether these claims also constitute an abuse of process.\n\n340.\n\nThe sole claim made by the Claimants in this ICSID arbitration in relation to the alleged deprivation of assets that was not raised in the ICC1 Arbitration is the allegation that the Respondent harassed HSY's senior management, thereby depriving HSY of its \"human assets.\" The Tribunal will address this allegation below, when considering the merits of the Claimants' claims.\n\n***c. Taking of Control over the Shipyard***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent took *de facto* control over the Skaramangas shipyard by using HSY's facilities, equipment and employees for \"free of charge\" works on numerous Hellenic Navy vessels, by taking materials from HSY's warehouses without any payment for them, by imposing a new organizational structure regarding the management of HSY to the exclusion of HSY's board of directors, and by representing itself as the owner of the shipyard to the outside world.\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Hellenic Navy ever assumed *de facto* control over the shipyard and argues that the use of the shipyard by the Hellenic Navy was based on the Finalization Agreement, which authorized the Hellenic Navy to use the shipyard to complete the works on the four submarines referred to in the Implementation Agreement. According to the Respondent, to the extent the claims relating to the Finalization Agreement were not addressed in the ICC1 Arbitration, they (and their economic consequences) will be addressed in the ICC2 Arbitration, where the ICC1 claimants (as ICC2 respondents) have advanced a counterclaim amounting to approximately EUR 36 million for the alleged unlawful use of HSY's facilities by the Hellenic Navy.475\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 825.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, although the parties to the ICC1 Arbitration did not make any specific claims in that arbitration in relation to the Finalization Agreement, the ICC1 tribunal found that \"[n]either HSY nor the Republic have ever doubted that the Finalization Agreement was validly entered into and created enforceable obligations.\"476 The Implementation Agreement was never amended to reflect the terms of the Finalization Agreement, but the Respondent subsequently enacted a law, Law 4258/2014, which included a provision (Article 26) that dealt with the finalization of the four submarines (*Pipinos*, *Matrozos* and *Katsonis* under the Archimedes Program and *Okeanos* under the Neptune II Program) that were subject to the Finalization Agreement. The ICC1 tribunal concluded that under the Finalization Agreement, \"HSY was freed from its obligation to construct and deliver the vessels in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon in the Archimedes Contract,\" and that this obligation \"was substituted by a new obligation, that of promptly delivering the Submarines in an 'as is' condition (*i.e.*, in a stage of completion of between 80% and 90%) to the Hellenic Navy, and supporting the Hellenic Navy in its efforts to finalize construction at its own cost and risk.\"477 The ICC1 tribunal further found that the Respondent's obligation to pay the outstanding purchase price had not been extinguished by novation, which led it to grant Claim 1 in an amount (EUR 75.5 million) representing the outstanding price under the Archimedes Contract, as noted above.478\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1016.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1020\u20131021.\n\nSubmarine *Okeanos*, which was part of the Neptune II Program, was also included in the Finalization Agreement and accordingly, its construction was finalized by the Hellenic Navy at its own cost and risk. However, the ICC1 claimants made no claim regarding *Okeanos* as the Respondent paid for it in full (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1166).\n\n344.\n\nHowever, the ICC1 tribunal also noted that \"[t]he Finalization Agreement does not address the precise economic consequences of this highly complex amendment, further to stating the general principle that the Navy will finalize the Submarines at its own cost and risk.\"479 The ICC1 tribunal went on to state:\n\n*The Parties have not addressed this issue at all in this arbitration. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the avoidance of unjustified enrichment may require that the economic consequences of the Finalization Agreement (including the compensation in favour of the Yard for the services provided, if any, and the compensation in favour of the Republic for the back-charges accrued, if any) be adjudicated \u2013 but this arbitration is not the proper forum to do so, since the Parties have failed to address the issue.*480\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1040.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1040.\n\n345.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' claims in this ICSID arbitration, to the extent that they arise out of the alleged takeover of the shipyard, are in part based on the same facts as the ICC1 claimants' Claims 1 and 2 in the ICC1 Arbitration. While the Claimants disagree with some of the findings of the ICC1 tribunal (in particular insofar as the tribunal's rulings on these claims gave effect to the Finalization Agreement), they are also, alternatively, based on those findings. Accordingly, the essential basis of the Claimants' claims in this ICSID arbitration, to the extent that they arise out of the alleged takeover of the shipyard pursuant to the Finalization Agreement, is the same as the basis of the ICC1 tribunal's findings on the claimants' contractual Claims 1 and 2 in the ICC1 Arbitration. This is the case regardless of whether the Claimants disagree or, alternatively, agree with the ICC1 tribunal's findings as to the validity of the Finalization Agreement. To that extent (but *only* to that extent), the Claimants' claims, therefore, have already been, in substance, adjudicated and are, as such, inadmissible.\n\n346.\n\nHowever, as noted by the ICC1 tribunal, the economic consequences of the Finalization Agreement were not resolved in the ICC1 Arbitration and instead form part of the subject matter of the ICC2 Arbitration. To the extent that such claims arise directly out of the Finalization Agreement, they are, in substance, contractual claims and this ICSID Tribunal has no jurisdiction over such claims. What does fall within the jurisdiction of this ICSID Tribunal is the Claimants' claims arising out of the alleged takeover of the shipyard, to the extent such claims are not directly based on the Finalization Agreement or its financial consequences, but on subsequent events that took place after the conclusion of the Finalization Agreement and were not considered in the ICC1 Arbitration. The Tribunal will address these events when dealing with the merits of the Claimants' claims.\n\n***d. Special Administration***\n-------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent took over the legal title of the shipyard by appointing, on 8 March 2017, a Special Administrator, who is now in charge and tasked with selling the shipyard to a new owner. According to the Claimants, the Respondent is misusing the Recovery Decision to force HSY into bankruptcy.\n\n348.\n\nWhile the Respondent acknowledges that \"the only assault that did not feature prominently in the ICC1 proceedings is the Claimants' claims in relation to the Special Administration,\" it argues that \"the essential basis of this claim is contractual, as demonstrated by the fact that the Claimants now seek to argue that when HSY was placed in Special Administration, the Respondent breached its contractual obligations.\"481 The Respondent further notes that \"HSY has brought the very same claim as a contractual claim in the ICC2 proceedings, arguing that by initiating the Special Administration the Hellenic Republic breached its contractual obligations.\"482\n\nResp. Reply, para. 55(b) (referring to Cl. Reply, para. 1616).\n\nResp. Reply, para. 55(b) (referring to HSY's Updated Statement of Counterclaim (**R-0295**)).\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, the placement of the shipyard under Special Administration was not an issue in the ICC1 Arbitration. Accordingly, while the Claimants' claims in the present arbitration, insofar as they arise out of the Special Administration may raise contractual issues, such claims cannot be considered inadmissible on the sole basis of having also been raised in the ICC2 Arbitration, which is not yet completed. The Tribunal will, therefore, the address the issue of whether any such claims qualify as treaty or contract claims on the merits.\n\n***e. Defamation Campaign***\n----------------------------\n\n350.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Claimants' claims, to the extent that they arise out of the alleged defamation campaign, are not contractual and were not raised in the ICC1 Arbitration. Indeed, the Respondent states that \"the only claim with respect to which the essential basis of the claim is not contractual is the so-called 'defamation' campaign.\"483\n\n*See* Resp. Reply, paras. 55\u201356.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimants' claims, to the extent that they arise out of the alleged defamation campaign, are admissible in the present proceedings.\n\n**F. Admissibility of the Claims Based on the** ***M****onetary** **G****old*** **Principle**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n352.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined above that the Claimants' claims, to the extent they arise out of the alleged deprivation of HSY of its income and assets, are inadmissible. Since the Parties' arguments relating to the applicability of the *Monetary Gold* principle relate to the application and interpretation of the European Commission's Recovery Decision and Military Decision, and therefore are only relevant to the Claimants' claims insofar as they arise out of the alleged deprivation of income and assets, the Parties' arguments have no bearing on the issues that remain to be decided by the Tribunal. The Tribunal, therefore, does not find it necessary, as a matter of judicial (or arbitral) economy, to make any determinations on the issue.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal merely notes, in this connection, that one of the claims (Claim 4) raised by the claimants in the ICC1 Arbitration was based on the alleged mishandling by the Hellenic Republic of the State aid issue, in breach of its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants under the Framework Agreement and the Implementation Agreement. The ICC1 tribunal found that the Hellenic Republic had breached Clause 11 of the Framework Agreement and Clause D.5 of the Implementation Agreement \"by not securing a Military Decision which authorizes HSY to export war ships to foreign navies,\"556 while dismissing the further claim that HSY had been improperly prevented from reacquiring the Dry-Dock Concession.557\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para.1631.\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1632. As noted above, Claim 4 was eventually dismissed as the claimants did not seek declaratory relief, and the claim for damages was dismissed for lack of causation between the Hellenic Republic's breach and the damage allegedly suffered by HSY (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 1633\u20131634).\n\n**G. The Admissibility of Claims Under the Umbrella Clause**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nThe Claimants' umbrella clause claim is based on Article 10(2) of the BIT, which provides that \"*[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments, in its territory, of investors of the other Contracting Party.\"*\n\n426.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the clause is \"worded broadly and covers all breaches of obligations of the host State towards the investor or its investment.\"654 According to the Claimants, they therefore need not be parties to the contractual obligations in the Framework and Implementation Agreements on which the umbrella clause claim is ultimately based. In any event, according to the Claimants, the Respondent has frustrated the ICC1 Award by having challenged it and by having placed HSY under Special Administration. The Respondent contends that the Claimants' umbrella clause claim amounts to an abuse of process and is also inadmissible because it is in substance the same claim as the claims brought by the claimants in the ICC1 Arbitration under the arbitration clauses contained in the Framework and Implementation Agreements.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 588.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the Claimants' umbrella clause claim is based on the Respondent's alleged failure to comply with its obligations under the Framework and Implementation Agreements, including (i) its obligation under Article 11 *lit. a* of the Framework Agreement and Article 5, Section D of the Implementation Agreement to resolve the State aid issue in a manner that would not require HSY pay back the State aid it had received and not to take measures that would undermine HSY's viability; (ii) its promise to resolve the State aid issue in a manner that would ensure HSY's ability to work for foreign navies; (iii) its obligation to comply with the payment schedule under Article 6 of the Main Contracts; (iv) its promise to award further work (the MEKOS and MACHITIS programs) to HSY; (v) its promise that a company belonging to the Privinvest Group would be able to reacquire the concession for parts of the Concessionary Land; (vi) its obligation under the Implementation Agreement regarding taxation of HSY for past fiscal years; and (vii) its promise that the Claimants would be acquiring HSY free from hidden liabilities.655\n\nCl. Mem., para. 592. *See also* the Claimants' Opening Statement, pp. 248\u2013251.\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that claims arising out of these alleged breaches were also submitted to the ICC1 Arbitration. As discussed above, (i) Claim 4 in the ICC1 Arbitration arose out of the Hellenic Republic's alleged failure to handle the State aid issue in accordance with its obligation under the Framework and Implementation Agreements to ensure the possibility of foreign navy work; (ii) Claim 5 arose out of the Hellenic Republic's alleged failure to respect its promise to provide future work; (iii) Claims 1 and 2 arose out of the ICC1 respondent's alleged failure to comply with its payment obligations under the Main Contracts; (iv) Claim 4.2 related to the Hellenic Republic's alleged failure to ensure the reacquisition of parts of the Concessionary Land; (v) Claim 7 was for damages due to a breach of contract for the imposition of the Special Contribution; and (vi) Claim 6 arose out of the Hellenic Republic's alleged failure to disclose the OSE claims.\n\n429.\n\nThus, all of the Claimants' umbrella clause claims in this arbitration were also raised in the ICC1 Arbitration, with the exception, in part, of one claim \u2013 the allegation that the Hellenic Republic failed to comply with its obligation under the Framework and Implementation Agreements not to take measures that would undermine HSY's viability. According to the Claimants, instead of complying with this obligation, the Hellenic Republic \"demanded payment and ultimately seized assets owned by HSY in order to enforce the Recovery Decision, thus seeking to take the legal title to the shipyard.\"656 While the allegation that the Hellenic Republic mishandled the State aid issue, insofar as it concerned the alleged failure of the Hellenic Republic to ensure the possibility of HSY to work for foreign navies and to ensure the reacquisition of parts of the Concessionary Land, were raised in both the ICC1 Arbitration and this ICSID arbitration, the issue of the enforcement of the Recovery Decision (and the subsequent placement of HSY under Special Administration) was not raised in the ICC1 Arbitration; however, it has been raised in this ICSID arbitration.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 592 (second bullet).\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal has held above that, to the extent that the essential basis of the Claimants' claims in this ICSID arbitration is the same as that of the contractual claims brought by the ICC1 claimants, such claims must be considered, in substance, contract claims that have already been adjudicated and thus inadmissible. This finding applies to all of the Claimants' claims brought under the umbrella clause, except for the one claim noted in paragraph 429 above, relating to the enforcement of the Recovery Decision and the subsequent placement of HSY under Special Administration. This claim has also been raised by the Claimants as an alleged breach of investment protection standards other than the umbrella clause and accordingly will be addressed by the Tribunal in Section VI below, in connection with the merits of the Claimants' claims.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with the Claimants' argument that the Respondent has frustrated the ICC1 Award below, in connection with the Respondent's objection that the Claimants' claim for frustration of the ICC1 Award, which was only raised in the Claimants' Reply, is a new claim that is not permitted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**H.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe relevant provisions in determining whether the Claimants' ancillary claim is allowed are ICSID Arbitration Rules 40(1) and (2), which provide:\n\n*(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.*\n\n*(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.*\n\n442.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's objection raises the preliminary issue of whether the Claimants' allegation that the Respondent has frustrated the ICC1 Award amounts to an ancillary claim at all, or whether it should, rather, be considered a new factual allegation in support of an existing claim. Indeed, the Claimants have not alleged, in connection with their ancillary claim, any new breach of an investment protection standard contained in the Treaty that they had not already raised in their Memorial; what the Claimants have raised in their Reply is a new factual allegation that was not previously raised in the Claimants' Memorial. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to resolve this issue as the Claimants' new claim in any event meets the requirements of Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n443.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the Claimants' new claim falls within the scope of the consent of the Parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre, as required by Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. It is also undisputed that the new claim was submitted timely, in the Claimants' Reply. The remaining question is whether the Claimants' new claim arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute, as required by Rule 40(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants had raised claims based on the placement of HSY in Special Administration in their Memorial, alleging that this amounted to both a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and an expropriation.681 In their new claim, the Claimants now allege that the Special Administration frustrates the ICC1 Award as any proceeds that the Claimants may recover through their enforcement efforts will be paid to the Special Administrator. Accordingly, the Claimants would not benefit from any such payments. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Claimants' new claim arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute and is admissible.\n\nCl.

The claims that remain to be determined by the Tribunal are those arising out of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) Claims arising out of the alleged deprivation of HSY of its human assets as a result of the Respondent's harassment of HSY's senior management;\n\n(b) Claims arising out of the alleged takeover of the Skaramangas shipyard, to the extent they are not based on the Finalization Agreement;\n\n(c) Claims arising out of the Special Administration, including the claim for frustration of the ICC1 Award, insofar as they qualify as treaty claims; and\n\n(d) Claims arising out of the alleged defamation campaign.\n\n613.\n\nThe Tribunal will determine the Claimants' FET claims insofar as they arise out of the above circumstances and are thus admissible before the Tribunal.\n\n614.\n\nThe Claimants' FET claims are based on Article 2(3) of the BIT, which provides that \"*[i]nvestments by investors of a Contracting party shall, at all times, be accorded fair and equitable treatment*.\" As summarized above, the Claimants argue that the Respondent breached the FET standard by failing to act in good faith and by frustrating the Claimants' legitimate expectations regarding HSY.1017\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 534-556; Cl. Reply, paras. 1468-1565.\n\n***a. The alleged takeover of the shipyard***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls at the outset that the ICC1 tribunal determined that the Finalization Agreement of 25 February 2014, which authorized the Hellenic Navy to use the shipyard to complete the works on the four submarines (*Pipinos*, *Matrozos* and *Katsonis* under the Archimedes Program and *Okeanos* under the Neptune II Program), was valid and created enforceable obligations.1018 According to the ICC1 tribunal:\n\n*Neither HSY nor the Republic have ever doubted that the Finalization Agreement was validly entered into and created enforceable obligations. This is confirmed by the fact that the parties actually complied with the obligations assumed thereunder: - The Hellenic Navy took over and successfully completed the construction of the Three Archimedes Submarines; it did (or should have done) so at its own cost and risk, using the facilities owned by HSY; it has also used the workforce of HSY, and the subcontractors with whom HSY had been working (including HDW); - HSY authorized the Navy to enter its premises, and facilitated the use of the Yard, of its workforce and of its sub-contractors, so that the Navy could finalize construction of the Archimedes Submarines*.1019\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1016. The ICC1 tribunal determined that the agreement was reached orally, at a meeting held on 25 February 2014 between Mr. Iskandar Safa and [REDACTED] and Minister of Development [REDACTED] and then recorded in an email from Mr. Safa (ICC1 Award (**C-0019**), paras. 600\u2013 601). [REDACTED] replied to Mr. Safa's letter, insofar as it addressed the completion of the works, on 13 March 2014 (**C-0127**).\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1016.\n\n616.\n\nHowever, the Implementation Agreement was never amended to reflect the terms of the Finalization Agreement, and as the ICC1 tribunal noted, \"[t]he Finalization Agreement does not address the precise economic consequences of this highly complex amendment, further to stating the general principle that the Navy will finalize the Submarines at its own cost and risk.\"1020\n\nICC1 Award (**C-0019**), para. 1040.\n\n617.\n\nA few weeks after the conclusion of the Finalization Agreement, on 4 April 2014, the Respondent enacted Law 4258/2014. Article 26 of Law 4258/2014 dealt with the finalization of the four submarines that were subject to the Finalization Agreement. Article 26 provides as follows:\n\n*1) In respect of S/Ms 'PIPINOS,' 'MATROZOS,' 'KATSONIS' and 'OKEANOS,' which are the property of the HR and are currently located at the facilities of HSY, HR assigns to HN, by virtue of the title and possession it has over such S/Ms, the completion of all construction works and testing necessary for the certification of the S/Ms and their operational integration in the fleet, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 2 through 7.*\n\n*2) The works necessary for the completion of construction of the S/Ms shall be carried out at the facilities of HSY, where same are located as at this date, by members of the HN, the employees of HSY and any sub-contractors required. All necessary facilities, infrastructures and equipment of HSY shall be used by HN free of charge.*\n\n*3) HN shall contract with the employees of HSY for the purpose of the latter rendering the services required until completion of the S/Ms and their operational integration in the fleet. HN shall pay the monthly remuneration to be agreed with each employee, plus the applicable social security contributions, in consideration of the services to be provided. No employment relationship shall be established between the such employees and the HN under the relevant agreements, while HSY shall not be subrogated by HN in any of its obligations in respect of any of the employees existing claims against HSY. The employees shall maintain their existing employment relationship with HSY and all rights arising there from. The relationship between the HN and the employees shall be automatically terminated upon the completion of the construction of the S/Ms.*\n\n*4) HN is hereby authorised to enter into with any third-party suppliers and subcontractors, who were originally contracted with HSY and have already executed similar works on the S/Ms, such other agreements as may be necessary for compliance with all applicable technical specifications and certification requirements of the S/Ms.*\n\n*5) Any payments for the completion of the construction of the S/Ms as per paragraphs 1-4 hereof shall be effected by HN as of the date of entry into force hereof, in accordance to the applicable audit regulations, up to the amount of 75.5 Mio Euros, which is already registered in the budget of the Ministry of National Defence.*\n\n*6) Law 3885/2010 shall remain in force for any matters not regulated hereunder.*\n\n*7) Subject to the terms hereof, the Ministry of National Defence shall have no power to handle matters relating to Skaramangas Shipyards.*\n\n618.\n\nThe Claimants rely in support of their FET claim in particular on Article 26(1) of the Law, which provides that, pursuant to the Law, \"HR assigns to HN, by virtue of the title and possession it has over such S/Ms, the completion of all construction works and testing necessary for the certification of the S/Ms and their operational integration in the fleet.\" Furthermore, according to Article 26(2), \"[t]he works necessary for the completion of construction of the S/Ms shall be carried out at the facilities of HSY, where same are located as at this date, by members of the HN, the employees of HSY and any sub-contractors required.\" While Article 26(5) further provides that \"[a]ny payments for the completion of the construction of the S/Ms as per paragraphs 1-4 hereof shall be effected by HN as of the date of entry into force hereof, in accordance to the applicable audit regulations,\" the provision remains silent on the relationship between HSY and the Hellenic Republic, save that the last sentence of Article 26(2) provides that \"[a]ll necessary facilities, infrastructures and equipment of HSY shall be used by HN free of charge.\"\n\n619.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the interpretation of this last sentence. The Claimants submit that, \"[t]hrough this provision, the Hellenic Republic deprived Claimants of the use of and control over their investment, transferring both to the Hellenic Navy.\"1021 According to the Claimants, Article 26(2), *in fine*, thus amounts to a breach of Article 2(3) of the BIT since it allows HSY's only customer to use the shipyard free of charge. The Respondent argues that the provision only regulates the relationship between the Hellenic Republic and the Hellenic Navy. In other words, the provision confirms that the State will not charge the Hellenic Navy for the use of the shipyard.1022\n\nCl. PHB, para. 2135.\n\nResp. C-Mem. para. 821; Resp. Rej., para. 253.\n\n620.\n\nIn order to determine the legal effect of Article 26, and whether its implementation amounts to a breach of the FET standard under the BIT, the Tribunal must consider the entire factual context of the matter.\n\n621.\n\nOn 11 April 2014, a week after the enactment of Law 4258/2014, [REDACTED], Chairman and CEO of HSY, wrote to [REDACTED], complaining that \"despite our request for a full form agreement the Hellenic Republic is again resorting to legislation to enforce its position on a private company and to go further in such legislation than was agreed to by HSY.\"1023 [REDACTED] stated that the Law did not reflect the agreement reached between HSY and the Hellenic Republic, and reiterated HSY's request for a full form contract. On 10 May 2014, [REDACTED] wrote a further letter, again complaining about the Law and the proposed draft agreements between the Hellenic Navy and HSY's employees, stating that \"HSY never agreed that any costs or responsibility would be borne by it.\"1024\n\nLetter from HSY to [REDACTED] dated 11 April 2014 (**C-0088**).\n\nLetter from HSY to [REDACTED] dated 10 May 2014 (**C-0089**).\n\n622.\n\nOn 14 May 2014, the Hellenic Navy wrote to HSY, informing HSY of the consequences of Law 4258/2014.1025 The letter set out, *inter alia*, a new communication and command lines schedule and requesting that all organizational changes regarding the Archimedes and Neptune II Programs be made with prior notice to the Navy and subject to mutual agreement.\n\nFax from the Hellenic Navy General Staff to HSY dated 14 May 2014 (**C-0107**).\n\n623.\n\nOn 23 June 2015, Mr Iskandar Safa wrote to Prime Minister Samaras, referring to the Finalization Agreement and stating that \"[t[his agreement reached obviously needed a comprehensive and full form document to properly protect both parties \u2013 however I am informed by our management that HSY's wishes in this regard were ignored and a law was passed in the Hellenic Republic's parliament which also ignored the explicit terms of the written agreement.\"1026 There is no response to this letter in the record.\n\nLetter from Mr. Iskandar Safa to Prime Minister A. Samaras dated 23 June 2014 (**R-0138**).\n\n624.\n\nOn 4 December 2015, the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, in its capacity as a supervising authority of shipbuilding activities and the competent authority in matters relating to recovery of State aid, sent a letter to HSY, inviting HSY to pay the recovery amount quantified in the letter, together with interest, within 30 days of the date of service.1027 In the absence of payment, the Ministry would take measures to collect the outstanding amount in accordance with the law governing the collection of public revenues. On 11 March 2016 the Greek authorities issued a notice of indebtedness,1028 and on 12 October 2017, the Ministry of Finance and the [REDACTED] applied to the Athens courts, requesting the appointment of a Special Administrator.1029 On 8 March 2018, the Athens courts placed HSY in Special Administration and appointed a Special Administrator for HSY.1030 These proceedings are still ongoing.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism to HSY dated 4 December 2015 (**C-0013**).\n\nIndividual Notice of Indebtedness dated 11 March 2016 (**C-0132**).\n\nApplication for Special Administration dated 12 October 2017 (**C-0159**).\n\nSingle Member First Instance Court of Athens judgment no. 725/2018 on special administration (**R-0162**).\n\n625.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, while HSY and the Hellenic Navy agreed in the Finalization Agreement that the Hellenic Navy could use the shipyard to complete the works on the four submarines, the essential terms of the arrangement, including the compensation to be paid for the use of the shipyard, were never agreed. Indeed, as noted above, Law 4258/2014 authorized the Hellenic Navy to use the shipyard \"free of charge.\" While the Respondent argues that the clause merely means that the Hellenic Navy is not required to make any payments to the Hellenic Republic, the context of the clause suggests that it addresses the relationship between HSY and the Hellenic Navy.1031 In any event, even if the Respondent's interpretation were to be adopted, it is undisputed that there is no agreement between the Parties regarding the terms of the payment, and that the Respondent has not made any payments.\n\nLaw 4258/2014 (**C-0011**) (\"The works necessary for the completion of construction of the S/Ms shall be carried out at the facilities of HSY, where same are located as at this date, by members of the HN, the-employees of HSY and any sub-contractors required. All necessary facilities, infrastructures and equipment of HSY shall be used by HN free of charge.\") *See also* Explanatory Report to Law 4258/2014 (**R-0237**).\n\n626.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, while there was an agreement between HSY and the Hellenic Republic regarding the use of the shipyard for the completion of the works on the four submarines (although not necessarily a full-fledged \"contract\" within the meaning of Greek law), the Respondent, instead of negotiating the terms of the agreement with HSY, promulgated Law 4258/2014 to give effect to the agreement. In the circumstances, the Hellenic Republic did not act as a contractual counterparty, but exercised its sovereign powers to give effect to the Finalization Agrement. Accordingly, it acted in its sovereign capacity and its conduct is governed by the Treaty, including the obligation under the Treaty to treat the Claimants' investments in HSY in a fair and equitable manner. The fact that there may be contractual dispute or disputes between the parties, or that the parties may not be able to agree on the modalities of implementation of the Finalization Agreement, is not a justification for a Contracting State to use its sovereign powers to resolve the matter unilaterally and in a manner that effectively frustrates the Claimants' legitimate expectation to fair and equitable treatment of their investment. The fact that the ICC2 claimants have brought a counterclaim in the ICC2 Arbitration for costs relating to the takeover of the shipyard1032 is not determinative, for two reasons: first, because the counterclaim has not yet been decided; and second, there is no risk of double compensation as the Claimants would not benefit from any favorable award that HSY might be able to obtain in the ICC2 Arbitration as it has been placed in Special Administration (*see* section b. below). Moreover, and in any event, the ICC2 tribunal should be expected to take into account any award that this ICSID Tribunal makes in the Claimants' favor, just as this Tribunal has taken into account the decisions taken by the ICC1 tribunal.\n\nHSY's Updated Statement of Counterclaim, 2 February 2018 (**R-0295**), Section B.\n\n627.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal determines that, when resorting to its sovereign powers to enforce the Finalization Agreement, without seeking to negotiate an agreement on its essential terms, and without compensating HSY for the use of the shipyard, the Respondent breached the FET standard under the Treaty.\n\n***b. The alleged takeover of HSY's assets through the Special Administration***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimants contend that the placement of HSY in Special Administration in March 2018 constitutes a breach of the FET standard for a number of reasons. The Claimants contend that the Special Administration amounts to coercion and harassment and is thus in bad faith and in breach of the FET standard; that it is not justified for the purposes of enforcing the Recovery Decision because it does not distinguish between military and civil assets; and that the Hellenic Republic abusively seeks to ensure that the legal requirements for Special Administration will be met by not paying what it owes to HSY and by allegedly interfering with HSY's attempts to assign its claims against the Hellenic Republic to [REDACTED]. According to the Claimants, the Respondent is also using the Special Administration to frustrate the ICC1 Award.\n\n629.\n\nThe Respondent denies any wrongdoing and contends that the Special Administration was the only way for the Greek Government to enforce the Recovery Decision and comply with its obligations under European law.1033 The Respondent notes that, at the time, the European Commission had commenced infringement proceedings against the Hellenic Republic for failure to enforce the Recovery Decision.1034 The Respondent further asserts that, contrary to the Claimants' allegations, HSY's military assets will not be used to satisfy the State aid claim, although they could be used to satisfy the claims of creditors such as [REDACTED] and employees which could enforce their claims against such assets.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 1054. *See* European Commission's Observations, para. 58.\n\nThe Commission had referred the matter to CJEU on 22 February 2017. *See* Resp. Rej., para. 592; Resp. C-Mem., paras. 399-400.\n\n630.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Special Administration process is still ongoing. Accordingly, to the extent that the Claimants' FET claim is based on events or actions allegedly attributable to the Respondent that have not yet occurred, the claim must be considered premature. The evidence on record is also insufficient to support the Claimants' contention that the Respondent is using the Recovery Decision for extraneous purposes, such as for the purpose of transferring legal title to HSY's assets to a third party, or for the purpose of frustrating the ICC1 Award. In light of the evidence before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Greek Government had effectively no option but to seek to enforce the Recovery Decision, in view of the decision of the CJEU of 28 June 2012, finding the Hellenic Republic to be in breach of its obligation under Article 108(2) of the TFEU to enforce the Recovery Decision, and in view of the proceedings commenced on 22 February 2017 by the European Commission before the CJEU to impose penalties on the Hellenic Republic as a consequence of its failure to enforce the Recovery Decision.1035 Nor is there any credible evidence before the Tribunal that the Hellenic Republic applied for the insolvency of HSY in order to frustrate the ICC1 Award; indeed, the Hellenic Republic was not the sole party to file an application for insolvency.\n\nThe Notice on the EU Commission's action against the Hellenic Republic under Article 260(2) TFEU in case C-93/17 (**R-0244**).\n\n631.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to establish that the Special Administration of HSY amounts to a breach of the FET standard.\n\n***c. The alleged harassment of HSY's senior management***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent deprived HSY of its \"human assets\" by harassing HSY's senior management by bringing several criminal proceedings against HSY's board members for non-payment of the salaries of HSY's employees. As a result, according to the Claimants, several HSY managers had to leave the country to avoid arrest. The subsequent proceedings led to several convictions.\n\n633.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that HSY has failed to pay its employees' salaries. While the Claimants contend that this was the consequence of the Hellenic Republic failing to comply its own contractual obligations, there is no evidence that this argument could not be raised before or was not properly considered by the Greek courts. The Tribunal notes that the proceedings against HSY's managers were brought by Greek prosecutors acting under Greek labor law. The Claimants do not allege that the managers were unable to defend themselves or that the proceedings were not conducted in compliance with due process or that they resulted in denial of justice. In the circumstances, and in the absence of any credible evidence that the criminal proceedings were used for extraneous purposes, the Claimants' claim for breach of the FET standard stands to be dismissed.\n\n***d. The alleged defamation campaign***\n----------------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent breached the FET standard by engaging in a \"defamation\" campaign against the Claimants and the Privinvest group. The Claimants rely, in particular, on statements made by the [REDACTED], during parliamentary debates in 2015 and 2016, as summarized above. The Claimants also contend the [REDACTED] falsely accused HSY management of having deserted HSY, and refer to articles authored by [REDACTED].\n\n635.\n\nHaving carefully considered the evidence relied upon by the Claimants, the Tribunal is unable to agree that the statements of the Greek officials referred to by the Claimants are defamatory, or indeed that the Respondent has engaged in a defamation campaign. While some of the statements of Greek officials may go beyond what would be appropriate in bilateral communications between the individuals concerned, this is not the context in which they were made. As to the alleged defamation campaign, the Tribunal cannot consider such statements in isolation; they must be considered in their context and in light of the evidence as a whole. As noted by the *S.D. Myers* tribunal:\n\n*The intent of government is a complex and multifaceted matter. Government decisions are shaped by different politicians and officials with differing philosophies and perspectives. Each of the many persons involved in framing government policy may approach a problem from a variety of different policy objectives and may sometimes take into account partisan political factors or career concerns. The Tribunal can only characterize CANADA's motivation or intent fairly by examining the record of the evidence as a whole.*1036\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, para. 161.\n\n636.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, when considered in their context and in light of the evidence as a whole, the statements of the Greek officials referred to by the Claimants do not amount to a breach of the FET standard. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that, in any event, the FET standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT applies to \"[i]nvestments by investors of a Contracting [P]arty,\" not to investors. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the statements caused any damage to or loss of the Claimants' investments.\n\n**C. Claim for Illegal Expropriation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n766.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in Section V.E (2) above that a number of the Claimants' claims, insofar as they arise out of contract claims that were adjudicated in the ICC1 Arbitration, are inadmissible in this ICSID arbitration. The claims that the Tribunal has found admissible are the following:\n\n(a) Claims arising out of the alleged deprivation of HSY of its human assets as a result of the Respondent's harassment of HSY's senior management;\n\n(b) Claims arising out of the alleged takeover of the shipyard, to the extent they are not based on the Finalization Agreement or its financial consequences;\n\n(c) Claims arising out of the Special Administration, including the claim for frustration of the ICC1 Award, insofar as they qualify as treaty claims; and\n\n(d) Claims arising out of the alleged defamation campaign.\n\n767.\n\nThe Tribunal will determine the Claimants' expropriation claims insofar as they arise out of the above circumstances and are thus admissible before the Tribunal.\n\n768.\n\nThe Claimants' expropriation claims are based on Article 4 of the BIT (\"Expropriation\"), which provides, in relevant part:\n\n*1- Investments by investors of either Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to any other measures the effects of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") except in the public interest, under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment affected immediately before the actual measure was taken or become public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, it shall include interest from the date of expropriation until the date of payment at a normal commercial rate and shall be freely transferable in a freely convertible currency.*\n\n*2- The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall also apply where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is constituted under the laws in force in any part of its own territory and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares.*\n\n769.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimants argue that the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimants' investment within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT and directly and indirectly expropriated HSY's assets within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the BIT.1295\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 574-575; Cl. Reply, para. 1418.\n\n770.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined above that the takeover of the Skaramangas shipyard by the Respondent and its use by the Hellenic Navy, without seeking an agreement on the essential terms of the Finalization Agreement and without compensating HSY for the use of the shipyard, amounted to a breach of the FET standard under Article 2(3) of the BIT. While making this determination, the Tribunal dismissed the Claimants' claims that (i) the alleged takeover of HSY's assets through the Special Administration; (ii) the alleged harassment of HSY's senior management; and (iii) the alleged defamation campaign amounted to a breach of the FET standard. Since the Claimants' expropriation claims arise out of the very same events as their FET claims \u2013 takeover and use of the shipyard by the Hellenic Navy without agreement and compensation; placement of HSY in Special Administration; and harassment of HSY's senior management \u2013 the Tribunal must determine whether any of these events, on their own or cumulatively, amount to an expropriation.\n\n771.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Claimants' case and the supporting evidence, the Tribunal finds that there has been no expropriation in the present case. While a breach of the FET standard may, in certain circumstances, also amount to an expropriation, this is not the case here, in particular because the Hellenic Navy's use of the shipyard was based on the Finalization Agreement and thus did not involve a compulsory transfer of control of HSY or the shipyard. Moreover, although the situation changed in March 2018 when HSY was placed in Special Administration and, as a result, the Claimants effectively lost control over the company and the shipyard, the evidence does not support the Claimants' contention that HSY was placed in Special Administration for extraneous or otherwise illegitimate reasons. First, the State was not the sole party filing the application for Special Administration; a private party, the [REDACTED], also joined in the application.1296 Second, the decision on the application was taken by the Greek courts (the Athens Single-member Court of First Instance), and the Claimants do not allege that in taking the decision on the application, the Greek courts committed a denial of justice or acted otherwise improperly.1297 Third, and in any event, insofar as the Greek State was involved as an applicant, it effectively had no option but to seek to enforce the Recovery Decision, in view of the decision of the CJEU of 28 June 2012, finding the Hellenic Republic to be in breach of its obligation under Article 108(2) of the TFEU to enforce the Recovery Decision, and in view of the proceedings commenced on 22 February 2017 by the European Commission before the CJEU, to impose penalties on the Hellenic Republic as a consequence of its failure to enforce the Recovery Decision.1298\n\nApplication for Special Administration dated 12 Oct. 2017 (**C-0159**).\n\nDecision No. 725/2018 of the Single-Member First Court of Athens dated 8 March 2018 (**C-0281**).\n\nThe Notice on the EU Commission's action against the Hellenic Republic under Article 260(2) TFEU in case C-93/17 (**R-0244**).\n\n772.\n\nWhile the Claimants contend that the placement of HSY under Special Administration was improper since, under Article 17 of the Recovery Decision, illegal State aid should be recovered from the civil parts of HSY's activities and not from the military parts, as it is only the civil parts that benefited from it, the Tribunal notes that the Special Administration is still pending, and there is no evidence before the Tribunal that the Recovery Decision has been improperly enforced.\n\n773.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to agree with the Claimants that their investment in Greece has been expropriated. In light of the evidence before the Tribunal, the placement of HSY under Special Administration must be considered a legitimate act to implement pre-existing laws, including the law of the EU, which forms part of the Greek law, in the ordinary course of business of the Greek courts.1299 The Claimants' claim for expropriation of their investment is therefore dismissed.\n\n*See* *Quiborax* Award (**RL-0020**), para. 202 (finding that \"if the Revocation Decree was the legitimate exercise of its sovereign right to sanction violations of the law in its territory, it would not qualify as a compensable taking. International law has generally understood that regulatory activity exercised under the so-called 'police powers' of the State is not compensable. In this regard, Comment (g) to \u00a7712 of the American Law Institute's *Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law* provides: A state is not responsible for loss of property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from bona fide general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action of the kind that is commonly accepted as within the police power of states, if it is not discriminatory, [\u2026] and is not designed to cause the alien to abandon the property to the state or sell it at a distress price.\"); *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award of 13 September 2001 (**CL-0075**), para. 603 (\"[D]eprivation of property and/or rights must be distinguished from ordinary measures of the State and its agencies in proper execution of the law. Regulatory measures are common in all types of legal and economic systems in order to avoid use of private property contrary to the general welfare of the (host) State.\")\n\n**D. Claim for Breach of the Full Protection and Security Standard**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n829.\n\nThe Claimants' FPS claim is based on Article 2(3) of the BIT, which provides that \"*[i]nvestments by investors of a Contracting party [\u2026] shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting party*.\"\n\n830.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties have put forward widely divergent views on the scope and content of the FPS standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT, the Claimants contending that the standard provides broad protections for the Claimants' investment, and that it serves to \"guarantee [\u2026] the physical, commercial and legal stability of the investment in a secure investment environment.\"1416 According to the Respondent, the FPS standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT requires a State \"to exercise its powers with due diligence to protect and secure the investment from the use of force by third parties.\"1417\n\nCl. Mem., para. 558.\n\nResp. C-Mem., para. 1138 (citing *Suez* (**CL-0074**), paras. 167, 173); Resp. Reply, para. 690.\n\n831.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the Respondent's position captures the essence of the FPS standard in the BIT. In accordance with its terms, and consistent with the preponderance of arbitral jurisprudence dealing with similarly worded provisions, the FPS standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT must be interpreted so as to impose a legal obligation on the host State to exercise due diligence to protect the investment of a foreign investor against undue interference by third parties.1418 Whether such protection extends beyond physical protection to legal security is essentially a matter of interpretation of the relevant provision in the applicable treaty. In the present case, the Tribunal need not take a view on the issue as the Claimants do not even allege, nor is there any evidence on the record, that the Respondent failed to protect the Claimants' investment against any undue interference by third parties; as summarized above, the Claimants' case is that it is the Respondent itself that interfered with the Claimants' investment. This is not a category of conduct that the FPS standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT is intended to govern.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Suez* (**CL-0074**), paras. 173, 178 (citing *Saluka* (**RL-0026**), para. 484; *BG Group Plc v. the Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL), Award (24 December 2007), paras. 323\u2013328; *PSEG Global et al. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award (19 January 2007) (**CL-0188**), paras. 258\u2013259; *Rumeli* (**RL-0027**), para. 669).\n\n832.\n\nIn light of the above, the Claimants' FPS claim stands to be dismissed.\n\n**E. Claim for Breach of the Umbrella Clause**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n896.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n902.\n\nThe Claimants' umbrella clause claim is based on Article 10(2) of the BIT, which provides that \"*[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments, in its territory, of investors of the other Contracting Party*.\"\n\n903.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in Section V.G.2 above that all of the Claimants' umbrella clause claims in this arbitration were also raised and adjudicated in the ICC1 Arbitration and are thus inadmissible, with the exception, in part, of one claim \u2013 the allegation that the Hellenic Republic failed to comply with its obligation under the Framework and Implementation Agreements not to take measures that would undermine HSY's viability. The claim is summarized above under sub-section E(1)a.(b)(ii) (\"Seeking to take legal title\") of this Section VI (\"Liability\"). Under this head of claim, the Claimants contend that the Respondent breached its obligations by seizing HSY's assets in order to enforce the Recovery Decision and by subsequently placing HSY in Special Administration.\n\n904.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' umbrella clause claim overlaps with their claim for breach of the FET standard, as discussed in Section VI.B.(3)b. above (\"Special Administration\"). For the reasons stated therein, the Tribunal determined that the Claimants had failed to establish that the Special Administration of HSY amounts to a breach of the FET standard. This finding applies to the Claimants' umbrella clause claim, which relies on the very same facts as the Claimants' FET claim and thus lacks a basis in fact. Accordingly, to the extent that the Claimants' umbrella clause claim is admissible before this Tribunal, it stands to be dismissed for lack of merit. In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not determine whether the Claimants need to be holders of the relevant obligation being enforced under the umbrella clause, as alleged by the Respondent.\n\n**F. Ancillary Claim**\n----------------------\n\n905.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in Section V.H.(2) above that the Claimants' ancillary (or alternative) claim regarding the alleged frustration of the ICC1 Award is admissible, as it arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute.\n\n906.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimants claim that the Respondent frustrated the ICC1 Award, first by refusing to implement the ICC1 Award and by then challenging it before the Greek courts and obtaining a stay of enforcement, and finally by \"burying\" the Award by way placing HSY in Special Administration. According to the Claimants, the Respondent's conduct constitutes a breach, *inter alia*, of Article 4(1) and 4(2) and other provisions of the BIT. The Respondent denies that it has frustrated the ICC1 Award and claims that it had the right to seek setting aside of the ICC1 Award before the Greek courts and any claim for damages is therefore premature.\n\n907.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in Section VI.B.(3) and VI.C.(2) above that the Special Administration does not amount to a breach of the BIT. This determination also applies to the Claimants' claim for frustration of the ICC1 Award, to the extent that it relies on the very same facts. The claim thus lacks a basis in fact. Furthermore, there is no evidence before the Tribunal that, when challenging the ICC1 Award, the Hellenic Republic, or indeed subsequently the Greek courts, behaved in a manner that would engage the responsibility of the Respondent under the BIT.1576\n\nThe Tribunal notes that by decision dated 8 April 2019 the Athens Court of Appeal dismissed the Hellenic Republic's challenge of the ICC1 Award. *See* Judgment No. 1897/2019 of the Athens Court of Appeal dated 8 April 2019 (**C-0355**). In June 2019, the Hellenic Republic filed an appeal against the decision with the Greek Supreme Court, which suspended the enforcement of the ICC1 Award (Cl. PHB, para. 2084). The matter is still pending.\n\n908.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants' claim that the Respondent frustrated the ICC1 Award is dismissed.\n\n**VII. QUANTUM**\n----------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n964.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in Section V.E.(2) above that a number of the Claimants' claims, to the extent they arise out of contract claims that were adjudicated in the ICC1 Arbitration, are inadmissible in this ICSID arbitration. The claims that the Tribunal has found to be admissible and subject to its determination are those arising out of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) Claims arising out of the alleged deprivation of HSY of its human assets as a result of the Respondent's harassment of HSY's senior management;\n\n(b) Claims arising out of the alleged takeover of the shipyard, to the extent they are not based on the Finalization Agreement;\n\n(c) Claims arising out of the Special Administration, including the claim for frustration of the ICC1 Award, insofar as they qualify as treaty claims;\n\n(d) Claims arising out of the alleged defamation campaign; and\n\n(e) Ancillary claim for frustration of the ICC1 Award.\n\n965.\n\nThe Tribunal has further determined in Section VI.B.(3) above that, when resorting to its sovereign powers to enforce the Finalization Agreement, without seeking to negotiate an agreement on its essential terms, and without compensating HSY for the use of the shipyard, the Respondent breached the FET standard under the Treaty. The Tribunal has dismissed all of the Claimants' remaining claims, for reasons set out in Sections V and VI above.\n\n966.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants do not attempt to segregate the compensation that they claim as a result of the Respondent's breach of its obligations under the FET standard, as determined in Section IV.B.(3) above, from the impact of the Respondent's other alleged breaches. The Tribunal, having dismissed the Claimants' claims for compensation as a result of these other alleged breaches, is not in a position to quantify the Claimants' losses based on the finding that it has reached. However, given the factual and legal complexity of this case, involving a variety of preliminary issues regarding jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as legal and factual issues arising from events that took place over a period of close to ten years, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to simply dismiss the Claimants' case for compensation for failure to meet the burden of proving their losses. Anticipating the Tribunal's findings on the many jurisdictional, admissibility, legal, and factual issues arising in this case, and then developing alternative calculations for each scenario, could not have been reasonably expected from either Party.\n\n967.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal finds it appropriate, in accordance with Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, to issue a Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability which deals with issues of jurisdiction, admissibility and liability only, and to postpone its decision on quantum to a subsequent phase of the proceedings.1671 This determination also applies to the Claimants' claim for moral damages, which the Claimants have presented as a case on quantum rather than liability. The Tribunal will revert to the Parties after the issuance of this Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, in order to establish, in consultation with the Parties, a procedural calendar for the quantum phase of this arbitration.\n\nOther ICSID tribunals have adopted this approach in similar circumstances. *See, e.g.*, *HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Liability of 29 December 2014, paras. 335, 336(g); *Total* (**CL-0005**) paras. 182, 184, 338, 339, 342, 346, 457, 460, 485(d).\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n968.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimants' claims fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments and the ICSID Convention, and are admissible to the extent that they are not contract claims that have been adjudicated in ICC Case No. 18675/GZ/MHM/AGF/ZF/AYZ, as determined by the Tribunal in Section V of this Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability;\n\n(b) The Claimants' claim for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(3) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is granted;\n\n(c) The Claimants' claim for illegal expropriation under Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is dismissed;\n\n(d) The Claimants' claim for breach of the full protection and security standard in Article 2(3) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is dismissed;\n\n(e) The Claimants' claim for breach of the umbrella clause in Article 10(2) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is dismissed:\n\n(f) The Claimants' ancillary claim for frustration of the arbitral Award issued in ICC Case No. 18675/GZ/MHM/AGF/ZF/AYZ is dismissed;\n\n(g) The Tribunal's decision on the costs is reserved; and\n\n(h) The Tribunal will provide directions for the conduct of the further proceedings in this matter in due course.\n\nDate: 24 July 2020"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2023-06-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations and Defined Terms**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case involves a dispute between Iskandar Safa and Akram Safa, natural persons having the nationality of Lebanon (the **\"Claimants\")**,and the Hellenic Republic (the **\"Respondent\"** or **\"Greece**,**\"** and together with the Claimants, the **\"Parties\")**.1\n\nUnless the context otherwise requires and save for the definitions reiterated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Award, the Tribunal adopts the abbreviations used in the Decision.\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute was submitted by the Claimants to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** on the basis of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 24 July 1997, which entered into force on 17 July 1999 (the **\"Treaty\"** or the **\"BIT\"****)**, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\"****)**.\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute arises out of measures allegedly taken by the Respondent in relation to the Hellenic Shipyards S.A. **(\"HSY\")**,a company that owned a shipyard located in Skaramangas, Greece. The Claimants are indirect shareholders of HSY.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability (the **\"Decision\"****)** in this matter on 24 July 2020. In its Decision, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n*(a) The Claimants' claims fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments and the ICSID Convention, and are admissible to the extent that they are not contract claims that have been adjudicated in ICC Case No. 18675/GZ/MHM/AGF/ZF/AYZ, as determined by the Tribunal in Section V of this Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability;*\n\n*(b) The Claimants' claim for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(3) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is granted;*\n\n*(c) The Claimants' claim for illegal expropriation under Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is dismissed;*\n\n*(d) The Claimants' claim for breach of the full protection and security standard in Article 2(3) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is dismissed;*\n\n*(e) The Claimants' claim for breach of the umbrella clause in Article 10(2) of the Agreement between the Lebanese Republic and the Hellenic Republic on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments is dismissed:*\n\n*(f) The Claimants' ancillary claim for frustration of the arbitral Award issued in ICC Case No. 18675/GZ/MHM/AGF/ZF/AYZ is dismissed;*\n\n*(g) The Tribunal's decision on the costs is reserved; and*\n\n*(h) The Tribunal will provide directions for the conduct of the further proceedings in this matter in due course.*2\n\n*Iskandar Safa and Akram Safa v*. *Hellenic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/16/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 24 July 2020 **(\"Decision\")**,para. 965.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal thus found that the Respondent had breached the fair and equitable treatment **(\"FET\")** standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT and dismissed all the other claims brought by the Claimants.3 As to the quantum of the Claimants' claim for compensation, the Tribunal considered that the Claimants had not segregated their claim for compensation due under the FET claim from the other alleged breaches and, as a result, it was not in a position to quantify the Claimants' loss.4 As envisaged in paragraph 965(h) of the Decision, the Tribunal subsequently provided directions to the Parties regarding further submissions on the quantum of the Claimants' claim that was found to be in breach of the FET standard.5\n\nDecision, para. 965(b).\n\nDecision, para. 966.\n\nDecision, para. 967.\n\n6.\n\nThis Award contains the Tribunal's decision on quantum and incorporates the Decision as Annex A, which constitutes an integral part of this Award. The Decision sets out the procedural history of this arbitration until 24 July 2020, the factual background to the dispute and the submissions made by the Parties regarding jurisdiction and liability. These sections of the Decision are not repeated in this Award. The following Sections deal with the post-Decision procedural history, the Parties' requests for relief and the Parties' arguments in relation to quantum.\n\n**II. POST-DECISION PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 July 2020, following the issuance of the Decision, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal stating that it had identified a series of \"inaccurate and misleading leaks\" of elements of the Decision to the Greek media, and requested that the Tribunal remind the Claimants of their obligations under Section 23 of Procedural Order No. 1, which confirmed, according to the Respondent, that the \"terms of the award are to remain confidential unless the parties agree otherwise.\"\n\n8.\n\nOn 29 July 2020, the Claimants submitted a response to the Respondent's communication of 28 July 2020, requesting that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's complaints concerning the alleged leaks of the Decision. The Claimants argued that (i) they had not published the Decision, nor circulated it to anyone; and (ii) Section 23 of Procedural Order No. 1 only dealt with the publication of awards and decisions by the ICSID Secretariat and \"does not establish an obligation on the Parties.\" The Claimants further noted that in Section 19 of Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal had determined that \"there is no general obligation of confidentiality in ICSID arbitration, nor specifically in these proceedings [...].\"\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 3 August 2020, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's requests made in its communication of 28 July 2020, finding that Article 48(5) of the ICSID Convention, Rule 48(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Section 23 of Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the publication of awards, orders and decisions of the Tribunal only apply to the ICSID Secretariat and do not create any obligations for the Parties, and that in the absence of any demonstration by the Respondent that the Claimants had released confidential information, the Tribunal could not grant the Respondent's request.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 13 August 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding the establishment of a procedural timetable for the quantum phase of the proceeding and to submit their joint proposal or their respective positions, if they were unable to agree, by 28 August 2020.\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 August 2020, the Parties requested that the Tribunal extend the deadline for the submission of their proposals concerning the procedural timetable for the quantum phase. On the same day, the Tribunal approved the Parties' request and extended the deadline for the Parties to submit their proposals regarding the procedural timetable to 2 October 2020.\n\n12.\n\nOn 11 September 2020, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to provide a copy of the Decision to the European Commission. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit their observations on the Respondent's request by 15 September 2020.\n\n13.\n\nOn 14 September 2020, the Claimants requested an extension of time until 28 September 2020 to revert on the Respondent's request. On the same day, the Tribunal approved the Claimants' request and extended the deadline for the Claimants' observations to 25 September 2020.\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 September 2020, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they objected to the Respondent's request for permission to provide a copy of the Decision to the European Commission.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 September 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to extend the deadline for reverting to the Tribunal regarding their proposal for the procedural timetable to 12 October 2020.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe scope of the present stage of the proceedings was set out in the Tribunal's Decision, in which the Tribunal determined that the Respondent had breached its obligations under the FET standard of the BIT in connection with the implementation of the Finalization Agreement. According to the Decision, *\"when resorting to its sovereign powers to enforce the Finalization Agreement, without seeking to negotiate an agreement on its essential terms, and without compensating HSY for the use of the shipyard, the Respondent breached the FET standard under the Treaty.*\"313 This was the sole breach of the Treaty found by the Tribunal; all of the Claimants' remaining claims were dismissed.\n\nDecision, para. 965.\n\n203.\n\nAs summarized above in Section I, the Tribunal found that it was not in a position, at the time of the Decision, to address the quantum of the Claimants' claim arising from the implementation of the Finalization Agreement, for the following reasons:\n\n*The Tribunal notes that the Claimants do not attempt to segregate the compensation that they claim as a result of the Respondent's breach of its obligations under the FET standard, as determined in Section IV.B(3) above, from the impact of the Respondent's other alleged breaches. The Tribunal, having dismissed the Claimants' claims for compensation as a result of these other alleged breaches, is not in a position to quantify the Claimants' losses based on the finding that it has reached. However, given the factual and legal complexity of this case, involving a variety of preliminary issues regarding jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as legal and factual issues arising from events that took place over a period of close to ten years, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to simply dismiss the Claimants' case for compensation for failure to meet the burden of proving their losses. Anticipating the Tribunal's findings on the many jurisdictional, admissibility, legal, and factual issues arising in this case, and then developing alternative calculations for each scenario, could not have been reasonably expected from either Party.*314\n\nDecision, para. 966.\n\n204.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal found it appropriate \"to *postpone its decision on quantum to a subsequent phase of the proceedings.*\"315 This finding also applied to the Claimants' claim for moral damages, which the Claimants had presented as a case on quantum rather than liability.316 Accordingly, the scope of the present proceedings is limited to the Tribunal's sole finding of breach of the FET standard under the Treaty, as well as the Claimants' claim for moral damages.\n\nDecision, para. 967.\n\nDecision, para. 967.\n\n205.\n\nAs to the subject matter, the Tribunal's Decision was limited to the finding of liability and did not involve any decisions related to quantum. Consequently, while the Tribunal found in the Decision that \"*it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to simply dismiss the Claimants' case for compensation for failure to meet the burden of proving their losses*,\"the Claimants must discharge that burden in the present stage of the proceedings. The Claimants must show that they suffered a loss as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty, as well as the quantum of the claimed loss. This is undisputed between the Parties.317 It also appears undisputed between the Parties, and the Tribunal agrees, that while the Claimants need not prove the quantum of their loss with absolute certainty, they need to prove the fact of loss on the balance of probabilities.318\n\nCl. PHB on Quantum, para. 2798; Resp. Rej. on Quantum, para. 43.\n\nCl. PHB on Quantum, para. 2798; Resp. Rej. on Quantum, para. 44.1.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, in this connection, that HSY is not a claimant in the present arbitration, and that the Claimants are not shareholders of HSY; their investment in HSY was made through several companies of the Privinvest Group (the composition of which changed over time), of which the Claimants are the ultimate controlling shareholders.319\n\nDecision, paras. 246-248.\n\n207.\n\nFor the purposes of determining whether the Claimants have met their burden of proving that they have suffered a loss, the Tribunal recalls the finding of the PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case:\n\n*The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act \u2014 a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.*320\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory* **(CL-0099)**,p. 28.\n\n208.\n\nIn order to discharge their burden of proof, the Claimants must therefore show that they would have been better off in the counterfactual scenario in which HSY and the Respondent would have negotiated the essential terms of the Finalization Agreement, including the compensation payable to HSY for the use of the shipyard, than they are in the actual scenario, in which HSY did not benefit from any such payments. Conversely, if the Claimants' situation in the counterfactual scenario would, on a balance of probabilities, have been the same as their current actual situation, the Claimants would not have suffered any loss as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty, and the Claimants' claims must be rejected.\n\n209.\n\nThe issue of burden of proof arises in the present case in this particular form, *inter alia,* because the claims have not been brought by HSY (which *prima facie* would appear to have suffered a loss as it was not paid for the use of the shipyard), but by indirect shareholders of HSY, the Claimants. This is the principal difference between the present case and the related ICC1 and ICC2 Arbitrations, in which the claims (and the corresponding counterclaims) were brought by the parties to the relevant agreements, including HSY. As noted above, in the ICC2 Arbitration, it is HSY (together with its co-respondents, which do not include the Claimants) that is a party to the arbitration and that has brought (together with its co-respondents) a counterclaim based on the very same event - the \"takeover\" of the shipyard - from which the Claimants' present claim arises, in the amount of EUR 36.9 million.321 By contrast, in the present case, HSY is not a party to the arbitration, but rather forms the very subject matter of this dispute - it is the Claimants' investment out of which this ICSID arbitration arises.322\n\nResp. C-Mem. on Quantum, para. 25; Resp. Rej. on Quantum, para. 16.2; HSY's Updated Statement of Counterclaim dated 2 February 2018 in ICC2 **(R-0295)**,para. 52.\n\nDecision, para. 250 (determining that \"the Claimants' shareholding in HSY qualifies as an *'investment'* within the meaning of both Article 25(1) of the BIT and Article 251 of the ICSID Convention.\")\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants have put forward three alternative approaches to the quantification of their alleged loss: (i) alternative profits approach; (ii) market lease approach; and (iii) minimum costs approach. While the Claimants' case appears to be that each of these approaches quantifies the same alleged loss, they produce substantially different quantifications.\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimants' alternative profits approach is based on the assumption that the Respondent would have agreed to pay compensation in the \"but for\" scenario based on HSY's hypothetical operational profit if HSY had run the shipyard itself. The approach also assumes that the compensation period \"would not have been cut short\" by the Special Administration, and that the Respondent would have agreed to bear the costs of reactivating and operating the shipyard. The Claimants argue that HSY's profit in this scenario would have been substantial, as the Claimants would have worked on the Archimedes and Neptune II Programs and would have conducted MRO work on vessels belonging to the Hellenic Navy. On this basis, the Claimants quantify their claim at EUR 109.8 million, plus interest.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants' market lease approach is based on the identification of the leasable areas of the shipyard, which the Claimants have assigned to distinct area categories, and for which they have then identified the lease rates per square meter on the basis of lease rates charged on the open market for similar area categories. This approach also assumes that the relevant time frame for assessing HSY's cash flows extends from 4 April 2014, the date of the breach of the Treaty, until the end of the Hellenic Navy's use of the shipyard, which is still ongoing. Under this approach, the Claimants' claim amounts to EUR 90,618,332, plus interest.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants' minimum costs approach is based on HSY's equivalent annual costs of owning and operating the shipyard, including depreciation, market interest on the shareholder loans provided to HSY and credit costs to account for the risk of the Respondent's failure to pay the lease. This approach also assumes that the period of calculation of the Claimants' loss extends from 4 April 2014, the date of the breach, until the end of the Hellenic Navy's use of the shipyard. The Claimants' claim under this approach amounts to EUR 72,151,861, plus interest.\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, at the outset, that each of the Claimants' three approaches is based on the assumption that in the counterfactual \"but for\" scenario HSY would not have been placed under Special Administration (which actually occurred on 8 March 2018).323 However, as noted above, although the Tribunal found in the Decision that the Respondent had breached its FET obligation under the Treaty \"when resorting to its sovereign powers to enforce the Finalization Agreement, without seeking to negotiate an agreement on its essential terms, and without compensating HSY for the use of the shipyard,\" the Tribunal dismissed the Claimants' claim that the Special Administration in itself amounted to a breach of the Treaty.324 The Special Administration therefore cannot be excluded from the \"but for\" scenario on the basis that it formed part of the wrongful conduct.\n\nCl. PHB on Quantum, paras. 2829-2833; Third [REDACTED] Report **(C-0363)**,para. 7.59; [REDACTED] **(C-0365)**, paras. 411, 439.\n\nDecision, paras. 628-631.965.\n\n215.\n\nMoreover, while the Special Administration could, in theory, be excluded from the \"but for\" scenario if the payments made by the Hellenic Navy pursuant to the Finalization Agreement would have generated sufficient revenue during the period from 4 April 2014 to 8 March 2018 (whatever the methodology used to quantify them) to prevent the placement of HSY into Special Administration, it does not appear, on the balance of probabilities, that this would have been the case. The Tribunal notes that HSY's undischarged State aid alone amounted, as at 4 April 2014, to over EUR 500 million, and debts to third parties amounted to between EUR 67.3 and 75.9 million (the precise amount being disputed between the Parties), composed mainly of liabilities to HSY's workers and [REDACTED].325 Since these debts had accrued prior to the Respondent's breach of the Treaty, they cannot be excluded from the \"but for\" scenario, and accordingly HSY would have been required to service or repay them as they became due or, as in the case of the State aid, had already fallen due in April 2014.326 The Claimants further argue that \"HSY's profits from leasing could not have been subjected to recovery of [S]tate aid\" as they would have related to HSY's military activities (which were not the subject of the Recovery Decision), and not the civil assets (which were covered by the Recovery Decision).327 However, the European Commission appears to have taken the view that the fact that State aid could only be recovered from HSY's civil assets would not preclude recourse to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, if necessary, and in all probability would have insisted on this position in its dealings with the Greek Government.328 Accordingly, the Greek Government would have been constrained to apply for placement of HSY into Special Administration also in the \"but for\" scenario.329 Indeed, it appears undisputed that HSY would not have been able to generate sufficient revenue to pay off the entirety of the undischarged State aid. HSY's placement into Special Administration thus would in all probability have taken place in any event, regardless of the completion of the Finalization Agreement and the payments made by the Hellenic Navy to HSY thereunder.330\n\nThe Parties' quantum experts disagree on the amount of HSY's external debt; *see* [REDACTED] Report **(C-0365)**, p. 36; Fourth [REDACTED] Report **(R-0360)**,para. 4.87.\n\nDecision, para. 100; Commission Decision of 2 July 2008 on the measure C 16/04 (ex NN29/04, CP 71/02 and CP 133/05) implemented by Greece in favor of Hellenic Shipyards (notified under document C (2008)3118) **(\"Recovery Decision\") (C-0001)**.\n\nCl. Mem. on Quantum, para. 2382 *et seq.*\n\n*See* European Commission's Observations, para. 56. (\"It follows that, since HSY has not reimbursed the incompatible aid, EU State aid rules require Greece to initiate insolvency proceedings against HSY in order to recover as much as possible of the aid from HSY's assets. In case full recovery of the aid (with interest) is eventually not possible, Greece is also obliged to wind-up HSY and to bring about the definite cessation of HSY's (non-military) activities.\"\n\nAccording to Art. 68(1) of Law 4307/2014 **(C-0160)**,any company that is \"in a general and permanent inability to fulfill its due financial obligations\" may be placed into Special Administration\"  \nThe First Instance Court of Athens in its decision described Special Administration as an \"extraordinary procedure ... for the liquidation in operation (sale while in operation and transfer as a group of assets or as individual groups of assets (sectors) to new entities), of heavily indebted businesses,\" introduced by Law 4307/2014.: *see* Decision No. 725/2018 of the Single-Member First Court of Athens dated 8 March 2018 **(C-0281)**,p. 3.\n\nIt appears undisputed that, as of the date HSY was placed in Special Administration, the rights of the shareholders in HSY passed in their entirety to the Special Administrator: *see* Legal Opinion of Jakovos E. Venieris **(R-0312)**,para. 73.\n\n216.\n\nThus, the proper counterfactual in the present case involves one in which the Finalization Agreement would have been completed to provide for compensation to HSY for the use of the shipyard and in which the Respondent would have made payments to HSY for the use of the shipyard in accordance with the completed Finalization Agreement, either in cash or by way of a set-off against the State aid debt;331 however, it does not involve the scenario in which HSY would not have been placed into Special Administration.\n\nThe ICC1 tribunal took the view that the Respondent would be able to set off its State aid claim against any awards made in HSY's favor; *see* ICC1 Award, **(C-0019)**,paras. 2060-2067.\n\n217.\n\nAs to HSY's other external debts, including the [REDACTED] loan and workers' claims, as noted above, these amounted to EUR 67.3 -75.9 million (the amount being disputed between the Parties). Even assuming the revenue from the Finalization Agreement would have been sufficient to allow HSY to service the [REDACTED] loan so as to exclude or at least reduce the risk of [REDACTED] joining in the effort to place HSY into Special Administration,332 this would not have prevented the placement of HSY into similar insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in circumstances in which it would have been unable to pay off the undischarged State aid, which, as noted above, had already fallen due and substantially exceeded any amount of revenue HSY would have been able to earn under the Finalization Agreement.\n\nUnder Law 4307/2014 **(C-0160)**,Art. 58.2, at least one of the creditors applying for Special Administration must be a financial institution.\n\n218.\n\nAs to the workers' claims specifically, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimants' argument that the Respondent would have assumed responsibility for payment of the workers' claims as part of the Finalization Agreement. These claims, which amounted to some EUR 37.7 million, had accrued between April 2012 and April 2014, during the shutdown of the shipyard, and accordingly it is more likely than not that the Respondent would not have agreed to assume such responsibility, given that these debts had accrued prior to the conclusion of the Finalization Agreement and thus did not relate to the use of the shipyard as from 8 April 2014.\n\n219.\n\nHowever, while the Tribunal is unable to accept the counterfactual scenario on which each of the Claimants' approaches to the quantification of their claim is based, for the reasons set out below, the Tribunal need not take a view on which one of these three approaches is the appropriate method in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal notes that each of the three approaches is based on the assumption that the Claimants have in fact suffered a loss. It should be recalled, in this connection, that the Finalization Agreement was concluded between the Respondent and HSY, and not with the Claimants, on the basis of the exchange of letters between Mr. Iskandar Safa, acting on behalf of HSY, and [REDACTED] , acting on behalf of the Respondent.333 Thus, the Claimants were not a party to the Finalization Agreement, and it is therefore not sufficient for the Claimants, for purposes of discharging their burden of proof, to show that HSY suffered a loss. The Claimants bear the burden of proving that they themselves, separately and independently of HSY, suffered a loss as a result of the Respondent's failure \"to negotiate an agreement on its [*i.e*., the Finalization Agreement's] essential terms, and without compensating HSY for the use of the shipyard,\" in breach of the BIT.\n\nEmail from First Claimant to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] dated 27 February 2014 **(C-0087)**; Letter from [REDACTED] to First Claimant dated 13 March 2014 (**C-00127**).\n\n220.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"HSY would have passed on the profits earned under the Finalization Agreement to Claimants\" in the form of repayment of shareholder loans granted to HSY by Privinvest Holding SAL.334 According to the Claimants, Privinvest Holding SAL, which is effectively fully owned by the Claimants, in turn would have distributed the funds to Claimants either in the form of dividends or repayment of the shareholder loans owed to the Claimants.335 The Claimants contend that these loans amounted to EUR 150 million, including the [REDACTED] in the amount of EUR 131 million.336\n\nCl. PHB on Quantum, para. 2872.\n\nCl. PHB on Quantum, para. 2879; Cl. Reply on Quantum, para. 2609.\n\nCl. PHB on Quantum, para. 2873; Cl. Reply on Quantum, para. 2605. The terms of the [REDACTED] have not been disclosed, although the Tribunal ordered their disclosure by Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the Claimants have discharged their burden of proof. The Claimants have not shown that HSY would and indeed could have prioritized payments to Privinvest Holding SAL at the expense of HSY's external creditors.\n\n222.\n\nFirst, it does not appear probable that HSY would have been, as a matter of fact, in a position to repay the shareholder loans to Privinvest Holding SAL, in view of its level of indebtedness and the fact that it had effectively been insolvent since 30 September 2011, as noted by the First Instance Court of Athens in its decision placing HSY under Special Administration; indeed, HSY had failed to publish its financial statements since that date.337 The Claimants do not appear to argue that HSY would have been in a position to pay any dividends. In the circumstances, and contrary to the Claimants' suggestion, HSY would likely have been unable to refinance any of its external debt.338\n\nDeloitte Independent Report dated 9 October 2017 **(R-0240)**,p. 8; Decision No. 725/2018 of the Single-Member First Court of Athens dated 8 March 2018 **(C-0281)**,p. 10.\n\nTr. Day 2, 148:13-20 [REDACTED]).\n\n223.\n\nSecond, it is also uncertain, as a matter of Greek law, whether HSY could have lawfully made any payments to Privinvest Holding SAL, given that Greek law, like many other systems of corporate governance, requires company directors to act in the interest of the company and prioritize the company's interests over those of the shareholders, and it is unlikely that prioritizing repayment of shareholder loans over external debt would have been in HSY's interest.339 It also remains uncertain whether Privinvest Holding SAL would have been in a position to pay the corresponding amounts, or any amounts at all, whether in the form of repayment of shareholder loans or dividends, further to the Claimants - even assuming HSY could have made any payments to Privinvest Holding SAL.340 There is no evidence before the Tribunal as to how any sums of money that might have reached Privinvest Holding SAL would have been recorded in its books, what fiscal consequences, if any, there might have been as a result of such payments, and what other aspects of its financials might have been relevant to the making of a dividend to the Claimants.\n\nLaw 2190/1920, Art. 22 **(R-0376)**.\n\nThere is limited evidence on the record on the financial position of Privinvest Holding SAL, and its 2020 financial statements, including portions dealing with the shareholder loan to HSY, have been heavily redacted. It is unclear, among other things, whether the shareholder loans are subordinated: *see* Fourth [REDACTED] Report **(R-0360)**, paras. 4.35\u20144.44.\n\n224.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of proving that they would have received, in the \"but for\" scenario, any payments from HSY, through Privinvest or otherwise. The Claimants have thus failed to prove that they suffered any loss as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty.\n\n225.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Claimants' claim for moral damages also fails. There is no evidence on the record that the Claimants suffered any moral damage as a result of the Respondent's failure to negotiate the essential terms of the Finalization Agreement and to pay compensation for the use of the shipyard.\n\n**V.

The Respondent's Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe relevant provision is Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n237.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules further provides that the award shall contain, *inter alia,* \"any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n238.\n\nIt is well established in ICSID arbitration that the provisions quoted above provide the Tribunal with broad discretion to decide how the costs incurred by the Parties in the course of the arbitration are to be allocated.\n\n239.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree that the applicable principle in the circumstances of this case is that costs should \"follow the event,\" and indeed both Parties request that the Tribunal award their costs of arbitration, including their legal costs and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat. The Tribunal agrees, with the limited exception of the costs of the arbitration, for the reasons set out below.\n\n240.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, which include the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' Fees and Expenses |  |\n| Dr. Veijo Heiskanen | [REDACTED] |\n| Mr. Klaus Reichert | [REDACTED] |\n| Professor Brigitte Stem | [REDACTED] |\n| ICSID's Administrative Fees | [REDACTED] |\n| Direct Expenses | [REDACTED] |\n| **Total** | [REDACTED] |\n\n241.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts, except for the lodging fee of USD 25,000.00, which was made by the Claimants only. On this basis, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD [REDACTED] The Tribunal finds it appropriate that the Parties bear and equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and the direct expenses. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments they advanced to ICSID.\n\n242.\n\nAs to legal costs, the Tribunal agrees that these costs should \"follow the event\" and accordingly their allocation should reflect the relative success of the Parties. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that, in the first (jurisdictional and liability) phase of the arbitration, most of the Respondent's jurisdictional and admissibility objections were dismissed, whereas the Claimants ultimately prevailed on one of their claims on liability; however, the Claimants' remaining claims were all rejected. In this quantum phase, as determined above, the Respondent ultimately prevailed in full as the Claimants' claims that reached this stage of the proceedings were dismissed in their entirety.\n\n243.\n\nAs to the reasonableness of the Parties' legal costs, the Tribunal notes that, while the fees and costs of the Claimants' counsel are higher than those of the Respondent's, this seems to be largely a consequence of the Claimants' counsel's higher hourly rates. In view of the complexity of the case, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants' costs are unreasonable.\n\n244.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to (i) grant the Claimants 50% of their legal costs in the liability phase, in the amount of [REDACTED]; (ii) grant the Respondent 50% of its legal costs in the liability phase, in the amount of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]; and (iii) grant the Respondent's legal costs in their entirety in the quantum phase, in the amount of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], and dismiss the Claimants' claim for legal costs in the quantum phase in their entirety.\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Parties' agreement, in the first phase of the arbitration, that no interest on costs is due on the cost claims.358 In view of this agreement, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Claimants' claim of interest on its costs that it raised in the second phase of the arbitration.\n\nCl.
