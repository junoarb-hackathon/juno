INTRODUCTION\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present case is regarding a dispute filed before the International Centre for Settlement of\u00a0Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Center\") pursuant to the Agreement on Promotion and\u00a0Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Venezuela.\u00a0(\"BIT\u201d or the \"Treaty\") executed on November 2. 1995 and in force as of September 10, 1997.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants, Valores Mundiales. S.L. (\u201cValores\") and Consorcio Andino, S.L. (\"Consorcio\"),\u00a0are two sociedades de responsabilidad limitada with corporate domicile in Madrid, Spain (the\u00a0\"Claimants\").\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\", the \"Respondent\" or the\u00a0\"Republic\").\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants and the Respondent shall be hereinafter jointly referred to as the \"Parties\". The\u00a0complete list of the representatives of the Parties and their corresponding domiciles are included\u00a0in page ( i) of this Award.\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has analyzed all the arguments, claims, annexes and legal capacity of the Parties.\u00a0The fact that this Tribunal makes no reference or docs not quote an argument or document, does\u00a0not entail that the Tribunal has failed to consider it.\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summan', the Claimants request the Tribunal to declare that Venezuela has violated Articles V\u00a0(expropriation). IV (fair and equitable treatment). Ill (arbitrary and discriminatory' measures) and\u00a0VII (transfers) of the BIT. and to determine that such violations have caused them damages and\u00a0loss of profits. Consequently, the Claimants request the Tribunal to hold the Respondent\u00a0responsible for paying an indemnification pursuant to the BIT and international law. to order the\u00a0Respondent from refraining to impose additional liens on the indemnification and to pay all the\u00a0costs and expenses related with this arbitration.\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent contests the claims of the Claimants, and requests the Tribunal to declare that it\u00a0lacks jurisdiction over those claims, and that such claims are inadmissible. In the event the\u00a0Tribunal concludes it has jurisdiction, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare that\u00a0Venezuela has not breached its obligations under the BIT and. in the event the Tribunal finds the\u00a0existence of responsibility, to deny the claim for damages given for lack of evidence under\u00a0international law. Finally, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to require Claimants to pay the\u00a0costs and expenses of the arbitration proceedings and to compensate Venezuela for the expenses\u00a0incurred in its defense.\nLIC.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On May 10, 2013 the Center received a request for arbitration (\u201cRequest for Arbitration\u201d) from\u00a0Valores Mundiales, S.L. and Consorcio Andino, S.L., vis-\u00e0-vis, the Bolivarian Republic of\u00a0Venezuela.\n9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On May 30, 2013, the Center received a communication from the Respondent contesting the\u00a0registration of the Request for Arbitration pursuant to the effects of the denounce from the\u00a0Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals or Other States\u00a0(\u201cICSID Convention\u201d) by Venezuela on January 24, 2012. On May 13, 2013 the General\u00a0Secretary of ICSID confirmed the reception of such communication.\n10. \u00a0\u00a0Through a letter dated June 4,2013, the Claimants rejected the arguments against the registration\u00a0of the Request of Arbitration submitted by Venezuela. On such date, the General Secretary of\u00a0ICSID confirmed the reception of such communication\n11. \u00a0\u00a0On June 6,2013, the General Secretary of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant\u00a0to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified such fact to the Parties.\n12. \u00a0\u00a0In the Notice of Registration, the General Secretary invited the Parties to inform the Center of any\n\u2022 agreement with respect to the number of arbitrators and their appointment mechanism under Rule 7(c) of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the\u00a0\u201cInstitution Rules\u201d). Likewise, it invited them to, if possible, integrate an arbitral tribunal pursuant\u00a0to Articles 37 through 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n13. \u00a0\u00a0Through a communication dated June 10, 2013, the Respondent reiterated its objection to the\u00a0registration of the Request for Arbitration, indicating its intent to refraining in the future from all\u00a0participation in this proceeding. On June II, 2013, ICSID General Secretary confirmed the\u00a0reception of such communication and indicated that the registration of the Request for Arbitration\u00a0was made without prejudice tothe powers and duties of the arbitral tribunal concerning the\u00a0jurisdiction, venue and merits, as set forth in Articles 41 and 42 of the ICSID Convention.\n14. \u00a0\u00a0On June 14, 2013, the Claimants proposed a mechanism to integrate the arbitral tribunal to the\u00a0Respondent. The Center confirmed the reception of such communication on such date. The Center\u00a0did not receive any communication form the Respondent in connection therewith.\n15. \u00a0\u00a0On August 8, 2013, after more than sixty (60) days as of the registration of the Request for\u00a0Arbitration elapsed, without the Parties reaching an agreement regarding the mechanism to\u00a0constitute the Tribunal, the Claimants appointed Dr. Horacio A. Grigera-Na\u00f3n, a national from\u00a0the Republic of Argentina, pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n16. \u00a0\u00a0Through letter dated August 13,2013, Dr. Horacio A. Grigera-Na\u00f3n accepted his appointment as\u00a0arbitrator of this proceeding.\nLIC.

The Claimants argue that there have been no conversations between the Parties since the end of 201468.\nD. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT OF WHETHER THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN MEASURES PRIOR TO DECREE NO. 7.394 AND MEASURES THEREAFTER.\n121. \u00a0The Claimants have argued throughout this arbitration that there is a link between the measures\u00a0prior to Decree No. 7.394 and measures thereafter, i.e., between the measures affecting the\u00a0Companies and arising from and relating to, the criminal process advanced against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0Barrueco and the measures arising from and relating to, the aforementioned Decree. The\u00a0Respondent denies the existence of such relationship.\n122. \u00a0Through a notice dated February 17,2016, the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit briefs after\u00a0the Hearing answering the question o\u00ed \u201cwhether or not there exists, depending on the position of\u00a0each Party, a link between the measures prior to [Decree No. 7.394] and measures thereafter'\u2122.\u00a0Both Parties submitted their post-hearing writs on April 5, 2016.\n1. Claimants\u2019 Position\n123. The Claimants argue that there is a close link between measures prior to Decree No. 7.394 and\u00a0measures thereafter, as well as between those measures and the Decree itself70. According to the\u00a0Claimants, Venezuela would have used these measures to indirectly appropiate the Companies\u00a0without paying any compensation to the Claimants71. Furthermore, the imposition of the measures\u00a0and the Decree itself resulted in an unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of the BIT.\n124. \u00a0According to the Claimants, the measures prior to Decree No. 7.394 and measures thereafter have\u00a0the same origin and basis72.\n125. \u00a0First, the Claimants argue that the imposition of the special administration on the Companies, as\u00a0well as freezing their bank accounts and the prohibition to register or notarize corporate acts -both prior to Decree No. 7.394 - had their origin in the order issued in December 2009 by the then\u00a0President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to \u201coccupy\u201d and take ownership of the companies that were allegedly\u00a0owned by Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco73. A few months after the imposition of these measures, when,\u00a0according to the Claimants, it became clear that the Companies were not owned by Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0Barrueco, the President signed the Decree No. 7.39474. According to the Claimants, one of the\u00a0basis of the Decree is precisely the imposition of seizure and special administration measures75.\n126. \u00a0Second, the Claimants suggest that the measures subsequent to the Decree, particularly the\n67 Counter Memorial 171. footnote 209.

Indeed, the Claimants point out, that the Liaison Commission originates on Decree\u00a0No. 7.394 and is based on the seizure and special administration measures. The Administrative\u00a0Ordinance is based on these measures which, in turn, originate in the orders of President Ch\u00e1vez77.\n127. \u00a0Third, the Claimants affirm that there is certain identity between the special administration and\u00a0the Liaison Commission insofar as both (i) were imposed by the Executive Branch pursuant to\u00a0orders issued by the then President Ch\u00e1vez; (ii) have had the purpose of promoting Venezuela's\u00a0agro-food security and sovereignty policies; and (iii) they have had to adjust their actions to the\u00a0guidelines of the Ministry of Food78.\n128. \u00a0Particularly, the Claimants argue that since May 2011, two \u201cmirrors\u201d of the Liaison Commission\u00a0were appointed as representatives of the special administration and began acting as special\u00a0administrators79. Subsequently, in December 2012, Venezuela designated two \u201cmirrors\u201d of the\u00a0Liaison Commission as special administrators whom, to date, continue to hold such positions80.\n129. \u00a0The Claimants also argue that the Liaison Commission has stated that its purpose is to assure the\u00a0compliance of the provisions of the special administration, while special administration members\u00a0have stated that their actions are aimed to promote the agri-food policies of the special\u00a0administration of the Executive Branch.81\n130. \u00a0Finally, the Claimants state that Venezuela indefinitely suspended the expropriation\u00a0administrative proceeding while maintaining the special administration and the seizure measures\u00a0in an irregular and indefinite manner82. In such manner, Venezuela has progressively increased its\u00a0interference in the Companies without paying any compensation to the Claimants83.\n2. Respondent\u2019s Position\n131. The Respondent denies that the measures prior to Decree No. 7.394 and measures thereafter have\u00a0the relationship argued by the Claimants84.\n132. \u00a0First, the Respondent argues that the recitals of the Decree merely indicate the factual and legal\u00a0circumstances justifying the issuance of the Decree. The mention of the seizure measures in said\u00a0recitals is reasonable, inasmuch it reflects the reality of an existing judicial procedure as of the\u00a0date of the Decree which could affect the normal functioning and operation of Monaca85.\n133. \u00a0Second, the Respondent disputes the probative value of the statements of then President Ch\u00e1vez\n76 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief. 5i 39.\n77 Id.\n78 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \\*| 40.\n79 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, 41.\n80 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, <| 42.\n81 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \\*| 41-43.\n82 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief. 44-45.\n83 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief. 45.\n84 Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, U I.\n20\n  \nLIC.

On the contrary, it states that these are entities with different legal basis\u00a0and functions. The Respondent explains that the special administration is one of the judicial\u00a0measures ordered, which fulfills \u201ca supervisory and custody task to safeguard the value of\u00a0companies\u201d\\*1. On other hand, the Liaison Commission was created within the framework of the\u00a0conversations related with the Decree No. 7.394 with the purpose of obtaining information and\u00a0knowledge to facilitate the transition after the termination of the expropriation process88.\n135. \u00a0The Respondent explains that both bodies should act with a certain degree of coordination to fulfill\u00a0their duties and to avoid duplicating efforts. However, it argues that this coordination responds to\u00a0the \u201clogical collaboration between public officers\u201d and does not evidence a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d\u00a0as argued by the Claimants89. In this sense, Venezuela states that the fact that both bodies have\u00a0followed the guidelines of the Ministry of Food does not demonstrate a merger of their functions,\u00a0since all companies in the food sector are obliged to meet the requirements of said entity90.\u00a0Additionally, it states that the Claimants base their thesis of the merger of these bodies on a draft\u00a0of an internal, which contains errors and was never used91.\n136. \u00a0Finally, Venezuela argues that the Liaison Commission disappeared on September 30, 2013,\u00a0therefore it is not explained how the alleged expropriation effect, consisting in the occupation of\u00a0the companies, could have survived92.\n137. \u00a0In conclusion, Venezuela denies the alleged relationship argued by the Claimants between the\u00a0seizure and special administration measures, on the one hand, and Decree No. 7.394, on the other.\u00a0Venezuela argues that neither the first or the second have deprived the Claimants of their\u00a0ownership or control of the Companies nor have they voided their value. Thus, there is no\u00a0expropriation and no violation to the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT93.\nIV. JURISDICTION\nA.

Article 71 of the ICSID Convention\u00a0allows contracting States to denounce the Convention and be released from any obligation to\u00a0continue complying with it. after six months of the denouncement date. On other hand. Article 72\u00a0of the Convention only preserves the right to initiate arbitration if the consent of the parties exists\u00a0before the effective date of denouncement of the ICSID Convention99. Likewise. Rule 2(3) of the\u00a0Institution Rules, along with its commentary (Note \"M\") refer to the dale of the granting of the\u00a0consent as the formalized mutual consent and relate it to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention100.\u00a0The experts appointed by the Parties also agree that when the State has denounced the ICSID\u00a0Convention, the effective date to establish the existence of the formalized mutual consent, is the\u00a0date on which the depositary' receives the notice of denunciation of the Convention101. In this case,\u00a0the effective date of denouncement of the Convention is January 24, 2012.\n142. \u00a0The Claimants did not formalize the consent to initiate an arbitration when presenting the Dispute\u00a0Notice dated November 7. 2011. and received on November 9. 2011 (the \"Dispute Notice\u201d)102.\u00a0Although these are prior to the effective date of the denouncement of the Agreement (January 24.\n\u20194 Respondent's Post-Hearing Writ.\\* 4.

Venezuela argues that the\u00a0alleged acceptance of consent by the Claimants of November 7, 2011 is invalid, and, therefore, is\u00a0legally non-existent106.\n144. \u00a0Venezuela argues that pursuant to Article XI of the BIT, the contracting States agreed that the\u00a0following requirements should be met when a dispute arises: (i) the investor has notified the State,\u00a0in writing, about the existence of the dispute; (ii) the investor and the State have tried, to the extent\u00a0possible, to settle the dispute through an amicable agreement; (iii) the dispute could not have been\u00a0settled by an amicable agreement within a six month period as of the notification date107. The BIT\u00a0empowers the investor to choose to submit the dispute to local courts or to international\u00a0arbitration, only at the end of the above referenced procedure, and if each and every one of the\u00a0aforementioned requirements are met108.\n145. \u00a0According to Venezuela \u201cft]he decision to submit the dispute to local courts or to an international\u00a0arbitration court necessarily implies that the investor cannot choose between one and the other,\u00a0until after the previous requirements have been met. It is only at that moment that the investor can\u00a0formalize the consent to an ICSID arbitration\u201d'09. The Claimants would otherwise be choosing\u00a0the ICSID arbitration instead of the local courts before being authorized by the BIT to do so,\u00a0eliminating any useful effect to the mechanism of Article XI110.\n146. \u00a0Moreover, Venezuela argues that the requirement to attempt to amicably settle the dispute for a\u00a0six month period as of the notification date is a jurisdictional requirement111. Only if the dispute\u00a0cannot be amicably settled within such period, the investor may, at its discretion, submit the\u00a0dispute to the jurisdiction of the local courts or to international arbitration112.\n147. \u00a0Venezuela refers to the opinion submitted in this arbitration by Professor August Reinisch, who\u00a0states that it is not a waiting period that is equivalent to the mere lapsing of time, but rather, it\u00a0refers to the need to participate in attempts to reach an amicable agreement113.

Although some tribunals have considered that an amicable\u00a0settlement period is not a jurisdictional requirement, the aforementioned jurisprudence has been\u00a0disproved by more recent decisions\"5. Furthermore, the language of Article XI of the BIT leaves\u00a0no doubt that these conditions are mandatory, and, therefore, have a jurisdictional nature\"6.\n148. \u00a0According to Venezuela, the necessary consequence of the quoted jurisprudence is that the\u00a0consent can be formalized solely after the jurisdictional requirements have been met. Since in an\u00a0arbitration the tribunal\u2019s power is based upon the parties\u2019 agreement to submit the dispute to\u00a0arbitration, if the decision-maker has no power - i.e., jurisdiction - to decide the dispute, then the\u00a0consent is non-existent or legally ineffective\"7. If an investor expresses its acceptance to an\u00a0arbitration offer before the conditions are met, the acceptance would be non-existent and the\u00a0investor's communication cannot have the legal effects sought by it\"8. Venezuela argues that in\u00a0Holiday Inns v. Morocco the tribunal clarified that the consent was not granted on the date on\u00a0which the parties signed the arbitration agreement, but on the date on which the conditions were\u00a0finally met\"9.\n149. \u00a0The Respondent argues that, regardless of the fact that, to this date,there is no decision answering\u00a0the question submitted to the Tribunal in this arbitration, \u201cthe general principle has direct\u00a0application: to the extent the jurisdictional requirements in the treaty have not been met, the\u00a0consent cannot be formalized\u201d'20. Furthermore, contrary to Claimants\u2019 allegations, it is not\u00a0necessary for the BIT to include a different text in order for the requirements of Article XI to\u00a0condition the consent121. Venezuela also refutes the interpretation by the Claimants of Rule 2(3)\u00a0of the Institution Rules in this context, since at no time does it define when the investor has been\u00a0able to validly express his consent122. When conditioned, consent is formalized only when the\u00a0requirements above have been met, and not when the other party expresses its consent123.\n150. \u00a0It is undisputed that the effective date to establish the existence of the formalized mutual consent\u00a0is January 24, 2012 (notification date of the denouncement of the ICSID Convention by\u00a0Venezuela). The six-month period of negotiations set forth in Article XI of the BIT - one of the\u00a0jurisdictional requirements according to Venezuela - expired on May 8, 2012, three and a half\u00a0months after the effective date to formalize the consent. Consequently, the Claimants were never\u00a0authorized by the BIT to formalize the consent124 and any attempt by the Claimants to formalize\u00a0the consent with respect to future disputes in their Dispute Notice is ineffective125.\n151. \u00a0Venezuela also argues that the principle of consent irrevocability set forth in Article 25( 1 ) of the\n114 Counter Memorial, fl 50-55.\n115 Counter Memorial, fl 56-58\n116 Counter Memorial, 60.\n117 Counter Memorial, 62.\n118 Counter Memorial, 63.\n119 Counter Memorial, fl 65-69.\n120 Counter Memorial, 1| 72.\n121 Rejoinder, fl 52-57.\n122 Rejoinder, fl 58-59.\n123 Rejoinder. 1i 60.\n124 Rejoinder, 1| 49.\n24\n  \n\u00a1]3^JLV\u00cdLLEGAS SOJO\nExpert Translator\nmi^nh.m Translations \\_\\_\n  \n125 Counter Memorial, 1| 76.\nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 41 of 375\nICSID Convention solely protects the formalized mutual consent, which did not exist in the present dispute126. Moreover, Venezuela argues that it is not avoiding its international obligations\u00a0by demanding compliance with Article XI of the BIT. The Treaty provides for other alternatives\u00a0of international arbitration, so Venezuela would not evade its international obligations by avoiding\u00a0arbitration under the ICSID Convention127. Furthermore, if the Claimants' logic were true as to\u00a0Venezuela\u2019s intention to evade its obligations through its interpretation of the jurisdictional\u00a0requirements, Venezuela would have denounced the ICSID Convention in any of the 21 ICSID\u00a0arbitrations where it had been previously involved128.\n152. \u00a0Now, therefore, with respect to future disputes, Venezuela states that the dispute did not exist,\u00a0much less its notification, nor did the other two requirements had been fulfilled before the\u00a0Claimants could be authorized to choose to submit the dispute to local courts or to international\u00a0arbitration129.\n153. \u00a0Second. Venezuela claims that no jurisdiction exists for the Tribunal to rule over the indirect\u00a0expropriation claim, insofar as such claim did not exist on January 24, 2012, the effective date of\u00a0denouncement of the ICSID Convention130. The Dispute Notice was premature given that, as of\u00a0the date of its delivery, an administrative proceeding existed on its early stages, which, if finalized,\u00a0it would eventually have resulted in a direct expropriation131. In the Dispute Notice, the Claimants\u00a0made reference to Decree No. 7.394 and to the negotiations with Venezuela in connection with\u00a0such Decree. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of Article XI ( 1 ) of the BIT, a valid notice\u00a0of an expropriation claim assumes that the alleged breach by Venezuela existed prior to the date\u00a0notice132.\n154. \u00a0Also, Claimants did not include an expropriation claim in their Request for Arbitration133.\u00a0Claimants submitted claims under Articles 111, IV and VII of the BIT. Additionally, the Claimants\u2019\u00a0reservation of rights indicates that the events that occurred until the date of the Request for\u00a0Arbitration, were not sufficient to substantiate an expropriation claim. The Administrative\u00a0Ordinance was only described as an aggravating event creating uncertainty, but not as the measure\u00a0that materialized in the expropriation134.\n155. \u00a0According to Venezuela, the expropriation was mentioned for the first time in the Memorial, due\u00a0to the alleged breach of obligations under Article V of the BIT, using the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance as a justification thereof35. The Claimants indicate January 21,2013, as their valuation\u00a0date for their damages in this arbitration (\u201cValuation Date\u201d)136, which is the date immediately\u00a0prior to the publication of the Administrative Ordinance dated January 22, 2013. The Claimants\u00a0alleged their loss of control on January 22, 2013, when Gruma would have been forced to stop\n126 Rejoinder, fl 62-64.\n127 Rejoinder, fl 67-68.\n128 Rejoinder, fl 66.69-72.\n129 Counter Memorial, U 73.

Even the Claimants\u2019 lawyers repeated at the Hearing that the Administrative Ordinance was the tipping point in the expropriation iter\u00a0implemented by Venezuela138.\n156. \u00a0According to Venezuela, Claimants\u2019 arguments are the best statement to indicate that the\u00a0cumulative events occurred before January 22, 2013, had not represented the loss of control of\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca. Therefore, a formalized consent on an expropriation claim could not have\u00a0existed. The dispute regarding an indirect expropriation did not exist on the effective date of\u00a0Venezuela\u2019s denouncement of the ICSID Convention. Any arguments by the Claimants to\u00a0formalize the consent after such date cannot be used to grant jurisdiction to ICSID. Furthermore,\u00a0this dispute over the alleged total loss of control of Gruma over Monaca and Demaseca has not\u00a0been notified to Venezuela as required by Article XI( 1 ) of the BIT139.\n157. \u00a0Venezuela also alleges that the lack of jurisdiction on the expropriation claim is evident because\u00a0there is no relationship between the seizure measures and Decree No. 7.394140.\n158. \u00a0Third. Venezuela claims that the BIT requires both States to be contracting States of the ICSID\u00a0Convention at the time an ICSID arbitration has begun.141. However, the Request for Arbitration\u00a0was filed on May 10, 2013, nine months after the denouncement became effective142. Under\u00a0Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, this dispute could not have been brought before a tribunal\u00a0under the ICSID Convention since Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention before it was\u00a0possible for the Claimants to formalize consent143.\n159. \u00a0Article XI (2)(b) of the BIT allows the investor to choose the ICSID arbitration to the extent that\u00a0\u201ceach State party to this Agreement is a party /to the Convention/\"144. If one of the States has not\u00a0joined the Convention, then an arbitration would solely be available under the rules of the\u00a0Supplementary Mechanism, and not under an arbitration as per the ICSID Convention145.\n160. \u00a0Venezuela criticizes the Claimants\u2019 argument which states that this clause implies that the ICSID\u00a0arbitration is available when both States party to the BIT have been contracting States of the\u00a0Convention, but it does not apply when a State party to the BIT is no longer a contracting State of\u00a0the Convention146. Venezuela argues that this interpretation is groundless since Spain and\u00a0Venezuela had already joined the ICSID Convention when the BIT was signed by both States,\u00a0when it became effective, and because it would also eliminate the possibility of arbitration under\u00a0the ICSID Supplementary Mechanism147. This statement of Article XI of the BIT can only be\u00a0construed as a requirement that each State shall be a contracting party of the ICSID Convention\n137 Counter Memorial, fl 84-85.\n138 Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Writ, H 7.\n139 Counter Memorial, U 91.\n140 Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Writ, 116.\n141 Rejoinder, fl 73-90.\n142 Rejoinder, \\*| 87.\n143 Counter Memorial, 92.\n144 See Rejoinder, 74.\n145 Counter Memorial 94.\n146 Rejoinder, 1] 75.\n26\n  \nL1C.

Venezuela argues that this as an additional alternative grounds for the Tribunal to conclude that it\u00a0has no jurisdiction\"\\*'. The Respondent argues that Article XI (2)(b) of the BIT also includes as\u00a0international arbitration options, an arbitration under the Supplementary Mechanism of the ICSID\u00a0Supplementary Mechanism or under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission for\u00a0International Trade Law. (\u201cUNCITRAL\"). Therefore, there is no reason for the Claimants to insist\u00a0on maintaining an ICSID arbitration when there is no jurisdiction given the denouncement of the\u00a0ICSID Convention by Venezuela. Venezuela stales that there arc alternatives in the BIT to submit\u00a0disputes to an international arbitration after the ICSID Convention has been denounced150.\n161. \u00a0Fourth. Venezuela states that the true investor in this arbitration is Gruma, a Mexican company\u00a0that has no right to benefit from the ICSID Convention, since it is not a national of a contracting\u00a0State of the Convention151.\n162. Gruma. through the Claimants, wants to make the Tribunal believe that Valores and Consorcio\u00a0are investors in Venezuela and. therefore, the investments are Spanish152. The Claimants were\u00a0vehicles used to make Mexican investments look Spanish15\u2019.\n163. \u00a0Venezuela claims that Valores and Consorcio are paper companies (which is confirmed by their\u00a0financial information) who could not have invested in Venezuela154. Gruma was the sole\u00a0administrator of Monaca and Demaseca until 2014155. In addition, the Claimants have no\u00a0employees, offices, telephone numbers or e-mail addresses156. The alleged attomeys-in-fact of the\u00a0Claimants, who advanced the negotiations with Venezuela, are Gruma employees157. For example,\u00a0the Dispute Notice of Claimants had Gruma\u2019s logo158. Venezuela refers to the definition of\u00a0investors under the BIT and argues that \"despite the fad that the Claimants take for granted that\u00a0they meet the definition of Article 1.1 of the [BIT] to be considered as 'investors' and that this\u00a0would he sufficient to undergo an arbitration under the ICSID Convention, this assertion is\u00a0questionable\"^9.\n164. \u00a0Furthermore, even though the Claimants own the shares in Monaca and Demaseca160. there is no\u00a0doubt that the investments were made by Gruma and not by the Claimants161. Gruma incorporated\u00a0Valores in Spain in 2003. and in 2004 it contributed 95% of its shares in Monaca. Gruma\u00a0incorporated Consorcio in 2006 and transferred to Consorcio the shares it had in Demaseca162.\u00a0Moreover. Gruma controls Valores and Consorcio from their date of incorporation.

Additionally, the\u00a0alleged investments of Valores in Monaca and of Consorcio in Demaseca, have not been\u00a0evidenced by the Claimants, flic Claimants only rely on the Statements of Engr. Huerta to\u00a0evidence their status as investors in this case'64. The foreign investment records do not show that\u00a0these investments had been made with foreign capital injection, because in reality they were\u00a0reinvestments of Venezuelan companies within Venezuela165. Venezuela also claims that the\u00a0reality of this investment is evidenced by the intervention of the Mexican government in favour\u00a0of Gruma.166.\n165. \u00a0Venezuela argues that the ICSID Convention exists for the Contracting States and their nationals,\u00a0but it does not exist for an improper use by companies such as Gruma, who is not a national of a\u00a0contracting State167, but rather a Mexican company. It was Gruma who authorized the\u00a0commencement of this arbitration under the ICSID Convention, as it evidenced by copies of\u00a0Gruma\u2019s resolutions168. This arbitration is unheard of since it is an ICSID arbitration initiated with\u00a0the authorization of a Mexican company169. Venezuela thus concludes that \"this arbitration has\u00a0begun by the authorization o f a legal entity that is not a national of a Contracting Stale, using\u00a0paper companies dully incorporated in Spain but without any employees and without a real\u00a0domicile in Spain, trying to invalidly formalize cotisent before been enabled by the Agreement Io\u00a0do so. through a premature notice of a dispute with no grounds to substantiate an expropriation\u00a0claim, by initiating an ICSID arbitration when Venezuela was not a Contracting Slate Io the\u00a0Convention, event hough the Convention includes other options of international arbitration'\u2122.\n166. \u00a0The scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention is to resolve differences between contracting\u00a0States and nationals of other contracting States171. Gruma is a Mexican company which cannot be\u00a0benefited from the Agreement and. therefore, has tried to do so through paper companies. The\u00a0compliance with the nationality requirement set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is\u00a0has precedence over the \"investor\" term of the BIT. Additionally, to be a Spanish \u201cinvestor\"\u00a0protected under the BIT, the \"investor\" must be a Spanish \"national\" under Spanish law173.\u00a0However, the Claimants do not comply with the domicile requirements to be considered Spanish\u00a0nationals1 \u2019. Finally, Venezuela argues that accepting the jurisdiction under the conditions of this\u00a0case would have a negative impact on the ICSID arbitration system174.\nB.

The ICSID Convention became effective on\u00a0June I. 1995. for Venezuela. The depositary received notification of the denouncement of the\u00a0Agreement on January 24, 2012. which became effective six months later, i.e.. on July 25, 2012.\n171. \u00a0flic consent of the Parties to ICSID jurisdiction was formalized on November 9, 2011. with the\u00a0Dispute Notice, prior to Venezuela notifying the denouncement of the Convention178. The\u00a0denouncement docs not affect the obligations of Venezuela with respect to the dispute since the\u00a0Parlies expressed their consent to submit this dispute to ICSID jurisdiction before the\u00a0denouncement was communicated to the depositary of the Convention179. The latter is confirmed\u00a0by Article 72 of the ICSID Convention. The subsequent denouncement of the Convention by\u00a0Venezuela does not affect the rights and obligations arising from the consent previously granted\u00a0by Venezuela to the ICSID jurisdictionl80. Venezuela granted its consent to the ICSID jurisdiction\u00a0in the BIT, which became effective as of September 10, 1997. On the other hand, the Claimants\u00a0granted their consent through the Dispute Notice received by Venezuela on November 9. 20111x1.\n172. \u00a0In the opinion of the Claimants, the conclusion of the waiting period set forth in the BIT. is not a\u00a0condition for the investor to accept Venezuela's offer to submit the disputes to an ICSID\u00a0arbitration182. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article XI of BIT. this rule\u00a0only establishes as a requirement to submit a dispute to arbitration, that the parlies try to amicably\u00a0settle the dispute within a period of six months after the dispute notice,18'.

The conclusion of the waiting period does\u00a0not postpone the formalization of the consent, but it is rather a requirement that must be met to\u00a0commence arbitration186.\n173. \u00a0The Claimants also argue that the attempt to unilaterally withdraw its consent after its written\u00a0accepntace by the Claimants, Venezuela breached Articles 25(1 )(b) and 72 of the ICSID\u00a0Convention, which state that once consent is granted, neither party can, directly or indirectly,\u00a0withdraw it187.\n174. \u00a0The decisions quoted by Venezuela to support its argument on the nature of the waiting period are\u00a0inapplicable188. Venezuela cites nine cases where the central argument was whether the claimants\u00a0could initiate an arbitration before complying with the requirements set forth in the investment\u00a0treaty. None of the decisions offered by Venezuela explain when its consent formalized if the\u00a0claimants accept the offer of consent before initiating the arbitration, nor do they explain if the\u00a0submission of the dispute to arbitration is conditioned by the offer to fulfillment of a waiting\u00a0period189. Even if the waiting period is considered to have a jurisdictional nature, it does not\u00a0determine the moment of consent and nothing prevents the waiting period requirement from being\u00a0fulfilled after the parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the ICSID190.\n175. \u00a0According to the Claimants, none of the cases cited by Venezuela supports the argument stating\u00a0that the consent of the parties is invalid for being subject to a procedural requirement which must\u00a0be fulfilled before commencing the arbitration191. Venezuela relies on certain arbitration decisions\u00a0which refer to essential applicability requirements of the ICSID Convention, but which cannot be\u00a0compared with the requirements that must be fulfilled before commencing an arbitration192.\n176. \u00a0The Claimants refer to the arbitrations of Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine and Abacial v. Argentina to\u00a0argue that, in other arbitral decisions it has been accepted that an investor of a contracting state\u00a0can accept the consent offer of a treaty before the waiting period set forth in the treaty elapses193.\n177. \u00a0Furthermore, the Claimants are nationals of another contracting State pursuant to Article 25(2)(b)\u00a0of the ICSID Convention.

There is no factual1\\*\u201d or legal basis to support that the Tribunal\u00a0lacks jurisdiction because the real investor in this arbitration is Gruma. as Venezuela claims196.\u00a0Venezuela ignores the definition of \"investor\" in the BIT and tries to establish nationality\u00a0requirements in addition to those provided for in the Treaty, while ignoring the legal status of\u00a0Valores and Consorcio197. The incorporation of a legal entity under Spanish law is sufficient for\u00a0said legal entity to enjoy the protection of the BIT198. Arbitral tribunals have refused to ignore the\u00a0legal status of investors when the applicable treaties define the nationality of the investor with the\u00a0criterion of incorporation or formation199. Furthermore, it is not true, as Venezuela alleges, that\u00a0Valores and Consorcio arc not Spanish companies under Spanish law2\"\". In any case, the definition\u00a0of investors of the Agreement, and not Spanish law. determines whether the nationality\u00a0requirements have been met in accordance with Article 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention201.\n179. \u00a0Furthermore, it is not true that Claimants have their administration and management center outside\u00a0of Spain202. Both Valores and Consorcio submit their tax returns in Spain and comply with the\u00a0formalities set forth in Spanish laws202. Valores and Consorcio are entities holding foreign\u00a0securities (or holding companies), thus they require a reduced administrative structure and their\u00a0most relevant decisions are taken in Madrid by the respective management bodies. Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0argument that the arbitration was initiated through a Gruma\u2019s resolution20'1 is also false.\n180. \u00a0The Claimants also argue that rations vo/z/n/a/w jurisdiction exists. Venezuela's consent is\u00a0granted in Article XI of the BIT205, and the requirements of Article XI arc met in this case. Each\u00a0of the Claimants is a Spanish \"investor\u201d in accordance with Article l( 1 )(b) of the BIT. Their claims\u00a0arise from the breach by Venezuela of its obligations under the BIT.\n181. \u00a0The Claimants allege that on November 9.2011. they notified in writing this dispute in accordance\u00a0with Article Xl( I ) of the BIT. In such communication, the Claimants informed Venezuela that a\u00a0dispute had arisen under the BIT \"as a result of the measures [...] described, among others The\u00a0Claimants describe the dispute in detail, and invited Venezuela to hold conversations seeking an\u00a0amicable dispute resolution206. The Claimants made reference, among other measures, to \"Decree\u00a0[No. 7.394] to the intervention measures imposed by the Republic on [the Companies], and to\u00a0the faded attempts to find a negotiated dispute resolution\"207.\n182. \u00a0The Claimants also argue that the expropriation dispute existed long before Venezuela denounced\u00a0the ICSID Convention, and it was this dispute that the Claimants communicated to Venezuela in\n195 Hearing.

The Administrative Ordinance did not create a new controversy but, instead, aggravated the existing controversy and culminated an expropriation proceeding that was\u00a0in the process of being executed when Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention209. According\u00a0to the Claimants, there is sufficient evidence on the relationship between Decree No. 7.394 and\u00a0the Administrative Ordinance. It is a single controversy over the creeping expropriation of\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca, which was launched and began to be implemented years before Venezuela\u00a0denounced the Convention210. In addition, Decree No. 7.394 and the measures before and after it\u00a0are part of the same dispute2\".\n183. The dispute was duly notified as per the BIT212. In November 2011, the Claimants expressly\u00a0notified in writing their disagreement regarding the expropriation measures taken by Venezuela:\n\u201cOn May 12, 2010, the Republic [...] published [...] the Presidential Decree No. 7.394 [...] ordering the \u2018forced acquisition\u2019 and/or \u2018expropriation\u2019 of\u00a0[MONACA and DEMASECA], [...]\nDue to the Decree, in June 2010, the Republic created a Liaison Commission to monitor the administration and operations of MONACA and DEMASECA.\u00a0The Republic has demanded that VALORES and CONSORCIO, through\u00a0MONACA and DEMASECA, pay the salaries and expenses of the current 20\u00a0(twenty) members of the Liaison Commission, which exceed US$1 million\u00a0per year. The members of the Liaison Commission, are located in the facilities\u00a0of MONACA and DEMASECA, and they use of the computers and offices of\u00a0MONACA and DEMASECA and, generally, hinder the free direction and\u00a0management of MONACA and DEMASECA by imposing controls and\u00a0authorizations for the management and payments of taxes, payrolls, purchases\u00a0of raw materials and suppliers in general, as well as by delaying the issuance\u00a0of the annual update certificates of the investments registries in Venezuela\u00a0prepared by the Investors and filed before the Foreign Investments Agency\u00a0(SIEX) in spite of complying with the applicable regulations, among others.\u00a0Due to Decree 7.394, MONACA and DEMASECA are unable, inter alia, to\u00a0pay royalties, repatriate capital and capital investments, as well as to send\u00a0profits abroad, and to make dispositions of assets outside their ordinary course\u00a0of business. For the same reasons, VALORES and CONSORCIO are\u00a0prevented, inter alia, from transferring their shares in MONACA and\u00a0DEMASECA to third parties. [...]\nIn accordance with the foregoing, and for the purposes of Article XI( 1 ) of the Convention, we respectfully inform You that the Investors consider that a\u00a0dispute regarding investments has arisen between the Republic and the\u00a0Investors as a result of, inter alia, the aforementioned measures, which\u00a0contravene and are incompatible with the obligations assumed by the Republic\u00a0in the Convention. Specifically, the mentioned measures contravene, inter\u00a0alia, the following obligations of the Republic set forth in the Convention: (i)\u00a0investments made in a Contracting Party\u2019s territory by Investors of the other\u00a0Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations, or\n208 Brief, K 168; Hearing.

Nationalization and expropriation) [...]\nThe Investors hereby, and for the purposes of the resolution of all the previously mentioned disputes related to the investments, as well as all those\u00a0disputes which may arise in the future between the Investors and the Republic,\u00a0accept the consent granted by the Republic in the aforementioned Article XI,\u00a0and, in turn, the Investors express their consent to ICSID jurisdiction to resolve\u00a0such disputes through ICSID arbitration(s).\u201d213\n184. \u00a0The Claimants contend that the term \u201cdispute\u201d is a \u201cdisagreement on a legal or factual matter, a\u00a0conflict of legal points of view or of interests between the parties\" requiring a minimum of\u00a0communication, i.e., at least one of the parties must have raised the issue with the other party.\"\u00a0214 The Claimants notified their \u201cdisagreement\u201d on Venezuela\u2019s measures in their Dispute Notice\u00a0, identified how the measures violated the BIT, and objected them months before Venezuela\u00a0denounced the ICSID Convention215.\n185. \u00a0If Venezuela\u2019s argument were to be accepted, it would mean that Venezuela could evade its\u00a0international responsibility simply by denouncing the ICSID Convention and adopting a\u00a0subsequent measure that would aggravate the already notified dispute216. This interpretation\u00a0would negatively affect the fundamental principle of the ICSID Convention which states that the\u00a0consent of the Parties cannot be unilaterally withdrawn through direct or indirect means217. In the\u00a0Request for Arbitration, the Claimants expressly reserved the right to submit additional claims,\u00a0including an expropriation claim,218 and in the Dispute Notice they granted their consent to ICSID\u00a0jurisdiction regarding disputes \u201cwhich have arisen as well as all those disputes which may arise\u00a0in the future\u201d219. There is no doubt that consent to ICSID jurisdiction can refer to existing or future\u00a0disputes220.\n186. \u00a0Venezuela\u2019s argument stating that the Claimants could not have formalized the consent with\u00a0respect to the direct expropriation dispute, nor that they could have notified such dispute because\u00a0it did not exist when the Claimants sent their Dispute Notice, fails to acknowledge the facts and\u00a0should be rejected. The distinction Venezuela is trying to make between a dispute over a direct\u00a0and indirect expropriation is artificial and deficient since Venezuela had already stated, through a\u00a0Decree, that it would necessarily acquire Monaca and Demaseca and had taken measures to\u00a0indirectly achieve this purpose221. There is no factual or legal basis for Venezuela\u2019s argument that\u00a0a dispute exists and can be validly notified only when events supporting a claim of an indirect\u00a0expropriation exist. Venezuela did not cite cases supporting this position and argued to the\n213 Claimants\u2019 letter to the Executive Vice-president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, November 7, 2011 (the \u201cDispute\u00a0Notice\u201d) (Annex C-5) [emphasis added].

Venezuela222.\n187. \u00a0Furthermore, neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT require an existing dispute at the time of\u00a0formalizing the consent to ICSID223 arbitration, nor does the BIT require that the Claimants notify\u00a0each of the measures which form part of or which aggravate or continue, an already notified\u00a0dispute224.\n188. There is no doubt that the dispute was notified on November 9,2011, when Venezuela had already\u00a0expressed its intention to appropriate Claimants\u2019 investments and when it had adopted the vast\u00a0majority of measures to achieve such purpose. That notification is sufficient under Article XI of\u00a0the BIT and, therefore, it is irrelevant that the Dispute Notice did not make reference to the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance225.\n189. \u00a0Likewise, according to the Claimants, the BIT does not require that both States, Venezuela and\u00a0Spain, be contracting states to the Convention at the time of commencement of an ICSID\u00a0arbitration226. The Respondent argues that Article XI(2)(b) of the BIT allows the investor to\u00a0choose an arbitration before ICSID subject to the condition that \u201ceach State party to this\u00a0Agreement has joined [the Convention]\u201d 221. However, the Claimants argue that Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0reading of this Article is contrary to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the BIT, and that\u00a0Venezuela intends to add the following text to the BIT: \u201cand when no State party has ceased to\u00a0be a Contracting State or has denounced the ICSID Convention\u201d22\\*. According to the text of the\u00a0BIT, the fact that a State has joined the ICSID Convention determines the application or not of\u00a0the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Supplementary Mechanism 229. Article XI of the BIT makes\u00a0no reference to the eventual denouncement of the ICSID Convention by any of the States.\n190. \u00a0The interpretation of Venezuela is also contrary to the scope and purpose of the BIT and the ICSID\u00a0Convention, inasmuch, as explained by Professor Schreuer, such an interpretation would\u00a0eliminate the protection granted by Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, given that it would allow\u00a0States to evade their international obligations under the ICSID Convention through their simple\u00a0denouncement2M. The Claimants propose as an example, the Agreement between the Republic\u00a0of Venezuela and the Republic of Costa Rica for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of\u00a0Investments, executed on March 17, 1997, where such States expressly agreed that the ICSID\u00a0arbitration would not be available if the Respondent would have denounced the ICSID Convention\u00a0at the time an arbitration had commenced231.\n191. \u00a0Likewise, Venezuela is trying to confuse the offer made by Venezuela to submit the disputes\u00a0under the BIT, to ICSID arbitration (provided that Venezuela has joined the ICSID Convention),\n222 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Writ, 60.\n223 Claimants' Post-Hearing Writ, 63.\n224 Claimants' Post-Hearing Writ, 64.\n225 Claimants' Post-Hearing Writ, 65.\n226 Brief, Tffl 157-166; Hearing.

The Claimants propose as an example Venoklim v. Venezuela, where the tribunal concluded that the consent had been formalized before the denouncement of\u00a0the ICSID Convention became effective, rejecting the Respondent's objection, and mentioning\u00a0that the date on which the last of the parties granted its consent to ICSID arbitration \u201cZs the\u00a0effective date as ofwhen the consent consequences become effective\"233. The consent of the Parties\u00a0was formalized on November 9, 2011, even before Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention,\u00a0and when, at such time, Venezuela was still a contracting State of the ICSID Convention234.\u00a0Although Spain and Venezuela were already parties to the ICSID Convention when they signed\u00a0the BIT in 1995, Venezuela ignores that when the BIT was negotiated, Venezuela had not yet\u00a0ratified the ICSID Convention and there was no certainty that it would do so235.\n192. The Claimants indubitably and unambiguously appointed the ICSID as the means for dispute\u00a0resolution236. Moreover, the Claimants have not submitted this dispute to the courts of Venezuela\u00a0nor have they agreed with Venezuela to submit the dispute to another dispute resolution\u00a0mechanism237.\nC. Analysis by the Tribunal\n193. \u00a0Below, the Tribunal will analyze each of the four objections presented by Venezuela, in the order\u00a0in which they were raised in its Counter Memorial. In analyzing each of these matters, the Tribunal\u00a0has considered all the arguments presented by the Parties, both written and oral. The fact that a\u00a0claim has not been quoted or summarized does not mean that it was not considered by the Tribunal\u00a0when reaching its decision. Specifically, the Court emphasizes that its conclusions are limited to\u00a0the requirements of this particular case and to the scope of the arguments presented by the Parties.\n1. First jurisdictional objection\n194. \u00a0Venezuela argues that the Dispute Notice did not formalize, nor could it have formalized the\u00a0consent to ICSID arbitration since such consent is only formalized once all the requirements set\u00a0forth in Article XI of the BIT have been met. On the other hand, the Claimants argue that the\u00a0Parties had formalized their consent on November 9, 2011, upon receipt of the Notification of the\u00a0Dispute, prior to the denouncement notification of the Convention by Venezuela on January 24,\u00a02012.\n195. \u00a0The Tribunal will first state the facts that are most relevant to the undisputed jurisdictional\u00a0objection of Venezuela invoked by the Parties:\n(i) \u00a0On November 9, 2011, Venezuela received the Dispute Notice.\n(ii) \u00a0On January 24, 2012, the ICSID Convention depositary received a written\u00a0denouncement notice of the Convention by Venezuela.\n232 Brief, H 163.\n233 Brief, U 164 quoting Venoklim v.

Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set\u00a0forth in this Agreement shall be notified in writing, providing detail\u00a0information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the\u00a0investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle\u00a0these differences amicably.\n2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in such manner within a six month period,\u00a0as of the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph 1, it will be\u00a0submitted, at the investor\u2019s choice:\na) To the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the\u00a0investment was made in, or\nb) To the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)\u00a0created by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between\u00a0States and Nationals or Other States, opened for its signature in Washington on\u00a0March 18, 1965, when each State party to this Agreement has joined it.

The Parties do not seem to dispute that, for interpreting the terms of the BIT and the ICSID\u00a0Convention, it is necessary to refer to the general rule of interpretation included in Article 31(1)\u00a0of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\u201cVienna Convention\u201d) which establishes that\u00a0\u201c/h/ treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given\u00a0to the terms of the treaty in their context and taking into account its scope and purpose \u201d239. The\u00a0Tribunal considers that these elements of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention form a single\u00a0rule of interpretation and should not be taken in isolation. The function of the Tribunal is to\u00a0determine the meaning of what was agreed in the BIT rather than establishing interpretation lines\u00a0applicable to other treaties with similar texts.\n200. \u00a0The Tribunal considers the description of the tribunal in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia on the\u00a0interpretation process in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention:\n\u201cThe interpretation provided in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is a process of concentric circles, in which the interpreter begins to consider,\u00a0within the framework of the. general rule 1) the ordinary meaning of the .\u00a0treaty\u2019s terms, 2) in its context, and 3) in light of the scope and purpose of the\u00a0treaty, and going through such hermeneutic three steps path, it advances\u00a0towards the appropriate interpretation. [,..]\u201d240\n201. \u00a0The Tribunal will rely on the general rule of treaty interpretation, and also on the complementary\u00a0rule provided in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, insofar as it considers its application to be\u00a0necessary241.\n202. The Claimants and Venezuela seem to agree in an important part of the interpretation of Articles\u00a071 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the Respondent argues, and the Claimants seem to\u00a0accept, that Article 72 of the Convention applies if the mutual consent to ICSID jurisdiction is\u00a0formalized before the denouncement of the Convention242. The discussion of the Parties focuses\u00a0on whether, in this case, the mutual consent to the ICSID jurisdiction was formalized before the\u00a0denouncement of the Convention.\n203. \u00a0The Claimants argue that the consent of the Parties was formalized through the Dispute Notice,\u00a0received on November 9,2011, where they expressly stated that \u201cThe Investors hereby accept the\u00a0consent granted by the Republic in the aforementioned Article XI, and, in turn, the Investors\u00a0express their consent to ICSID jurisdiction to resolve such disputes through ICSID\u00a0arbitration^)\"243. Such Dispute Notice was sent before the denouncement of the ICSID\u00a0Convention by Venezuela, on January 24,2012. Although the Respondent does not agree that the\u00a0Dispute Notice formalized the consent, it does not deny that the Claimants\u2019 intention was precisely\n239 The Tribunal notes that Venezuela is not a party to the Vienna Convention. However, it is a peaceful fact that the interpretation\u00a0rules set forth in such Convention, reflect the international law and, as already mentioned, the Parties do not dispute that these\u00a0rules apply for interpreting the Treaty.\n240 Aguas del Tunari v.

The Respondent argues\u00a0that it is only after the three requirements have been met, that the BIT \u201cauthorizes the investor to\u00a0choose between submitting the dispute to the competent courts of the host State or to an\u00a0international arbitration\u201d246.\n206. \u00a0Professor Schreuer and Professor Reinisch agree that the BIT imposes as a requirement that the\u00a0investor negotiate during six months as of the date of the Dispute Notice, before the investor can\u00a0submit the corresponding claim before the national or arbitral jurisdiction. Their discrepancy\u00a0refers to the time when the investor can opt for the arbitration forum and formalize their consent\u00a0to arbitration.\n207. \u00a0According to Professor Schreuer, Claimants could opt for arbitration at any time, even before the\u00a0commencement of the six-month negotiation period in the BIT247. On other hand, Professor\u00a0Reinisch considers that the Claimants could not opt for arbitration, at which time they would grant\u00a0their consent, until they had exhausted the six months of negotiations set forth in the BIT248.\n208. \u00a0In summary, for Venezuela, the Claimants did not formalize the consent with the Dispute Notice\u00a0since, in accordance with Article XI of the BIT, solely once the dispute is notified and after the\u00a0six months period is exhausted, the investor can grant its consent and submit the dispute to the\u00a0chosen forum. According to Venezuela, the text of Article XI(2) of the BIT, specifically the\u00a0expression \u201cwill be submitted, at the investor\u2019s choice\u201d, shows that only after the amicably\u00a0negotiation period has elapsed, the investor's choice can be made with respect to the dispute\u2019s\u00a0forum.\n209. \u00a0Venezuela understands that the requirement to attempt to amicably settle the dispute within a six\u00a0month period has a jurisdictional nature.\n210. \u00a0The Tribunal accepts that it is a complex matter, in which each position is supported by the opinion\u00a0of well-known international law experts on foreign investments, and after a careful analysis has\u00a0concluded that, in the circumstances of the specific case and in light of the arguments presented\u00a0by the Parties, it does not agree with Venezuela\u2019s interpretation of Article XI of the BIT.\n211. \u00a0In the first place, the ordinary meaning of the terms in the BIT in its context does not condition\u00a0the possibility of the investor granting its consent to the fulfillment of the three previous stages.\n244 Counter Memorial, \\*] 42; Rejoinder, Ii 42; Brief 124\n245 See Prof. Reinisch's Second Report, D 42 (\u201cArticle XI of the Spain and Venezuela BIT includes three steps: I) the Dispute\u00a0Notice, 2) the six months period to reach an amicably settlement, and then 3) the investor's choice between local courts and\u00a0international arbitration \u201d); Prof. Schreuer\u2019s Report.

The\u00a0Treaty does not require that the consent to arbitration ICSID and the submission of the dispute be\u00a0given through the same document.\n212. \u00a0It does not follow from the text of the BIT, nor does it conceptually result from its context, that\u00a0the investor\u2019s right to consent to ICSID arbitration must be equated with the investor\u2019s right to\u00a0\u201csubmit\u201d the dispute to national courts or to international arbitration upon the investor\u2019s election.\u00a0The submission of the dispute is the first procedural step triggering the forum the investor has\u00a0chosen. The Parties agree that, in the case at hand, the submission of the dispute occurred with\u00a0the submission of the Request for Arbitration.\n213. \u00a0The Parties do not seem to dispute that, upon signing the BIT, Venezuela granted its consent to\u00a0arbitration (Article XI of the BIT)249. With respect to the consent of the investor, the text of Article\u00a0XI does not subject it to any condition. If item 2 of Article XI contains a condition, it could only\u00a0refer to the submission of the dispute, i.e., at the commencement of the procedure before the local\u00a0courts or before the arbitral tribunal.\n214. \u00a0Similarly, nothing in the text suggests that such a choice can solely be made after the negotiation\u00a0period has expired.\n215. \u00a0In fact, Article XI of BIT refers to the dispute notification:\n\u201c1. Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set\u00a0forth in this Agreement shall be notified in writing, providing detail\u00a0information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the\u00a0investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle\u00a0these differences amicably.\n2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in such manner within a six months period, as of the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph I, it will be\u00a0submitted, at the investor\u2019s choice\u201d, [emphasis added]\n216. \u00a0The Tribunal considers that the text does not refer - as appears to be inferred from Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0interpretation - that, only after six months have elapsed, the investor can make his forum election.\u00a0The reference to \u201cthe\u201d investor\u2019s choice means a specific choice: \u201cor the investor\u2019s choice\u201d, which\u00a0could be both, a choice made after six months, and an election - the choice - made prior to that\u00a0period. Once the \u201cchoice\u201d is made, the dispute shall be submitted to the dispute resolution\u00a0mechanism chosen by the investor, provided that six months have elapsed since the Dispute\u00a0Notice without the parties having been able to amicably settle the dispute.\n217. \u00a0The States parties to BIT granted to the investors of the other party with the authority, in Article\u00a0XI of the BIT, to choose to submit themselves to the national courts of the host State of the\u00a0investment or to international arbitration. For the Tribunal, the terms and context of Article XI(2)\u00a0do not imply that the election can solely be made at the time of submitting the dispute to\u00a0arbitration. The investor is free to exercise this right under the terms of the BIT and nothing\u00a0prevents the investor from making such election in advance.\n218. The Tribunal considers that with the Dispute Notice, the Claimants granted their consent to ICSID\u00a0jurisdiction. In the case at hand, the Claimants also made their election on the mechanisms offered\u00a0by Venezuela in Article Xl(2) of the BIT.\n249 See Hearing. Day 3, Tr. 690:9-692-5; 696:9-22.\n  \n39\n  \nLIC.

However,\u00a0the Tribunal does not agree with Venezuela that Article XI of the BIT. which allows the consent\u00a0and submission of the dispute to be simultaneous, imposes the obligation that said consent and\u00a0submission of the dispute to ICSID arbitration, have simultaneous effects.\n220. \u00a0The Tribunal does not find in the text or in the context of the BIT a provision prohibiting or\u00a0limiting the possibility for the investor, at the lime of the dispute notification, to grant its consent\u00a0and opt for the arbitration forum. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the expression of the BIT,\u00a0according to which the parties should try to amicably settle the dispute \"to the extent possible\".\u00a0does not suggest that the negotiations are a prerequisite for the validity of the consent.\n221. \u00a0finally, an interpretation such as the one proposed by Venezuela could promote, as Professor\u00a0Schrcucr points out. an eventual unfair behavior from the States and a violation of their\u00a0international commitments. Once the controversy has been notified and knowing the need to\u00a0exhaust the six-month period for the investor to express its consent, the State could denounce the\u00a0Convention to escape from its commitments250.\n222. \u00a0For the Tribunal, there is no doubt that the three steps identified by the Parties251 and\u00a0aforementioned were met. The Claimants submitted a written notification of the existence of a\u00a0dispute with Venezuela, the Parlies tried to amicably settle the dispute and the six months period\u00a0before the Claimants submitted the dispute to arbitration, i.e., before the procedure commenced\u00a0with the submission of the Request for Arbitration. To the extent that the BIT did not subject the\u00a0formalization of the consent to conditions precedent, which in the case at hand, the consent was\u00a0granted with the Dispute Notice and that the requirements were met before submitting the dispute,\u00a0the arguments of the Respondent do not prosper.\n223. \u00a0Finally, with respect to the cases mentioned by Venezuela in reference to the waiting period and\u00a0to the fact of whether such period has a jurisdictional or procedural nature, the Tribunal agrees\u00a0with Professor Schreuer's conclusion,252 establishing that this difference between the Parties is not\u00a0relevant, inasmuch that the period was actually observed and the Parties conducted negotiations\u00a0to try to reach an agreement before submitting the dispute to international arbitration by\u00a0submitting the Request for Arbitration.\n224. \u00a0The Tribunal then rejects Venezuela's first jurisdictional challenge, insofar as Venezuela gave its\u00a0consent to ICSID jurisdiction in Article XI of the BIT, which became effective as of September\u00a010. 1997, and the Claimants validly granted their consent in the Dispute Notice received on\u00a0November 9, 2011. There was mutual consent by the Parlies prior to Venezuela's denouncement\u00a0of the ICSID Convention and. therefore, such denouncement docs not affect the jurisdiction of\u00a0this Tribunal.\n2. Second jurisdictional objection\n225. \u00a0The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the indirect expropriation claim\n250 See Hearing. Day 3.

SAUL VILLEGAS SOJO\nExpert Translator < Directum Translations\n  \nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 57 of 375\nfor two different independent reasons25\u2019. First, Venezuela alleges that \"the Claimants could not have formalized the consent on an indirect expropriation claim which did not exist prior to the\u00a0denouncement of the Convention by the Republic\" 25'. The Respondent alleges that, according to\u00a0the arguments of the Claimants themselves, the dispute over the indirect expropriation could not\u00a0have existed until January 22, 2013, the publication date of the Administrative Ordinance which,\u00a0according to the Claimants, crystallized the alleged expropriation255 . The Respondent warns that\u00a0on the date of receipt of the Dispute Notice (November 9, 2011 ) and on the date of denouncement\u00a0of the Agreement by Venezuela (January 24, 2012), \"events that could support a claim of indirect\u00a0expropriation were not present at the time.\"256 Therefore, it concludes that the Dispute Notice was\u00a0premature and. consequently, invalid with respect to the expropriation claim257.\n226. \u00a0Second. Venezuela argues that \"the controversy over the alleged total loss of control by G RU MA\u00a0on MONACA and DEMASECA - which the Claimants argue in their Memorial that it constitutes\u00a0an indirect expropriation - has not been notified to the Republic as required by the Article XI. ! of\u00a0the Agreement\"25\\* To the extent that there had been no notification regarding the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance and its effects, then, the six-month negotiation period provided for in the Treaty would\u00a0not have commenced either259.\n227. \u00a0On other hand, the Claimants argue that the Administrative Ordinance did not generate a new\u00a0dispute, but that it rather (i) aggravated a dispute which existed as of the publication of Decree\u00a0No. 7.394 in May 2010, and (ii) concluded an expropriation process that had begun with such\u00a0Decree and was in process of being executed when the Respondent denounced the Convention260.\u00a0In such sense, the Claimants argue that they have no obligation to notify each measure adopted\u00a0by Venezuela solely having as purpose aggravating or continuing an already notified existent\u00a0dispute261.\n228. \u00a0The Tribunal will successively analyze Venezuela's arguments supporting this objection to the\u00a0Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n229. \u00a0The Tribunal has already concluded that the Claimants consented to ICSID jurisdiction through\u00a0the Dispute Notice. Therefore, the first question that the Court must answer in connection with\u00a0this second jurisdictional objection is whether the consent granted through said notification covers\u00a0the indirect expropriation claim filed by the Claimants in this arbitration.\n230. \u00a0Article XI( I ) of the BIT establishes that the investor must notify in writing the existence of a\u00a0dispute to the State receiving the investment, as follows:\n251 Counter Memorial. \\* 91.\n254 Counter Memorial. \\* 90.\n255 See Counter Memorial. V 86-89. The Tribunal notes that references to the \"crystallization\" of an indirect expropriation were\u00a0introduced bj the Respondent. The Claimants have not used this term, but have argued that the alleged progressive interference\u00a0by Venezuela in the Companies had its \"climax\" with the Administrative Ordinance. (.See. e.g..

To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle\u00a0these differences amicably.\u201d [emphasis added]\n231. \u00a0In accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, Article XI(1) of BIT requires (i) the\u00a0existence of a dispute and (ii) that the dispute should be over the compliance of the obligations by\u00a0the State receiving the investment under the Treaty. A dispute is \u201cdisagreement on a legal or\u00a0factual matter, a conflict oflegal points ofview or of interests between the parties.\"262As Professor\u00a0Schreuer observes, the existence of a dispute requires, at least, that one of the parties has raised\u00a0the issue with the other party263.\n232. \u00a0In the Dispute Notice, the Claimants referred, inter alia, to the effects of Decree No. 7.394, the\u00a0acts carried out by the Liaison Commission, the imposition of controls and authorizations in the\u00a0management of the companies, and the delay in the issuance of the annual update of the investment\u00a0register before the Foreign Investments Agency (SIEX)2M. The Claimants also stated that they\u00a0were unable to pay royalties, repatriate capital and investment income, send profits abroad, carry\u00a0out an asset disposal outside their ordinary course of business and transfer their shares in Monaca\u00a0and Demaseca to third parties265.\n233. \u00a0Consequently, the Claimants reported that a dispute with Venezuela arose as a result, inter alia,\u00a0of the measures and actions described in the Dispute Notice, and that said measures, and that such\u00a0actions contravened Article V of BIT, relating to expropriation266. In such respect, the Dispute\u00a0Notice establishes:\n\u201c(l]n accordance with the foregoing, and for the purposes of Article XI( 1 ) of the Agreement, we respectfully inform You that the Investors consider that a\u00a0dispute regarding investments has arisen between the Republic and the\u00a0Investors as a result of, inter alia, the aforementioned measures, which\u00a0contravene and are incompatible with the obligations assumed by the Republic\u00a0in the Agreement. Specifically, the aforementioned measures contravene, inter\u00a0alia, the following obligations of the Republic set forth in the Agreement: (i)\u00a0investments in the territory of a Contracting Party made by Investors of the\u00a0other Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations.\n262 See Mavrommatis Case (Greece v.

Nationalization and expropriation)\u201d [emphasis added]\n234. \u00a0According to the Respondent, the notification claim for the breach of obligations under the BIT\u00a0with respect to the expropriation is invalid inasmuch Venezuela had not breached its obligations\u00a0under the Treaty267. The Respondent alleges that \"[sjolely after the expropriation occurred, and\u00a0only if the requirements of Article V are not met [...] a breach by the Republic to its obligations\u00a0under the Agreement which could be subject to a Dispute Notice, could exist\" 268. The Tribunal\u00a0does not agree with this statement: the notification referred to in Article XI( 1 ) of BIT refers to the\u00a0existence of a \u201cdispute\u201d - i.e., a disagreement on a point of law or fact - regarding to compliance\u00a0with Treaty obligations.\n235. \u00a0Whether or not there was a breach of the BIT, including Article V - expropriation - of the Treaty,\u00a0is precisely the subject of the dispute and, therefore, a matter submitted to the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\u00a0From the content of the Dispute Notice, it follows that, at least since November 9, 2011, a dispute\u00a0existed between the Parties with respect to the alleged breach of Respondent\u2019s obligations under\u00a0the Treaty with respect to expropriation issues.\n236. Now, therefore, the Respondent suggests that the Administrative Ordinance caused an\u00a0expropriation dispute different than the one arising from Decree No. 7.394269. Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0position seems to be based on the fact that the Claimants ''tried to notify a direct expropriation in\u00a0their Dispute Notice\" based on the publication of the Decree No. 7.394270, and it was until they\u00a0filed their Memorial that, for the first time, they presented a claim for an indirect expropriation\u00a0that would have been triggered with the publication of the Administrative Ordinance on January\u00a022, 2013271.\n237. \u00a0However, there is nothing in the Dispute Notice supporting this conclusion. The Claimants\u00a0expressly stated that the measures described in the Dispute Notice are contrary to Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0obligations under Article V of the BIT which refers, both, to direct expropriations and to \"any\u00a0other measure of similar features or effects\" to an expropriation. Neither the Claimants qualify\u00a0the expropriation as direct or indirect, nor does it follow from the text of the Dispute Notice that\u00a0their intention was to qualify the measures as a direct expropriation.\n238. \u00a0Furthermore, the circumstances referred to by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice - interference\u00a0in the management of Monaca and Demaseca, the impossibility of paying royalties, repatriating\u00a0capital and disposing their shares in the Companies, inter alia - are the same as, according to them\u00a0pursuant to their writs submitted to this Tribunal, they amount to an indirect expropriation of their\u00a0investments in Venezuela. In other words, the alleged effects of the Venezuela\u2019s measures and\u00a0actions, which were expressly denounced by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice, are essentially\u00a0the same as those discussed during the arbitration.\n267 Rejoinder.

In effect, the position held by the Claimants in this arbitration is\u00a0that through a series of measures - including Decree No. 7.394 and the actions carried out by the\u00a0Liaison Commission, inter alia - the State has submitted its investments to an indirect and\u00a0progressive expropriation concluding with the publication of the Administrative Ordinance.\n240. \u00a0One part of the dispute that has been submitted to the Tribunal is precisely whether Decree No.\u00a07.394, the seizure and special administration measures and the Administrative Ordinance are\u00a0related or not in the terms indicated by the Claimants. Also, the dispute lies in whether such\u00a0measures caused a loss of economic benefits or the investment control equivalent to an\u00a0expropriation. The Parties dispute the effects of the Administrative Ordinance and its relationship\u00a0with Decree No. 7.394 and with the measures described by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice.\u00a0The Claimants argue, in part, as a measure which concluded in the expropriation process272 and\u00a0as Venezuela\u2019s decision which aggravated an existing dispute since the publication of Decree No.\u00a07.394 in May 2010273. Venezuela denies the effects the Claimants attribute to the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance and denies their connection with the Decree No. 7.394 and the measures derived from\u00a0it to which the Claimants attribute expropriation effects.\n241. \u00a0With respect to the Administrative Ordinance, the Tribunal could only accept the jurisdictional\u00a0exception proposed by Venezuela if it were clear that a second dispute was generated from the\u00a0measures arising from the criminal proceedings. As it will be explained in further detail below,\u00a0the Tribunal has found that the seizure and special administration measures on the Companies,\u00a0whose foundation is the alleged participation of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco in the capital of Monaca\u00a0and Demaseca, were executed by Venezuelan officials in confusion with the purpose being\u00a0pursued and the provisions of Decree No. 7.394 and those arising from Venezuela\u2019s food\u00a0policies274. During the term of the Liaison Commission at the Monaca and Demaseca facilities,\u00a0there was convergence and confusion between the functions of the Liaison Commission members\u00a0and those exercised by the special administrators. Even after the withdrawal of the Liaison\u00a0Commission and when the special administrators were the only remaining at Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca facilities, there was no clarity as to the origin of the decisions made by the Respondent\u2019s\u00a0officials, as to whether they were based on the seizure and special administration measures, the\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 or the compulsory acquisition process. Furthermore, the Liaison Commission\u00a0members created in the framework of the compulsory acquisition process, were then appointed as\u00a0special administrators in the Administrative Ordinance. The Tribunal concludes that there has\u00a0been a de facto relationship between Decree No. 7.394 and the seizure and special administration\u00a0measures, including the Administrative Ordinance, and that they are all part of the same dispute\u00a0notified by the Claimants in their Dispute Notice.\n242. \u00a0It is undisputed that, as of the date on which the Claimants expressed their consent to arbitration,\u00a0the Administrative Ordinance, a consequence of this criminal proceeding, had not been issued. If\u00a0the Administrative Ordinance is part of the same dispute and the Claimants could not have known\u00a0it on the date of their consent - since it had not been issued - the Claimants could not be required\u00a0to include it in the notice. They could not have been required to notify each new measure related\u00a0with the dispute, nor to initiate a new negotiation period to commence the arbitration.\n243. \u00a0The Tribunal finds that the expropriation dispute existed at least as of November 9, 2011. In its\u00a0Dispute Notice, the Claimants validly notified the existence of a dispute regarding compliance of\u00a0Venezuela\u2019s obligations under Article V of the Treaty and, in turn, they formalized the consent to\u00a0arbitration with respect to the case at hand in relation to the expropriation prior to the\n2,2 See. eg.

Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the expropriation claim in the terms set forth by the Claimants in this arbitration.\n244. \u00a0Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the second jurisdictional objection of Venezuela.\n3. Third jurisdictional objection\n245. \u00a0The Respondent argues that, regardless of the effects of the application of Article 72 of the\u00a0Convention, the BIT requires that both States - Spain and Venezuela - be contracting States of the\u00a0Convention at the time the investor submits the dispute to ICSID arbitration275. Such requirement\u00a0would not be met in this case, because by the time the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration\u00a0(May 10,2013), six months had already elapsed since the denouncement notification (January 24,\u00a02012) and, therefore, Venezuela had ceased to be a contracting State of the ICSID Convention276.\n246. \u00a0The third jurisdictional objection by Venezuela is based on its interpretation of Article XI(2)(b)\u00a0of the BIT. This Article provides the following:\n2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in such manner within a six months period, as of the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph 1, it will be\u00a0submitted, at the investor\u2019s choice:\na) To the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the\u00a0investment was made, or\nb) To the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)\u00a0created by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between\u00a0States and Nationals or Other States, opened for its signature in Washington on\u00a0March 18, 1965. when each State party to this Agreement has joined it. In the\u00a0event that one of the Contracting Parties has not joined the aforementioned\u00a0Convention, the Supplementary Mechanism for Conciliation, Arbitration and\u00a0Fact Finding shall be resorted to by the ICSID Secretariat [emphasis added];\n247. \u00a0According to Venezuela, the term 'joined' used by Article XI(2)(b) of the BIT \u201cmoZ only means\u00a0that the two States have initially joined to the Convention, but both States continue to be a party\u00a0to the Convention at the time of submitting a controversy to arbitration.\"111\n248. The Respondent argues that Spain and Venezuela were contracting States to the ICSID\u00a0Convention before signing the BIT. Therefore, the interpretation of Article XI(2)(b) proposed by\u00a0the Claimants - according to which what it is required that both States have initially adhered to\u00a0the Convention - would deprive the meaning and utility of this provision. Furthermore, this\u00a0interpretation would eliminate the possibility of commencing an arbitration under the\u00a0Supplementary Mechanism of the ICSID when the ICSID arbitration is unavailable278.\n249. \u00a0The Tribunal does not share Venezuela\u2019s interpretation. On the contrary, it finds that the\u00a0interpretation of Article XI (2)(b) of the BIT proposed by the Claimants is adequate according to\n275 Counter Memorial, 92 and ss.; Rejoinder. 1! 73 and ss.\n276 Counter Memorial, \\*1 96.\nLIC.

The Tribunal considers that the term \u201cjoined it\u201d in Article Xl(2)(b) of the\u00a0BIT should be understood, in a broad sense, as having granted the consent to become a contracting\u00a0State to the ICSID Convention280.\n251. \u00a0Respondent\u2019s interpretation would imply equating the expression \u201cwhen each State party to this\u00a0Agreement has joined the [ICSID Convention]\u201d [emphasis added] with the expression \u201cif each\u00a0State party to this Agreement is a party to the ICSID Convention\". Being a party of a treaty means\u00a0having expressed consent to be bound by it. \u201cAccession\u201d is an act by which the State manifests\u00a0such consent; being a party to the treaty is the consequence of that accession. Thus, these are\u00a0different concepts which cannot simply be exchanged in the context of Article XI of the Treaty,\u00a0as proposed by Venezuela.\n252. \u00a0Likewise, Venezuela\u2019s interpretation would imply accepting that the expression \"[i] n the event\u00a0that one of the Contracting Parties has not joined it\" refers to the event in which one of the States\u00a0has denounced the ICSID Convention. In the opinion of the Tribunal, these expressions are not,\u00a0and cannot be, equivalent. \u201cAccession\u201d and \u201cdenouncment\u201d are different acts, with different\u00a0objectives and opposite effects, and are regulated by different rules within the Vienna Convention.\u00a0Even, as Professor Schreuer observes, they are diametrically opposed281. Therefore, the\u00a0transcribed text cannot have the meaning attributed to it by Venezuela.\n253. \u00a0The context of the term \u201cjoined\" confirms Claimants\u2019 interpretation, according to which the\u00a0requirement is that both States have initially acceded to the Convention. For the Tribunal, Article\u00a0XI(2)(b) contemplates two hypotheses: the first is that both States have become parties to the\u00a0Convention, in which case the arbitration will be available under the ICSID Convention. The\u00a0second hypothesis is that one of the States has not become a party to the Convention. In this case,\u00a0arbitration may be resorted to, under the Supplemental Mechanism of the ICSID.\n254. \u00a0The tense used in Article XI(2)(b) of the BIT, i.e., \u201chas joined\u201d implies that accession occurs at\u00a0a single moment when the State Party expresses its consent to be bound by the ICSID Convention\u00a0and, consequently, it becomes a contracting State thereof.\n255. \u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the explanation presented in the arbitration by Professor Schreuer:\u00a0pursuant to Article XI(2)(b), if a State has joined or not to the ICSID Convention, it determines\u00a0whether arbitration is available under the ICSID Convention or the Supplemental Mechanism of\n279 Vienna Convention, Articles 2(1 )(b) and 15.

If none of these two mechanisms were available, then the dispute would be submitted to an ad hoc tribunal under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n256. \u00a0The Tribunal finds that the interpretation of Article XI(2)(b) set forth herein is consistent with the\u00a0object and purpose of the Treaty, and the Respondent has not convincingly argued otherwise.\n257. \u00a0Furthermore, Article 32 of the Vienna Convention indicates that the interpreter may resort to\u00a0supplementary interpretation methods, among other purposes, to \u201cconfirm the meaning resulting\u00a0from the application of Article 31\". Within the supplementary interpretation methods, Article 32\u00a0of the Vienna Convention expressly includes the circumstances of the execution of the treaty.\u00a0Both, Claimants and Professor Schreuer, have referred to the circumstances of the BIT negotiation\u00a0to explain why Article XI(2)(b) of the BIT was drafted in that way despite the fact that, at the time\u00a0of its execution, both Spain and Venezuela were already parties of the ICSID Convention.\n258. The explanation offered by the Claimants - which has not been contested by the Respondent -confirms the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation. The BIT negotiation concluded in approximately January\u00a01995.283 By that time, Venezuela had signed the ICSID Convention, but had not yet ratified it. In\u00a0effect, Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention in August 1993, but ratified it almost two years\u00a0later, in May 1995. The ICSID Convention became effective, with respect to Venezuela, on June\u00a01, 1995. By the time Venezuela ratified the ICSID Convention, the BIT had already been\u00a0negotiated and Spain was in the middle of an internal approval process of the Treaty in order to\nsign it284.\n  \n259. \u00a0In this context, it makes sense that Spain and Venezuela had negotiated a dispute resolution system\u00a0that provided for one of the States not being party to the ICSID Convention. This is precisely the\u00a0second hypothesis of Article XI(2)(b), according to which the Supplemental Mechanism would\u00a0be resorted in case one of the States \u201chas not joined\" to the ICSID Convention.\n260. \u00a0Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Article XI(2)(b) cannot be interpreted as\u00a0requiring both States to be parties of, or, according to the Respondent, \u201ccontinue to be joined\" to\u00a0the Convention at the moment in which the investor submits the dispute to ICSID arbitration. This\u00a0interpretation would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty and would\u00a0ignore the context and the circumstances of its negotiation and execution.\n261. \u00a0In the case at hand, the consent to the ICSID jurisdiction was formalized before Venezuela\u00a0denounced the ICSID Convention. The BIT does not impose an additional requirement that both\u00a0States parties to the BIT should continue to be parties to the ICSID Convention at the time the\u00a0investor submits a dispute to an ICSID tribunal.\n262. \u00a0For the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal rejects the third jurisdictional objection of the\u00a0Respondent.\n4. Fourth jurisdictional objection\n282 Prof. Schreuer\u2019s Report. 77.

SAUL VILLEGAS SOJO\nExpert Translator\nDirectum Translations\n  \n47\n  \n  \nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 64 of 375\n263. \u00a0The Respondent alleges that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, inasmuch the true investor in\u00a0Venezuela is Gruma. a Mexican company which has no right to benefit from the ICSID\u00a0Convention because it is not a national of a contracting State.\n264. \u00a0Venezuela bases this objection on two main arguments. First, it argues that the Claimants arc\u00a0paper companies acting as holding companies of the Gruma shares in the Companies to give a\u00a0Spanish appearance to the investments\"85. According to Venezuela, the Claimants merely\u00a0\u201cinherited direct foreign investment\" from Gruma through a transfer of \"paper\" shares286.\n265. \u00a0Second, the Respondent argues that even if the Claimants qualified as \"investors\" under the\u00a0definition of Article 1(1 )(b) of the BIT. they could not be considered nationals of another\u00a0contracting State for purposes of the ICSID Convention287. According to Venezuela, \u201cbeing a\u00a0'Spanish investor' under the Agreement is not automatically equivalent to being a 'national'\u00a0Spanish to comply with the requirement to be 'a national of another contracting State' of Article\u00a025 of the ICSID Convention.\" 288 Claimants must also qualify as nationals from Spain under\u00a0Spanish law; however, they do not meet the requirements to do so289.\n266. \u00a0For methodological reasons, the Tribunal will begin its analysis with this second argument.\n267. \u00a0In accordance with Article 25( 1 ) of the Convention, the ratione personae jurisdiction of the ICSID\u00a0extends to disputes between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State:\n\u201d[ I\u2019Jhe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent\u00a0subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Center by that\u00a0State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the\u00a0dispute consent in writing to submit to the Center. When the parties have given\u00a0their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\u201d [emphasis\u00a0added]\n268. \u00a0Further. Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention establishes what is meant by \"a national of another\u00a0Contracting State\":\n\u201cIA]ny juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented\u00a0to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person\u00a0which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that\u00a0date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be\u00a0treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this\u00a0Convention.\u201d [emphasis added |\n269. \u00a0Article 25(2)(b) contains two hypotheses to determine whether a juridical person constitutes a\u00a0\"national of another Contracting Stale\" for the purposes of Article 25( I ) of the Convention. The\u00a0first hypothesis is that the juridical person has the nationality of a Contracting State other than the\u00a0State receiving the investment. The second hypothesis admits that the juridical person has the\u00a0same nationality of the State receiving the investment, provided that the parties have agreed to\u00a0attribute the status of \u201cnational of another Contracting State\" inasmuch it is subject to foreign\n285 Rejoinder.\u2019 106. 125 y 137.\n286 Rejoinder.\u2019!! 131-133.\n287See Rejoinder.\u2019 160.\n48\n  \nLIC.

In contrast, in the first hypothesis - which is relevant for purposes of this\u00a0arbitration - the Convention does not establish any criteria to determine that a juridical person has\u00a0the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State receiving the investment. Therefore, this\u00a0task corresponds to the States.\n271. \u00a0As noted by several ICSID tribunals, the drafters of the Convention chose not to incorporate a\u00a0definition of nationality under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, granting wide latitude to States\u00a0to agree on the criteria that would determine the nationality of legal persons for purposes of ICSID\u00a0jurisdiction290.\n272. \u00a0In this regard, the Rompetrol court v. Romania indicated that\n\u201cThe latitude granted to define nationality for purposes of Article 25 must be at its greatest in the context of corporate nationality under a BIT, where, by\u00a0definition, it is the Contracting Parties to the BIT themselves, having under\u00a0international law the sole power to determine national status under their own\u00a0law, who decide by mutual and reciprocal agreement which persons or entities\u00a0will be treated as their \u2018nationals\u2019 for the purposes of enjoying the benefits the\u00a0BIT is intended to confer\u201d291\n273. The Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the Rompetrol court v. Romania. Article 25 (2)(b) does\u00a0not define the manner of determining the nationality of legal persons for the purposes of Article\u00a025 of the Convention. Therefore, it is up to the States to establish the requirements that a legal\u00a0person must meet to consider that it has \"the nationality of a Contracting Slate other than the\u00a0State party to the dispute\". Generally, the States establish these requirements in the instruments\u00a0that contain the offer of consent to the jurisdiction of the ICSID. When entering into international\u00a0agreements for the protection of investments, it is the States that, in exercise of their sovereignty,\u00a0negotiate and agree to which natural or legal persons will grant the benefits of the agreement.\u00a0Consequently, the Tribunal must grant deference to the definition of nationality of legal persons\u00a0established in the corresponding agreement.\n274. \u00a0In the words of Professor Schreuer:\n\u201c[T]he definitions of corporate nationality included in national laws or treaties providing ICSID jurisdiction are directly relevant to determining whether the\u00a0nationality requirements of Article 25(2)(b) have been met. They are part of\u00a0the legal framework for submission to the Center by the State. Upon written\u00a0acceptance of the investor, they become part of the consent agreement of the\u00a0parties. Therefore, any reasonable determination of the nationality of legal\u00a0persons contained in national laws or treaties must be accepted by ICSID\u00a0commissions or tribunals.\u201d292\n275. For the aforementioned reasons, the Tribunal finds that the definition of \u201cinvestor\u201d established in\u00a0the BIT is conclusive for purposes of establishing its jurisdiction under the Treaty and under the\u00a0Convention. The definition of the investor\u2019s nationality is given by the Treaty. In this case, the\n290 Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine, 1] 25; Rompetrol v. Romania, 80\n291 Rompetrol v.

Therefore, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to analyze\u00a0Spanish law in order to verify whether or not the Claimants have the nationality of that country,\u00a0in accordance to additional criteria as to those established in the Treaty.\n276. \u00a0Article X I( 1 ) of the BIT. which contains the offer of the State's consent to arbitration, provides as\u00a0follows:\n\"Any dispute arising between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party with respect to its compliance with the obligations set\u00a0forth in this Agreement, shall be notified in writing, providing detailed\u00a0information thereof, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the\u00a0investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute will try to settle\u00a0these differences amicably.\" [emphasis added]\n277. \u00a0The term \"investor\" is defined in Article l( 1 ) of the BIT. which reads as follows:\n\"[Legal] persons, including companies, joint ventures, business corporations, branches and other organizations incorporated or, in any event, duly organized\u00a0pursuant to the laws of the Contracting State, as well as those incorporated in\u00a0one of the Contracting Parties and are effectively controlled by the investors\u00a0of the other Contracting Party.\u201d [emphasis added]\n278. \u00a0In the case of legal entities incorporated outside of Venezuela. Article I( 1 )(b) of the BIT\u00a0establishes as the only requirement to determine whether entities are investors under the Treaty is\u00a0for them to be incorporated or duly organized under Spanish law. In other words, the BIT adopts\u00a0the incorporation criterion to establish whether a legal person qualifies as an \"investor\" under the\u00a0Treaty.\n279. \u00a0This Tribunal finds that, within the framework of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, the\u00a0Contracting States may adopt the incorporation criterion under their own law as a necessary and\u00a0sufficient nationality criterion for purposes of the ICSID jurisdiction293. As other courts have\u00a0observed, the place of incorporation is a criterion widely used at the international level to establish\u00a0the nationality of legal persons and. together with the criterion of the registered office, is the\u00a0generally accepted method for determining the corporate nationality of the claiming party under\u00a0Article 25 (2)(b)294.\n280. \u00a0In exercising their authority to define consent to ICSID jurisdiction. States may, for example,\u00a0establish a control or \"effective connection\" test of the investor with the other State, or reserve\u00a0the right to deny protection to claimants that they could otherwise resort to the respective treaty.\u00a0I lowcver. once consent is defined, the Tribunal shall follow it2'15. Therefore, when the nationality\u00a0test established in the corresponding treaty is that of \"incorporation\" - and not one of genuine\u00a0control or connection, for example - the court should not go beyond the provisions of the treaty,\u00a0unless that some form of abuse has occurred296, for example, if the investor is a company\u00a0incorporated in a particular State after the dispute arose, in order to benefit from a treaty concluded\u00a0by that State297.\n2,3 Rompetrolv.

Similarly, is it also undisputed by\u00a0the Parties that the \u201cshares\u201d are investments protected under the BIT and that the Claimants have\u00a0owned the shares in Monaca and Demaseca for several years before the controversy arose299.\n282. \u00a0The Respondent has not invoked any reason that justifies disregarding the legal status of the\u00a0Claimants or investigating the fulfillment of the nationality requirements in furtherance to those\u00a0expressly established in Article Xl( 1 )(b) of the BIT. The Tribunal also finds no reason to do so.\n283. \u00a0As explained by the Tribunal, the \u201cincorporation\u201d criterion established in the BIT is the only\u00a0relevant and sufficient criterion to establish its ratione personae jurisdiction, and the Claimants\u00a0comply with that requirement. Therefore, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to evaluate the factual\u00a0allegations raised by the Respondent in connection with this jurisdictional objection.\n284. \u00a0In conclusion, this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants under Article 25(1) of the ICSID\u00a0Convention and Article XI( 1 ) of the Treaty. Thus, the fourth jurisdictional objection presented by\u00a0Venezuela is rejected.\nV. BIT VIOLATION CLAIMS\nA. EXPROPIATION CLAIM\n1. Claimants\u2019 Position\n285. \u00a0The Claimants argue that Venezuela expropriated its investments in violation of Article V of the\u00a0BIT. Specifically, they claim that the measures imposed by Venezuela on Monaca and Demaseca\u00a0constitute \u201c measure[s] of similar features or effects\" to an expropriation in terms of Article V( 1 )\u00a0of the BIT, i.e., constituting an indirect expropriation300.\n286. \u00a0In this case, the expropriation would have occurred progressively through a series of measures\u00a0that, cumulatively, have features and effects equivalent to an expropriation301. These measures\u00a0are: (i) the imposition of seizure and special administration measures on Monaca and Demaseca\u00a0derived from the criminal proceedings, vis-\u00e0-vis Mr. Fernandez Barrueco; (ii) the issuance of\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 - whose effects extend to Demaseca - and the \u201cinvasion\u201d of the company\u00a0facilities by the Liaison Commission members who, acting on their own behalf or jointly with the\u00a0special administrators, they would have begun to gradually control the companies; and (iii) the\u00a0issuance of the Administrative Ordinance granting the special administrators - previously [the]\u00a0Liaison Commission members - the \u201cbroadest administrative authorities\u201d on both Companies and,\u00a0in addition, orders them to adjust their actions to the agri-food policies of Venezuela and present\u00a0financial statements of its management at the close of each fiscal year302.\n287. \u00a0According to the Claimants, the Administrative Ordinance constitutes the \u201cculminating point of a\u00a0series of measures attributable to the Respondent interfering with Claimants 'property rights with\n2,8 Valores Incorporation Deed dated November 14, 2003 (Annex C-20) and Consorcio Incorporation Deed dated April 20,2006 (Annex C-21 ).

Following the standard proposed by the AES v. Hungr\u00eda\u00a0tribunal, there would be expropriation when (a) the investor is totally or significantly deprived of\u00a0the ownership or effective control of its investment or (b) the investment is totally or significantly\u00a0deprived of its value306. In this case, both hypotheses would concur since, as a consequence of the\u00a0measures imposed by Venezuela, the Claimants (i) have lost the control over the Companies and\u00a0(ii) the value of their shares is \u201cvirtually zero\u201d307.\n289. \u00a0First, the Claimants argue that the Venezuelan State, acting through several entities and agencies,\u00a0has exerted an interference of such magnitude on the Companies that it has substantially deprived\u00a0them of the control on their investments308. This interference would have resulted in an effective\u00a0deprivation of the fundamental rights of the Claimants as shareholders of the Companies in a\u00a0manner that \u201chas been deprived from its essence, and lacks content to the point that they are\u00a0practically useless\"\u2122.\n290. \u00a0According to the Claimants, the following situations would reflect the substantial loss of control\u00a0of the Claimants on their investments, as recognized by several international tribunals310.\n291. \u00a0First, the loss of de iure control over Monaca and Demaseca arising from the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance granting the special administrators \u201cthe broadest administration authorities\u201d over the\u00a0Companies and, furthermore, obliging them to adjust their actions to public policies issued by the\u00a0Ministry of Food with respect to agri food activity3\".\n292. \u00a0Based on several decisions of the Iran-USA Claims Tribunal, the Claimants state that \u201cthe\u00a0appointment of government administrators in a company can be considered as a measure of\u00a0similar features or effects to the indirect expropriation.\"3'2 As in those cases, the Claimants argue\u00a0that in the case at hand there is no realistic perspective of revering their rights. In effect, the\u00a0measures have been in force for more than six years, there are no indications that they will cease\u00a0and, at any moment, Venezuela will acquire the formal ownership of the Companies313.\n293. \u00a0Second, the impossibility of (i) distributing or receiving dividends and transferring capital; (ii)\u00a0freely dispose their shares; (iii) appoint new board members; (iv) approve balance sheets and\u00a0financial statements; (v) decide on the sale of assets; and (vi) amend or modify the bylaws of the\u00a0Companies. According to the Claimants, these restrictions arise from the prohibition of notarizing\u00a0or certifying acts whereby Monaca, Demaseca or the Claimants participate, and the freeze of the\u00a0bank accounts of the Companies314. The distribution of dividends would also be hampered by the\u00a0SIEX rejection - presumably ordered by the Liaison Commission- to update Monaca\u2019s registry as\n303 Memorial, 51 181.\n304 Memorial, 1] 182.\nMSld.\n306 Memorial, 182, quoting AES v.

The Respondent would have admitted that closing plants without\u00a0state authorization would entail a violation of the Decree, while the special administrators would\u00a0have declared that, by virtue of said Decree, the assets of the Companies cannot be subject to any\u00a0negotiation317.\n295. \u00a0Fourth, the interference in the daily decisions of the Companies reflected, e.g., the need to request\u00a0authorization from Venezuelan officials to make any payment or transfer of their bank accounts\u00a0and in the obstruction of certain commercial decisions318.\n296. \u00a0Fifth, the duty to submit periodic reports to the Liaison Commission and special administrators\u00a0on financial, commercial and operational matters of the Companies319.\n297. \u00a0Sixth, the obligation to pay fees and compensations to the Liaison Commission members and\u00a0special administrators320.\n298. \u00a0Seventh, the occupation of different offices and spaces in the administrative headquarters and\u00a0other facilities of Monaca and Demaseca by the Liaison Commission and the special\u00a0administrators321.\n299. \u00a0Eighth, the disposal of the Companies assets, particularly the obligation to lend thousands of tons\u00a0of com to competing companies without accruing interest and selling corn flour to the so-called\u00a0\u201cSocialist Bakeries\u201d322.\n300. Ninth, the restriction on appointing representatives injudicial matters, authority which, pursuant\u00a0to the law, corresponds to the board of directors of Monaca. According to the Claimants, this\u00a0limitation was confirmed by the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which, in the context of a judicial\u00a0proceeding, vis-\u00e0-vis, Monaca, stated that the company has an \u201cintervening board\u201d which may\u00a0exercise the defense of the company in the proceeding323.\n301. \u00a0Tenth, the fact that the Companies are under a special administration regime which, under\u00a0Venezuelan law, solely applies to confiscated assets that have become the State\u2019s property.\u00a0According to the Claimants, Venezuela has acted as if the Companies were its property; it has\u00a0imposed special administrators acting as their owners and has referred to them publicly as\u00a0\u201crecovered and nationalized1' companies, \u201cacquired by the Venezuelan State\"324. The Claimants\u00a0emphasize that the highest court of administrative litigation confirmed that it had jurisdiction over\u00a0Monaca because it is a company in which the State exercises \u201cdecisive and permanent control\u00a0with respect to its management or administration\u201d.325\n5,5 Memorial, H 185.\n316 Brief, 225.\n311 Id.\n318 Memorial, H 185.\n3,9 Memorial, 1| 185.\n323 Hearing.

Following the decision in Teemed v. Mexico, the Claimants explain that the\u00a0measures adopted by a State constitute indirect expropriation if, in such regard, the investor \u201cwas\u00a0radically deprived of the economic utility of its investment, as if the rights related to such\u00a0investments [...] would have ceased'\u2122.\n303. \u00a0In this regard, the Claimants first state that Decree No. 7.394 covers all of the Companies\u2019 assets\u00a0and it is uncertain when the transfer of ownership over said assets will be formalized327; and,\u00a0second, that the Companies are under an intervention regime preventing them from receiving the\u00a0\u201cbasic benefits\u201d from their investments.\n304. \u00a0Specifically, the Claimants state that they cannot perform the following acts with respect to the\u00a0Companies: (i) register the minutes of the shareholders\u2019 meeting in the Commercial Registry; (ii)\u00a0effectively appoint board members; (iii) distribute dividends; (iv) manage the payment of\u00a0premiums for the subscription of shares; (v) sell or transfer their equity interests; (vi) manage and\u00a0withdrawn from their bank accounts; (vii) freely manage transfer their assets; and (viii) freely\u00a0manage them according to their criteria328. Furthermore, the Venezuelan measures have had the\u00a0effect of subjecting the managers of the Companies to the instructions of the special administrators\u00a0subject to civil and criminal penalties in the event of a non-compliance329.\n305. Consequently, the actions by the Claimants in the Companies would have no economic value,\u00a0since the Claimants, or a hypothetical buyer in their place, cannot enjoy the rights and benefits\u00a0inherent to this type of investment330. This conclusion is based on three main reasons: (i) during\u00a0more than five years, the Companies have been prevented from distributing profits and there are\u00a0no indications that such prohibition will be lifted in the mid-term; (ii) the fact that the Companies\u00a0must adjust their actions to Venezuela\u2019s food policies limits their ability to generate profits and\u00a0make investment decisions maximizing their net present value, since the special administrators\u00a0have the authority to impose measures on the Companies affecting their ability to generate funds;\u00a0and (iii) since the publication of Decree No. 7.934, and as a result thereof, the Claimants, or a\u00a0potential buyer, are certain that at any time the ability to receive the future dividends flows will\u00a0be formally transferred to the Respondent331.\n306. Claimants emphasize that a company prevented from paying dividends or profits to its\u00a0shareholders has no value for them or for a potential buyer. In this regard, they emphasize, first,\u00a0that the shareholders have not received the payment corresponding to the share subscription\u00a0premium decreed in December 2008, as representatives of Venezuela prevent Monaca from\u00a0obtaining the record of direct investment which is necessary for making the payment. The\u00a0foregoing would evidence that the Claimants have been deprived from receiving the payment of\u00a0approved profits and that decreeing more profits would be useless332. Second, they explain that\u00a0the \u201cshort-term assets\u201d of the Companies are assets subject to the Decree No. 7.394 and,\u00a0consequently, Claimants cannot transfer them without authorization from Venezuela. The\u00a0argument of the Respondent stating that there is no restriction for Companies to declare dividends\u00a0is tricky, since it is not the same to have a loan to receive a dividend in an uncertain future, than\n326 Memorial, U 188, quoting Teemed v.

Third, the Claimants indicate that paying dividends would alter the assets of the Company, which is prohibited by Decree No. 7.934 and the seizure and special\u00a0administration measures. Furthermore, the accounts of the Companies are frozen and withdrawls\u00a0could only be made with the authorization of the special administrators. According to the\u00a0Claimants, \u201cit would be naive to believe that they would authorize the Claimants to make\u00a0millionaire payments of dividends.\u201d334 Finally, they state that, for the payment of dividends, the\u00a0Venezuelan law requires the presentation of a certified copy of the meetings\u2019 minutes approving\u00a0such payment. As the registration of the act is prohibited, the dividends approvals could not be\u00a0paid335.\n307. \u00a0Finally, the Claimants indicate that Venezuela\u2019s argument that Companies cannot have a zero\u00a0value inasmuch they exist, continue to operate and are profitable and have a surplus, is irrelevant,\u00a0inasmuch \"companies continue to operate, but for the benefit of the Republic - not for the benefit\u00a0of their formal shareholders\u2019\u2122. In effect, Claimants cannot receive dividends from their\u00a0investments in the Companies and all the assets and rights subject to Decree No. 7.934, including\u00a0financial assets, \u201cwill be transferred, free of encumbrances or limitations in favor of the\u00a0Republic\u201d\u2122.\n308. \u00a0Third, the Claimants argue that the measures adopted by Venezuela are permanent and not merely\u00a0temporary, as the Respondent argues.\n309. \u00a0On the one hand, they claim that Decree No. 7.934 has permanent and irreversible effects,\u00a0inasmuch it affects all of the Company\u2019s assets and obliges its owners to transfer, on a definitive\u00a0manner, said assets to Venezuela and it, likewise, obliges Venezuela to acquire them338. The\u00a0Claimants state that Respondent\u2019s argument that Decree No. 7.394 is not irreversible given that\u00a0the process is suspended for the parties to negotiate an amicably settlement is fallacious,\u00a0inasmuch, on the one hand, the negotiations have not continued and, for the other, the suspension\u00a0of the expropriation process does not imply the cessation of the effects of the Decree339.\n310. \u00a0Likewise, they also note that Venezuela\u2019s analysis of the dissolution of the Liaison Commission\u00a0is superficial, since it fails to mention that two of its main members are special administrators\u00a0under the Administrative Ordinance and continue to exercise essentially the same functions which\u00a0they performed in the Liaison Commission340.\n311. \u00a0On the other hand, the Claimants argue that \u201cthe extensive duration of the seizure and special\u00a0administration measures and the state of the appeal filed, vis-\u00e0-vis, said measures demonstrate\u00a0that the measures adopted by the Republic are not temporary\u201d34'. The Claimants argue that the\u00a0doctrine recognizes that the extensive duration of the measures is a factor confirming the existence\u00a0of an indirect expropriation342. According to the Claimants, a measure ceases to be temporary\u00a0when an objective observer would conclude that there is no immediate possibility for the owner\u00a0to recover the enjoyment of its investments343.\n312. \u00a0In the case at hand, an objective observer would conclude that the measures are not merely\n333 Hearing, Day 1, Tr. 83:15-84:10\n334 Hearing, Day 1, Tr. 84:19-85:\n335 Audiencia, Dia 1, Tr. 85:4-13.\n336 Brief, H 241\n337 Id.\n338 Hearing, Day 1, Tr. 87:8-18.

The argument of the\u00a0Respondent undermines the nature and function of the reservation of rights, insofar it would lead\u00a0to the conclusion that its effect is to preclude a claim, instead of preserving it346.\n314. \u00a0In any event, the Claimants note that (i) they formally notified the existence of an expropriation\u00a0claim under Article V of the BIT from their Dispute Notice, and (ii) in April 2013, also prior to\u00a0the Request for Arbitration, Gruma publicly announce the de-consolidation of the Companies\u2019\u00a0operations as a result of the Administrative Ordinance347. According to the Claimants, the\u00a0foregoing evidences that: (i) the measures adopted by Venezuela did have \u201csufficient grounds\u201d to\u00a0be presented in the arbitration; (ii) there was already an expropriation claim formally notified\u00a0under the BIT, and (iii) the Claimants reserved the right to file such claim later as they did in\u00a0fact348.\n315. \u00a0Finally, the Claimants argue that Venezuela not only indirectly expropriated its investments, but\u00a0that it has also subjected them to an illegal expropriation process349. According to the Claimants,\u00a0the expropriation of their investments is illegal under the BIT inasmuch (i) it was made without\u00a0compensating the Claimants; (ii) it was contrary to the legal provisions governing expropriation\u00a0under Venezuelan law, and (iii) it was discriminatory350.\n316. \u00a0With respect to the first point, the Claimants state that, in the event of expropriation, the BIT\u00a0demands the payment of a prompt, adequate and effective compensation. It also establishes that\u00a0the compensation must be \u201cequivalent to the real value of the investment immediately before the\u00a0measures were taken or before they were announced or published, if this occurs prior [to the\u00a0expropriation.]\"351 According to the Claimants, \u201cthe real value of the investment\" referred to by\u00a0the BIT is equivalent to its fair market value352.\n317. Although it has been more than five years since Venezuela issued Decree No. 7.934 and imposed\u00a0the seizure and special administration measures, the Respondent has not compensated the\u00a0Claimants in any manner, nor has it paid the fair market value of the Companies nor has it offered\u00a0a credible justification or explanation regarding the delay in the payment of the compensation\n344 Brief, 11 247 y 251.\n345 Brief, 1 260.\n346 Brief, \u00dc 253-256.\n347 Brief, Hi 257-258.\n348 Brief, 1 259.\n349 Brief, 1261.\n350 Memorial, 1 195.\nncT\u00c2\u00db\u00ceviLL\u00c9\u00d4AS SOJO expert Translator\u00a0nirortum Translations\u2014\n  \n351 Memorial, 1196, quoting Article V(2) of the Treaty.\n352 Memorial, 1 196.\n56\nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 73 of 375\nthereof\u201953. This lack of payment, by itself, makes the expropriation carried out by Venezuela, illegal354.\n318. The Claimants point out that Respondent's argument, according to which the existence of a\u00a0negotiation process would comply with the requirement of legality, ignores the fact that Venezuela\u00a0has repeatedly hampered the Claimants' attempts to resolve the dispute and has preferred to\u00a0maintain the status quo instead of negotiating in good faith, thus avoiding having to pay\u00a0compensation to the Claimants355.\n319. \u00a0According to the Claimants, the facts would show that Venezuela has not had a real will to\u00a0negotiate an amicable settlement regarding the expropriation of the Companies and has even acted\u00a0in bad faith throughout the process356. Particularly, the fact that the Respondent ignored all the\u00a0sale proposals made by the Claimants as per Venezuela\u2019s request, and that the latter would have\u00a0never submitted a counterproposal and it would have not made an offer based on an available\u00a0valuation for more than three years. Therefore, it would be valid to conclude that Respondent has\u00a0not negotiated in good faith, in accordance with the standards followed by the tribunals of\u00a0ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela\\*?\\*.\n320. \u00a0With respect to the second point, the Claimants allege that under Venezuelan law' the State cannot\u00a0occupy the assets of the company subject to expropriation w ithout first obtaining a final judgment\u00a0from a competent judge and paying a fair compensation thereof 35?. Respondent contravened this\u00a0provision by imposing the Liaison Commission - which, contrary to Venezuela\u2019s arguments, was\u00a0never agreed by Claimants - and the special administration over the Companies359. They also argue\u00a0that the expropriation process was unilaterally suspended by Venezuela to maintain the status quo\u00a0in an irregular and indefinite manner, to Claimants' detriment360. In this regard, they argue that\u00a0although the Venezuelan law' does not establish a term for the direct settlement phase, it cannot\u00a0be used to \"indefinitely perpetuate\" an injurious status of Claimants' property rights3\"1.\n321. \u00a0With respect to the third point, the Claimants argue that the expropriation was discriminatory\u00a0inasmuch Venezuela has treated other food companies similar to the Companies in a different way\u00a0- including Alimentos Polar. C.A. and Cargill Venezuela. C.A.- who also compete in the\u00a0Venezuelan wheat and corn flour market. In fact, the Venezuelan State has not issued an\u00a0expropriation decree with respect to such companies obligating them to forcefully sell all of their\u00a0assets - but only a few' of their assets - for the execution of the \"Socialist Agroindustrial Processing\u00a0Capacity Consolidation for the Venezuela of the XXI century \u201d program or any other public\u00a0program'62. On the contrary, the Respondent has benefited other companies to the detriment of\u00a0the Companies by ordering Monaca and Demaseca to transfer corn to them363.\n322. \u00a0Finally, and contrary to Venezuela\u2019s arguments, the Claimants affirm that any violation of the\u00a0Venezuelan legal system regarding expropriation constitutes, in turn, a violation of the BIT364.\u00a0Likew ise, they also state that the Treaty does not require exhausting domestic remedies or filing\n553 Memorial. 1 197 and Brief. \\* 269.\n354 Memorial.

In this case, the Claimants opted to resort to an ICSID arbitration, inasmuch going to the Venezuelan courts would be useless, as evidenced by the third-party\u00a0proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas)365.\n323. In summary, the Claimants allege that Venezuela progressively expropriated its investments in\u00a0the Companies through a series of permanent and irreversible measures which had the effect of\u00a0depriving control of the Claimants on their investments and destroying their value. Moreover, this\u00a0expropriation measures are illegal since they do not comply with the requirements set forth in the\u00a0BIT.\n2.\n  \nRespondent\u2019s position\n  \n324. \u00a0The Respondent denies that there has been a direct or indirect expropriation of Claimants\u2019\u00a0investments. On the contrary, it maintains that the owners of Monaca and Demaseca hold the\u00a0ownership and control of the Companies and that the corresponding measures have not caused a\u00a0significant reduction or loss in the value of their investments366.\n325. \u00a0As an introductory manner, Venezuela states that the Claimants intentionally confuse the\u00a0expropriation procedure initiated by Venezuela - which was suspended before the expropriation\u00a0took effect -, on one hand, and the measures adopted in the context of the criminal proceeding,\u00a0vis-\u00e0-vis, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco - which are of a precautionary and temporary nature.-, on the\u00a0other367. However, these are completely different and independent procedures and none of them\u00a0has resulted in expropriation368.\n326. \u00a0Respondent also questions Claimants\u2019 argument that the Administrative Ordinance was the\u00a0culminating point of the alleged creeping expropriation. The Administrative Ordinance was issued\u00a0before the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration. Therefore, the Claimants should have\u00a0included an expropriation claim in their Request for Arbitration; however, they did not. On the\u00a0contrary, the Claimants reserved the right to submit additional claims in the event that Venezuela\u00a0\u201cotherwise seizes the investments of the Claimants, or takes or continues to take interference\u00a0measures on such investments\u201d36<>. The foregoing would evidence the lack of support for the\u00a0expropriation claim now argued by the Claimants.\n327. According to Venezuela, the Claimants have not evidenced that an expropriation occurred on their\u00a0respective investments, inasmuch the measures: (i) are not permanent nor have irreversible\u00a0consequences; (ii) they have neither resulted in the deprivation of their property, nor in the total\u00a0reduction of the value of their investment, nor in the loss of control of their investment; and (iii)\u00a0cumulatively and gradually have not led to the effective denial of the owner\u2019s interest on its\u00a0property370.\n328. \u00a0First, Respondent argues that, for the invoked measures to constitute expropriation, they must be\u00a0definitive and permanent371. According to Venezuela, none of the measures alleged by the\u00a0Claimants meet such features.\n329. \u00a0Respondent argues that the seizure measures issued within the framework of the criminal\n365 Brief, U 281\nCounter Memorial, 1 284.\n367 Counter Memorial, \\*\u00a1 285.\n368 Counter Memorial, H 286.\n369 Counter Memorial, 292.\n370 Counter Memorial, 1] 296.\n371 Counter Memorial, 297-299.

It also explains that the seizure measures follow the fate of the criminal\u00a0process, and could be modified, revoked or annulled by the competent authority motu proprio or\u00a0at per the request of the interested party372.\n330. \u00a0With respect to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal cases cited by the Claimants, Venezuela\u00a0notes that these cases are substantially different from the case at hand, given that in those cases,\u00a0the government administration was established by law to replace the administrators and there was\u00a0no realistic perspective of investors regaining control of their investment373.\n331. \u00a0Regarding the duration of the measures, the Respondent states that the Court must consider the\u00a0circumstances of the case at hand. In this case, the Court must consider that the measures issued\u00a0by the criminal judge (i) are reasonable and procedurally justified; (ii) they directly depend on the\u00a0fate of the criminal process; (iii) its control is in charge of an independent judicial authority, and\u00a0(iv) the reasonableness of its duration must be analyzed in the context of the Venezuelan judicial\u00a0system and with respect to its objective of protecting [Venezuela] against organized crime and\u00a0terrorism374.\n332. \u00a0With respect to Decree No. 7.394, Venezuela alleges that the Liaison Commission, established\u00a0within the framework of the expropriation process, was also temporary, as confirmed by the fact\u00a0that it was dissolved in September 2013375.\n333. Second, Venezuela asserts that the Claimants have not evidenced that the measures have reached\u00a0the high investment threshold established by the law and jurisprudence to demonstrate that they\u00a0have an expropriation effect376.\n334. \u00a0According to Venezuela, international jurisprudence agrees that \"a measure amounts to an\u00a0expropriation if the claimant was substantially or radically deprivedfrom the economic use and\u00a0enjoyment of its investments or if its investment has been effectively neutralized, in whole or in its\u00a0entirety\"311. In that sense, the Claimants must evidence that the measure destroyed either all or\u00a0practically all, the economic value of the investment, or interfered with or limited it to such a\u00a0degree as to conclude that the property was taken from the owner378.\n335. \u00a0In such regard, Venezuela argues that the mere decrease in the value of the investment or of the\u00a0profits is insufficient to support the existence of an indirect expropriation379. Similarly, there\u00a0would be no expropriation if, despite experiencing a decrease in profits, the company\u2019s business\u00a0remains operational380. It also states that for the loss of control of an investment to be considered\u00a0an expropriation, the investor should not be allowed to use or dispose of his investment381.\n336. \u00a0In this case, the Claimants have neither proved that their shares have lost all their value as a result\u00a0of the measures adopted by Venezuela, nor that a \u201chypothetical voluntary buyer\u201d would grant a\u00a0zero value to the shares382.\n372\n373\n374\n375\n376\n377\n378\n379\n380\n381\n382\n  \nCounter Memorial, fl 300-301.\nRejoinder, fl 378 y 390.\nRejoinder, 1389.\nCounter Memorial, y 302.\nCounter Memorial, H 304.\nCounter Memorial, 1' 306, citations omitted.\nCounter Memorial, II 308.\nCounter Memorial, 1' 309.\nCounter Memorial, 1| 312, haciendo referencia a los laudos de Grand River v.

On the contrary, as of 2010 the utilization levels\u00a0of the Companies increased, to the point that, to the Valuation Date, their performance was higher\u00a0than they had before the implementation of Decree No. 7.394 and the seizure and special\u00a0administration measures\u2019\u201d4. Likewise, in its 2012 Annual Report, Gruma acknowledged not\u00a0having identified any indication of impairment in the value of its net investment in the Companies,\u00a0so that even a decrease in the value of the investment would be ruled out '85.\n339. \u00a0Venezuela notes that the Claimants have not evidenced that they have been deprived of the\u00a0economic benefit of their investment. On the contrary, the Companies have remained operative\u00a0and ongoing, and continue to produce profits which have been used in the ordinary course of\u00a0business\u201986.\n340. \u00a0With respect to the reasons that, according to the Claimants, would lead to the conclusion that\u00a0their shares in the Companies have no value, Venezuela states the following;\n341. \u00a0First, it is untrue that Decree No. 7.394 prevents the distribution of dividends in the Companies.\u00a0The Decree only concerns to the necessary goods for the production, storage and distribution of\u00a0food and. hence, excludes the profits that corporate governance bodies would have allocated for\u00a0other purposes387. Regarding the alleged restriction to carry out corporate acts arising from the\u00a0seizure measures. Venezuela notes that the Claimants have not requested authorization from a\u00a0judge for the registration of certain acts nor they object that such possibility exists. Similarly, the\u00a0Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the failure to register a specific act \"would have\u00a0prevented the execution of their eventual resolution to distribute dividends\u201d3\\*\\*.\n342. \u00a0Second, it is \u201cmore than evident\" that a company dedicated to the production of food in Venezuela\u00a0shall comply with the country's food policies, which is why the Claimants argument stating that\u00a0the Companies\u2019 ability to generate profits, investing or divesting in a manner maximizing its net\u00a0present value would be limited for this reason should be disregarded380. In this regard, the\u00a0Respondent refers to the Ley de Seguridad y Soberan\u00eda Agroalimentaria.\n343. \u00a0Third, expropriation process is suspended to allow the Parties to seek a consensual solution, other\u00a0than expropriation, so it is untrue that the goods and rights subject to Decree No. 7.394 would\u00a0necessarily be transferred to the Respondent's assets as a result of the process390.\n344. \u00a0Finally. Venezuela indicates that the Claimants have not evidenced that the Venezuelan State has\u00a0received any benefit or profits from the Companies, so their argument stating that the companies\u00a0are still in operation, but for the benefit of the Respondent, is groundless301.\n181 Counter Memorial.\u201d 320-321.\n\u201d\\*\u25a0\u2019 Counter Memorial. \"321; Rejoinder. \u2022 398.\nRejoinder. \u2022 397. quoting the GRUMA 2012 Annual Report. 2012. p. 117 (Annex R-053).\n38,1 Counter Memorial. \\* \" 324-325.\n187 Rejoinder. \u2022 400\n388 Rejoinder.\" 401.\n389 Rejoinder. \u201d 402-403.\n390 Rejoinder. \u201d 404 y 407.\n391 Rejoinder. \" 405.\nLIC.

It argues that, on\u00a0the contrary, they have always maintained the daily management and control of the Companies,\u00a0which continue producing and distributing their products392.\n346. \u00a0Specifically, Venezuela asserts that the Claimants have not established, for each of the facts\u00a0allegedly demonstrating that they have lost control over the Companies, \u201cif such interference [in\u00a0business activities] is sufficiently restrictive to support the conclusion that the property has been\u00a0'taken'from its owner\"393. In this regard, Venezuela explains the following:\n347. \u00a0First, the special administrators have not taken out Claimants\u2019 control over the Companies, they\u00a0have not replaced the administration and management of the Companies, they have not interfered\u00a0with the Companies\u2019 operations or displaced the Claimants from their Companies. Shareholder\u00a0position. On the contrary, the Companies\u2019 representatives have kept their offices and no action\u00a0taken by, or attributable to, Venezuela has ignored or prevented the statutory bodies of the\u00a0Companies from exercising their functions394.\n348. \u00a0The special administration has conservatory and temporary administration, supervisory and\u00a0custody features to prevent corporate assets from unduly deteriorating. None of the resolutions by\u00a0means of which the special administrators have been appointed, including the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance, have granted them management or administration authorities over the Companies395.\n349. \u00a0Furthermore, the Claimants have not indicated \u201c[not even] a single case in which the special\u00a0administrators have undertaken management authorities or have unauthorized management acts\u00a0carried out by the managers appointed by Gruma; thus, it can be said that the statutory bodies\u00a0have remained permanently or have been completely displaced or subjected to executing foreign\u00a0decisions\"399.\n350. \u00a0Second, it is not true that, in consequence of the seizure measures, the Claimants would not have\u00a0been able to freely transfer their shares, receive dividends, appoint new board members, approve\u00a0balance sheets and financial statements, decide on the sale of assets or amend the Companies\u2019\u00a0bylaws397.\n351. No legal provision or judicial or administrative order, including Decree No. 7.394 nor the seizure\u00a0measures, has prohibited or prevented the performance of the corporate acts referred to by the\u00a0Claimants. In fact, the acts not contrary, vis-\u00e0-vis, the objective of preserving the integrity of the\u00a0Companies\u2019 estate, should not be understood included within the prohibition to transfer assets\u00a0subject to registration; and, in any case, the interested party may request authorization from the\u00a0judge who issued the measure in order carry out such acts398.\n352. \u00a0In the case at hand, the Claimants have not evidenced the existence of corporate acts whose\u00a0effectiveness would have been limited by the seizure measures and have not evidenced that any\u00a0request for judicial authorization to register or certify a specific act had been submitted and\u00a0denied399. Specifically, Venezuela emphasizes that the Claimants have not evidenced that they\u00a0had attempted to declare and distribute dividends nor to request a judicial authorization to register\n392 Counter Memorial, 328-329.\n395 Counter Memorial, H 332, quoting Pope & Talbol v.

There is also no evidence that the measures have prevented the Claimants from selling their shares in the Companies401.\n353. \u00a0Third, it is untrue that the special administration is an institution exclusively applicable to properly\u00a0that, due to seizure or confiscation, has become the State\u2019s property. In Venezuela, the criminal\u00a0judge has broad powers to issue complementary precautionary measures that best meet the\u00a0security objective pursued. It was in use of these powers that the judge decided to apply the of the\u00a0special administration figure to the Companies, without implying that there was property seizure\u00a0or confiscation402.\n354. \u00a0Fourth, it is also untrue that the Liaison Commission and the administrators had invaded or\u00a0occupied the offices and facilities of the Companies. The Liaison Commission has used the offices\u00a0with Gruma\u2019s consent and the special administrators never had a permanent physical presence at\u00a0the Companies' plants40\u2019. Expropriation by \u201coccupation\" occurs when the State substitutes,\u00a0replaces or physically expels the owner of the property to which it was the owner: which situation\u00a0has not occurred in the case at hand404.\n355. \u00a0Respondent also establishes that, almost two years after the alleged occupation, Gruma stated the\u00a0following in its Annual Report, dated April 30. 2012:\n\u201cThe Venezuelan government has not taken physical control on MONACA\u2019s or DEMASECA\u2019s assets, nor has it taken control of their operations.\u00a0Consequently. GRUMA can validly and legally affirm that, to date. Valores\u00a0Mundiales and Consorcio Andino have full legal ownership over the rights,\u00a0interests, shares and assets of MONACA and DEMASECA. respectively, and\u00a0that they also have complete control on all types of decisions, operations and\u00a0directives in [the Companies]\u201d405.\n356. \u00a0Fifth, the requests for information made by the Liaison Commission and the administrators have\u00a0been necessary for these agencies to perform their duties, and do not constitute or imply a loss of\u00a0control406.\n357. \u00a0Sixth, the redirection of corn is legally permitted for agri-food safety reasons: it is also done\u00a0between private companies and is a common practice in the industry407.\n358. Seventh, the payment of fees to the Liaison Commission members was agreed with Monaca\u2019s\u00a0representatives and their compensation was made in accordance with Venezuelan law. Further,\u00a0the special administrators receive an amount in bolivars from Monaca as a right (dieta), different\u00a0from the one indicated by Engr. Huerta408.\n359. \u00a0In summary, Venezuela argues that neither the seizure measures arising from the criminal\u00a0proceedings, vis-\u00e0-vis, Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco nor the activities deployed by the Liaison Commission\u00a0under Decree No. 7.394 have directly or indirectly interfered in the internal operations of the\n400 Rejoinder.

On the contrary, the Companies \u201ccontinue to be profitable and to have a surplus, and\u00a0are in operation, under GRU MA 's control.\"409\n360. \u00a0Third, Venezuela states that the Claimants have not complied with their burden of evidencing how\u00a0Decree No. 7.394, the seizure measures and the Administrative Ordinance have had the impact of\u00a0an expropriation410. Specifically, it alleges that the Claimants \u201chave failed to carry out a coherent,\u00a0concatenated and causal analysis of the measures they complain about to justify the [sic] existence\u00a0of a [sic] 'creeping expropriation\"\"\\* f\n361. Contrary to Claimants\u2019 arguments, Decree No. 7394 and the seizure measures are completely\u00a0different and independent from each other. The Decree and the seizure measures have a different\u00a0origin and objective, different recipients and do not respond to a coordinated plan or pattern412. In\u00a0effect, it would not make sense to use precautionary measures, since the alleged purpose of\u00a0expropriating the Companies could be achieved with the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and the\u00a0implementation of the expropriation process413.\n362. \u00a0Respondent states that, between the expropriation process and the precautionary measures there\u00a0is a mere chronological relationship rather than the cause-effect relationship attributed to them by\u00a0the Claimants. The Claimants have neither evidenced that the measures are concatenated nor that\n. they have resulted in substantial interference with their business activities414.\n363. \u00a0On the other hand, Venezuela argues that if the Administrative Ordinance, Decree No. 7394 or\u00a0the seizure measures were to had the expropriation effects now attributed to them by the\u00a0Claimants, then they would have filed an expropriation claim with their Request for Arbitration415.\u00a0In the words of Venezuela, the fact that the Claimants had not included an expropriation claim in\u00a0the Request for Arbitration - when the Administrative Ordinance already existed - shows that this\u00a0claim has no legal and factual grounds and, furthermore, that the Valuation Date of the alleged\u00a0expropriation, from the day prior to the publication of the Administrative Ordinance, is\u00a0arbitrary416.\n364. \u00a0Fourth, Venezuela arguments that Decree No. 7.394 has not resulted in expropriation of\u00a0Claimants\u2019 investments in the Companies. The Respondent asserts that the Decree \"has not had\u00a0the effect of depriving the holders of the ownership of the assets or preventing the owners from\u00a0transferring them\" and explains that, pursuant to Article 5 of the Decree, the transfer of the\u00a0ownership right on all the assets would only occur with the completion of the expropriation\u00a0process set forth in the law. The procedure has not been completed, since it is suspended at the\u00a0request of the Claimants417. In any event, the process has complied with Article V of the BIT and\u00a0Venezuelan law.\n365. \u00a0According to Venezuela, the BIT does not prohibit expropriation, but rather regulates the manner\u00a0of exercising the right to expropriate or nationalize418. Respondent alleges that, although there has\u00a0been no expropriation, the process initiated by Decree No. 7.394 fully complies with the\u00a0requirements of the BIT and Venezuelan law, for the following reasons:\n409 Counter Memorial, fl 341-342.\n410 Counter Memorial, U 343.\n4,1 Counter Memorial.^) 345.\n412 Counter Memorial, fl 286 and 347.\n4,3 Rejoinder, U 345.\n414 Memorial de Contestaci\u00f3n, D 347.\n415 Memorial de Contestaci\u00f3n, 1| 291.\n4.6 Memorial de Contestaci\u00f3n, \\*| 294.\n4.7 Rejoinder, fl 358-359 y 375.\n418 Counter Memorial, 349.\n  \nLie.

Venezuela has complied with the fundamental due process rules under international law\u00a0and Venezuelan law, since (i) the Claimants received a notification prior the expropriation in\u00a0accordance with Venezuelan law; (ii) they have been entitled to be heard during the multiple\u00a0negotiations between the Parties; and (iii) they have had the possibility of submitting the decisions\u00a0affecting them to a jurisdictional court to enforce their rights.\n368. \u00a0Furthermore, the expropriation process is suspended in the administrative phase and the amicably\u00a0settlement phase remains open without the expropriation having taken place420. In fact, after\u00a0submitting its Request for Arbitration, the Claimants represented that negotiations with the\u00a0Venezuelan government were ongoing421. Regarding the Liaison Commission, it is\u00a0incomprehensible that the Claimants label it as illegal when they, themselves, agreed to its\u00a0creation422.\n369. \u00a0Third, the process has not been a discriminatory process, inasmuch Venezuela has issued 24\u00a0expropriation decrees with respect to other food companies under the Ley de Seguridad y\u00a0Soberan\u00eda Alimentaria, for the execution of a specific work for each of them423. Moreover, the\u00a0Claimants have not demonstrated compliance with international law requirements to evidence the\u00a0alleged discrimination, namely, (i) that the Companies are in similar circumstances to other\u00a0companies; (ii) that these companies have received less severe treatment; (iii) that they were\u00a0discriminated because of their nationality or another category protected by international law, or\u00a0that the Decree No. 7.394 unreasonable424.\n370. \u00a0With respect to Demaseca, Venezuela clarifies that Decree No. 7394 does not affect such company\u00a0and that it is not subject to any expropriation process. In effect, the Decree solely mentions\u00a0Monaca and its assets. Demaseca is a legal entity completely different from Monaca and it is\u00a0inadmissible pretending that it should be considered as a property of the latter for the simple fact\u00a0that both share industrial facilities425. According to Respondent, the decision to include Demaseca\u00a0within the valuation process was taken by mutual agreement between the Parties, and does not\u00a0imply that it is subject to an expropriation process426.\n371. \u00a0Fifth, Respondent argues that even if during the expropriation process of Monaca there had been\u00a0some illegality or breach of formal requirements required by Venezuelan law, such non-compliance does not constitute an international illegality427.\n372. \u00a0Based on the decisions of the tribunals of Feldman v. Mexico, Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine and\u00a0EnCana v. Ecuador, Venezuela argues that \"an expropriation cannot be considered illegal from\u00a0the international law point of view, when the investor intentionally ignores the remedies that local\u00a0law has in place to solve and correct the violations argued by the investor\u201d42\\*.

Through\u00a0using such remedies the Claimants would have been able to overcome the alleged violations they\u00a0now argue, including the alleged delay in concluding the negotiations and its harmful effects.\u00a0However, the Claimants decided not to use such remedies430. Consequently, they cannot now\u00a0claim that an expropriation took place under the BIT431.\n374. \u00a0To contradict this Claimants\u2019 argument. Venezuela states that the subjective assessments of an\u00a0investor regarding the possibility to use domestic remedies are insufficient to justify their\u00a0omission. Moreover, the Claimants have not evidenced the alleged irregularities in the third party\u00a0proceeding (incidente de tercetvavjand have not demonstrated that there is a connection between\u00a0such irregularities and the domestic remedies that they could have used to address their\u00a0situation433.\n375. \u00a0Finally, Venezuela argues that, insofar an expropriation has not yet taken place, the obligation to\u00a0pay by the Respondent and the corresponding right of the Claimants to receive a compensation\u00a0thereof, has not arisen In other words. Claimants\u2019 claim for compensation is groundless.\n376. \u00a0In this regard, the Respondent reiterates, on one hand, that the expropriation process is suspended\u00a0and that, even after the commencement of the arbitration, the Parties have continue discussing in\u00a0order to agree on the fair price or to achieve some other type of amicable settlement, different to\u00a0expropriation433. On the other hand, it argues that, in the event of an indirect expropriation claim,\u00a0there would be no obligation to compensate without the court having previously resolved that, in\u00a0effect, such expropriation took place434.\n377. \u00a0Respondent also alleges that, even in the event of an expropriation, the lack of payment of the\u00a0compensation does not in itself constitute an international law violation. Citing the tribunals of\u00a0ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela, inter alia, the Respondent\u00a0maintains that the negotiation process meets the requirement of legality435. In the case at hand,\u00a0the Parties began negotiations shortly after the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and. in this context.\u00a0Venezuela has made and discussed proposals and generated discussions regarding the valuation\u00a0of the Companies\u201936.\n378. \u00a0In summary. Venezuela submits that there has been no expropriation of the Claimants'\u00a0investments since: (i) the Claimants have not been deprived of their investment in the Companies;\u00a0(ii) the seizure measures ordered by a judge in the framework of the criminal proceeding, vis-\u00e0-vis, Fernandez Barrueco are temporary and may be rendered null and void; and (iii) the Parties\u00a0are in an amicably settlement phase and Decree No. 7.394 has not resulted in the expropriation of\u00a0the Companies137.\n3.

These measures arc (i) the seizure\u00a0and special administration measures arising from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez\u00a0Barrueco - including the SAREN and SUDEBAN circulars -; (ii) Decree No. 7.394 and the\u00a0imposition of the Liaison Commission; and (iii) the Administrative Ordinance that, according to\u00a0the Claimants, is the \"climax\" of the expropriation.4\u20199\n380. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants contend that these measures are intrinsically related140 and that, accordingly, they have\u00a0lost de im e control of the Companies and the value of their shares is \"virtually zero\".\u201d1 They also\u00a0argue that the expropriation was unlawful because it failed to abide by the terms of the Treaty. In\u00a0particular, they allege that they have not received compensation, that the expropriation was\u00a0contrary to Venezuelan law and that it was discriminatory.442\n381. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela rejects Claimants' allegations and explains that the seizure and special administration\u00a0measures - including the Administrative Ordinance, and Decree No. 7.394 arc completely different\u00a0and independent procedures, and that none of these measures, individually or cumulatively\u00a0considered, has resulted in a total or substantial loss of Claimants\u2019 control over their investments\u00a0or destroyed their value. In addition. Respondent holds that the request for compensation is without\u00a0cause because there has been no expropriation and that, in any event, the expropriation process has\u00a0complied with the requirements under Venezuelan and international law.\n382. \u00a0\u00a0As a starting point, the Tribunal notes that Claimants have not alleged that Venezuela directly\u00a0expropriated their investments in the country.44\u2019 Their argument has focused on demonstrating that\u00a0the measures imposed by Venezuela are an indirect expropriation that occurred progressively.444 It\u00a0further notes that the focus of the Claimants' expropriation allegation seeks to demonstrate that it\u00a0lost control of the Companies and that its investment therein is \"worth zero\u201d. Therefore, the\u00a0Tribunal shall examine, on the basis of the factual and legal arguments put forward by the Parties\u00a0in this arbitration, whether Venezuela subjected Claimants' investments to an indirect\u00a0expropriation in breach of Article V of the BIT and whether the foregoing items proposed by\u00a0Claimants have been demonstrated.\n383. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall begin by establishing the standard of indirect expropriation under the Treaty\u00a0and, in particular, that of creeping expropriation.\n384. \u00a0\u00a0Article V of the BIT provides that \"investments [...] shall not be subject to nationalizations,\u00a0expropriations, or any other measure of similar features or effects [...]445. Claimants allege - and\u00a0Venezuela does not reject- that the highlighted expression corresponds to the concept of \"indirect\u00a0expropriation\" w hich, unlike direct expropriation, does not entail a formal transfer of title to the\u00a0affected goods or rights.446 It is not disputed then that the BIT covers indirect expropriations.\n458 Memorial. \\* 176.\n4,\u2018> Memorial. \\* 107.\n440 See Brief. \u00a7.

Claimants do not contest this standard and insist that the Decree\u00a0and the seizure and special administration measures are indisputably related.456\n389. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that the Parties seem to agree on several aspects of the standard applicable to\u00a0an indirect expropriation.457 The underlying principle of their propositions is that a measure or\u00a0series of measures attributable to a State constitutes an expropriation if it entails total or substantial\u00a0deprivation of the investor\u2019s essential property rights over its investment, in particular its economic\u00a0use and enjoyment. The Parties also seem to agree that expropriation would occur if the investor\u00a0is wholly or significantly deprived from the ownership or effective control of its investment, or if\u00a0the investment is totally or significantly deprived of its value.\n390. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that, in the context of an indirect expropriation, the deprivation of those\u00a0fundamental rights musts be of such magnitude that the Tribunal concludes that maintaining the\u00a0title to the investment does not represent any benefit to the investor. Only in such scenario, and\u00a0considering all the circumstances of the case, could the measure or measures at issue be considered\n447 Memorial, U 173.\n448 See Memorial, 182.\n449 See Memorial, 182-183; Hearing, Tr. 1, 68:15-69:1. (\u201cThe parties to this arbitration agree that an indirect expropriation\u00a0occurs when a State substantially deprives an investor of the economic benefits of its investment.

For\u00a0example, the tribunal of Pope & Talbot v. Canada (Damages Award) determined that the test of\u00a0whether interference with business activities constitutes expropriation lies in establishing \"whether\u00a0such interference is sufficiently restrictive to support the conclusion that property has been \u2018taken \u2019\u00a0from its owner \u201d.458\n392. \u00a0\u00a0In Teemed v. Mexico, the tribunal explained that under international law is deemed to be a\u00a0deprivation of property \"when there is dispossession of its use or of the enjoyment of its benefits,\u00a0or interference with such use or enjoyment of equivalent effects or magnitude [.. .]\u201d.459\n393. \u00a0\u00a0The tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina II, referring to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in\u00a0Starrett Housing v. Iran stated that \"it is admitted in international law that measures taken by a\u00a0state may interfere with property rights to such extent that these rights are devoid of content and\u00a0are to be considered as expropriated [.. .]\u201d460.\n394. \u00a0\u00a0In the light of the facts proven in the arbitration, the Tribunal must examine whether the measures\u00a0attributable to Venezuela have interfered with the economic use and enjoyment of Claimants\u2019\u00a0investment to such extent that Claimants are to be considered stripped of their property. Such\u00a0would be the case if, as a result of such measures, Claimants lost control of their investments or\u00a0the value of their shares was destroyed, as they alleged happened.\n395. \u00a0\u00a0Having established the standard of indirect expropriation, it is useful to clarify the concept of\u00a0\u201ccreeping expropriation\u201d. Arbitral tribunals that have resolved investor-State disputes agree that\u00a0creeping expropriation is a form of indirect expropriation resulting from a series of measures\u00a0adopted by the state over a period of time, which, taken together, have the effects of an\u00a0expropriation.\n396. \u00a0\u00a0For example, the Tribunal in LG&E v. Argentina described creeping expropriation as an indirect\u00a0expropriation that manifests itself gradually and increasingly.461 Also, the tribunal of Generation\u00a0Ukraine v. Ukraine noted that:\n\u201cCreeping expropriation is a form of indirect expropriation with a temporarily distinctive quality in the sense that it encapsulates the situation in which a series of acts attributable\u00a0to a State over a period of time culminate in the expropriation of such property\u201d.462\n397. In the same vein, the Tribunal of Siemens v. Argentina, invoked by Claimants, noted that:\n\u201cBy definition, a gradual expropriation refers to a process, to the steps that ultimately have the effect of an expropriation. If the process stops before reaching that point, then the\u00a0expropriation does not happen. This does not necessarily mean that there are no adverse\u00a0effects. Obviously, each step must have an adverse effect that may not be important in\u00a0itself or be considered and unlawful act. The last step of a gradual expropriation that tilts\u00a0the balance is similar to the drop that fills the glass. The previous drops may not have had\n458 Pope & Tatbotv.

In short, a gradual or progressive indirect expropriation (creeping\u00a0expropriation) results from a series of actions or measures attributable to the State which, taken\u00a0together, have the effects of an expropriation, but which alone or separately do not give rise to an\u00a0expropriation.\n399. \u00a0\u00a0As noted above, in the Memorial and the Replication, the Claimants contended that Venezuela had\u00a0subjected its investments to a creeping expropriation that would have culminated or would have\u00a0been consummated with the publication of the Administrative Ordinance on January 22, 2013.465\u00a0Claimants further pointed out that it was the cumulative effect of the measures imposed by\u00a0Venezuela, ending with the Administrative Ordinance, which shaped the indirect expropriation.466\u00a0Claimants also referred to specific facts or situations that, according to them, denote the loss of\u00a0control over their investments and would have meant the destruction of the value of their respective\u00a0shares in the Companies.467 Finally, in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants argued for the first time\u00a0in the arbitration that Decree No. 7.394, by itself, constitutes an indirect expropriation.468\n400. \u00a0\u00a0For methodological reasons, the Tribunal shall begin by analyzing this last allegation, namely, the\u00a0alleged indirect expropriation arisen from Decree No. 7.394. Subsequently, the Tribunal shall\u00a0analyze the allegation of a creeping expropriation that would have culminated with the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance. Finally, the Tribunal shall refer to the Parties\u2019 arguments concerning\u00a0the alleged loss of control and destruction of value of their investments.\na. The alleged indirect expropriation arisen from Decree No. 7.394.\n401. \u00a0\u00a0In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants, in contrast to what they argued in their earlier briefs and\u00a0during the Hearing, [they] argued that Decree No. 7.394 itself constitutes an indirect\u00a0expropriation.469 Claimants have also seemed to suggest that the Administrative Ordinance itself\u00a0may have expropriatory effects.470 However, the Tribunal finds that neither the allegations nor the\u00a0evidence submitted by Claimants support these claims.\n402. \u00a0\u00a0First, because consistently in their allegations of both jurisdiction and merit, Claimants have\u00a0emphasized that it is the relationship between all measures - whether related to or arisen from\u00a0Decree No. 7.394, as well as the seizure and special administration measures - that results in a\u00a0creeping expropriation of their investments in Venezuela. This new allegation in the Post-Hearing\u00a0Brief is surprising in light of the approach made by Claimant throughout the arbitration.\n403. \u00a0\u00a0Second, because even if this late allegation was to be received, the Tribunal does not find that\u00a0Claimants have proved that Decree No. 7.394, alone or in conjunction with one or more of the\u00a0measures said to be related thereto, and without regard to the measures adopted in the framework\u00a0of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco, contains such a limitation on the\u00a0essential property rights of the Claimants in their investments as to lead to the conclusion that it\u00a0gave rise to an indirect expropriation.

It is clear from the Claimants\u2019 allegations prior to their Post-Hearing Brief that neither Decree No.\u00a07.394 nor the measures that might have resulted from that decree, alone, had the sufficient entity\u00a0to configure the alleged indirect expropriation.472 According to the same Claimants throughout this\u00a0arbitration, it is the actions of SAREN, of SUDEBAN and, particularly the actions of the special\u00a0administrators, culminating in the Administrative Ordinance, that are decisive for the alleged\u00a0destruction of value of the investment.473 These measures were issued as a consequence of the\u00a0process initiated against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and not of Decree No. 7.394. Accordingly,\u00a0beyond the allegation in their Post-Hearing brief, Claimants have not proven that by eliminating\u00a0the measures originating in the process against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco - which Claimants have\u00a0qualified as determinative -, and relying solely on Decree No. 7.394, an indirect expropriation\u00a0occurs.\n405. \u00a0\u00a0In summaiy, both in their briefs and at the Hearing, Claimants contended that the alleged\u00a0expropriation is a consequence of the combined effect of the seizure and special administration\u00a0measures and Decree No. 7.394474 and that this creeping expropriation would have been\u00a0consummated with the issuance of the Administrative Ordinance in January 2013.

Claimants have emphasized that, unlike the previous resolutions, the Administrative Ordinance\u00a0gives administrators \u201cthe broadest powers of administration \" over the Companies and, in that\u00a0sense, grants them the power to control them.478 The Tribunal does not agree with this construction.\u00a0In order to determine its scope, the discussed expression must be read in context. Article 2 of the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance provides as follows:\n\u201cThe aforementioned Special Administrators shall have the broadest powers of administration to guarantee the possession, custody, safekeeping, use and conservation of\u00a0the movable and immovable property of the limited companies listed in article 1 of this\u00a0Administrative Ordinance, in such sense, they shall guard the assets, property and rights\u00a0that are part of the referred Companies, aimed at their operation\u201d, [emphasis added]\n410. \u00a0\u00a0The transcribed text indicates that the \"broadest powers of administration\" are linked to the\u00a0specific purpose of protecting the movable and immovable property of the Companies in the\u00a0development of the precautionary measures ordered in the criminal proceedings against Mr.\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco. In that sense, the Administrative Ordinance does not entail a general power\u00a0to direct the Companies nor does it confer on special administrators the broader powers than those\u00a0they had by virtue of resolutions issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance between\u00a0December 2009 and December 2012. Indeed, such resolutions gave special administrators the\u00a0power to \u201ctake ail necessary measures for the custody, conservation and management of the\u00a0company and its corresponding assets, in order to prevent them from being altered, disappearing,\u00a0deteriorating or destroying [.. .J\u201d479.\n411. \u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing that, from a purely textual point of view, the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance did not extend the powers of the administrators in such a way as to give them the full\u00a0and unlimited management of the Companies. Both resolutions prior to the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance and the latter refer to administrative powers related to and necessary to maintain the\u00a0company and the assets that are the subject of the precautionary measures issued in the criminal\u00a0proceedings against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco.\n412. \u00a0\u00a0In addition to the text of the Administrative Ordinance itself, it is necessary to analyze the effects\u00a0of the measure to determine whether it had the impact attributed to it by Claimants and, in\u00a0particular, whether its issuance resulted in different and broader actions than those performed by\u00a0the special administrators prior to its effective date. The Tribunal has examined the evidence in the\u00a0file relating to the actions of special administrators prior to and after January 22, 2013 - the\u00a0issuance date of the Administrative Ordinance - and finds no evidence that there has been, de iure\u00a0or de facto, a material change between the functions exercised by special administrators prior to\u00a0the Administrative Ordinance and after its publication.480\n478 See Brief. <[21.\n479 See for example.

However, on April 29, 2013, when the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance came into force, a Gruma spokesman told the media that \"although officially and legally control was\u00a0granted to these special administrators back in I enezuela, in fact Gruma continues to operate the companies as we had been\u00a0doing since the expropriation took place \u201d, (A.

Indeed, Claimants held that the expropriation occurred\u00a0progressively and that the Administrative Ordinance was \u201cthe measure that consummated the\u00a0indirect expropriation \u201d482 Claimants reaffirm this criterion upon setting the Valuation Date on the\u00a0day immediately preceding the application of this measure483 and not on the issuance date of\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 - which they attempted to give by itself the effect of a measure of indirect\u00a0expropriation in the Post-Hearing Brief -, nor of the administrative resolutions prior to the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance. The foregoing would entail that, according to Claimants\u2019 own judgment\u00a0in the generality of their arguments, the actions attributable to Venezuela, prior to the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance, were not sufficient to conclude that they had lost the control over their\u00a0investments to the extent that they should be considered expropriated.\n416. \u00a0\u00a0The reports issued by Gruma prior to the publication of the Administrative Ordinance confirm this\u00a0conclusion. Indeed, in its 2011 Annual Report, submitted on April 30, 2012,484 Gruma confirmed\u00a0that Valores and Consorcio maintained control over the Companies, despite the fact that the other\u00a0measures discussed in this arbitration - in particular, Decree No. 7.394, the Liaison Commission,\u00a0the SAREN and SUDEBAN circulars and the appointment of special administrators - had already\u00a0been implemented arid were still in force after two years.485 As of the date of that Annual Report,\u00a0Claimants had already filed the Notice of Dispute.\n417. \u00a0\u00a0In the section on \u201cFinancial Information - Legal Proceedings\u201d, the 2011 Annual Report states as\u00a0follows:\n\u201cOn May 12, 2010, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \u201cRepublic\u201d) published decree number 7.394 in the Official Gazette of Venezuela (the \u201cExpropriation Decree\u201d),\nnegotiates expropriation\\*\u2019, Reuters, April 29, 2013 (Exhibit R-073) and \u2019\u2019Gruma points out that it keeps operating its plants in Venezuela\u201d, El Universal, April 29,2013 (Exhibit R-076).

(\u201cMONACA\u201d). The\u00a0Republic has stated to GRUMA\u2019s representatives that the Expropriation Decree extends to\u00a0our subsidiary Derivados de Ma\u00edz Seleccionado, DEMASECA, C.A. (\u201cDEMASECA\u201d).\n  \nThe Venezuelan government has not taken physical control on MONACA\u2019s or DEM ASECA\u2019s assets, nor has it taken control of their operations. Consequently, GRUMA\u00a0can validly and legally affirm that, to date. Valores Mundiales and Consorcio Andino have\u00a0full legal ownership over the rights, interests, shares and assets of MONACA and\u00a0DEMASECA, respectively, and that they also have complete control on all types of\u00a0decisions, operations and directives in [the Companies], which shall not cease until Gruma,\u00a0through Valores Mundiales and Consorcio Andino, finally agrees with the Venezuelan\u00a0government the terms and conditions of the transfer of such assets, in accordance with the\u00a0legal and business schemes currently being negotiated with the Venezuelan\u00a0government\u201d.486\n418. \u00a0\u00a0In the same section, the report refers to seizure and special administration measures issued by\u00a0virtue of the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco, to the first instance decision\u00a0in the third party proceeding {incidente de tercer\u00edas) and to the fact that the appeal against such\u00a0decision had not been resolved. However, the report does not mention any negative consequences\u00a0arisen from the imposition of such measures.487\n419. \u00a0\u00a0Gruma\u2019s contemporaneous statements point out that even two years after the adoption of the\u00a0seizure and special administration measures, and the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and the\u00a0imposition of the Liaison Commission, Claimants considered that they still maintained ownership\u00a0and control over the Companies. As the Tribunal pointed out earlier, the Administrative Ordinance\u00a0did not entail a substantial change in the powers and authorizations of the special administrators\u00a0by virtue of the resolutions in effect when Gruma filed the referred reports. In terms of the tribunal\u00a0of Siemens v. Argentina (Award), in this case the measure that would have represented the last step\u00a0in the expropriation did not have the entity to \"provoke the overspill\u201d.488\n420. \u00a0\u00a0As the Tribunal already noted, this analysis would suffice to reject Claimants\u2019 specific allegation\u00a0that Venezuela subjected their investments to a creeping expropriation that would have culminated\u00a0in the Administrative Ordinance.489 However, in order to fully address the Parties\u2019 allegations, the\u00a0Tribunal shall examine the other arguments offered by them in relation to the alleged indirect\u00a0expropriation.\nc.

On the contrary, it has been proven that\u00a0the corporate governance bodies of Monaca and Demaseca met after the adoption of the measures\u00a0at issue and entered into corporate acts. Indeed, a communication issued by the Claimants points\u00a0out that the shareholders\u2019 meeting of the Companies met during 2010, 2011 and 2012, to approve\u00a0financial statements and appoint or ratify managers.494 Therefore, no impediment has been proven\u00a0for the shareholders\u2019 meeting or the corresponding corporate body to meet and make decisions.\n428. \u00a0\u00a0Third, the Venezuelan law experts of both Parties agree that the failure to register these acts would\u00a0affect their enforceability and effects against third parties, but not their validity.495 In any case, as\u00a0it is a measure arisen from a judicial decision in criminal proceedings, Claimants could request\u00a0authorization from the judge who issued the measure to formalize or register the corresponding\u00a0act.496 Claimants did not contest this explanation from Venezuela nor did they submit evidence\n491 See Memorial. 78.\n492 Memorial, \\*1 185.\n495 Circular No. 0230-864 from the Director General of the Autonomous Service of Registries and Notaries to Public Registries,\u00a0Commercial Registries and Public Notaries, December 10, 2009 (Exhibit C-66).\n494 Letter from H.

Indeed, the SAREN circular does not restrict or prevent the sale of\u00a0Claimants\u2019 shares in Monaca and Demaseca. This is, as demonstrated in the arbitration, an seizure\u00a0measure issued in the framework of criminal proceedings against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco,\u00a0whereby SAREN prevents entities that have notarization or registration functions to refrain from\u00a0notarizing acts of companies with respect to which the seizure arisen from the aforementioned\u00a0criminal proceedings operate. In addition, according to Dr. Velazquez\u2019s expert report - not\u00a0disputed by Claimants on this item, both the ownership and the assignment of the shares are proven\u00a0by registration in the company\u2019s shares ledger498 and not in the records referred to in the SAREN\u00a0circular. It has not been demonstrated that the sale of shares is one of those acts that, according to\u00a0Venezuelan law, must be notarized or registered for purposes of validity or enforceability before\u00a0third parties. Therefore, the SAREN measure in no way affects the ability of Claimants to dispose\u00a0of their shares in the Companies.\n431. \u00a0\u00a0The fact that the measures taken in the criminal proceedings to secure the custody and preservation\u00a0of property entails the compliance of additional formalities, authorizations or requirements does\u00a0not entail, as Claimants seem to suggest, that control has been lost of Claimants\u2019 shares of Monaca\u00a0and Demaseca or that the possibility of selling them has been lost.\n432. \u00a0\u00a0Based on the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that it has not been proven that the\u00a0measure with respect to the registration of acts involving Claimants or Companies entails that they\u00a0or those are unable to enter into the corresponding acts or that Claimants have lost total or\u00a0substantial control of the Companies.\n433. \u00a0\u00a0Second, Claimants assert that, as a result of the measures imposed by Venezuela, they lost control\u00a0because they cannot receive dividends or profits. Claimants attribute this impediment, first, to the\u00a0restriction to register minutes of meeting arisen from the SAREN circular and, second, to the\u00a0immobilization of the Companies\u2019 bank accounts ordered by SUDEBAN and to the fact that any\u00a0transfer would require the authorization of the special administrators.\n434. \u00a0\u00a0Likewise, they allege that the distribution of dividends would be hindered by SlEX\u2019s refusal -allegedly ordered by the Liaison Commission - to update the Companies\u2019 foreign investment\u00a0register. Finally, in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants explained that Decree No. 7.394 prevents\u00a0them from receiving dividends or profits from the Companies.499 Based on the foregoing,\u00a0Claimants contended, for the first time in this arbitration, that the Decree, by itself, would be\u00a0sufficient to constitute an indirect expropriation of their investments.500 The Tribunal shall refer to\u00a0each of these arguments.\n497 See Brief, fl 234 and 387.\n498 Dr. Vel\u00e1zquez\" s Report, H 63.\n499 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Writ, U 84.\n75\n  \n  \n500 Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Writ, 83.\n  \nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 92 of 375\n435. \u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that, in general terms, the procedure for declaring\u00a0dividends is, as follows: the competent corporate governance body meets and approves the balance\u00a0sheet. If there are liquid and collected profits,501 this body may decide whether to distribute them\u00a0as dividends to shareholders or to use them for other purposes. If it chooses to declare dividends,\u00a0it automatically generates a liability to be borne by the company and an asset - credit right - for\u00a0shareholders.\n436. \u00a0\u00a0From the foregoing arises an elementary remark made by Respondent and with which the Tribunal\u00a0agrees: in order to be able to pay dividends, it is necessary to have declared them.502 Claimants\u00a0admit that they have not declared dividends since 2009 and explain that they have not declared\u00a0dividends because it would be futile to do so.503 Beyond Claimants\u2019 assertion on the alleged\u00a0\u201cfutility\u201d of having declared dividends, there is no evidence in the arbitration that if there are profits\u00a0in the Companies, Claimants have stopped declaring dividends as a consequence of measures taken\u00a0by Venezuela or that, having considered the dividend decree by the corporate body, it has been\u00a0unable to do so because of the measures adopted by Respondent and, specifically, because of the\u00a0SAREN circular or the failure of SIEX to update the registries. Claimants have not alleged, much\u00a0less proved, that Venezuelan officers improperly interfered with the decisions of the corresponding\u00a0corporate body regarding the use of the profits generated by the Companies.\n437. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants have not contributed acts of the administrative bodies or of the meeting that even suggest\u00a0the possibility of declaring dividends or reflect the futility of declaring them as alleged by\u00a0Claimants.\n438. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Tribunal reaffirms that the SAREN circular does not prevent the shareholders of\u00a0the Companies from declaring dividends, but rather regulates the registration of corporate acts.\u00a0Claimants do not dispute that under Venezuelan law the act of declaring dividends constitutes\u00a0rights and, therefore, it is not necessary to record the corresponding minute for the right to be\u00a0enforceable.504 Besides, if the SAREN circular imposes an additional requirement or authorization\u00a0under the seizure, Claimants did not prove that they had even attempted to request concept or\u00a0authorization to record the respective minute.\n439. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Claimants assert that paying dividends would entail altering the Companies\u2019\u00a0equity, which would be prohibited by the seizure and special administration measures and Decree\u00a0No. 7.394.505 However, they have not explained how this situation would be outlawed by the\u00a0aforementioned measures. To state that \u201877 would be na\u00efve to believe that [managers] would\u00a0authorize claimants to pay millions of dividends \u201d506 is not sufficient to satisfy their burden of proof.\n440. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the conduct of SIEX - not to process the update of the foreign investment register,\u00a0required to transfer foreign currency abroad -, the Tribunal remarks that the Parties do not agree\u00a0on what is the basis for their action, if an order of the Liaison Commission or measures arising\u00a0from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez Barrueco. Indeed, Claimants contend that\u00a0SIEX has not processed the requests to update Monaca\u2019s foreign investment registry by order of\u00a0the Liaison Committee.507 Their assertion is based on the statement of their witness, Engineer\u00a0Homero Huerta,508 and on a SIEX official notice in which that entity, referring to Decree No. 7.394,\n501 Dr. Canova\u2019s Second Report, Exhibit 54: Code of Commerce (C\u00f3digo de Comercio) of Venezuela, Article 307.\n502 Rejoinder, 542.\n503 Memorial, 80 (\u201cBecause of these restrictions, Claimants, as shareholders of MONACA and DEMASECA have not declared\u00a0dividends or other capital transfers since 2009, as it would be futile to do so \u201c).\n504 See Rejoinder, 542.\n505 Hearing, Day 1, Tr. 84:11-18.\n506 Hearing, Day 1, Tr. 84:19-85:3.\n507 See, for example, Memorial, 79 and 185.\n508 Witness statement of Homero Huerta Moreno, July 25,2014,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a052 and 53.\n76\n  \nLIC.

Venezuela points out that the\u00a0S1EX measure arises from the seizure issued within the criminal proceedings against Mr.\u00a0Fernandez Barrueco.510\n441. \u00a0\u00a0Regardless of the basis for its action. The Tribunal considers that the conduct of S1EX docs not\u00a0constitute a prohibition on declaring or paying dividends, but an obstacle to transferring\u00a0investment-related payments abroad. In this sense. Venezuela's conduct could represent a breach\u00a0of the obligation set forth in Article VII of the BIT or other standards of protection stated in the\u00a0Treaty?\" but the provided evidence docs not prove that such action entails a loss of control, use\u00a0or enjoyment of the investment equivalent to expropriation.\n442. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal does not consider that at the Hearing had been proven, as Claimants stated in\u00a0their Post-Hearing Brief,512 that Decree No. 7.394 prevented them or prevents them from receiving\u00a0dividends or profits from Monaca and Demaseca.513\n443. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants base their conclusion exclusively on a particular construction of Mr. Nelson Alba\u2019s\u00a0assertion during the Hearing. Indeed, Respondent\u2019s witness confirmed that disposing of the assets\u00a0covered by the Decree would be a breach thereof.514 However, he never asserted, as Claimants\u00a0suggest, that the Decree covers current assets of the Companies.515\n444. \u00a0\u00a0The issue of whether or not the profits of Companies are affected by Decree No. 7.394 has been\u00a0widely debated by the Parties in this arbitration. Respondent has indicated that the goods affected\u00a0by the Decree are exclusively those used for the operation of Monaca or for the large-scale\u00a0production, agro-industrial processing and storage of certain products, including machinery,\u00a0equipment and work implements. In that regard. Respondent submits that the money of the\u00a0Companies, including the dividends declared, would not be affected by the Decree, as it does not\u00a0comply with lhe purpose stated therein.516 This issue was confirmed by the Venezuelan expert\u00a0during his cross-examination at the Hearing:\n\u201cQ: You couldn't get the current assets out of Venezuela. Right? A: Current assets are their property. Q: Current assets arc money. Right? A: Of course, they are their property. I'm not\u00a0interested in money. I'm interested in goods to produce food. [,..]\u201d517.\n445. \u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Tribunal docs not find it possible to conclude, from Claimants' particular\u00a0construction of Mr. Nelson Alba\u2019s words at the Hearing, that Decree No. 7.394 prevents Claimants\u00a0from receiving profits or distributing dividends. There is also no evidence that Claimants, as\u00a0shareholders of the Companies, have even discussed at meetings or other management meetings\u00a0of the Companies about the profit decree or sharing and the simple assertion in this arbitration that\u00a0it would have been futile is no more than a mere appreciation of Claimants.\nso9 See Official Notice of the Supcrintendcncy of Foreign Investment (Superintendencia de Inversiones Extranjeras.

This interference would be reflected, for example, in the need to seek authorization\u00a0from government officers for any disbursement or transfer of their bank accounts and in the\u00a0hampering of certain business decisions. In addition, Venezuelan officials would have occupied\u00a0the offices and facilities of the Companies and requested information of a different nature.518\n447. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that the intervention of Venezuelan officials in Monaca and Demaseca\u00a0affected and affects the ordinary functioning and operation of the Companies and imposes on the\u00a0administration appointed by Claimants difficulties in the administration of the Companies. This\u00a0intervention, its context, its scope and the alleged juxtaposition of functions between the Liaison\u00a0Commission and the special administration, not only creates confusion, but also has effects for the\u00a0analysis of the Claimants\u2019 claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment as discussed in Section\u00a0V.B.3 of this Award.\n448. \u00a0\u00a0However, for purposes of the alleged indirect expropriation, the Tribunal does not find evidence\u00a0that such confusion between the functions of the Liaison Committee and the special administrators\u00a0was sufficient to displace, substitute or remove the shareholders or managers or employees of the\u00a0Companies designated by the shareholders. There is also no evidence that the members of the\u00a0Liaison Commission or the special administrators exercised functions of administration or\u00a0management of the Companies to such extent that the Claimants lost control over their investment\u00a0in a total or substantial manner.\n449. \u00a0\u00a0As examples of the intervention of the special administrators and the Liaison Committee in the\u00a0day-to-day decisions of the companies, Claimants indicate that these officers warned that they\u00a0would not recognize expenses associated with a corporate event;519 refused to authorize payments\u00a0corresponding to the lease fee of a new distribution center;520 vetoed the termination of a lease\u00a0agreement of a pasta plant521 and rejected an application to transfer vehicles owned by that\u00a0company.522\n450. \u00a0\u00a0However, Claimants themselves acknowledged that the payments for the corporate event and the\u00a0lease fee for the new distribution center, as well as the termination of the agreement and closure of\u00a0the pasta plant were eventually authorized.523 In other words, they were acts whose execution was\u00a0initially rejected by Respondent\u2019s officers, but were subsequently authorized by those same\u00a0officers. However, besides, they are acts whose entity and significance is not sufficient to hold that\u00a0they result in a loss of the investment control of the Claimants, to such extent that none of these\u00a0acts, as a whole or individually, were subject of a statement of loss control. Nor is there any\u00a0evidence in the file that as a result of such acts the Claimants or the Companies have been seriously\u00a0affected in their operation, or in their ability to manage and control, or that the Companies have\u00a0suffered financial loss. In short, these were prior authorization or control measures that generated\u00a0difficulty and discomfort in the execution of certain acts, and even confusion as to their origin or\u00a0legal basis, but which were not sufficiently significant to indicate a loss of control over the\u00a0investment.\n451. \u00a0\u00a0Fourth, Claimants allege that both the seizure and special administration measures and Decree No.\n5,8 Memorial, fl 92-102.\n519 Memorial, fl 98 and 185,\n520 Memorial, fl 99 and 815.\n521 Memorial, fl 101 and 185.\n522 Memorial.

A\u00a0different matter is the construction made by the Respondent\u2019s officers, who considered that while\u00a0the negotiations were suspended and the criminal process was in force authorizations -administrative or judicial - were required to dispose of the movable or immovable property,\u00a0generating confusion in the administration of the Companies.529\n454. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Claimants contend that with the publication of the Administrative Ordinance they lost de\u00a0iure control over the Companies. On this item, the Tribunal refers to the provisions of Section\u00a0V.A.3.b of this Award.\n455. \u00a0\u00a0In short, as it was not proven that the SAREN circular had prevented or prevents the corporate\u00a0governance bodies of the Companies from meeting and holding corporate acts, including declaring\u00a0dividends or deciding on the sale of shares. It is also not proven that the SUDEBAN circular or the\u00a0fact that the special administrators must approve banking movements of the Companies has\u00a0affected the power of statutory administrators to enter into these acts. Finally, it is not proven that\u00a0the conduct of the SIEX prevents the exercise of the power of corporate bodies to declare dividends\u00a0and distribute profits.\n456. \u00a0\u00a0As for Decree No. 7.394, the Tribunal did not find that it prevented the distribution of profits.

Nor does the Tribunal find any evidence that as a result of Decree No. 7.394\u00a0Claimants are prevented from selling their shares in the Companies. A different matter, as shall be\u00a0discussed later, would be the loss of value of the shares of the companies as a consequence of the\u00a0measures adopted by Venezuela and which are the subject of the dispute.\n457. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal concluded that the interference of Venezuelan civil servants in the Companies\u00a0- either through the Liaison Commission, the special administrators or a merger between two\u00a0concepts - did not have the effect of displacing, substituting or removing shareholders, managers\u00a0or employees of the Companies, and that their actions did not have the sufficient entity to affirm\u00a0that they are indicative of a loss of control over the investment. The Administrative Ordinance did\u00a0not mean a material change, de facto or de iure, in the powers that could be exercised by the special\u00a0administrators and therefore, does not modify the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of\u00a0their performance in the Companies.\n458. \u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, none of the actions alleged by Claimants had the scope and effect that Claimants\u00a0attribute to them with respect to the control of the investment. Nor was there a measure of an entity\u00a0such as to lead the Tribunal to conclude that, by taking this measure together with the others, there\u00a0is a total or substantial loss by Claimants over their investments, so that they are to be considered\u00a0expropriated.\nd.

It is not disputed that the\u00a0expropriation process initiated by virtue of the aforementioned decree has been suspended since\u00a0August 2010, and that there is uncertainty about the duration of the expropriation process. In that\u00a0sense the process that could ultimately lead to the assets affected by the Decree being definitively\u00a0transferred to Venezuela - or to the Decree being revoked through courts at the request of the\u00a0Claimants, according to the possibility posed by Venezuela - has not yet been completed. A\u00a0different matter is that the Decree remains in force, that the duration of its validity is uncertain and\u00a0that with it remain the limitations to the right to dispose of the affected assets that were discussed\u00a0in paragraphs 452 and 453 of this Award.\n464. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has already noted in paragraphs 446 to 450 of this Award the reasons why it considers\u00a0that it has not been proven that Decree No. 7.394 alone, or the measures arisen from the criminal\u00a0process, alone, or the aforementioned Decree and measures as a whole, resulted in such\u00a0interference by the Venezuelan officers in the management of the Companies to conclude that the\u00a0directors of the Companies appointed by shareholders were relegated to their functions or that the\u00a0Claimants lost substantial control over the day-to-day management of the Companies.\n465. \u00a0\u00a0It is worth remembering in this item that the Liaison Commission, to which Claimants attribute a\u00a0substantial part of the alleged loss of control, was withdrawn in September 2013, and that the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance, issued in connection with the criminal proceeding and which Claimants\u00a0consider to be the culminating event of the alleged expropriation, did not result in a material\u00a0change, de facto or de iure, in the functions of the special administrators as compared to whose\u00a0they had when the Claimants still maintained that they continued to exercise control over the\u00a0Companies.\n466. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, although Claimants and their experts allege that the Administrative Ordinance, upon\u00a0stating that special administrators must adjust their actions to the public policies issued by the\u00a0Ministry of Food in agrifood matters, \u201climits [the][Companies ] ability to generate profits and\u00a0make investment decisions that maximize their net present value \u201d,538 they have not proven that the\u00a0limitation on the ability to produce profits is such that it entails a total destruction of the value of\u00a0the Companies.\n467. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the State has the power to require\n535 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, H 36.\n536 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, \u00c2 38-39.\n537 nP|Ipnianp/^nillpr Firct Rprv^rl d\u00fb\n  \n537 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report.

On the contrary, the evidence\u00a0on record, and specifically acts performed by or involving the Claimants, indicates that, despite\u00a0the measures, the shares of Monaca and Demaseca did not lose their full value and maintain a\u00a0market value. Particularly relevant to this conclusion are (i) Gruma\u2019s acquisition of ADM\u2019s shares\u00a0in Valores and Consorcio in 2012; (ii) Gruma\u2019s annual reports; and (iii) the relevant information\u00a0submitted to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission where companies should truthfully\u00a0inform the public and stock market regulatory authorities of events that may affect the value of a\u00a0specific company\u2019s shares.542\n471. \u00a0\u00a0With respect to the sale of ADM\u2019s shares, it is proven that, in December 2012, Gruma acquired all\u00a0of ADM\u2019s shares in Valores and Consorcio for a total amount of USD$8 million543 (the \u201cADM\u00a0Transaction\u201d). From this transaction, the Venezuelan experts inferred that the total value of\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca at the date of the transaction was USD$266.7 million.544 According to these\u00a0experts, the implied value of the Companies on the basis of the ADM Transaction is the best\u00a0indication of the value of Monaca and Demaseca in the current scenario as of the Valuation Date\u00a0selected by Claimants (January 21,2013).545\n472. \u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller remark that the ADM Transaction was not about the Companies, but about 3%\u00a0of Valores and Consorcio. In addition, they contend that the ADM Transaction only represents\u00a0Claimants\u2019 ability to seek compensation from Venezuela for the measures or for the\u00a0expropriation.546\n473. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that the ADM Transaction is indicative that the share value of Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca is not zero. By the date of the ADM Transaction, all of the measures discussed in this\u00a0arbitration - save and except for the Administrative Ordinance, which, as stated, did not have the\n539 Rejoinder D\u00faplica, U 403.\n540 See infra \u00a7VI.C.l.\n541 See, for example Memorial, \\*[189.\n542 See infra\n543 Local Equity Interests Purchase Agreement by and between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and GRUMA S.A.B de C.V.\u00a0of Valores, December 14,2012 (\u2019\u2018Valores Purchase Agreement\\*\") (Exhibit CLEX-071 ); Local Equity Interests Purchase Agreement\u00a0by and between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and GRUMA S.A.B. de C.V. of Consorcio, December 14, 2012 (\"Consorcio\u00a0Purchase Agreement\u2019\\*) (Exhibit CLEX-072).\n544 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report, 10.\n545 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report, \u00a7 6.\nLIC.

Therefore, the ADM Transaction indicates that Claimants\u2019 shares in Monaca and Demaseca retained value despite of the seizure and\u00a0special administration measures and Decree No. 7.394.\n474. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Gruma\u2019s own valuation reports did not reveal a destruction of the value of its\u00a0investment, through Claimants, in Monaca and Demaseca as a result of the measures. Indeed, in\u00a0its 2010, 2011 and 2012, annual reports, Gruma referred to the Decree, the negotiations with the\u00a0Venezuelan government and the Notification of Dispute and indicated that there were no\u00a0indications of impairment of the value of its net investment in the Companies.547\n475. \u00a0\u00a0In the 2012 Gruma Annual Report presented in 2013 (\u201c2012 Gruma Annual Report\u201d). Gruma\u00a0stated that it had lost control of Monaca and Demaseca on January 22, 2013, and that, as a result\u00a0of that loss of control, it would cease to consolidate the financial information of the Companies in\u00a0its financial statements.548 This statement is also found in the in Gruma\u2019s 20-F report filed with the\u00a0U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission on April 30,2013, for the fiscal year ended on December\u00a031,2012549 (the \u201cGruma\u2019s 2012 20-F Report\u201d), which mentions the existence of the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance.\n476. \u00a0\u00a0Also in the 2012 Annual Report, Gruma indicated that, based on preliminary fair value\u00a0calculations, there was no indication of impairment of the value of Gruma\u2019s net investment in the\u00a0Companies.550 Indeed, the report states the following:\n\u201cPending resolution of this matter, based on preliminary fair value calculations, no indication of impairment of the value of GRUMA\u2019s net investment in MONACA and DEMASECA has been\u00a0identified. The Company cannot estimate the value of any future impairment charges, if any. The\u00a0Company\u2019s net investment in the historical value of MONACA and DEMASECA as of December\u00a031.2012. is $2,901,726 and $ 188,563, respectively. The Company does not maintain any insurance\u00a0covering the risk of expropriation of its investments\u201d.551\n477. \u00a0\u00a0This report does not allow us to conclude that on that date there was a total loss of control - which\u00a0Gruma only declared as a consequence of the Administrative Ordinance - or an impairment of the\u00a0investments that brought them to \u201czero \u201c value. However, according to the aforementioned report,\u00a0it is concluded that, based on calculations that qualify as \u201cpreliminary\u201d, there were not yet\u00a0\u201cidentified\u201d that there were \u201cindications\u201d of impairment in the value of Claimants\u2019 net investment\u00a0in Monaca and Demaseca, which would not allow us to estimate the possible future charge for\n547 GRUMA, 2010 Annual Report, 2010, page 54 (Exhibit R-016) (\u201cAt the end of 2010, the valuation committee received the\u00a0respective non-binding appraisals that are currently under discussion and subject to further approval by the highest level\u00a0authorities of each of the parties.

Gruma considered then that there was a possibility of a deterioration in the investment but that it had not been identified and that it was not possible to estimate it at that time.\n478. \u00a0\u00a0In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Gruma\u2019s statements prior to the one declaring the loss of control by the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance, together with the ADM Transaction, prove that Claimants\u2019 investment\u00a0in the Companies did not have a \u201czero\u201d value resulting from the seizure and special administration\u00a0measures or from Decree No. 7.394. This alleged \u201czero value\u201d results in large part from a legal\u00a0analysis of the Claimants in this arbitration that their experts accept as true, and not from the\u00a0contemporary evidence - Gruma\u2019s statements and ADM Transaction - mentioned above. As for\u00a0the Administrative Ordinance, it did not have the determining entity and scope attributed to it by\u00a0Claimants, and in the balance of evidence the Tribunal considers that the set of statements on the\u00a0situation of the Companies added to the ADM Transaction allow it to conclude that the value of\u00a0the Companies is not \u201czero\u201d as claimed by Claimants.\n479. \u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that, as a result of the seizure and special\u00a0administration measures - including the SAREN and SUDEBAN circulars - and Decree No. 7.394,\u00a0the Claimants have lost total or substantial control over the Companies. Nor is it proven that the\u00a0value their investments has been \u201cwiped out or destroyed\u201d. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that\u00a0there has been no indirect expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investments in Venezuela.\n480. \u00a0\u00a0In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to rule on the alleged\u00a0unlawfulness of the expropriation. The Tribunal shall refer to the alleged irregularities in the\u00a0expropriation process upon analyzing the claim for unfair and unequitable treatment.\nB. THE CLAIM FOR UNFAIR AND UNEQUITABLE TREATMENT\n1. Claimants\u2019 Position\n481. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Venezuela has breached its obligation to treat Claimants\u2019 investments fairly\u00a0and equitably.\n482. \u00a0\u00a0Article IV of the BIT establishes Venezuela\u2019s obligation to provide Valores and Consorcio with\u00a0fair and equitable treatment in accordance with (i) international law, (ii) other investment treaties\u00a0ratified by Venezuela, applicable by virtue of the most-favored-nation clause, and (iii) the national\u00a0treatment as a floor for the application of the standard.552\n483. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, the standard of fair and equitable treatment requires Venezuela not to\u00a0impose measures preventing the investor from enjoying the fruits of its investment, not to act in an\u00a0arbitrary, unfair, idiosyncratic or discriminatory manner, abide by due process, act in good faith,\u00a0act in a consistent and transparent manner, respect the legitimate expectations of the investor and\u00a0refrain from coercing or harassing the investor.553 Valores and Consorcio contend that nothing\u00a0prevents a claimant from asserting its claim for fair and equitable treatment on the same facts on\u00a0which their claim of expropriation is based, provided that the standard of fair and equitable\u00a0treatment is met.554\n484. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Article IV of the BIT, according to which Venezuela must grant \u201cfair and\u00a0equitable treatment under international law \u201d, cannot be equated with the minimum standard of\u00a0treatment.555 In this context, they argue that Venezuela misconstrues the standard of fair and\n552 Memorial, 1\u00a1 204.\n553 Memorial, H 205.

The BIT does not refer to the minimum level of treatment, and the construction of the Treaty according to the common sense of its terms,\u00a0supports the construction that this is an autonomous standard.556\n485. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Venezuela ignores the decisions quoted by Claimants in Vivendi v. Argentina II, Suez\u00a0vs. Argentina and Total v. Argentina. In Vivendi v. Argentina II, the court rejected the respondent\u2019s\u00a0construction that the standard of \u201cfair and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles\u00a0of international law\u201d was equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment under general\u00a0international law, formulated in the case Neer.\u2122 This tribunal held that the reference to \u201cprinciples\u00a0of international law\" in the treaty requires \u201cconsideration of a margin of principles of\u00a0international law broader than just the minimum standard\", adding that \u201cfair and equitable\u00a0treatment must be in accordance with the principles of international law, but this requirement of\u00a0conformity may serve as both a minimum and maximum limit of the standard offair and equitable\u00a0treatment of the treaty\".\u2122 Venezuela quotes the \u201cdoctrine\u201d of the North American Free Trade\u00a0Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) ignoring that Article 1105 of this treaty is entitled \u201cminimum standard of\u00a0treatment\u201d and that its note of interpretation establishes that the article reflects the minimum\u00a0standard of treatment.559\n486. \u00a0\u00a0In the event that the Tribunal determines that the standard of fair and equitable treatment equals to\u00a0the minimum standard of treatment, it has evolved in such a way that it must now be considered\u00a0comparable to the independent standard of fair and equitable treatment.560 The tribunals of Mondev\u00a0v. United States and Pope & Talbot v. Canada (Damages Award), inter alia, have acknowledged\u00a0that this.561 Claimants argue that Glamis Gold v. United States is inapplicable because it is a\u00a0NAFTA case and in this case the State parties to the BIT have not issued a similar construction.562\n487. \u00a0\u00a0Likewise, according to paragraph 2 of Article IV of the BIT, Venezuela must provide the same\u00a0treatment as that guaranteed to investors from a third State, if such treatment is more favorable.\u00a0Claimants contend that the simple reading of Article IV of the BIT shows that the most-favored-nation clause in paragraph 2 qualifies the standard of fair and equitable treatment in paragraph 1\u00a0and, therefore, the function of the most-favored-nation clause is to \u201climit\u201d the scope to the standard\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment.563 Claimants also consider ungrounded Venezuela\u2019s argument that\u00a0the most-favored-nation clause cannot be sued to incorporate the fair and equitable treatment of\u00a0another treaty because Article IV, paragraph 1 (which includes the protection of fair and equitable\u00a0treatment) was specifically negotiated.564 Claimants rely on the legislative history of the BIT\u00a0Approval Bill. They argue that the purpose of the most-favored-nation clause is precisely to\u00a0override the provisions of the base treaty, regardless of whether those provisions were negotiated\u00a0with any level of specificity.565 Finally, Claimants argue that importing a fair and equitable\u00a0treatment provision from another investment treaty does not require a comparison with an investor\u00a0in similar circumstances.566\n488. \u00a0\u00a0Under the most-favored-nation clause of the BIT, Claimants invoke the application of the text of\u00a0the fair and equitable treatment clauses without reference to general international law, included in\n556 Brief, 1290.\n557 Memorial, \\*\u00a1 208.\n558 Memorial, \\*| 208, quoting I ivendi v.

It adds that \u201cdespite the fact that the Republic denies the connection between\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 and the seizure and special administration measures, the expert absent from the\u00a0Republic recognizes this in his report\".585 It is also arbitrary, because it was imposed to execute\u00a0the \u201cSocialist Agroindustrial Processing Capacity Consolidation for the Venezuela of the XXI\u00a0cenluiy\" program, although this program does not really exist.586 Finally, Decree No. 7.394 is\u00a0arbitrary because it is contrary to due process.587\n494. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Venezuela engaged in discriminatory conducts in breach of the standard of\u00a0fair and equitable treatment. Although Venezuela claims that it adopted these measures to respond\u00a0to the food crisis and that they were imposed on the entire sector, the measures imposed on\u00a0Alimentos Polar C.A. and Cargill Venezuela S.A. - companies competing with Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca - have not had the scope of those imposed on the Companies.588 Alimentos Polar C.A.\u00a0and Cargill Venezuela S.A. were expropriated only one warehouse and one rice plant, respectively,\u00a0and have not been forced to transfer all their assets for the performance of a public work, while\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 subjected the Companies to an expropriation process that affects all of their\u00a0assets.589\n495. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, Venezuela also engaged in conduct contrary to due process, breaching\u00a0the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Claimants mention the similarities of this dispute with\u00a0Petrobart v. Kyrgyzstan. They allege that Venezuela intervened irregularly in the third party\u00a0proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas) initiated by the Companies and Claimants and in the appeal\u00a0filed by the same parties against the decision in the third party proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas)\u00a0confirming the seizure and special administration measures.590 In addition, they allege that\u00a0Venezuela has indefinitely suspended the expropriation proceedings with the aim of not paying the\u00a0compensation due, but maintaining the effects of Decree No. 7.394.591\n496. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela would also have incurred a denial of justice since Claimants filed an appeal against the\u00a0decision rendered in the third party proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas) more than five years ago,\u00a0but the appeal has not yet been admitted.592 According to Dr. Canova, the admission of an appeal\n580 Brief, U 311 and footnote 565.

Slovakia, a claim for\u00a0denial of justice based on unjustified procedural delay does not require to use up internal remedies.\n497. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, under Venezuelan law, a final court judgment is required and the timely payment of\u00a0fair indemnity to occupy the Companies, or in the case of prior occupation, the initiation of an\u00a0expropriation suit, including the deposit of the amount of compensation.594\n498. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela would also have acted contrary to good faith. Respondent has obstructed and delayed\u00a0the resolution of the dispute by changing Venezuela\u2019s representatives in the negotiations, imposing\u00a0additional requirements in order to create false expectations of good faith negotiation, the\u00a0unjustified failure to comply with the conditions agreed upon in the \u201cCommitment Deed\u201d and\u00a0failure to respond to Claimants\u2019 continuing invitations to resume the dialogue.595 It has not acted\u00a0in a consistent and transparent manner in its discussions with Claimants, nor has it had adequate\u00a0communication with Claimants during the process.596\n499. \u00a0\u00a0Based on El Paso v. Argentina, Claimants argue that the standard of fair and equitable treatment\u00a0also encompasses reasonableness and proportionality. The seizure and special administration\u00a0measures have not been proportional because they affect the whole property of the companies,\u00a0despite the fact that, if anything, as Venezuela admits, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco never had more\u00a0than a minority and indirect percentage in the Companies.597-\n500. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Claimants contend that Venezuela treated its investments unfairly and inequitably by\u00a0harassing the staff of the Companies by Venezuelan officials, especially the members of the\u00a0Liaison Commission. This harassment was carried out through threats through threats of dismissal\u00a0and the taking of operations by force; pressure for the dismissal of employees who did not\u00a0sympathize with the government; the submission of Companies\u2019 managers to a regime that exposes\u00a0them to criminal and civil sanctions if they act against the mandates of the Liaison Commission;\u00a0threats to disallow payments and to redirect raw materials from the Companies in order to ensure\u00a0that their actions conform to the interests of Venezuela; and threats to take the companies by the\u00a0Venezuelan National Guard.598 Likewise, Venezuelan officials have occupied the offices of the\u00a0Companies, requested thousands of requests for information, obligated to pay indemnity payments\u00a0to members of the Liaison Commission and to the special administrators and the requirement to\u00a0notify decisions on operational and labor matters, interfering in these decisions.599\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s Position\n501. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela maintains that it has not breached the provisions of Article IV of the BIT on fair and\u00a0equitable treatment.\n502. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela first argues that Claimants have failed to make a claim for prima facie fair and equitable\u00a0treatment.600 They have failed to explain which acts or measures, in addition to those constituting\u00a0an expropriation, have independently breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment.601 The\u00a0basis for the two claims must be different, and Claimants cannot simply mechanically repeat the\nS9J Hearing, Day 1, Tr. 101:20-102:4.\n594 Memorial, 226.\n595 Memorial, 1226; Brief, fl 329-333.\n596 Memorial, fl 331-332.\n597 Hearing, Day l,Tr. 101:4-101:15.\n598 Memorial, H 229; Brief, 1334.\n599 Memorial, U 229.\n600 Counter memorial. 5i 386.\n601 Rejoinder, 460.\n88\n  \nLIC.

United States to define the minimum standard of treatment\u00a0under customary international law.605 It also quotes Neer v. Mexico to argue that the minimum\u00a0standard of treatment has been breached if there is conduct amounting to an outrage, in bad faith,\u00a0a deliberate disregard for duty, or an insufficiency of governmental action so far from\u00a0international standards that any reasonable and impartial man could easily acknowledge as\u00a0insufficient\".^ Claimants argue that the common sense of the terms of the BIT does not refer to\u00a0the minimum standard of treatment. However, Venezuela maintains that nothing in the BIT links\u00a0the fair and equitable standard of treatment with a \u201cstand-alone\u201d standard or the components that\u00a0Claimants seek to incorporate.607\n505. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela also argues that Claimants cannot qualify NAFTA cases as irrelevant because their\u00a0analysis of the minimum standard of treatment reflects international law.608 It quotes Professor\u00a0Paparinskis, according to whom \"[the] ordinaiy meaning of fair and equitable treatment ' refers\u00a0directly to the minimum standard provided by customary international law, even if the process or\u00a0object of reference is not explicitly specific in the treaty at issue. However, even if that assertion\u00a0was not entirely persuasive, the minimum standard must nevertheless \u2018be taken into account \u2019 as a\u00a0'relevant rule of international law \u2019 in accordance with Article 31(3)(c) of the [Vienna Convention],\u00a0which plays an important role in the construction process (\u2018together with the context \u2019, under the\u00a0heading of Article 31(3)) \u201d.609\n506. \u00a0\u00a0It also highlights that Professor Schreuer, Claimants\u2019 expert in responding to Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0jurisdictional objections, considers that when treaties refer to international law in their fair and\u00a0equitable treatment clauses, customary law must be taken into account upon construing those\u00a0clauses.610 Professor Schreuer agreed with the NAFTA Free Trade\u2019s Commission construction\u00a0because the heading of Article 1105(1) is \u201cminimum standard of treatment\u201d, but also because the\u00a0text of the clause established an explicit relationship between fair and equitable treatment and\u00a0international law. Although Professor Schreuer indicates that the conclusion reached in the\u00a0NAFTA context would not necessarily be applicable in the context of other treaties lacking these\u00a0features, the treaty at issue before the tribunal does have the important characteristic pointed out\u00a0by Professor Schreuer: there is a direct link between fair and equitable treatment and international\n602 Id.\n605 Counter memorial, 390; Rejoinder, 1] 471.\n604 Rejoinder, U 463.\n605 Rejoinder, U 463; Glamis Gold v.

Estonia and M.C.l. Power\u00a0Group v. Ecuador in support of its argument that the standard of fair and equitable treatment\u00a0necessarily incorporates the minimum standard of treatment provided by customary international\u00a0law.\n508. \u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the minimum standards of treatment is not comparable to the autonomous standards\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment. Claimants do not define with specificity what \u201cautonomous\u00a0standard\u201d means.613 In any case, the minimum level of treatment is a minimum, not a maximum,\u00a0and especially not a potpourri of standards arranged and selectively chosen to obtain the desired\u00a0result.614\n509. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela also argues that the import of one standards of fair and equitable treatment from another\u00a0treaty is not appropriate. To the extent that the standard of fair and equitable treatment corresponds\u00a0to the minimum standard of treatment under international law, and even if the Agreement did not\u00a0specifically include an express reference to international law, the meaning of standard would not\u00a0change, even if the tribunal could and would decide to import the text of another treaty.615\u00a0Venezuela contends, however, that Claimants\u2019 arguments about \u201cimporting\u201d a treaty with more\u00a0favorable terms are ungrounded. International tribunals have taken the view that provisions\u00a0specifically negotiated by the contracting parties cannot be circumvented by a most-favored-nation\u00a0clause.616 In addition, the legislative history of the BIT Approval Bill does not provide any\u00a0additional support for this argument, since it only states that the most-favored-nation clause\u00a0\u201creinforces the standard of fair and equitable treatment\".\u21221 Claimants have also failed to prove\u00a0that Venezuela has accorded other foreign investors in similar circumstances more favorable\u00a0treatment than Claimants, which is a requirement for filing a claim under the most-favored-nation\u00a0clause.618\n510. \u00a0\u00a0However, even if an autonomous standard were applied in this case, Claimants have not proven\u00a0that Venezuela\u2019s measures have deprived Claimants of the benefits of their investments, that\u00a0Venezuela has treated Claimants in a manner that is discriminatory, arbitrary, contrary to due\u00a0process or the principle of good faith, or that Venezuela has exercised coercion and harassment.\n511. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela argues that in no case have the owners been deprived of the ownership of their\u00a0investment, nor have they diminished its commercial value or impeded its operation. No\u00a0Venezuelan authority has prohibited the distribution of dividends, the approval of balance sheets\u00a0and financial statements, and the performance of other acts mentioned by Claimants.619 Unlike the\u00a0case o\u00eeAchmea v. Slovakia, invoked by Claimants, what happened in this case was that due to the\u00a0restrictions on the seizure imposed in the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco\u00a0(where the State exercises its police power), on a temporary basis, certain acts at law cannot be\u00a0formalized and authenticated, without judicial authorization.

The judge concluded that the only way in which\u00a0it was possible to safeguard the value of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco\u2019s shares was to protect and\u00a0safeguard the equity and value of the Companies as a whole.626 Furthermore, it is justified that the\u00a0measures have been applied to the companies as a whole and not only to the fraction of the\u00a0shareholding of the defendant. Also, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco\u2019s right, through Rotch, to recover\u00a0Claimants\u2019 shares - a right that was in effect at the time the measures were issued - provides a\u00a0reasonable basis for validly ordering the seizure.62/\n514. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants\u2019 arguments are formally inadmissible because in substance they constitute a claim of\u00a0denial of justice, which has sought to be presented simply as common breach of the standard of\u00a0fair and equitable treatment, when the requirement of use up of local remedies has not been met.628\u00a0Venezuela has demonstrated that Claimants could have used suitable domestic remedies to nullify\u00a0or amend the allegedly arbitrary or unjustified effects of the measures.629 On the other hand,\u00a0Claimants have not proven that the remedies available to them were futile.\n515. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the origin and basis of the measures, and the reasons why they are not discriminatory,\u00a0Venezuela reiterates the arguments it used to respond the claim of expropriation.630\n516. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela also argues that Decree No. 7.394 was not arbitrary and that Claimants overlook the\u00a0context in which it was formulated.631 Venezuela has refuted Claimants\u2019 history that Venezuela\u00a0created the situation that made necessary the expropriation of the companies.632 Measures taken by\u00a0the Government to address the food crisis were imposed on the entire sector.633 In addition, there\u00a0is no obligation to treat every company operating in the country in exactly the same way, and\u00a0international law allows for justified government actions, as in this case.634 With respect to the\n620 Rejoinder, 5 484.\n621 Rejoinder, 1 484.\n622 Counter memorial, 1i 406, quoting the ELSI Case (UnitedStates v.

Hungary to argue that: \"not all\u00a0failures of imperfections in a process shall prevent fair and equitable treatment. The rule is not\u00a0perfect. It can be said that the rule has been breached only when the procedural acts or omissions\u00a0ofa state are manifestly unfair or unreasonable in relation to the facts and context before the judge\u00a0(in such a way as to shock or at least surprise the sense of legal correctness) \u201d.638\n519. \u00a0\u00a0It has not been proven that there has been improper intervention by any body of the Venezuelan\u00a0State in the third party proceedings (incidente de tercer\u00edas). Claimants quote the account of their\u00a0\u2022 witness, Homero Huerta, of information he received from his lawyers in a referential, speculative\u00a0and ungrounded manner.639 Besides, the judge did not ignore any evidence in the procedure.640\u00a0With respect to the claim of denial of justice, Venezuela argues that there is no fundamentally\u00a0unfair procedure or blatantly wrong decisions in this case that can be considered a breach.641 Within\u00a0criminal proceedings, the only decision so far issued was in favor of the accused, and is under\u00a0appeal, while the duration of the appeal proceedings in the third party proceeding (incidente de\u00a0tercer\u00edas) is reasonable.642 Furthermore, the use up of internal remedies is a general principle in\u00a0any case of denial of procedural justice.643\n520. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the negotiation process, Venezuela maintains that since the publication of Decree No.\u00a07.394, the Parties have developed uninterrupted negotiations in which they have analyzed and\u00a0discussed various scenarios for a potential agreement; that the suspension of the expropriation\u00a0process was by common agreement precisely to allow for the development of the negotiations; that\u00a0Claimants\u2019 account ignores the complexity of the negotiations and is false when it refers to the\u00a0alleged threats of coercion; that, in addition, it should be taken into account that at the end of 2011,\u00a0the essence and nature of the negotiations between the Parties changed, as the possibility of\u00a0creating two joint ventures began to be considered; that Gruma\u2019s contemporary communications\u00a0contradict the position of Claimants in this arbitration on the state of the negotiation between the\u00a0Parties; and that in October 2013, the Parties agreed to continue the conversations in a confidential\u00a0manner and that, indeed, they were continuing as of the date of their Rejoinder.644 Venezuela also\u00a0argues that it has not exercised coercion or harassment, and so Claimants\u2019 statements to that effect\u00a0are denied by witnesses Nelson Alba, Johabner Parra and Hairo Arellano.645\n635 Rejoinder, 490.

On the other hand, Venezuela alleges that Claimants\u00a0have not made a claim for fair and equitable treatment prima facie; it disputes the standard\u00a0proposed by Claimants and, in any event, denies that their actions are contrary to the obligation to\u00a0provide fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty. The Tribunal shall refer to the arguments of\u00a0the Parties in that order.\n523. \u00a0\u00a0First, the Tribunal does not share Venezuela\u2019s position that Claimants cannot base their claim for\u00a0fair and equitable treatment on the same facts on which they base their claim for expropriation.\u00a0None of the authorities quoted by the Respondent backs its position. On the contrary, international\u00a0tribunals have accepted that the same facts that constitute an expropriation may entail breaches of\u00a0other standards of protection under the respective treaty.646\n524. \u00a0\u00a0For example, the tribunal of BCB v. Belize noted:\n\u201cAs an initial issue, the Tribunal does not accept that a behavior that breaches one of the protections of the Treaty, cannot breach other provisions of the same treaty. The\u00a0Treaty addresses the general objective of \u2018creating favorable conditions for greater\u00a0investment\u2019 among States parties through the protection of investments by articulating\u00a0a set of standards of protection in more or less general terms. The protection established\u00a0in this way is intended to be cumulative. Nothing in the Treaty supports Respondent\u2019s\u00a0claim that the standards of the Treaty are alternative to each other, so that a breach of\u00a0any would prevent the breach of another. Rather, each of the standards set out in the\u00a0Treaty expresses a particular aspect of the general purpose of investment protection. Its\u00a0potentially overlapping application reflects this complementarity\u201d.647\n525. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that the same analysis applies to the Treaty on which Claimants\u2019 claims in\u00a0this arbitration are based. To the extent that the same conduct may breach several provisions of the\u00a0Treaty, nothing prevents Claimants from basing their remaining claims on the same facts invoked\u00a0in connection with their expropriation claim.\n526. \u00a0\u00a0Although this is not the case before this Tribunal, accepting Venezuela\u2019s position would lead to\u00a0the conclusion that an investor cannot file a subsidiary claim for breach of the standard of fair and\u00a0equitable treatment in the vent that the corresponding tribunal does not find evidence of\u00a0expropriation. In this hypothetical scenario, if the investor errs in the legal qualification of the facts\u00a0subject of the process in his main claim, he would be devoid of redress even if the acts of the State\u00a0are contrary to some standard of protection under the treaty over which the investor also submits\u00a0a claim.\n527. The same fact or situation may constitute a breach of different provisions of a treaty, and unless\u00a0otherwise provided, the corresponding tribunal may exercise its jurisdiction to examine and decide\u00a0on the breaches invoked provided they have been duly alleged. In this case, Claimants provided an\u00a0independent analysis of the reasons why they believe Venezuela\u2019s measures breach Article IV(1)\u00a0of the Treaty on Fair and Equitable Treatment. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot accept Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0defense that Claimants \u00a1failed to articulate a claim for fair and equitable treatment prima facie.\n646 See, for example, CME v. Czech Republic,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0610-612; Metalclad v. Mexico,\n104; Teemed v.\n  \nLIC.

For example, the tribunal of Vivendi v. Argentina\u00a0II, upon construing the expression \"in accordance with the principles of international law \u201d in\u00a0Article 3 of the bilateral investment treaty between France and Argentina - noted the following:\n\u201cThe Tribunal finds no basis for equating the principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment. First, the reference to the principles of international\u00a0law supports a broader construction that entails considering a margin of principles of\u00a0international law broader than just the minimum standard. Second, according to the\u00a0wording of Article 3, fair and equitable treatment must be in accordance with the\u00a0principles of international law, but this requirement of conformity can serve both as a\u00a0minimum and maximum limit to the fair and equitable treatment standard of the Treaty.\u00a0Third, the words of the provision indicate that contemporary principles of international\u00a0law must also be taken into account, not just the principle of almost a century ago\u201d.649\n532. \u00a0\u00a0The tribunal of Total v. Argentina also reached the same conclusion:\n\u201cIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the phrase \u2018fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of international law\u2019 cannot be read as \u2018treatment required by the minimum\u00a0standard of treatment of foreigners/investors under international law\u2019. This is\u00a0irrespective of the issue of whether there really exists today a difference between this\u00a0traditional minimum standard and what international law generally requires in terms of\u00a0the treatment of foreign investors and their investments\u201d.650\n533. \u00a0\u00a0In any event, the Tribunal notes that the concept of \u201cminimum standard of treatment\u201d under\u00a0international law has developed significantly since its earliest definitions. For example, the tribunal\u00a0of RDC v. Guatemala noted that \"the minimum standard of treatment is 'constantly in a process\u00a0of development 'form its formulation in Neer\u201d.65'\n534. \u00a0\u00a0In a similar sense, the tribunal of Pope & Talbot v. Canada (Damages Award) recognized that \"the\u00a0range of actions subject to the international arena has expanded beyond the international breaches\u00a0considered in Neer to include the concept of fair and equitable treatment \u201d.652\n648 The Tribunal notes that NAFTA expressly includes the minimum standard of treatment and, therefore, other tribunals'\u00a0constructions of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" clause of that treaty cannot automatically extend to this BIT.\n649 Vivendi v.

Argentina noted that:\n\u201cThe minimum requirements to meet this [minimum] standard have varied, and the Tribunal understands that its content is substantially similar, whether the terms are\u00a0construed according to their current meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention or\u00a0under customary international law\u201d.653\n536. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with the opinion of this tribunal and of other tribunals that have reached the\u00a0same conclusion.654 Indeed, the concept of \u201cminimum standard of treatment\u201d has been expanded\u00a0to such an extent that it now provides protection very similar to that accorded under the standard\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment. Accordingly, the discussion raised lacks practical effect in this case,\u00a0since the level of protection afforded to investments protected under the Treaty is substantially the\u00a0same, regardless of how the reference to \u201cInternational Law\u201d contained in Article IV(1) of the BIT\u00a0is construed.\n537. \u00a0\u00a0In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to refer to Claimants\u2019\u00a0alternative argument that the provisions on fair and equitable treatment of other bilateral\u00a0investment treaties entered into by Venezuela which do not refer to \u201cInternational Law\u201d in relation\u00a0to that obligation should be applied through the most-favored-nation clause.\n538. \u00a0\u00a0Article IV( 1 ) of the Treaty is to be construed in accordance with the rule of construction of Article\u00a031(1) of the Vienna Convention. In its current sense, the terms \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cequitable\u201d mean\u00a0\u201caccording to justice and reason\u201d655 and \u201chaving equity\u201d656, namely, having \u201cequality of mind\u201d.657\u00a0In their context, the terms \u201cfair and equitable\u201d refer to the treatment that the Contracting States\u00a0undertook to guarantee to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting State.\u00a0According to numeral 2 of the same Article IV, such treatment may not be less favorable than that\u00a0granted to the investments of its own investors or those of third States. In view of the purpose and\u00a0aim of the Treaty, as arisen from its preamble, this treatment should be aimed at creating favorable\u00a0conditions for protected investments.\n539. \u00a0\u00a0From the construction and application that different arbitral tribunals have given to the obligation\u00a0to grant fair and equitable treatment, some elements commonly accepted as part of the standard\u00a0arise. These components include, inter alia, the obligation not to act in an arbitrary or\u00a0discriminatory manner,658 abide by due process659 and to act in a consistent and transparent\u00a0manner.660 It has also been understood that \u201cthe guarantee of fair and equitable treatment [...] is\u00a0an expression and constitutive part of the principle of goodfaith recognized by international law \u201d\u00a0and must therefore be construed in light of such principle.661 In any case, as established by the\u00a0tribunal of Mondev. v. USA, the decision of what is fair and equitable shall depend on the facts of\u00a0each specific case.662\n653 Azurix v. Argentina, 361.\n654 See, for example, Mondev v. United States, 123; Azurix v.

However, the Tribunal shall not proceed to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the State breached one or more components of the standard. On the contrary,\u00a0the Tribunal shall examine all the facts and circumstances submitted to their consideration in order\u00a0to establish whether or not the action of the State, taken as a whole, conforms to the standard of\u00a0conduct required by Article IV( 1 ) of the Treaty. This, insofar as Claimants\u2019 allegation would\u00a0appear to point out that it was the aggregate of measures adopted by Venezuela that resulted in the\u00a0breach of Article I V( 1 ) of the Treaty.663\n541. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Claimants contend that Venezuela unfairly and inequitably treated their investments by\u00a0implementing and maintaining a series of measures on Monaca and Demaseca that have deprived\u00a0them of the basic benefits of their investments.664 Specifically, the complain that, as a result of the\u00a0seizure and special administration measures and Decree No. 7.394, Claimants are unable to\u00a0distribute dividends, approve financial statements, to appoint or remove directors or managers, to\u00a0sell their shares in the Companies or to dispose of their assets.665\n542. \u00a0\u00a0Based on the decision of Achmea v. Slovakia, Claimants allege that the adverse effect of the\nmeasures - that is, the impediment to receiving the basic benefits of their investments - would be sufficient to conclude that Venezuela breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment\u00a0under the Treaty. In any case, they claim that the measures are also contrary to this standard of\u00a0protection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\n543. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that the adverse effect of a measure or series of measures is not sufficient\u00a0to conclude that the State failed to comply with its obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment\u00a0of investments protected under the Treaty. To reach this conclusion, the Tribunal shall have to find\u00a0evidence that the measures themselves or viewed in conjunction with the other circumstances of\u00a0the cases, are contrary to the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n544. \u00a0\u00a0In this case, it is proven that, as of 2009, Venezuela imposed seizure and special administration\u00a0measures on Monaca and Demaseca arisen from the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0Barrueco, alleged shareholder of the Companies. These measures include the SAREN circular -which ordered the Public Registries, Mercantile Registries and Notaries to refrain from formalizing\u00a0or authenticating acts or legal affairs in which the Claimants or the Companies666 - and the\u00a0appointment of special administrators empowered, in general, to exercise actions tending to\u00a0guarantee the possession, safeguard, custody, use and conservation of the assets of the Companies\u00a0and, in particular, to guard their banking assets.667 Under this regime, bank movements of\u00a0Companies must be approved by special administrators.668\n545. \u00a0\u00a0The third party proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas) initiated by Claimants to request the lifting of\u00a0the measures was denied in the first instance in November 2010 and, at the date of the last\u00a0submission of the Parties before this Tribunal, Claimants\u2019 appeal against that decision had not yet\u00a0been admitted. Accordingly, the seizure and special administration measures remain in force.\n546. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, in May 2010, Venezuela issued Decree No. 7.394 by which it ordered the\u00a0initiation of an expropriation process of certain assets of Monaca. After the issuance of the Decree,\u00a0Venezuela imposed a Liaison Commission on Monaca and Demaseca.

The expropriation process was suspended in August\u00a02010 to give rise to \u201cfriendly negotiations\u201d between the Parties which, however, have not made\u00a0significant progress and whose interlocutor, as far as Venezuela is concerned, has change several\u00a0times without further explanation.\n547. \u00a0\u00a0In spite of the suspension of the expropriation process - which, according to Respondent- is barely\u00a0at the outset - Respondent has understood and made known to the Companies, that Decree No.\u00a07.394 imposes conservation obligations and certain restrictions on the goods covered by Decree,669\u00a0namely, those used for the operation of Monaca or for the large-scale production, agro-industrial\u00a0processing and storage of certain goods. For example, Respondent has pointed out that Claimants\u00a0may not perform acts that entail that the Companies\u2019 property is destroyed or become \"unable to\u00a0comply with the purpose for which it is being appropriated\u201d.610 According to Venezuela\u2019s own\u00a0expert, these acts would include (i) changing its corporate purpose; (ii) changing or eliminating a\u00a0line of business; (iii) ceasing to make investments to keep its factories and equipment operating;\u00a0and (iv) removing its machinery and equipment from Venezuela.671 According to the same expert,\u00a0Claimants may transfer the property, but the \u201cdecree of affectation\u201d shall pursue it wherever it is.672\u00a0These restrictions would be maintained until there is a definitive agreement regarding the\u00a0acquisition of all or part of the Companies or until Venezuela directly expropriates the assets\u00a0subject to Decree.673\n548. \u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, it has been demonstrated that SIEX did not process the applications for\u00a0registration or updating of foreign investment filed by Monaca and Valores between 2000 and\u00a02013,674 a situation that prevents Claimants from complying with one of the requirements\u00a0demanded by the laws of that State to transfer money abroad. In addition. Venezuela has ordered\u00a0the redirection of raw material owned by the Companies to other companies in the sector.\n549. \u00a0\u00a0Having established the scope of the measures imposed on Monaca and Demaseca, the Tribunal\u00a0shall now determine whether, as Claimants have argued, these measures or their implementation\u00a0are contrary to the State\u2019s duty to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments protected\u00a0under the Treaty.\n669 See for example, Official Notice AEM No. 2012-00002 of special administrators to Henry Castro.

It is then for the Tribunal to determine whether in their genesis or in their\u00a0execution, or both, the aforementioned measures meet the standard of arbitrariness and\u00a0disproportion alleged by Claimants.\n551. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants complain that, when the seizure and special administration measures were decreed, the\u00a0judge who heard the third party proceedings (incidente de tercer\u00edas) brought by them to revoke\u00a0them, ignored evidence that would demonstrate that Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco had no interest in\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca, and furthermore, confirmed the measures over all of the Companies\u00a0despite the fact that the interest of the accused party therein was minority and indirect. They also\u00a0allege that Venezuela\u2019s action in relation to the third party proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas) was\u00a0contrary to the guarantee of due process and constitutes a denial of procedural justice.\n552. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to the first item, the Tribunal notes that, in its decision of November 19,2011 - which\u00a0upheld the judgment of December 4, 2009 that underlies the seizure and special administration\u00a0measures imposed on Monaca and Demaseca - the criminal judge concluded that by the date on\u00a0which the precautionary measures were issued, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco had shareholdings in\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca, and that the only way to safeguard the value of his interest in these\u00a0companies was to extend the precautionary measures to all of the Companies.675\n553. \u00a0\u00a0The first thing to note is-that it is not for this Tribunal to serve as appellate judge of the Venezuelan\u00a0judge\u2019s decision, nor to reassess the evidence submitted in the third party proceeding (incidente de\u00a0tercer\u00edas) brought by Claimants to determine whether, under applicable law, a different\u00a0construction of the law or a different assessment of the evidence would apply. It is a peaceful issue\u00a0investment tribunals that these are not appellate tribunals and, in that sense, the commission of an\u00a0error of fact or law by a domestic tribunal is not, per se, a breach of the standard of fair and\u00a0equitable treatment.676 What happens in this case is Claimants\u2019 disagreement with the\u00a0Respondent\u2019s judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence and construction of the law under Venezuelan\u00a0law, a disagreement that is not for this Tribunal to resolve.\n554. \u00a0\u00a0A different matter is the performance of the Venezuelan judicial system from the point of view of\u00a0the process itself. Issued the seizure by the criminal judge, which was initially referred to the shares\u00a0of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Berrueco in the Companies, the prosecutor\u2019s office requested on December 3,\u00a02009 the extension of the precautionary measures to the Companies and the appointment of\u00a0managers.677 The judge resolved the request one day later, on December 4, 2009, granting the\u00a0petition.\n555. \u00a0\u00a0The third party proceeding (incidente de tercer\u00edas) was initiated by Claimants on February 1,2010\u00a0and resolved in the first instance, unfavorably to Claimants, on November 19, 2010, that is, ten\u00a0months after the filing date of the application. Claimants filed an appeal against that decision on\u00a0December 6, 2010.\n556. \u00a0\u00a0At this point, the Tribunal should note, and the Parties\u2019 experts accepted that what followed for the\u00a0admission of the appeal was a simple procedure that does not require further legal or evidentiary\u00a0analysis.678 It was simply a matter of issuing an order as to whether or not the appeal was admissible\u00a0or not. The decision did not entail resolving the merits of the appeal or reviewing the alleged errors\u00a0of the trial judge, but simply determine whether the appeal met the formalities and requirements\n675 Decision of the Eleventh Trial Court in Functions of Control, November 19,2010, pages 124-128 (Exhibit C-70).\n676 Oostergetel v.

Venezuelan law provides for a short term - between three and five days679 - for the judge to decide on the admissibility of the appeal. However, more than six years have lapsed since\u00a0the filing of the appeal and there is no evidence that the appeal has been admitted.\n557. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent has sought to justify the delay in the complexity of the matter and the congestion of\u00a0the Venezuelan judicial system680 and the fact that a conflict of jurisdiction arose that had to be\u00a0resolved previously.681 The tribunal cannot accept these justifications. First, as noted above, it was\u00a0not a question of resolving the appeal, but simply of deciding whether the appeal was admissible.\u00a0The Venezuelan legal experts of both parties distort the complexity alleged by Venezuela. The\u00a0allegation of congestion in the Venezuelan judicial system is also unsatisfactory. It is sufficient to\u00a0note that, within the same procedure, resolutions of other more complex issues such as the\u00a0extension of the measures to the Companies or the first instance decision of the third party\u00a0proceeding {incidente de tercer\u00edas) took substantially less time (one day and about ten months,\u00a0respectively).\n558. \u00a0\u00a0As for the conflict of jurisdiction, the term provided for in Venezuelan law to resolve it is not only\u00a0short (24 hours) but must be decided \u201czw preference to any other matter\u201d.6\\*1 The decision on the\u00a0conflict of jurisdiction took almost four years. Indeed, the conflict was raised by the trial judge on\u00a0January 17, 2011 and was declared non-existent on October 8, 2014.683 As of the date of this\u00a0Award, that is, more than six years after the filing of the appeal on December 6, 2010, and more\u00a0than two years from the decision of the alleged conflict of jurisdiction, it is not proven there-is a\u00a0decision on its admission, let alone that it has been resolved.\n559. \u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, seizure on Monaca and Demaseca, based on the alleged interest of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez\u00a0Barrueco in the capital of the Companies, continued to be executed by Venezuelan officials,\u00a0through confusing contractions and applications that indistinctly involved precautionary measures,\u00a0the provisions of the Decree and those arising out of food policies, as discussed below.\n560. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal notes that the restriction on leaving the country was lifted by the judge without\u00a0the prosecutor\u2019s office objecting such decision. A few days later, the criminal case against Mr.\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco was dismissed by the judge, to which the prosecutor\u2019s office filed an appeal.684\u00a0As a consequence, the precautionary measures affecting the Companies remain in force and, in\u00a0principle, would not be lifted until the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s appeal against the act declaring the\u00a0dismissal of the case is resolved.685\n561. \u00a0\u00a0Based on the allegations of the Parties on this item, and in particular taking into account the\u00a0testimony of Dr. Vel\u00e1zquez at the Hearing,686 the Tribunal finds that there is at least a serious doubt\u00a0that the criminal process - and accordingly - the determination on the validity of the precautionary\u00a0measures - could continue in case of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco is definitively absent from the\u00a0country.\n562. \u00a0\u00a0In short, as mentioned above and as shall be discussed below, the actions of officers of the\u00a0executive and judiciary power of the Respondent have caused the seizure measures- which\u00a0according to Venezuela have a transitory nature and constitute the legitimate basis of the situation\n679 See Dr. Canova\u2019s Second Report, footnote 137.\n680 See Rejoinder, 493, quoting Dr. Vel\u00e1zquez Bolivar\u2019s Expert Report, 88-92.\n681 See Counter memorial, U 211.\n682 Dr. Canova\u2019s First Report, 110.\n683 Supreme Court of Justice, Decision of the Criminal Court of Appeal, October 8,2014 (Exhibit R-159).\n684 Decision of the Twenty-eighth Trial Judge in Functions of Control, Judicial Circumscription of the Metropolitan Area of\u00a0Caracas, July 30,2014 (Exhibit R-151).

This\u00a0is a legal provision that initiates the expropriation process under Venezuelan law. With respect to\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 the Tribunal shall proceed to determine whether, in the conduct of Venezuela\u00a0subsequent to the issuance of the Decree, acts of Venezuela that qualify as breaches to the standard\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment provided for in the BIT arose, as Claimants allege.\n566. \u00a0\u00a0As a starting point, the Tribunal notes that Decree No. 7.394 only refers to Monaca. The Parties\u00a0dispute whether or not Demaseca is included in the scope of the Decree. Evidence shows that\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca are different legal entities but that they functioned as the same economic\u00a0unit687 and that certain Venezuelan actions arisen from the Decree were extended to Demaseca.688\n567. \u00a0\u00a0It is not in dispute that on August 17, 2010, the Vice President of the Republic instructed the\u00a0Attorney General\u2019s Office to suspend the procedure of expropriation of Monaca to begin\u00a0negotiations for the amicable acquisition of assets affected by Decree No. 7.394.689 Nor is it\u00a0disputed that the negotiations conducted between the Parties since the issuance of the Decree also\u00a0included Demaseca.690\n687 Gruma\u2019s documents point out that Monaca absorbed Demaseca\u2019s production in 2007 (See GRUMA, Situation of Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca (2014) (Exhibit R-120)). Indeed, the evidence in the file indicates that in August 2006 Monaca and Demaseca entered\u00a0into a \u201cTemporary Association Agreement\u2019\\* as part of a \u201cprogressive operational integration process \u201d prior to the projected\u00a0merger between both Companies (See MONACA-DEMASECA Temporary Association Agreement, August 1, 2006 (Exhibit C-26)). Johabner Parra, Respondent\u2019s witness, pointed out that \u201c[...] administratively and operationally, DEMASECA functions as\u00a0one more MONACA plant\u201d. \u201cTestimony of Johabner Parra of March 4,2015,111. See also. Day 2, Tr. 390:4-20).\n688 Venezuelan officers understood that Decree No. 7.394 extends to Demaseca\u2019s property (See Directive No. 050-11 from Minister\u00a0C. Osorio Zambrano (Ministry of Food) to President H. Ch\u00e1vez Frias (Presidency of the Republic), December 20, 2011 (Exhibit\u00a0R-051)). Venezuela named \u201cmirrors\\*\u2019 of the Liaison Commission of both Monaca and Demaseca (See Exhibit C-191). At the\u00a0Hearing, one of Respondent\u2019s witnesses confirmed that the members of the Liaison Commission were present at Demaseca\u2019s\u00a0premises (Hearing, Day 2, Tr. 390:4-7). All of the above is consistent with Gruma\u2019s assertions in its Annual Reports regarding the\u00a0scope of the Demaseca Decree.

Claimants complain that Venezuela has delayed and\u00a0hindered negotiations within the amicable settlement process, to the detriment of investors.\n569. \u00a0\u00a0In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the discussion of how the proceedings were suspended is not decisive in\u00a0this context. Regardless of who made this decision and whether or not the suspension of the\u00a0expropriation is valid under Venezuelan law, it was demonstrated in this arbitration that\u00a0Venezuelan officials have construed and construe that the expropriation process is suspended, but\u00a0that Decree No. 7.394 continues to apply and that it imposes certain limitations on the disposal of\u00a0the Companies\u2019 assets by Claimants, but allows the use of other assets not subject to food policy,\u00a0and that such limitations shall not cease until there is a final agreement regarding the acquisition\u00a0of all or part of the Companies, or until the effects of the Decree cease as a result of a court decision,\u00a0or until Venezuela resumes the expropriation process and directly expropriates the assets subject\u00a0to the Decree.691\n570. \u00a0\u00a0In this context, the Tribunal considers it essential to examine the manner in which the expropriation\u00a0process has proceeded, the negotiations leading to the transfer of the Companies to Respondent\u00a0and the application of Decree No. 7.394 in the meantime.\n571. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to negotiations, the Tribunal notes that the Appraisal Commission appointed by\u00a0mutual agreement of the Parties delivered the appraisal of the assets and property rights of both\u00a0Companies on September 23, 2010.692 On that date, the Parties agreed on a \u201cnegotiation price\u201d to\u00a0finalize a definitive agreement for the purchase of all the shares of Monaca and Demaseca.693\u00a0Subsequently, a review of the financial statements of the Companies as of October 31, 2010 was\u00a0requested by a firm of public accountants;694 however, none of the Parties submitted the result of\u00a0such review to this arbitration.\n572. \u00a0\u00a0Following that first appraisal, the Claimants submitted three proposals for the acquisition of all or\u00a0part of their shareholding in the Companies.695 However, there is no evidence on the record to\u00a0indicate that Venezuela responded to the first two proposals. Indeed, Mr. Hairo Arellano,\u00a0Respondent\u2019s witness, confirmed at the Hearing that Venezuela had not responded to these offers\u00a0nor made a counteroffer.696 The third proposal, which took the form of a \u201cCommitment Deed\u201d,\u00a0became ineffective due to the expiration of the provided term, without any significant progress in\u00a0the negotiations.\n573. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal also notes that the negotiations have come to a halt on a number of occasions without\u00a0substantial progress in defining the situation. Indeed, the evidence indicates that the negotiations\n691 See footnote 673 of this Award.\n692 Certificate of Completion of Appraisal and Determination of Base Negotiation Price, September 23,2010 (Exhibit C-158).\n693 Certificate of Completion of Appraisal and Determination of Base Negotiation Price, September 23, 2010 (Exhibit C-158),\u00a0Fourth Agreement (\u201cConsidering the previous agreements, for the corresponding purposes, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\u00a0and the companies VALORES MUNDIALES, S.L. and CONSORCIO ANDINO, S.L. determine that the negotiation price for both\u00a0of them to amicably reach a definitive and binding agreement for the purchase and sale of all shares of MONACA and\u00a0DEMASECA, is the amount of BsF 2,763,184,729.00 [...] When the parties determine the proportion of the shareholding of each\u00a0of them and/or the proportion of the shares subject matter of the purchase, the price of the transaction shall be fixed on a\u00a0proportional basis using the value that xvould correspond to the trading price agreed upon by one hundred percent (100%) of the\u00a0shares \u201d).

The Tribunal does not share that view.\n576. \u00a0\u00a0It is not in dispute that the Treaty does not impose an obligation to investors to exhaust domestic\u00a0remedies before resorting to an international tribunal to settle their disputes with the State. In\u00a0addition, taking into account the particular circumstances of this case, Respondent cannot claim\u00a0that interferences are made or consequences arise contrary to the position held by Claimants in this\u00a0arbitration for not having initiated judicial or administrative actions in Venezuela in relation to the\u00a0suspension of the expropriation process.\n577. \u00a0\u00a0Decree No. 7.394 provides that the Attorney General\u2019s Office is the entity in charge of processing\u00a0the expropriation procedure provided for in the Expropriation Law (Ley de Expropiaci\u00f3n) until the\u00a0affected property is transferred to the State.701 In addition, this law establishes that the\u00a0responsibility for initiating the judicial expropriation process corresponds to the Administration.702\u00a0In this sense, Respondent\u2019s own Venezuelan legal expert confirmed at the Hearing that it is the\u00a0State703 that determines when the negotiation process \u201chas reached an impasse\u201d.

As\u00a0explained, Claimants attempted to put an end to the situation that afflicts them by multiple requests\u00a0of resumption of the negotiations that were not addressed by Respondent. Indeed, the\u00a0\u201cCommitment Deed\u201d provided as part of the negotiations between the Parties, Claimants formally\u00a0requested Venezuela to revoke Decree No. 7.394 and lift the seizure and special administration\u00a0measures on the Companies.705 However, Respondent refused to grant such requests.706\n581. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal notes that Decree No. 7.394 qualifies as \u201curgent\u201d the execution of the\u00a0\"Agroindustrial Processing Capacity Consolidation for the Venezuela of the XXI Century\u201d\u00a0program, through the use of goods affected by Decree that, in addition, would be \u201cessential\u201d for\u00a0its execution.707 The delay in the acquisition of goods by Venezuela - whether through purchase\u00a0and sale or through direct expropriation and indemnification - is not compatible with the urgency\u00a0invoked in the Decree and denotes a lack of coherence between the reasons expressed in said rule\u00a0and the consequent action of the State.\n582. \u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, Venezuela initiated a process of expropriation, considered that it imposed\u00a0limitations on the operation of the Companies by Claimants, and subsequently suspended the\u00a0process and has maintained it suspended for several years, while State officials execute acts and\u00a0apply measures based on the construction that the Decree imposes certain restrictions or prior\u00a0authorization requirements for the operation of the Companies. Claimants are, thus, in a situation\u00a0of uncertainty with respect to scenarios ranging from the eventual revocation of the Decree to the\u00a0culmination of the expropriation process, and they maintain that ind\u00e9termination with support in\u00a0negotiations that they refuse to pursue.\n583. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal finds that Venezuela by this conduct breached its obligation to ensure fair and\u00a0equitable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investments by keeping the expropriation process suspended for\u00a0nearly ten years, without making decisive progress in the negotiations and, at the same time,\u00a0understanding that it applies those effects of Decree No. 7.394 that impose limitations on the\u00a0Companies, including restrictions on disposing of certain assets (the assets that according to\u00a0Venezuela are covered by the Decree) or performing certain acts (which Venezuela claims are\u00a0limited by the application of the Decree).708 To this is added the indefinite situation of Demaseca,\u00a0with respect to whom Venezuela maintains that it is a different legal entity, but to whom in fact\u00a0measures arisen from the Decree have been applied.\n705 Commitment Letter (Exhibit C-163).\n706 Official Notice No. 1571 of the Attorney General C.

However, two of its members - who served\u00a0as Venezuela\u2019s \u201cmirrors\u201d on the Liaison Commission - were appointed as special administrators\u00a0of the Companies and until the date of the Hearing, continued to perform that work.\n585. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal finds that during the stay of the Liaison Commission at the headquarters of the\u00a0Companies there was convergence and confusion between the functions corresponding to the\u00a0members of such Commission and those exercised by the special administrators,710 although\u00a0according to Venezuela itself, their mandates were completely different.\n586. \u00a0\u00a0Such confusion persisted after the withdrawal of the Liaison Commission. Indeed, if the same\u00a0people are initially appointed as members of the Liaison Commission (originating in the Decree),\u00a0act in parallel with the special administrators (originating in the criminal process) generating\u00a0confusion about the origin and scope of the powers of each one and interfering in the operation of\u00a0the Companies and then become special administrators, maintaining in the exercise of their\u00a0functions the same confusion, the Respondent cannot invoke in its defense the simple formal\u00a0separation of functions. In addition, Venezuelan officials invoked the State\u2019s food policies as\u00a0additional justification for the measures implemented by the special administrators, despite the\u00a0formal separation between those policies and the criminal proceedings against Mr. Fernandez\u00a0Barrueco. If the officials really had totally different powers, as Venezuela claims, that difference\u00a0had to take place in practice and give certainty to the Companies about the limitations to which\u00a0they might be subject. The mere formal separation, when the practice shows confusion in the\u00a0powers of the officer and their execution, is not sufficient to justify Respondent\u2019s performance.\u00a0This reflects a lack of coherence and transparency on the part of the State, which is only attributable\u00a0to the State.\n587. \u00a0\u00a0As the Tribunal noted in deciding on the expropriation, the Venezuelan measures and conduct did\u00a0not result in the total or substantial loss of control of the Companies by Claimants. However, the\u00a0Tribunal considers that there is a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment due to the\u00a0validity of the seizure and special administration measures in the context in which the criminal\u00a0process against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco and the third party proceeding {incidente de tercer\u00edas) has\u00a0advanced, added to the restrictions that according to Venezuela derive from Decree No. 7.394,\u00a0while the process of forced acquisition continues to be suspended despite the lack of progress in\u00a0the negotiations between the Parties, and the confusion generated and maintained as to the origin\u00a0and effect of the powers of the special administrators and, for a significant period of time, between\u00a0the special administrators and the Liaison Commission. These measures, in the form in which they\u00a0have been executed, created an unjustified burden on the Companies and imposed restrictions on\u00a0Claimants in the free exercise of their rights as shareholders of those Companies.\n588. \u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal considers that Venezuela has breached its obligation to\u00a0ensure fair and equitable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investments.\nC.

Claimants\u2019 Position\n589. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, Venezuela has imposed arbitrary and discriminatory measures contrary\u00a0to Article 111(1) of the BIT.\n590. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that in order for this breach to arise, it is only necessary that the hindering\u00a0measures are arbitrary or discriminatory.711 They also consider that the assessment of Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0breach of this standard and that of the fair and equitable treatment should be done independently.712\n591. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants define an arbitrary act as one that has no factual or legal basis, contrary to the rule of\u00a0law or due process.713 They quote the ELSI case before the International Court of Justice to define\u00a0arbitrary conduct as a \"deliberate failure to abide by the due process of law \u201d.714 They also consider\u00a0an act to be arbitrary if it is \"contrary to justice, reason or the law, [or is] dictated by shall or\u00a0whim \u201d or if \"is not based on reason facts or law \u201d.7,s\n592. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, Venezuela has implemented measures that breach the obligation\u00a0described in Article 111(1 ) of the BIT because they are arbitrary, lacking a legitimate factual or\u00a0legal basis or discriminatory in that they have been applied exclusively to Companies and not to\u00a0similar companies, and have hindered or prevented the management, maintenance, development,\u00a0use, enjoyment, extension, sale and liquidation of Claimants\u2019 investments.716\n593. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants contend that Venezuela has taken arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and factually and\u00a0legally unsupported measures by maintaining a \u201cspecial administration\u201d and other interference\u00a0measures in the service of the expropriatory purposes proclaimed in Decree No. 7.394. The appeal\u00a0filed by Claimants and Companies against the judge\u2019s decision in the third party proceeding\u00a0{incidente de tercer\u00edas) has not yet been admitted, although it was filed in December 2010.717 Also,\u00a0Venezuela has applied Article 22 of the Law against Organized Crime (Ley contra la Delincuencia\u00a0Organizada), which is applicable to seized or forfeited assets and presupposes the existence of a\u00a0final criminal conviction, non-existent in this case.718\n594. \u00a0\u00a0After proving that Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco did not hold shares in the Companies, the\u00a0representatives of the Republic stated that they were indifferent to who the owners of the\u00a0companies were and Venezuela adopted Decree No. 7.394.719 The imposition of Decree No. 7.394\u00a0was also arbitrary because it is not intended to satisfy an end of public utility or social interest, but\u00a0rather the singular expropriation of the Companies.720\n595. \u00a0\u00a0The execution of Decree No. 7.394 has been arbitrary for breaching due process, as Venezuelan\u00a0law demands that a final judgment be obtained in an expropriation trial and that a fair compensation\u00a0be paid to Claimants in order to occupy the Companies. The expropriation process has been\u00a0suspended since August 2010.

Venezuela, through SAREN, ordered its\u00a0notaries and commercial registries to refrain from authenticating and formalizing minutes of\u00a0shareholders\u2019 meetings of the Companies, including those where they appoint members of boards\u00a0of directors.722 Likewise, the Liaison Commission and the special administrators have prevented\u00a0the free development, management and administration of the Companies by the dismissal orders\u00a0of certain employees, interfered in planning and training workshops to incorporate the vision of\u00a0Venezuelan politics, interfered in the decision to change one of the distribution centers of Monaca\u00a0in Maracaibo and blocked the authorization of lease payments of the new distribution center,\u00a0pressuring Monaca to accept all labor claims of certain unions, interfered in a decision to close an\u00a0unprofitable pasta factory and ordered the sale and distribution of com flour at preferential prices\u00a0to \u201cSocialist Bakeries\u201d, inter alia.723\n597. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela invokes the decisions in Enron v. Argentina (Award), Sempra v. Argentina and El Paso\u00a0v. Argentina, arguing that these courts determined that the measures that the State considers\u00a0necessary to address sudden crisis or changing economic circumstances are not arbitrary. However,\u00a0Venezuela does not explain the sudden crisis or changing economic circumstance that justifies the\u00a0adoption of the drastic measures adopted in this case.724\n598. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, a measure is discriminatory if the State treats differently, investors in\u00a0\u2022 similar circumstancesand without reasonable justification.725 Venezuela would have treated the\nCompanies differently by imposing Decree No. 7.394, subjecting them to a process of expropriation that affected all of their assets. These measures have only affected Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca, whereas they have not been extended to national competitors such as Alimentos Polar,\u00a0C.A. and Cargill Venezuela, S.A. Respondent has also benefited these competitors by giving them\u00a0access to Monaca\u2019s raw material through an order to reassign more than 86,000 metric tons of\u00a0white com, owned by the Companies.726\n599. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants contend that Venezuela does not dispute that Alimentos Polar, C.A. and Cargill\u00a0Venezuela, S.A. constitute the universe of companies with which the Companies must be compared,\u00a0since they are in the same line of business.727 There is also no reasonable justification for treating\u00a0the Companies differently, and Venezuela does not argue otherwise.728\n2. Respondent\u2019s Position\n600. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela alleges that it has not breached the provisions of Article 111 of the BIT regarding\u00a0arbitrary or discriminatory measures.\n601. \u00a0\u00a0According to Venezuela, the jurisprudence of courts in investment arbitrations requires a high\u00a0standard of proof to demonstrate that a State acted arbitrarily.729 It requires that it be shown that\u00a0the action \u201cwas completely irrational, devoid of any coherent grounds \u201d or that it \u201cwas developed\u00a0with reckless disregardfor the investor's right \u201d.730 Misconduct must be largely self-evident,731 so\u00a0as to reflect the absence of legitimate purpose, whim, bad faith or a serious absence of due\n722 Memorial, H 235.\n723 Memorial, U 235; Brief, <| 348.\n724 Brief, 1J 342.\n725 Brief, H 350.\n726 Memorial, U 235.\n727 Brief, H 351.\n728 Id\n729 Rejoinder, H 500.\n710 Id.\n106\n  \nLIC.

Claimants\u00a0have therefore failed to meet the burden in accordance with the requirements of the ELSI standard\u00a0for conduct to be considered arbitrary.\n603. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela admits that \"the parties agree that a measure is discriminatory when the State provides\u00a0(i) different treatment, (ii) to investors in similar circumstance and (Hi) without reasonable\u00a0justification\".\u2122 Claimants do not explain in what the companies Alimentos Polar, C.A. and\u00a0Cargill Venezuela, S.A. would be comparable to Monaca and Demaseca. The Republic has never\u00a0admitted that such companies may be compared within the meaning of Article 111(1) of the BIT.\u00a0The mere fact that they are competitors, because they belong to the food branch, does not place\u00a0them in similar circumstances. In any case, they have been the object of governmental measures,\u00a0and even expropriation, proving that there is no individualization or persecution of the\u00a0Companies.739 Claimants do not answer the argument that Article 3 of the Food Law (Ley\u00a0Alimentaria) has been used as the basis for 24 other expropriation decrees affecting 24 other food\u00a0companies, or that Venezuela also ordered the redirection of products belonging to other\u00a0companies, such as, for example, CAPRI.740 Claimants have therefore not proven that the\u00a0companies were in similar circumstances or that Venezuela treated the Companies differently.\n604. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Venezuela argues that the analysis of the claim on the alleged breach of the standard of\u00a0fair and equitable treatment renders unnecessary a separate analysis of the claim on the alleged\u00a0arbitrary or discriminatory measures.741 Because Claimants have been unable to prove a breach of\u00a0fair and equitable treatment, a claim for arbitrary or discriminatory measures should not be\u00a0admitted. In any event, Claimants have failed to prove that their alleged investment was affected\u00a0by Venezuela through arbitrary or discriminatory measures.742\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analysis of the Tribunal\n605. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Venezuela also breached its obligation under Article III(l) of the BIT by\u00a0imposing arbitrary and discriminatory measures, which \"prevent Claimants to freely enjoy the\n732 Rejoinder, 1\u00cd 501, footnote 968.\n733 Counter memorial, 1\u00a1U 433-437.\n734 Rejoinder, 1\u00a1 502.\n735 Rejoinder, U 504.\n736 Rejoinder, H 505.\n737 Rejoinder, 1) 506.\n738 Rejoinder, 11 510; Brief, 1| 350.\n739 Rejoinder, H 514.\n740 Counter memorial, H 458; Rejoinder, H 515.\n741 Counter memorial, Iffi 449-455; Rejoinder.

In particular, Claimants contend that (i) the seizure and\u00a0special administration measures; (ii) the imposition of Decree No. 7.394; and (iii) the execution of\u00a0the Decree are arbitrary. They also claim that the imposition of the Decree - which, according to\u00a0them, covers all the assets of both Companies - is discriminatory.\n611. \u00a0\u00a0Upon analyzing the claim for unfair and inequitable treatment, the Tribunal examined the set of\u00a0facts and circumstances related to the seizure and special administration measures and Decree No.\u00a07.394 and concluded that Venezuela\u2019s performance as a whole does not conform to the standard\u00a0of conduct required by Article IV(1) of the Treaty of the Contracting States, recipients of the\u00a0investment. The Tribunal finds that some of the measures or conduct attributable to Venezuela\u00a0alleged by Claimants in the context of the claim for fair and equitable treatment are in themselves\u00a0arbitrary, namely, not supported by reason, fact or law.745 As the Tribunal has concluded, the same\u00a0conduct by the State may constitute a breach of different obligations under the BIT. The Tribunal\u00a0shall now focus on Claimants\u2019 allegations of conduct that they classify as arbitrary and\u00a0discriminatory, and in breach of the protection contained in Article III of the Treaty.\n612. \u00a0\u00a0In particular, the Tribunal finds that the conduct of S1EX - which consists of not processing\u00a0requests to update the foreign investment register of Companies and Claimants - is arbitrary, as it\n743 Brief, 347-348.\n744 Counter memorial. 460. quoting A.

Indeed, SIEX has refused to process these requests without even offering a justification or explaining the reason for its conduct.\n613. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela suggests that SIEX\u2019s conduct arises from the criminal process against Mr. Fernandez\u00a0Barrueco but fails to indicate its basis under the court order that ordered the measures. As noted in\u00a0paragraph 440 of this Award, it is not clear to the Tribunal, because it is not proven in the file,\u00a0what the basis for this conduct is, or whether it is related to Decree No. 7.394, as alleged by\u00a0Claimants, or whether it arises from the criminal proceeding against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco, as\u00a0Venezuela suggest.746 In any event, this is conduct attributable to Venezuela that has prevented\u00a0Claimants from complying with one of the requirements under the laws of that State to transfer\u00a0monies abroad. Besides, the ambiguity regarding the origin and legal framework of this conduct is\u00a0exclusively attributable to the State, which cannot avoid its international responsibility under\u00a0confusing situations that it has created itself.\n614. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal also finds that the imposition of the Liaison Commission was arbitrary. The Parties\u00a0dispute whether the Venezuelan Liaison Commission \u201coccupied\u201d the Companies without\u00a0complying with the requirements established in the Expropriation Law. Regardless of whether or\u00a0not there was an occupation under Venezuelan law, Respondent itself admits - and the Tribunal so\u00a0has ascertained - that the concept of a \u201cliaison commission\u201d, such as the one established for the\u00a0Companies after the issuance of Decree No. 7.394 and until September 2013, is not provided for\u00a0in the Decree or in the Expropriation Law. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the Liaison\u00a0Commission had been established by agreement between the Parties, inter alia, because no\u00a0instrument was provided to the arbitration to account for its creation, legal or conventional, and to\u00a0establish precisely the scope of its functions.\n615. \u00a0\u00a0The conduct already analyzed by the Tribunal of maintaining indefinitely the stay of the\u00a0expropriation process and simultaneously applying some of the effects of Decree No. 7.394 and\u00a0the absence of a decision - more than six years later - on the admissibility or not of the remedy\u00a0with which Claimants seek to contest precautory measures that are maintained indefinitely,\u00a0although they are alleged to be temporary, are also arbitrary.\n616. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal also finds that the redirection of raw materials ordered by Venezuela in 2012\u00a0was arbitrary insofar as it has no clear basis. Respondent explained in its pleadings that the power\u00a0of the State to order the redirection of products and the conditions for its exercise are provided for\u00a0in the Ley de Seguridad y Soberan\u00eda Agroalimentaria of 2008.747 Specifically, it stated that \u201cthe\u00a0redirection or reassignment of products, under certain circumstances, is a clearly regulated\u00a0process in Venezuela\"?48 The Tribunal does not share this conclusion.\n617. \u00a0\u00a0In their respective expert reports, the two experts offered by Venezuela stated that the power of the\u00a0Executive to order the redirection of raw materials was considered in the Ley de Seguridad y\u00a0Soberan\u00eda Agroalimentaria in force in 2012.749 However, each expert invoked different provisions\u00a0to support its conclusion. At the hearing, Dr. Vel\u00e2zquez accepted that he did not share Dr.\u00a0Ametrano\u2019s analysis as to the specific legal basis of the Executive\u2019s power to order the redirection\u00a0of raw materials and, finally, he admitted that such power was not expressly stated in the applicable\u00a0law.750\n618. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that the statements of Respondent\u2019s Venezuelan legal expert indicate that,\u00a0contrary to Venezuela\u2019s assertion, the reallocation of goods is not a \u201cclearly regulated\u201d process\n746 See Counter memorial, 469 and Rejoinder, footnote 1013.\n747 See Counter memorial, 271 and 339; Rejoinder, 335 and 600.\n748 Rejoinder, 600 [emphasis added].\n749 Dr. Ametrano\u2019s Report, 65-67; Dr. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019 Report, footnote 148.\n750 See Hearing, Day 4, Tr. 926:5-930:12.\n  \n109\n  \nLIC.

In conclusion, SIEX\u2019s conduct, the imposition of the Liaison Commission and the order to redirect\u00a0raw materials are, in themselves, arbitrary, as they lack of factual or legal basis. These actions by\u00a0the State have hindered the management and development of Claimants\u2019 investments in Venezuela.\nD. \u00a0\u00a0THE CLAIM FOR RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT TRANSFERS\nI. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants\u2019 Position\n620. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Venezuela breached Article VII of the BIT, and specifically, (i) paragraph\u00a01(a), by prevention the repatriation of capital and the payment of dividends to Claimants; (ii)\u00a0paragraph 1(f), by preventing payments related to the acquisition of raw materials and other\u00a0products necessary for investment; and (iii) paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, by preventing the obtaining of\u00a0the foreign currency necessary to make the transfers referred to in the preceding subparagraphs, as\u00a0well as making these transfers without delay or restriction.751\n621. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, Venezuela has prohibited the repatriation of capital and the payment of\u00a0dividends in contravention of Article VI1( 1 )(a), by prohibiting the formalization and authentication\u00a0of acts and legal affairs of Claimants, Monaca or Demaseca. Venezuela has prevented the\u00a0formalization of minutes of shareholders\u2019 meetings of the Companies before the Commercial\u00a0Registry, including those where dividends are declared, or capital repatriations are provided to\u00a0Claimants.752 Respondent would have prohibited Valores and Consorcio from transferring more\u00a0than USDS 163.5 million in dividends for the period 2009-2014.753\n622. \u00a0\u00a0Also, Venezuela would have breached its obligations under Article VII(l)(a) of the BIT by\u00a0preventing Monaca from paying Valores a USDS31.9 million share subscription premium for not\u00a0allowing Monaca\u2019s registration as a foreign investment in Valores to be updated. This request from\u00a0Monaca has been pending since December 2008 (although restrictions were imposed as of\u00a0December 2009, Venezuela has extended them to previously approved and processed payments).\n623. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, Venezuela argues that it has not breached Article VII of the BIT because\u00a0it has not expressly and directly prohibited such transfers, but has done so indirectly, through\u00a0measures that make it impossible to formalize minutes of meetings where dividends are declared\u00a0and registration as a foreign investment necessary to request foreign exchange for payment\u00a0thereof.754 This construction of Article VII of the BIT would render its content ineffective (effet\u00a0utile)', Contracting States could the, under some normative pretext implicitly restrict transfers.755\n624. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela has also prevented the acquisition of foreign currency in a discriminatory manner,\u00a0contrary to Article VI 1(2) of the BIT. Unlike other companies in the Venezuelan food sector, it has\u00a0prohibited the formalization of minutes before the Commercial Registry and the updating of its\u00a0status as a foreign investment before S1EX. Alimentos Polar, C.A. and Cargill Venezuela, S.A.\u00a0have not been effectively prevented from transferring all of their bank accounts without\u00a0government approval, from formalizing the minutes of shareholders\u2019 meetings that declare the\u00a0payment of dividends, and in the case of Cargill Venezuela, S.A., from registering with SIEX its\n751 Memorial, H 240.\n752 Memorial, \u00cd] 239.\n753 Brief, H 354.\n754 Id.\n755 Brief, U 355.\n110\n  \nLIC.

Respondent\u2019s Position\n627. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela argues that it has not breached the obligation to guarantee the free transfer of funds\u00a0under Article VII of the BIT. Venezuela contends that there is no act of Venezuelan authority by\u00a0which Claimants were prohibited from transferring or making payments abroad.763\n628. \u00a0\u00a0According to Venezuela, Claimants have not filed a claim for prima facie transfers, as they simply\u00a0repeat the facts to which they refer with respect to their claim for expropriation.764 In addition, it\u00a0argues that it is the responsibility of the investor to comply with the appropriate procedure to obtain\u00a0the necessary authorization to request a transfer.765\n629. \u00a0\u00a0There is no prohibition on the transfer of payments abroad. The measures at issue are justified by\u00a0the property preventive measures issued on November 25, 2009 under the Code of Civil Procedure\u00a0(C\u00f3digo de Procedimiento Civil), as a result of criminal proceedings of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco.\u00a0However, the measure at issue does not consist of prohibiting the execution of corporate acts; it\u00a0only prohibits the formalization of such acts, as they are not indefinite restrictions.766 In addition,\u00a0the tribunal has the power to modify or lift a measure if necessary, at the request of the interested\u00a0party.767 Therefore, there is no legal impediment for the management of the Companies to declare\n756 Brief, U 357.\n757 Brief, \u2019| 358.\n758 Memorial. 5| 239.\n759 Id.\n760 Brief, H 356.\n761 Brief, H 361.\n762 Brief, H 362.\n763 Rejoinder, H 524.\n764 Counter memorial, 467.\n765 Counter memorial, H 465.\n766 Counter memorial, \\*| 469; Rejoinder, | 527.\n767 Rejoinder, 5| 527.\nIll\n  \nL1C.

Although shareholders meeting have been held during\u00a02010 through 2012, Claimants have not filed any documents proving the intention of the\u00a0Companies to declare dividends in these years.768 They have not submitted any evidence indicating\u00a0that the corporate acts have occurred, that the registry refused to register them under the measures\u00a0and that these acts involved a transfer abroad. Nor have they shown that they asked the judge who\u00a0ordered the measures to authorize the registration of specific acts.769\n631. \u00a0\u00a0With respect to Article Vll(2). Claimants confuse the concepts, since in this case there arc no\u00a0regulatory measures, but the exercise of police power by means of a judicial authority. The\u00a0universe of companies to determine if there is a breach of Article VII of the BIT corresponds to\u00a0those that had a connection with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco in 2009.770 Therefore, it is not appropriate\u00a0to compare the Companies with Alimentos Polar. C.A. and Cargill Venezuela, S.A.\n632. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Venezuela has paralyzed for more than live years an application for foreign\u00a0exchange for the payment of more than (JSDS31 million in the form of a share subscription\u00a0premium. However, they do not explain how this allegation is linked to the Government\u2019s actions,\u00a0since it has nothing to do with Decree No. 7.394 or with the criminal proceedings against Mr.\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco.771 Venezuela has maintained a regime of exchange control for many years,\u00a0and this alleged application is only for one of many that Claimants have filed and received in recent\u00a0years. Free transfer is not \"unlimited\u201d and the measures that allegedly breach this provision are\u00a0justified by the indirect and temporary measures adopted in the criminal case against Mr.\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco.\n3. Analysis of the Tribunal\n633. \u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Article VII of the BIT:\n\" I. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party, with respect to investments made in its territory, the unrestricted transfer of payments relating thereto and, in\u00a0particular, but not exclusively, the following:\na) Investment income as defined in Article I: [...]\nf) Sums necessary for the acquisition of raw or auxiliary materials, semi-finished or finished products or for the replacement of capital goods or any other sum necessary for the maintenance\u00a0and development of the investment; [...]\n2.

Venezuela has not denied that the sums\u00a0in respect of which Claimants allege a breach of Article VII of the BIT are payments related to\u00a0Claimants\u2019 investments, as required by paragraph 1 of such article.\n636. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal reiterates that Claimants may base claims of breaches of different BIT obligations on\u00a0the same facts. In this case, the Tribunal considers that the conduct of Venezuela in connection\u00a0with a transfer of foreign currency of the share subscription premium is a breach of Article II on\u00a0restrictions on payment transfers.\n637. \u00a0\u00a0The share subscription premium corresponds to a return on an investment under Article 1(3) of the\u00a0. BIT and covered by transfer protection.\n638. \u00a0\u00a0It has been proven that S1EX has not processed the applications to update the foreign investment\u00a0registry filed by Monaca and Valores between 2010 and 2013, necessary for the acquisition of\u00a0foreign currency corresponding to the transfer of USDS31.9 million share subscription premium\u00a0declared in 2008. The Venezuelan government entity responsible for assessing and authorizing\u00a0foreign exchange purchase requests under the national exchange control regime - formerly, the\u00a0Foreign Exchange Administration Commission (Comisi\u00f3n de Administraci\u00f3n de Divisas,\u00a0\"CADIVn and since early 2014, the National Foreign Trade Center (Centro Nacional de\u00a0Comercio Exterior, \"CENCOEX\u201d) - has not liquidated the corresponding foreign exchange.\n639. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has already decided that Venezuela has acted arbitrarily with respect to the updating\u00a0of the foreign investment registry, necessary to obtain the authorization of the remittance of foreign\u00a0currency. In so doing, respondent has also breached its obligations under paragraphs 1 ( 1 ), 3 and 4\u00a0of Article VII of the BIT: (i) Venezuela has failed to comply with its obligation to guarantee\u00a0Claimants the unrestricted transfer of this payment related to their investments; (ii) it has also failed\u00a0to permit the transfer to be made without delay in the convertible currency decided by Claimants\u00a0and at the exchange rate applicable on the day of the transfers; (iii) it has failed to facilitate\u00a0procedures for effecting this transfer without delay or restrictions. Article VII(4) of the BIT further\u00a0requires that no more than three months elapse from the date on which the investor has submitted\u00a0the requires necessary to effect the transfer until such time as the transfer takes place. Respondent\u2019s\u00a0de facto conduct has prevented Claimants from transferring the USDS31.9 million share\u00a0subscription premium, after filing the application for registration and authorization of foreign\u00a0currency acquisition before CADIVI in December 2008.773\n640. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Claimants have not proved that they have ceased to deciare dividends as a result\u00a0of the conduct of Venezuela.774 Nor have they proven that SAREN\u2019s order to the Public Registries,\u00a0Commercial Registries and Notaries Public to refrain from formalizing or authenticating the\u00a0minutes of meeting effectively prevents Claimants as shareholders of Monaca and Demaseca from\n772 Treaty, Article 1(3) (Exhibit C-3).\n773 Request of Registration and Authorization of Foreign Currency Acquisition devoted to International Investments, December\u00a019,2008 (Exhibit C-104).\n774 See supra, fl 435-441.\nLIC.

To the extent that such dividends have not been declared, the Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2019 arguments with respect to the alleged\u00a0restriction on transfers of USDS163.5 million in retained earnings for the period 2009-2014.\nCOMPENSATION\nA. CLAIMANTS\u2019 POSITION\nClaimants allege that because of the unlawful measures attributable to Venezuela, Claimants do not control Monaca and Demaseca and the value of their investments in these companies has been\u00a0annihilated.775 Accordingly, Claimants would be entitled to receive redress in accordance with the\u00a0BIT and international law for internationally wrongful acts.776 According to Claimants, under\u00a0general international law, the principle of full reparation is applicable in this case, and under the\u00a0Treaty, the damage caused must be compensated by monetary compensation. Such compensation\u00a0must then place Claimants in the same economic position that they would have been in had the\u00a0unlawful measures not been taken by Venezuela. Claimants contend that Venezuela does not\u00a0dispute that the legal standard of full reparation should govern the analysis of damages applicable\u00a0in this case.\nDellepiane/Spiller explain that the set of unlawful measures imposed by Venezuela on Monaca and Demaseca, including Decree No. 7.394, the prohibition of transfers to its shareholders, the\u00a0appointment of special administrators with \"the broadest powers of administration \" has deprived\u00a0Valores and Consorcio of the economic value in those companies.777 They conclude that under\u00a0current conditions, \"companies have zero value for their shareholders \u201d778 and the damages\u00a0suffered by Claimants consist of the loss of value of the shares of Valores in Monaca ad Consorcio\u00a0in Demaseca (hereinafter, the \u201cInvestments\u201d), since Claimants cannot derive economic benefit\u00a0from them due to the Venezuelan measures.779\nAccording to Dellepiane/Spiller, Venezuela erroneously assumes that the continued operation of Monaca and Demaseca entails that Claimants\u2019 shares in the Companies retain their value. On the\u00a0contrary, Claimants contend that the fact that the companies continue to operate is irrelevant and\u00a0that what is really relevant is whether Claimants can benefit from those operation. In addition, they\u00a0clarify that according to Decree No. 7.394 \"expropriated goods and rights shall pass free from\u00a0encumbrance or limitations to the estate of[ Venezuela]\u201d, and the movable goods of the Companies\u00a0may not be subject to any kind of negotiation.780 Therefore, the operation and profitability of the\u00a0companies no longer inure in benefit of Claimants as shareholders, but of Venezuela.\nClaimants further argue that the measures imposed by Venezuela prevent them freely enjoying and disposing of their investments, breaching the fundamental principle of free ownership by the\u00a0owner, and have also prevented them from receiving the fruits of their investments, since all the\u00a0profits generated by the companies and those that continue to be generated are part of the assets\u00a0affected by Decree No. 7.394. As a result, and contrary to the assertion made by the Venezuelan\u00a0experts on the appraisal of damages (\u201cHart/V\u00e9lez\u201d). Dellepiane/Spiller did not assume that the\u00a0Investments have zero value, but reached this conclusion after a detailed analysis of the\u00a0Venezuelan measures.\n  \n775 Brief, H 365.\n  \n776 Memorial, H 241.\n777 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, \\*|67.\n778 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, \\*| 6.\n  \n779 Brief, I 366.\n780 Brief, H 377.\n  \n114\n  \n  \nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 131 of 375\n645. \u00a0\u00a0In light of the foregoing, Claimants allege that they are, at a minimum entitled to receive\u00a0compensation equal to the fair market value of Monaca and Demaseca calculated as of January 21,\u00a02013 (the Valuation Date), the day immediately prior to the publication of the Administrative\u00a0Ordinance - the measure that consummated the indirect expropriation.781 For Claimants, \"the\u00a0Administrative Ordinance was the last act of Respondent which, in conjunction with the previous\u00a0unlawful actions, resulted in the expropriation of Claimants ' Investments and which, in turn,\u00a0represented the culmination of the actions that together breached the Republic's obligations to\u00a0provide fair and equitable treatment, and not to hinder the management, use and enjoyment and\u00a0sale of Claimants ' investments \u201d.782\n646. \u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller calculated the fair value of the Investments at the Valuation Date, without taking\u00a0into account the effects of previous unlawful measures attributable to Venezuela. They concluded\u00a0that under the principle of full reparation and in order to place Claimants in a position equivalent\u00a0to that which they would have had if Venezuela had not imposed the measures, the fair market\u00a0value of the Investments as of the Valuation Date amounts to \u00d9SDS622.7 million and that the total\u00a0damages suffered by Claimants as of the same date were USD\u00ce629.7 million, excluding interest.\n647. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, the fair market value of the Investments calculated by Dellepiane/Spiller\u00a0coincides with: (i) the value recognized in 2010 as \u201cbase trading price\u201d guaranteed by Venezuela\u00a0as a result of an appraisal made by independent experts appointed by Claimants and Venezuela,\u00a0where it was determined that the fair market value of the Companies\u2019 share capital ranged from\u00a0USD$583.6 million to USD USDS659.1 million; and (ii) the value as \u201cestimated price\u201d for the\u00a0acquisition of Monaca and Demaseca in December 2011 recommended by the Ministry of Food to\u00a0the President of the Republic, which is equivalent to at least USD\u00ce574 million for the total stock\u00a0of Monaca and Demaseca.783\n648. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also request: (i) that the compensation ordered by the Tribunal is not subject to the taxes\u00a0that Dellepiane/Spiller have already taken into account upon calculating the amount of\u00a0compensation, otherwise taxes would be deducted in favor of Venezuela two times;784 (ii) that the\u00a0amount of compensation be updated, using a compound interest rate, from the Valuation Date to\u00a0the effective date of payment;785 and (iii) that all costs and expenses of this arbitration are borne\u00a0by Respondent, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of legal\u00a0representation.786\n649. \u00a0\u00a0According to Claimants, the BIT does not determine the standard of compensation applicable in\u00a0circumstances such as these, and should therefore be governed by general principles of\u00a0international law. The standard for calculating damages for internationally wrongful acts is that of\u00a0\u201cfull reparation\u201d. According to the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorz\u00f3w\u00a0Factory case, \u201creparation must, as far as possible, eliminate all consequences of the unlawful act\u00a0and reestablish the situation that, in all probability, would have existed had the act not been\u00a0committed\".787 Under international law, reparation should as far as possible, consist of restitution\u00a0in kind, but where such restitution is impossible or inapplicable - such as in this case - it should\u00a0consist of monetary compensation that places the victim of the wrongful act in the same economic\u00a0position as it would have been had the wrongful act not occurred.

Since the unlawful measure destroyed the value of the Investments, excluding the impact of the unlawful\u00a0measures, shall put Claimants in the \u201csituation that, in all likelihood, would have existed had the\u00a0unlawful acts not been committed\n650. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that this valuation standard, frequently applied in expropriation cases, is also\u00a0adequate to measure damages caused by Venezuelan measures that breach the standard of fair and\u00a0equitable treatment and other guarantees over the use and enjoyment of Treaty investments.789\u00a0Claimants contend that if the Tribunal finds that Venezuela has not breached Article V of the BIT,\u00a0the would be willing to transfer their shares in Monaca and Demaseca to Venezuela once\u00a0Venezuela pays, in convertible currency and into an account to be designated by Spain, a\u00a0compensation equivalent to the fair market value of Monaca and Demaseca.790\n651. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, according to Claimants, the standard of compensation provided for in Article V(2) of\u00a0the BIT for the case of lawful expropriations functions as a floor or minimum of the amount owed\u00a0on expropriations.791\n652. \u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller concluded that the Investments lack value due to Respondent\u2019s actions because\u00a0\u201cVenezuela has limited in their entirety the usufruct that Claimants (or, instead, a hypothetical\u00a0purchaser) could receive from the profit-making capacity of Monaca and Demaseca, and thus,\u00a0their economic value\"According to Dellepiane/Spiller, the only source of value that Monaca\u00a0and Demaseca could have for their shareholders, or a potential buyer, is exclusively the possible\u00a0compensation that Venezuela decides to grant for the assets subject to expropriation. They allege\u00a0that it is a fallacy of Venezuela that Claimants have been unable to dispose of their own investments\u00a0through their own fault.793 Claimants add that the profits generated by Monaca and Demaseca have\u00a0not been used in the normal course of business, as argued by Hart/V\u00e9lez. This use was sub-optimal,\u00a0and responded to the impossibility of distributing dividends, forcing Monaca and Demaseca to\u00a0accumulate inventories, invest in capital goods and cancel debts in order to reduce losses arisen\u00a0from inflation and devaluation of the bolivar.794\n653. \u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller used two methodologies to calculate the fair market value of the Investments at\u00a0the Valuation Date: (i) discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d), as the primary methodology; and (ii) relative\u00a0valuation, as the secondary method to corroborate the reasonableness of the results obtained from\u00a0the primary methodology. They explain that the DCF method is appropriate because Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca are two companies with a long and profitable trajectory in the Venezuelan market.\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller concluded that the damages suffered by Claimants as a result of the\u00a0expropriation and hindrance of the management of their investments amounts to USD$579.5\u00a0million, corresponding to the fair market value of the shares of Monaca and Demaseca, as of\u00a0January 21, 2012.

Applying the relative valuation method, they conclude that\u00a0the share value of Monaca and Demaseca under this methodology was between USDS540.8 and\u00a0USDS599.4 million, confirming the reasonableness of the fair market value of the Investments\u00a0obtained through the discounted cash flow analysis performed by Dellepiane/Spiller at USD\u00ce579.5\u00a0million.802\n660. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also contend that the valuations recognized by Respondent in 2010 and 2011 confirm\u00a0the reasonableness of the Dellepiane/Spiller valuation.803 After Decree No. 7.394 was published,\u00a0the Parties agreed to conduct an appraisal of Monaca and Demaseca through a commission\u00a0consisting of two experts, each appointed by a party. This Appraisal Commission fixed the value\u00a0of the companies as of July 31,2010 at the equivalent of USD\u00ce659.1 million at the exchange rate\u00a0then applicable. Then, Venezuela would have demanded to adjust the previous figure to reduce it,\u00a0which Claimants accepted. This September 2010 valuation constituted the base negotiation price\u00a0agreed by the Parties as a result of the joint valuation and reached USDS583.6 million, also at the\u00a0exchange rate applicable at that time. Finally, in December 2011, the Minister of Food had\u00a0informed President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez that no more than USD\u00ce520 million should be paid for 80% of\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca. This entails a value of at least USD\u00ce574 million for all Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca when deducting the royalty debt and financial debt as of December 31,2011 -804\n661. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Venezuela\u2019s and Hart/V\u00e9lez\u2019s criticisms to Dellepiane/Spiller\u2019s valuation\u00a0and their alternative fair market value calculations are ungrounded. Dellepiane/Spiller used\u00a0conservative projections and appropriate variables in the DCF model and corroborated the\u00a0reasonableness of their projections with an analysis of comparable companies and with the\u00a0valuations endorsed by Venezuela in 2010 and 201 1.805 They maintain that the \u201chistorical\u00a0transactions\u201d referred to by Hart/V\u00e9lez are not indicative of the fair market value of the\u00a0Investments as of the Valuation Date.806\n662. As to the interest on the compensation due, Claimants argue that since the Treaty does not contain\u00a0an express provision on the payment of interest, general principles of international law should\u00a0govern. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of full reparation, Claimants should be\u00a0compensated by paying pre-award and post-award interest for the loss of opportunity cost that the\u00a0compensation due would have generated.\nSuch interest must also be calculated in compound form.807 Thus, in order to place Claimants in the same position as they would have been if Respondent had not taken the actions discussed and\u00a0to prevent Respondent from enriching itself by unlawfully withholding compensation due to\n799 Memorial, H 286.\n800 Brief, 1418.\n801 Brief, 404.\n802 Brief, 1446.\n803 Brief, 1| 447.\n\u2122 Id\n805 Brief, H 397.

Claimants criticize Venezuela's assertion that the award of compound interest only\u00a0applies in special circumstances, because it ignores the recent and prevailing practice of investment\u00a0tribunals.812\n665. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also assert that, contrary to Venezuela's allegations, it is common practice to award\u00a0post-award interest, such as in investment arbitrations in which Venezuela has been convicted in\u00a0the past seven years. A contrary solution would encourage nonpayment of the award in a timely\u00a0manner and Venezuela's attitude indicates that it shall not recognized the lawfulness of any\u00a0possible award.8\u201d\n666. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Claimants allege that the principle of full reparation requires that Venezuela does not tax\u00a0the compensation ordered in this proceeding with taxes that have already been taken into account\u00a0by Dellepiane/Spiller in the termination of such compensation. In particular, such taxes are: (i)\u00a0income tax, (ii) science, technology and innovation tax. (iii) the tax of the Organic Law' of Drugs\u00a0(Ley Org\u00e1nica de Drogas), and (iv) sports, physical activity and physical education lax. I lad these\u00a0taxes not been applied in their calculations, the fair market value determined by Dcllepianc/Spiller\u00a0would be considerably higher.814\n667. \u00a0\u00a0Thus, any attempt by Respondent to tax the same income at a higher rate or tw ice would constitute\u00a0an additional breach of the Treaty and would be inconsistent with the Tribunal's award. According\u00a0to Claimants, this has been recognized by various tribunal upon recognizing that the value of the\u00a0expropriated asset should not be influenced by the expropriation itself.815\nB. RESPONDENT\u2019S POSITION\n668. Venezuela rejects the Claimants' right to receive the compensation they seek because they have\u00a0not proven that the value of Monaca and Dcmaseca has been annihilated as a result of losing control\u00a0of their investments, or because Venezuela has prevented them from enjoying the economic\u00a0benefits of their investments.816 Even if some of Claimants' alleged breaches other than the\n808 Memorial. \u2022\u2022 308-309: Brief.\\*' 459.\n809 See Letter from Instructions to Dcllepianc Spiller (Exhibit CLEX-001 ): Dellepiane/Spiller First Report. 5 13.\n810 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report. \\* 15.\n811 Brief. r 460.\n8,2 Brief. 461.\n811 Brief. \\*\\* 462-463.\n8U Memorial. < 301: Brief. \u201c 464-466.\n815 Memorial. \u2022\u2019 302-303.\n811\u2019 Rejoinder. 534.

These objected measures would be of a temporary and limited\u00a0nature, so that the alleged damage would never be the total loss of the Investments.817\n669. \u00a0\u00a0In its Counter Memorial, Venezuela clarifies that in accordance with the principle of integral\u00a0reparation, the State is bound to repair only for the damage caused by the unlawful conduct.\u00a0Venezuela adds that Claimants are wrong to assume that full reparation in this case consists of\u00a0restitution of the total value of the business, as if it had been divested, when Gruma retains\u00a0ownership and control of Monaca and Demaseca.818\n670. \u00a0\u00a0Now, in its Rejoinder, Venezuela argues that if the Tribunal concludes that there was a legal,\u00a0indirect or illegal expropriation, the principle of integral reparation under customary international\u00a0law does not apply in this case.819 Respondent submits that the applicable standard would be the\u00a0\u201cactual value of the investment\u201d immediately prior to the expropriation date - which according to\u00a0Claimants was January 21, 2013 - as set forth in Article V of the Treaty, as lex specialis.\\*10\u00a0According to Hart/V\u00e9lez, the real value of the companies at that date would in no case be more\u00a0than USDS266.7 million, as proven by the ADM Transaction. Claimants\u2019 assertion that the Treaty\u00a0only establishes the standard of compensation applicable to lawful expropriation is incorrect.821\n671. \u00a0\u00a0According to Venezuela, Claimants\u2019 theory of damages rests on the premise that the value of their\u00a0Investments was annihilated as a result of Venezuela\u2019s alleged expropriatory and discriminatory\u00a0measures. Dellepiane/Spiller simply assumed that the value of Monaca and Demaseca was zero at\u00a0the Valuation Date, without first determining the actual impact that Venezuela\u2019s allegedly\u00a0discriminatory and expropriatory measures had on the Companies.822 In other words, they assume\u00a0that the value of the companies is zero, falsely alleging that Venezuela stripped them of the control\u00a0and economic benefits of their Investments. Venezuela argues that this is a financial fiction because\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca continue to operate and are even performing better after Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0alleged behaviors.823 It adds that in the 2012 Gruma Annual Report, it expressly recognized that\u00a0there was no indication of impairment of the value of Gruma\u2019s net investment in Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca.824 In addition, Venezuela argues that Claimants must prove: (i) that had it not been for\u00a0the allegedly wrongful act, the harm would have occurred (factual element of causation); and (ii)\u00a0that such wrongful act was the proximate and direct cause of the harm (legal element of\u00a0causation).825\n672. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela maintains that it is not true that the value of Monaca and Demaseca is zero, because\u00a0neither the seizure nor Decree No. 7.394 prevent Valores and Consorcio from enjoying the\u00a0economic benefit of their Investments. Claimants have not proved that these measures prevent\u00a0them from declaring and distributing dividends, or that they have caused the loss of control over\u00a0their Investments. Contrary to Claimants\u2019 allegations, Venezuela has proven that the measures\u00a0currently affecting Monaca and Demaseca are temporary, and therefore reversible, linked to a\u00a0criminal proceeding whose sole purpose is the preservation and custody of property or assets linked\u00a0to Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco should his liability be established as a result of such proceeding.826\u00a0Claimants retain control and title over Monaca and Demaseca, and the expropriation proceedings\n817 Rejoinder, U 535.\n818 Counter memorial, footnote 850.\n819 Rejoinder, fl 570-586.\n820 Rejoinder, H 537.\n821 Rejoinder, U 572.\n822 Counter memorial, \\*| 476.\n823 Counter memorial, fl 477, 481-482; I lart/Velez First Report, 40.\n824 Counter memorial, 482.\n825 Counter memorial, 1] 485.\n826 Counter memorial, H 487.\nLIC.

The Venezuelan set of measures did not replace the statutory administrators or prevent them from exercising their functions in the management and conduct of the business.827\n673. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela adds that Claimants themselves do not dare to state categorically that there is a\u00a0prohibition on distributing dividends. Although it is true that the seizure prohibit, through the\u00a0SAREN, the recording of minutes, nothing prevents the shareholders of the Board of Directors of\u00a0the Companies from making decisions, including the decision to declare dividends, and put those\u00a0decisions on the record.828 Venezuela explains that the act of declaring dividends is a constitutive\u00a0act of rights and that once declared by the corresponding corporate body, shareholders acquire an\u00a0irrevocable right of credit.829 Therefore, it is not necessary to register the minute where they are\u00a0declared, in order for this right to be enforceable.830 In any event, once the dividends had been\u00a0declared. Claimants could have resorted to the judge to authorize the formalization of the\u00a0minutes.831 The profits of a company, once declared as dividends, become a debt to be paid to the\u00a0shareholders and. therefore, would not be \u201cproductive assets\" affected by Decree No. 7.394.8'2\u00a0Even if it were true that they could not distribute dividends. Claimants have not suffered damages\u00a0because historically they have not distributed dividends.833 Finally, I lart/V\u00e9lez note that no damage\u00a0has been caused by the fact that Monaca and Demaseca have w ithheld potential dividends, since\u00a0they were used in the normal course of business.834\n674. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela also argues that the redirection measures arc normal in the food industry, have been\u00a0requested on other occasions by Monaca and entail a normal contractual relationship with other\u00a0industry subjects.835 In addition, it adds that there is no evidence that the Venezuelan measures\u00a0prevented Claimants from selling their shares in Monaca and Demaseca. and that the link between\u00a0Gruma and Claimants with Mr. Fernandez Barrueco and between Monaca and ADM Latin\u00a0America (\u201cADM Latam\") could in itself have influenced the alleged impossibility of transferring\u00a0the shares of the Companies.836\n675. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand. Venezuela alleges that if Claimants succeed in show ing that they suffered\u00a0damages as a result of Venezuela's unlaw ful conduct, the circumstances of this case do not deserve\u00a0an assessment of the fair market value of the business because Gruma was not stripped of its\u00a0companies.83 At most, and only for purposes of argumentation, it could be considered as a\u00a0temporary interference in business. Venezuela explains that Dellepiane/Spiller should not have\u00a0made an assessment of the total value of the business,838 but a comparison between an DCF\u00a0valuation in the scenario of non-existence of the alleged measures (\"counterfactual scenario\")\u00a0and an DCF valuation that considers such measures (\"real scenario\").\u2122\\* In cases like this one\u00a0where Claimants have an indirect investment - through other companies of which they are\n827 Rejoinder.\\*: 588.\n828 Rejoinder. \\* 542.\n82,1 Respondent adds dial the failure to provide the minutes of the board of directors and shareholders\u2019 meeting of Monaca and Demaseca. the statutory bodies that determine and authorize an eventual distribution of dividends, and which are the only\u00a0documents that could be subject to the limitation imposed for dividend distribution purposes, entails that Claimants have not\u00a0complied with their burden of proof.

Fair\u00a0market value, based on the quantification of the total value of the business, is more appropriate for\u00a0cases of total loss or destruction of the investment. Venezuela argues that when there is temporary\u00a0interference it is neither practical nor correct to focus on the value of the entire investment, as\u00a0compensation should only cover the period of interruption. In the event that the measures are\u00a0reversed, and Claimants succeed in obtaining the compensation they claim, they would receive\u00a0double compensation: the amount claimed plus the profits of the two companies that would\u00a0continue to operate under the same conditions prior to the measures.843 Although \"Claimants argue\u00a0that the claimed damages consist of the loss of value of their investments due to the Venezuelan\u00a0measures \u201d,844 they expressly exclude from valuation the eventual effect of such measures and\u00a0assume a loss of value of their shares.845\n677. \u00a0\u00a0According to Venezuela, the ADM Transaction confirms that Monaca and Demaseca had value\u00a0even after the seizure and Decree No. 7.394846 were decreed. In December 2012, Gruma decides\u00a0to exercise its preemptive right and matched a third party offer to purchase all ADM\u2019s shares in\u00a0Valores and Consorcio for USD$8 million. The sole assets representing Valores and Consorcio are\u00a0their holdings in Monaca and Demaseca.847 From that transaction, with respect to 3% of ADM\u2019s\u00a0shares in Valores and Consorcio, the Venezuelan experts infer that the total value of Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca is USD192.6 million after deducing the USDS74.1 million of royalty debts.848 An\u00a0appropriate indication of a company\u2019s value is given by its historical transactions, such as the ADM\u00a0Transaction, just one month prior to the Valuation Date chosen by Claimants. Hart/V\u00e9lez explained\u00a0from their first report that the ADM Transaction gives a good indication of the value of the\u00a0Investments in the current scenario, which serves as the basis for a comparison with the\u00a0counterfactual scenario to the extent that the Tribunal determines that such comparison is\u00a0necessary.849\n678. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela also alleges that Dellepiane/Spiller poorly applies DCF\u2019s methodology and the method\u00a0of comparable publicly traded companies, artificially inflating Claimants\u2019 alleged damages.\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller barely apply, conveniently, the results and financial data of a single fiscal\u00a0year.850 Respondent suggests that Dellepiane/Spiller avoid presenting the historical analysis of\u00a0Monaca\u2019s and Demaseca\u2019s transactions because it would show that their results are better now than\u00a0before the measures that allegedly caused them harm.851 In addition, Dellepiane/Spiller make\u00a0speculative assumptions that reduce risk, result in an inflated valuation and set aside the effect of\n840 Rejoinder, 51 564.\n841 Rejoinder, 51 566.\n842 Rejoinder, 5i 564.\n843 Counter memorial, 51497.\n844 Counter memorial, 51 503.

If, as suggested by Dellepiane/Spiller, a WACC of\u00a010.12% is used for an investment in Monaca and Demaseca, the country risk premium would have\u00a0to be assumed as negative.853 Even assuming, not consented to by Venezuela, that Claimants\u2019\u00a0method was accepted as appropriate, the correct WACC as of January 21,2013 is really 19.16%.854\u00a0Using the corrected WACC and considering adequately the production and prices of wheat flour,\u00a0the value of Monaca and Demaseca would be reduced from USD\u00ce462.1 million to USDS222.1\u00a0million.\n680. \u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, in applying the comparable, publicly traded method, Dellepiane/Spiller\u00a0conveniently use non-comparable examples,855 and artificially inflate their value by applying a\u00a027% control premium.856 They forget to standardize the financial statements of comparable\u00a0companies and the companies under evaluation in order to put them in a comparable situation from\u00a0an accounting point of view.857\n681. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Venezuela asserts that Claimants leave without floor their arguments on the referential\u00a0effects of the 2010 and 2011 valuations when Dellepiane/Spiller indicate in their first report that\u00a0the eliminated the carrying value methodology because it did not represent the company\u2019s ability\u00a0to generate future cash flows.858 This also applies to benchmark assets valuations, as they do not\u00a0measure the capacity to generate these cash flows.\n682. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela concludes that Claimants have not complied with their obligation to calculate the\u00a0alleged damages - which is their procedural burden, therefore, their claim for damages must be\u00a0rejected in its entirety.\n683. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Venezuela argues that Claimants\u2019 request for the payment of pre- and post-award\u00a0compound interest has no basis in the Treaty, is contrary to the principles of international law and\u00a0fails to stand up to international jurisprudence on investment arbitration.859 The joint application\u00a0of the two proposed interest rates by Claimants is incorrect and excessive, since international\u00a0tribunals have applied interest rates based on short-term U.S. Treasury bonds or similar risk-free\u00a0rates, rather than speculating on what Claimants hypothetically might have generated.\u00a0Accordingly, in failing to determine an applicable interest rate in the Treaty, Hart/V\u00e9lez apply a\u00a010-year U.S. Treasury bond rate or a six-month Libor rate plus 2%, alleging that the rates requested\u00a0by Claimants are higher than the rates historically awarded.860\n684. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela also alleges that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 assertions, neither international law nor\u00a0tribunals, in general, award reparations on a compound interest basis. On the contrary, under\u00a0international law, compound interest is appropriate only when justified by special circumstances.\u00a0Claimants have not presented any special circumstances that would justify deviating from the\n852 Rejoinder, fl 599-603.\n8JJ Rejoinder.

On the contrary, tribunals have\u00a0considered that full compensation does not mean that the investor is covered by a situation of tax\u00a0deduction. Claimants limit themselves simply to an accounting argument, but there is no\u00a0determination of tax risk they allegedly face, so the claim is purely speculative and impossible to\u00a0determine.867\nC. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL\n688. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal begins by noting that it shall apply the rules of the Treaty itself and public\u00a0international law to determine the reparation owed by Venezuela for the breaches of the BIT\u00a0identified in this Award.\n689. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal recalls that it has not found that in this case the measures taken by Venezuela\u00a0constitute and expropriation.868\n690. \u00a0\u00a0Article XI(5) of the BIT states that:\n\u201cThe arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach\u00a0of obligations has caused damage to the investor of the other Contracting Party\u00a0and, if so, to fixing the amount of compensation\u201d.\n691. Unlike Article V(2) of the BIT, the Treaty does not detail a standard of compensation or a specific\u00a0methodology of compensation applicable as a result of breaches other than expropriation.\u00a0However, Article XI(5) of the Treaty clearly and expressly recognizes the Tribunal\u2019s power to \"fix\u00a0the amount of compensation\" linked to a contracting party\u2019s failure to comply with the BIT.869\n861 Counter memorial, fl| 543-547; Rejoinder, fl 642-643.\n862 Counter memorial, fl 548-549.\n863 Rejoinder, fl 644-645.\n864 Counter memorial, 1 550; Rejoinder, fl 646-648.\n865 Counter memorial, fl 550-551; Rejoinder, fl 646-648.\n866 Counter memorial, fl 552-554; See Hart/V\u00e9lez First Report, U 187.\n867 Rejoinder, 1 646-647.\n868 Supra \u00a7 V.A.3.\n869 See SD Myers v.

Venezuela, the principle of\u00a0integral reparation applies to breaches of obligations contained in investment treaties:\n\u201cReturning now to the relevant principles of international law applicable to the award of damages for breach of TJE, the Tribunal begins with an analysis of the principles of the\u00a0Chorz\u00f3w Factory. It is true that this was a State-to-state liability case and, as Respondent\u00a0has rightly pointed out it cannot automatically apply to an investor-state situation.\u00a0However, it is well accepted in international investment law that the principles adopted in\u00a0the Chorz\u00f3w Factoiy, although initially established in a state-to-state context, are the\u00a0relevant principles of international law that apply when considering compensation for\u00a0breach of a [bilateral investment treaty]. It is these well-established principles that\u00a0represent customary international law, even for breach of international obligations under\u00a0[bilateral investment treaties], which the Tribunal is bound to apply. Even a cursory\u00a0analysis of previous ICSID cases considering this issue confirms it. As Impregilo v.\u00a0Argentina states: \u2018With regard to compensation, the basic principle to be applied is that\u00a0laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice in its ruling in the Chorz\u00f3w\u00a0Factoiy case. According to that principle, reparation should remedy the consequences of\u00a0the wrongful act to the greatest extent possible and restore the circumstances to the\u00a0situation that would have probably occurred had it not been committed. In other words, in\u00a0principle, Impregilo should be placed in the same situation as it would be if Argentina had\u00a0not treated its investment unfairly and inequitably\u2019. [These] principles supplement those\u00a0contained in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, specifically Article 31, to make full\u00a0reparation for damage caused by the breach of an international obligation. This, in turn,\u00a0reflects customary international law\u201d.874\n694. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall, therefore, proceed to fix the amount of compensation to be paid by Venezuela\u00a0to the Claimants as a consequence of Treaty breaches found by the Tribunal, applying the principle\u00a0of full reparation.\ntribunal might think it appropriate to adopt the \u2018fair market value ' standard; in other cases it may not [Tribunal\u2019s translation]\n870 Memorial, U 241.\n871 To the extent that the Tribunal did not find in this case that Venezuelan measures constituted an expropriation, it shall not\u00a0determine whether Article V(29 of the BIT includes a lex specialis on compensation applicable to legal or illegal expropriations,\u00a0or whether it difTers from the principles of full reparation.\n872 Case regarding the Chorz\u00f3w Factoiy (Germany v.

With respect to the causal link specifically, there must be a \u201csufficient\u00a0causal link\u201d between the wrongful act and the loss suffered by claimant to order the corresponding\u00a0compensation.875 The Tribunal has broad discretion to determine the evidentiary value of the\u00a0evidence submitted by the Parties876 in relation to the existence of injury, the determination of\u00a0causality between the wrongful conduct and the injury suffered, and the applicable methodology\u00a0for ordering compensation.877\n696. \u00a0\u00a0However, it is widely recognized that, depending on the circumstances of the specific case,\u00a0tribunals may choose to apply certain valuation methods, as well as to adapt them after assessing\u00a0different arguments or opinions of the Parties and the facts proven by them. It could hardly be\u00a0considered that the amount of compensation corresponding to the breach of an obligation in an\u00a0investment treaty can be determined with scientific certainty or absolute accuracy,878 even if there\u00a0is certainty that the investor has suffered some harm. The process for ordering the payment of\u00a0damages may entail the use of certain reasonable approximations,879 considering further that the\u00a0Tribunal shall seek \u201cas far as possible, to eliminate all consequences of the unlawful act and to\u00a0reestablish the situation that would, in all probability, have existed, had the act not been\u00a0committed\".880 Nothing in the foregoing exempts the Tribunal from awarding damages for the\u00a0damages suffered and proven by Claimants.881 In the terms presented by the tribunal in System v.\u00a0Kyrgyzstan:\n\u201cThe Tribunal is also aware of the fact that all valuations in the absence of an actual sale are estimates and it is aware that the Tribunal has a legal duty to render\u00a0an award under a process that Respondent has freely agreed to establish, and that\u00a0Claimant has freely chosen to pursue, and on the basis of the material that the\u00a0parties have decided to submit to it. This is, necessarily, an exercise in the art of\u00a0the possible; and the Tribunal has sought to arrive at a rational and fair estimate,\u00a0in accordance with the [bilateral investment treaty], of the loss suffered by\u00a0Claimant, rather than seeking the chimera of a sum that is uniquely and\u00a0indisputably the correct determination of the value lost by Claimant. The Tribunal\u00a0is comforted by Immanuel Kant\u2019s remark that \u2018From a wood as twisted as that of\u00a0which man is made nothing entirely straight can be carved\u2019\u201d.882\n697. \u00a0\u00a0In this case, the experts of both Parties agree that the methodology to be used to calculate damages\u00a0to Claimants would be the difference in the value of the share capital of Monaca and Demaseca\u00a0under a real scenario, which includes the effect of the Treaty breaching measures and a\u00a0counterfactual scenario, which reflect the value of Claimants\u2019 investments without such\u00a0measures.883\n875 SD Myers v.

Contrary to\u00a0the statements of Hart/V\u00e9lez this is precisely the approach to calculating damages\u00a0in our First Report [...]\u201d.885\n700. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that this is an appropriate valuation method to be applied in this case,\u00a0. insofar as it would eliminate the consequences of Venezuela\u2019s breaches of the BIT and restore the\nsituation that would have existed had such breaches not been committed.\n701. \u00a0\u00a0However, Claimants\u2019 and Venezuela\u2019s experts disagree on both the value of the Investments under\u00a0the real scenario and under the counterfactual scenario. The Tribunal shall determine first the\u00a0value of the Investments in the real scenario and, second, their value in the counterfactual\u00a0scenario.\n1. Value of the Investments in the real scenario\n702. \u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller estimate that in the real scenario the value of Monaca and Demaseca to their\u00a0shareholders, or instead, to a potential buyer, is zero. According to Claimants Dellepiane/Spiller\u00a0concluded that the Investments have zero value in the real scenario based on Claimants\u2019\u00a0instructions886 and after analyzing in detail the effect of the measures imposed by Venezuela, based\u00a0on economic, financial and valuation principles. To the extent that for Claimants the value of the\u00a0Investments in the real scenario is zero, the compensation due would be the total of the\u00a0Investments in the counterfactual scenario. This is equivalent to the fair market value of the\u00a0Investments.\n703. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants further assert that this methodology is adequate to quantify damages suffered as a result\u00a0of measures that breach the standard of fair and equitable treatment and guarantees on the use and\u00a0enjoyment of investments, which \"preclude any significant return on the investment \u201d.\u201c7\u00a0Claimants refer to the case of CMS v.

Claimants (or a potential purchaser) are certain, as of May 12,\u00a02010. that at any lime such ability to receive the flow offuture dividends\u00a0shall be formally transferred to Venezuela\".'''''' Therefore, the value of\u00a0Monaca's and Demaseca's shareholding for Claimants or a potential\u00a0purchaser is determined solely by the expectation of the potential\u00a0compensation that Venezuela may decide to grant for the assets subject to\u00a0Decree No. 7.394. The value of such compensation does not represent the\u00a0fair market value of the Investments, nor does it represent their ability to\u00a0generate profits.890\n(iii) \u00a0Accordingly, the estimate of damages caused to Claimants as a result of\u00a0the measures would be the same regardless of whether the claim is in\u00a0breach of fair and equitable treatment or expropriation.\n(iv) \u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller propose a hypothetical case in which Claimants attempt\u00a0to resort to a financial institution to borrow money by pledging the shares\u00a0of Monaca or Demaseca as security. They contend that no financial\u00a0institution would accept them as collateral, since \"under the measures\u00a0imposed by Respondent no longer matters the capacity of the companies\u00a0themselves to generate funds, but rather the inability of shareholders to\u00a0access those funds \u201d.891\n705. \u00a0\u00a0For its part. Venezuela argues that Dcllepiane/Spiller should have determined the real impact that\u00a0the measures alleged to be contrary to the BIT had on the Investments. Hart/V\u00e9lez contend that\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller incurred in a \"financial fiction \" by assuming that the value of the Investments\u00a0in the real scenario is zero, based on false assumptions about the divestment of the control and\u00a0economic benefits of Claimants' Investments.892 Hart/V\u00e9lez consider that the best indication of the\u00a0value of Monaca and Demaseca in the current scenario at the Valuation Date (selected by\u00a0Claimants) is the ADM Transaction. They contend that the implied value of the Companies on the\u00a0on the basis of this transaction is USDS266.7 million, \"which results in a total value of Claimants '\u00a0investment of [USDJS192.6 million when [USD\u00a1S74.1 million is subtracted from the royalty\u00a0debt\".\u2122\n889 Dcllepiane/Spiller Second Report. \u2019 26.\n890 Rejoinder. \\* 379.\n891 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report.\\* 34.\n892 See. for example.

Applying this criterion of compensation when the investor invests\u00a0in shares in a company - as in the case of Claimants - tribunals have considered that compensation\u00a0should be measured in relation to the specific impact of the State\u2019s conduct on the financial\u00a0situation of Claimants as shareholders.\n708. \u00a0\u00a0In this case, the Tribunal has decided that the measures taken by Venezuela have not constituted\u00a0an expropriation. The facts described by Claimants in their letter of instructions to\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller also do not amount to a loss of control of the investment or a loss of its value.895\u00a0Although Claimants allege that the profits generated by Monaca and Demaseca were not used in\u00a0the ordinary course of business, the Tribunal considers it important to mention that there is no\u00a0evidence in this arbitration from the management bodies or shareholders of the Companies of a\u00a0profit management or dividend distribution policy, or where the alleged sub-optimal use of profits\u00a0has been discussed or decided upon.\n709. \u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, the Tribunal does not consider the premises on which Claimants and\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller base their conclusion that the value of Claimants\u2019 Investments has been\u00a0annihilated to be proven.\n710. \u00a0\u00a0Now, the Tribunal has found that Venezuela has breached Articles III, IV and VII of the BIT.\u00a0Among others, Respondent has hindered the transfer of dividends abroad in breach of the Treaty\u00a0through the conduct of SIEX. Venezuela has imposed a series of obstacles to the disposition of\u00a0assets covered by Decree No. 7.394 and to the management of the Companies based on an\u00a0expropriation process based on an expropriation process that has been suspended for almost ten\u00a0years, and a negotiation process that has not been advanced by Respondent\u2019s decision, while\u00a0Venezuelan officials continue to apply measures based on the Decree. Actions by Venezuelan\u00a0officials have generated confusion between those measures taken under the criminal process\u00a0involving Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco and those arisen from the Venezuelan food Decree and policies.\u00a0The foregoing, among other measures, coupled with the excessive delay (more than six years) in\u00a0the decision to admit the appeal of the third party proceeding {incidente de tercer\u00edas) and the\u00a0decision to dismiss in the criminal case against Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco have prevented Claimants\u00a0from challenging the measures imposed by Venezuela to fully resume the normal operation of\u00a0Monaca and Demaseca.\n711. \u00a0\u00a0Although the Tribunal has determined that such conduct does not amount to a total or substantial\u00a0loss of control or value of the Investments, it as unreasonably and unjustifiably hindered the\u00a0exercise of Claimants\u2019 rights as shareholders of Monaca and Demaseca and subjected the future\u00a0exercise of these rights to a situation of uncertainty. The fact that the Companies continue to\u00a0operate, and that their sales have behaved satisfactorily during the years in which Respondent\n894 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report, U 46.\n895 Letter from Instructions to Dellepiane/Spiller (Exhibit CLEX-001). For example, the Letter from Instructions to\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller includes the following facts: the officials of the Republic have \"forced the managers of MONACA and\u00a0DEMASECA to obtain authorization in writing each time such companies must pay obligations related to the ordinary course of\u00a0their business \" [emphasis added]; \"the disposition ofassets of these companies is prohibited\u201d; and \u201cit is impossible for MONACA\u00a0and DEMASECA to distribute dividends or repatriate capital\", among others. The Tribunal has not bound the above facts to be\u00a0proven. Also, the Letter from Instructions to Dellepiane/Spiller mentions the Administrative Ordinance. As stated in paragraphs\u00a0408-415 supra, the Tribunal has concluded that through the Administrative Ordinance the powers of the directors were not\u00a0extended as to give them full and unlimited management of the Companies.\nLIC.

In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the\u00a0Venezuelan unlawful acts have had an impact on the value of Claimants\u2019 Investments, that is, on\u00a0the value of the shares of Valores and Consorcio in Monaca and Demaseca. Contrary to\u00a0Respondent\u2019s allegations, the Tribunal sees no causal link between Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco\u2019s and\u00a0ADM Latam\u2019s alleged link to the Companies and the possibility or impossibility of transferring\u00a0the Companies\u2019 shares. The Tribunal is convinced that no potential purchaser would pay the same\u00a0value for Claimants\u2019 shares in Monaca and Demaseca if the BIT-breaching measures did not exist.\n712. \u00a0\u00a0Having said that, the Tribunal considers that in this case it would be inappropriate to apply the\u00a0total fair market value methodology or to take the value of the Investments as zero in the real\u00a0scenario. Claimants have not proved that their shares in Monaca and Demaseca do not have the\u00a0capacity to generate profits for them, or that the value of Claimants\u2019 shareholding in the Companies\u00a0is determined solely by the expectation of the potential compensation that Venezuela shall grant\u00a0them for the forced acquisition process under Decree No. 7.394.\n713. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal is of the opinion that this case can be distinguished from the case of Metalclad v.\u00a0Mexico. Claimants referred to that arbitration to hold that the standard to be applied to fully\u00a0compensate for the damage caused to Valores and Consorcio is monetary compensation equivalent\u00a0to the fair market value of the Investments.896 However, in Metalclad v. Mexico, NAFTA breaches\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment and illegal expropriation were found. Unlike this case, it conclude\u00a0that Metalclad had \u201ctotally lost its investment \", and that, in that case, the damages corresponding\u00a0to the breaches of granting fair and equitable treatment and compensation for adopting measures\u00a0equivalent to expropriation would be the same, since both situations entailed the impossibility of\u00a0the operation of the confinement and prevented any significant return on Metalclad\u2019s investment.\u00a0Now, in the case of CMS v. Argentina, where a breach of the standard of fair and equitable\u00a0treatment was found, the tribunal did not order as compensation to the investor the full fair market\u00a0value of the investment, but the difference between the hypothetical fair market value of the\u00a0claimants\u2019 shares without regulatory changes (namely, without the pesification measures), and the\u00a0current fair market value with the regulatory measures taken (with the pesification measures).897\n714. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the evidence in the record of this arbitration proves that the value of the Investments\u00a0during and after the series of measures that constitute breaches of Articles III(l), IV( 1 ) and VII of\u00a0the BIT was not zero.\n715. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall not present its analysis of Gruma\u2019s reports, but not before clarifying that it shall\u00a0proceed to assess the statements contained therein in their context.\n716. \u00a0\u00a0Gruma\u2019s 2012 20-F Report, submitted on April 30, 2013 to the U.S. Securities & Exchange\u00a0Commission points out that control of Monaca and Demaseca was lost on January 22, 2013 and\u00a0that, as a result of that loss of control, Gruma would cease to consolidate the financial information\u00a0of the Companies in its financial statements.898\n717. \u00a0\u00a0As the Tribunal noted in paragraphs 476 to 477 above, it is apparent from the 2012 Gruma Annual\u00a0Report (cut to December 31, 2012) that based on calculations that qualify as \u201cpreliminary\u201d there\u00a0were not yet \u201cidentified\u201d that there were \u201cindications\u201d of impairment in the value of Claimants\u2019\n896 Memorial, 5] 254.\n8,7 CMS v.

Gruma considered then that there was the possibility of an impairment in the\u00a0investment but it had not been identified and that it was not possible to estimate it at that time. In\u00a0short, the Companies had a value, an impairment was possible, but could not be estimated at that\u00a0time.\n718. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the 20-F Report submitted by Gruma to the U.S. Securities & Exchange\u00a0Commission on April 30, 2014, corresponding to the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2013\u00a0(\u201cGruma\u2019s 2013 20-F Report\u201d) provides that such company \"recognizedthe investment in Monaca\u00a0and Demaseca as a financial asset, classifying it as an available-for-sale financial asset\u2019\u2019,999\u00a0whereby Mr. Spiller recognized at the Hearing that at that time Gruma was not giving for zero the\u00a0value of the Companies. In the same report, Gruma\u2019s auditors made an \u201cimpairment test\u2019\u2019, which\u00a0consisted of comparing the carrying values against what could be the fair market value of the\u00a0Companies.900 This exercise necessarily entails that the auditors carried out certain valuation\u00a0exercises. Gruma\u2019s 2013 20-F Report establishes that \"the potential recoverable amounts using\u00a0the income or market approach were higher than the carrying value of these investments and\u00a0therefore, no impairment adjustment was deemed necessary\u2019\u2019.99' Based on the foregoing, the\u00a0Tribunal considers that the auditors did assign a certain value to the Companies, and that by the\u00a0time Gruma\u2019s 2013 20-F Report was filed and after the Administrative Ordinance, Claimants\u00a0appeared to believe that they had not lost the full value of their Investments.\n719. \u00a0\u00a0Now, in December 2015 Gruma announced that it was going to write off the carrying value of tis\u00a0investments in Venezuela.902 The reason expressed to cancel the investment was the strong\u00a0depreciation of the bolivar and the macroeconomic situation of Venezuela. This entails that, by the\u00a0Valuation Date in January 2013, the Investments were considered not to have a zero value.903\n720. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal then concludes that Claimants have not proved that the Companies ceased to have\u00a0any value to Claimants as a result of the measures adopted by Venezuela until early 2013, when\u00a0all the alleged actions had been taken. On the contrary, the evidence gathered in this arbitration\u00a0and Gruma\u2019s behavior indicate that the Investments in the Companies continued to have value,\u00a0although less. Indeed, the Tribunal considers that there is sufficient causal link between\u00a0Respondent\u2019s wrongful conduct that the harm suffered by Claimants, corresponding to a decrease\u00a0in the value of their Investments in the real scenario.\n721. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not agree with Mr. Spiller\u2019s position that the ADM Transaction is not an\u00a0adequate indication of the present value of Monaca and Demaseca.904\n899 GRUMA, S.A.B. de C.V., U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Form 20-F, Annual Report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)\u00a0of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the f seal year ended December 31,2013 (hereinafter, \u201cGruma\u2019s 2013 20-F Report\"),\u00a0page 35 (Exhibit CLEX-078).\n900 Hearing, Day 5, Tr. 1037:14:19.\n901 Gruma\u2019s 2013 20-F Report, page 35 (Exhibit CLEX-078).\n902 Gruma, \u201cGruma announces the cancellation of its investment in Venezuela\", December 16, 2015 (Exhibit R-207) (\u201cGRUMA,\u00a0S.A.B. de C.

GRUMA continued to reflect the carrying value of these\u00a0indirect net investments in its balance sheet in the 'Investment in Venezuela Available for Sale' account.

In the current case, this transaction reasonably entails that\u00a0the fair market value of the Investments as of the Valuation Date was USD$ 192.6 million, after\u00a0deducting the royalty debt with Azteca International Trademarks, A.G. (\u201cAzteca Trademarks\u201d) to\u00a0USD$74.1 million from the USD$266.7 million of the ADM Transaction.906\n723. \u00a0\u00a0It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that this transaction represents a measure of the fair market value of the\u00a0Investments after the BIT-breaching measures had been taken by Venezuela.907 The transaction\u00a0price was established unilaterally by ADM, as can be seen from Article 1.2 of the Local Equity\u00a0Interest Purchase Agreement between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and GRUMA S.A.B. de\u00a0C.V. of Valores, of December 14, 2012 (\u201cValores Purchase Agreement\u201d) and Article 1.2 of the\u00a0Local Equity Interests Purchase Agreement between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and\u00a0GRUMA, S.A.B. de C.V. of Consorcio, of December 14, 2012 (\u201cConsorcio Purchase\u00a0Agreement\u201d).908 Also, Mr. Fernando Chico Pardo\u2019s letter of intent reveals that the price established\u00a0between ADM and GRUMA had been agreed by Mr. Chico Pardo and ADM before Gruma decided\u00a0to exercise its right of first refusal. The Tribunal considers that the documents between Mr. Chico\u00a0Pardo and ADM before Gruma exercised its right of first refusal reflect the understanding of two\u00a0parties outside of this dispute regarding the value of the ADM Transaction. It is not a price fixed\u00a0or determined by Gruma or by Claimants, but the price that a shareholder other than Claimants\u00a0fixed and that a third party outside this dispute and not a shareholder of the Companies (Mr. Chico\u00a0Pardo) accepted. If ADM unilaterally fixed the price and the third party considered that this was\u00a0the market price of the shares and offered to buy them, without it having been demonstrated that\u00a0one or the other was in a position to be forced to buy or sell, that is the value which the Tribunal\u00a0must take into account as a value freely fixed in the market and which cannot be affected by the\u00a0statement subsequently made by ADM and Gruma in the contract concluded between them.909 At\u00a0the time of this representation, the price had already been determined and Gruma\u2019s only option\u00a0was to acquire the shares at the price offered by the third party (Mr. Chico Pardo) or at a higher\u00a0price.\n724. \u00a0\u00a0Venezuela is then right when it points out that in the real scenario and for the day following the\u00a0Valuation Date, the value of the Companies was not \u201czero\u201d, as Claimants allege.\n725. \u00a0\u00a0Upon determining the evidentiary value relating to the ADM Transaction and specifically the\u00a0purchase price of the transactions in the Valores Purchase Agreement and the Consorcio Purchase\u00a0Agreement, both dated December 14, 2012,910 the Tribunal considers relevant: (i) that the\u00a0Valuation Date set forth by Claimants (January 21, 2013) is only one month after the ADM\u00a0Transaction and that only five months after the ADM Transaction the Claimants commenced this\u00a0arbitration without proof of an impairment that brought the value of the Companies to \u201czero\u201d, or\u00a0to an additional loss in the value of the Investments, between the date of the ADM Transaction and\ncurrent value of MONACA and DEMASECA, claiming that this entails that in the current value, that is, under the MONACA and DEMASECA measures, are worth 266.7 million. Hart and V\u00ealez make a fundamental mistake here: the transaction was not about\u00a0MONACA and DEMASECA. The transaction was about 3 percent, as far as this case is concerned, 3 percent of Valores and\u00a0Consorcio. Now, Valores and Consorcio: what is the most important asset towards the end of2010, 2012? They are not necessarily\u00a0the shares since shares do not generate value directly but it is the possibility or the rights that Valores and Rights have to demand\u00a0a compensation from Venezuela\n905 See Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report, 42 (\u201cOur primary position is that the appropriate measure of damages is the difference\u00a0between the value ofthe companies at the valuation date (which we belief is reflected in the 2012 ADM Transaction) and the value\u00a0of the companies if alleged measures had not occurred (the counterfactual value).

Therefore, the Tribunal does not agree with Mr. Spiller\u2019s assertion during the\u00a0Hearing that the most important asset of Valores and Consorcio is not the shares in Monaca and\u00a0Demaseca, but the right to receive compensation from Venezuela.911\n726. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal then concludes that in the real scenario the value of the Investments is USD$ 192.6\u00a0million after deducting the royalty debt to Azteca Trademarks equivalent to USDS74.1 million\u00a0from USD$266.7 million corresponding to the 2012 ADM Transaction.\n2.

This impact on fair market value is estimated in\u00a0USD\u00ce43.2 million.\n732. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Dellepiane/Spiller explain that they have been instructed by Claimants\u2019 counsel to update\u00a0damages from the Valuation Date (January 21,2013) to July 28, 2014 using two interest rates (a)\u00a0the equivalent of Libor plus 4%; and (b) the capital cost of the grain milling and food processing\u00a0industry in the United States.\n733. \u00a0\u00a0In their response to Respondent\u2019s expert criticisms, Dellepiane/Spiller point out that, contrary to\u00a0what Venezuelan experts assert, there is no evidence that Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco had\u00a0shareholding in the Companies on the Valuation Date. In addition, the investigation against ADM\u00a0Latam does not mention the Companies. Accordingly, the Companies\u2019 relationships with Mr.\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco and ADM Latam do not affect the determination of the value of the\u00a0Companies.916\n734. \u00a0\u00a0In responding to Venezuelan experts\u2019 criticism of the DCF valuation model, Dellepiane/Spiller\u00a0points out three points they consider fundamental.\n735. \u00a0\u00a0First, they assert that Hart/V\u00e9lez overestimate the country\u2019s risk premium by relying on\u00a0Venezuela\u2019s Emerging Markets Bond Index (\u201cEMBI\u201d) as values above 10%, such as that proposed\u00a0by Venezuela\u2019s experts, are congruent only with yields observed on sovereign bonds in situations\u00a0closed to default. Venezuela\u2019s credit rating as of the Valuation Date (\u201cB 1 \u201d) indicates a better ability\u00a0to pay than that reflected by Venezuela\u2019s EMBI as of that date. This means that Venezuela\u2019s EMBI\u00a0at the beginning of 2013 incorporates not only macroeconomic, political and regulatory risks \u2018\u2018but\u00a0also additional risks related to Venezuela's potential voluntary default of its internationalfinancial\u00a0obligations\".9'1 That is, they include a risk of expropriation without compensation (or, in other\u00a0words, the risk of seizure). The BIT explicitly requires that the breach of the expropriated\u00a0investment exclude the effect of the measures, or threat thereof.918 Accordingly, the risk of seizure\u00a0should be eliminated in the estimate of WACC to determine the fair market value of the Companies\u00a0in a counterfactual scenario (namely, in the absence of measures in breach of the Treaty). They\u00a0conclude then that Dellepiane/Spiiler\u2019s country risk estimate \"(4%) does include the risk the\u00a0investment is expropriated, but considers that the investor shall receive fair compensation for such\u00a0expropriation (namely, excludes the risk of seizure) \u201d.919\n736. \u00a0\u00a0Second, Dellepiane/Spiller consider that the application of a size premium in the calculation of the\u00a0discount rate is incorrect. First, because the inclusion of such a premium is not widely used in the\u00a0financial literature and second, because, contrary to Hart/V\u00e9lez\u2019s assertion, the Companies\u00a0(jointly) can be considered \u201clarge companies\u201d in terms relative to the size of the Venezuelan\u00a0market.920\n737. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Claimants\u2019 experts point out that Hart/V\u00e9lez overestimate the cost of debt in dollars \u2018\u2018by\u00a0directly using an interest rate of 13% on loans in bolivars to discount flows offunds denominated\u00a0in dollars, without taking into account that expectations of devaluation of the bolivar against the\n916 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, 39-44.\n917 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, \\*i 8(a).\n918 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, fl 8 and 62-83.

Hart/V\u00e9lez have taken the Dcllepiane/Spiller model and\u00a0have introduced the following main changes:\n\"i. Production level: Adjusted to exclude the impact of seizure and special administrators measures, which contributed to an increase in production between 2010 and 2012; ii.\u00a0Operating margin on wheat: Aligned to historical margin levels, iii. Discount rate:\u00a0Compass Lexecon used a discount rate of 10.12%. while we recommend a discount rate of\u00a019.16% to adequately justify the risks faced by companies. Most of the difference in the\u00a0discount rate comes from the country risk premium, the size risk premium and the cost of\u00a0debt\u201d.927\n743. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers that the Companies have an operating and cash flow generation track record\u00a0such that the difference between the value of equity in the counterfactual scenario can be\u00a0established using the DCF methodology. This methodology is used to determine the value of an\u00a0asset at a specific date based on the net cash flows that the asset is expected to generate over time.\n744. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition.

This difference in calculation is\u00a0particularly relevant to the difference between the experts with respect to\u00a0the country risk premium; the risk premium by size that Respondent\u2019s\u00a0experts consider should be included and that Claimants\u2019 experts reject; and\u00a0the cost of the debt that, according to Claimants\u2019 experts, have been\u00a0overestimated by Respondent\u2019s experts.\n745. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Parties differ in the applicable interest rate and the application or non-app I \u00a1cation\u00a0of taxes on the sums payable for damages.\n746. \u00a0\u00a0In the applicable DCF model for determining the value of the Investments in the counterfactual\u00a0scenario, the Tribunal shall apply the items over which the Parties have no differences.

SAUL VILLEGAS SOJO\nExpert Translator\nDirectum Translations /\nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 153 of 375\nClaimants\u2019 experts (2008-2012), but rather a period prior to the measures adopted by Venezuela (2003-2009). On this subject, they state that if the Tribunal believes that the value of Monaca\u00a0should exclude both the benefits and the expenses generated by the seizure and special\u00a0administration (namely, the coimterfactual scenario), then the production period should be a\u00a0period that is not influenced by the effects of the seizure and special administration measures. This\u00a0period would be prior to 2010.928\n751. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not agree with the adjustment made by Respondent\u2019s experts for two\u00a0fundamental reasons. First, there is no evidence that the sales results of the Companies during the\u00a0period included in the economic model of Claimants\u2019 experts were the result of the management\u00a0of special administrators or of the measures adopted by Venezuela and which are the subject of the\u00a0dispute.929 Second, it is contradictory to seek, on one hand, to dismiss the results obtained during\u00a0the period 2008-2012 alleging positive interference of the special administrators and, at the same\u00a0time, to argue that during the same period the administrators of the Companies were the Claimants\u00a0and not the special administrators, and that the Venezuelan officials had no interference in\u00a0administrative decisions. In short, Respondent\u2019s experts seek to make an adjustment on the on the\u00a0basis, not proven that the special administrators and the special measures adopted by Venezuela\u00a0generated an increase in sales over the 2003-2009 period.\n752. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s experts have insisted that the value of the Companies as of the Valuation Date is\u00a0what is reflected in the ADM Transaction. They have also pointed out that, if the- real scenario is\u00a0to be compared with the coimterfactual scenario for the purpose of determining damages, the value\u00a0in the first of the above scenarios would be the ADM Transaction and in the second the value of\u00a0the Investments in the absence of the measures. This means that in order for the proposed\u00a0adjustment to be successful, it must be proven that it was the measures adopted by Venezuela or\u00a0the management of the special administrators or both that generated the increase in sales in the\u00a0period analyzed by Claimants\u2019 experts, an issue that the Tribunal does not find proven.\n753. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal considers it decisive that the portfolio of products marketed by both companies are\u00a0basic staple foods, which from 2008 to 2012 represented approximately 95.7% of the total\u00a0production of Monaca and Demaseca, and that the com flour and wheat flour markets grew at\u00a0annual rates of 2.3% and 1.6% respectively from 1992 to 2010 in Venezuela.\n754. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Tribunal finds that Dellepiane/Spiller is correct in stating that in order to estimate\u00a0future sales volumes for Monaca and Demaseca, sales volumes should be projected based on the\u00a0portfolio of products existing at the Valuation Date, and not taking into account products whose\u00a0transactions were discontinued in previous years.930 If the Tribunal relied on discontinued products,\u00a0it would not conform to the model that seeks to re-establish the situation that would have existed\u00a0in the absence of breaches of the Treaty.\n755. \u00a0\u00a0Nor does the Tribunal find reason in Hart/V\u00e9lez\u2019s criticism of the Dellepiane/Spiller model\u00a0regarding the utilization factor of the Monaca and Demaseca plants.

Gruma, as the parent company of Monaca and Demaseca, partnered with Mr.\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco in 2004 and again in 2006, although it was involved in nontransparent transactions with other parties. While Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco transferred his\u00a0shares in Valores and Consorcio in June 2008, the manner in which the transaction\u00a0occurred could raise red flags. It was not a clean sale of the shares; instead, a transfer was\u00a0made to a trust, which curiously contains his initials in the name (RFB Holdings)\u201d.931\n760. \u00a0\u00a0With respect to ADM Latam, Respondent\u2019s experts point out that Respondent sold wheat to\u00a0Monaca between 2004 and 2012 and, that, although the Companies were not mentioned in the U.S.\u00a0Department of Justice\u2019s report in the investigation to ADM Latam, the truth is that\n\u201cSophisticated buyers probably did not want to be involve with entities that have the same remote probability of being involved in illegal or questionable activities, such as\u00a0MONACA and DEMASECA. Compass Lexecon\u2019s assertion that an insurance or\u00a0contractual indemnity clause would protect against such risks is false. Full compensation\u00a0for insurance or contractual clauses cannot be guaranteed, and even if there were able to\u00a0indemnify against participation, the buyer would still be exposed to losing the investment,\u00a0making it unattractive. In addition, the investor would be buying into a company with\u00a0employees possibly involved in criminal, fraudulent or inappropriate activities\u201d.932\n761. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal notes that Respondent\u2019s experts make no estimate of the impact on the value of the\u00a0Companies of their alleged association with Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco or ADM Latam. For the\u00a0Tribunal moreover, it is not clear - because the conclusion of Respondent\u2019s experts is not clear\u00a0either - whether they claim that he Companies have no value because of their alleged association\u00a0with Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco or ADM Latam, or whether the value should be decreased by that\u00a0alleged association. If the first thing, the Respondent\u2019s experts would be against their own assertion\u00a0that the value of the ADM Transaction corresponds to the value of the Companies. If the second,\u00a0Respondent\u2019s experts do not provide any basis or element that allows to determine the impact of\u00a0these associations in the value of the Companies.\n762. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, however, the existence or not of a relationship between Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco and\n931 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report, 1| 121.\n932 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report, U 125.\n  \n138\n  \nLIC.

The Tribunal cannot then accept that, on one hand,\u00a0Claimants are prevented or hindered from having access to the possibility of proving whether there\u00a0is a connection with Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco and, on the other hand, give that connection as true\u00a0and proven for the purpose of concluding that the Companies have no value or that their value\u00a0should be substantially reduced.\n763. \u00a0\u00a0As for ADM Latam, beyond being a supplier of wheat to the Companies, the Tribunal does not\u00a0find any evidence or indication that such a link may affect the value of the Companies because an\u00a0investigation has been opened into ADM Latam in the United States.\n764. \u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that there is no discount or deduction to the value of the\u00a0Companies, for the alleged relationship with Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Barrueco or ADM Latam.\n(iii) The operating margin\n765. \u00a0\u00a0Two fundamental criticisms raise Hart/V\u00e9lez to the model proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller. On one\u00a0hand, Hart/V\u00e9lez argue that in the projection of Claimants\u2019 experts, wheat prices shall exceed\u00a0historical trends. On the other hand, Dellepiane/Spiller not only assumes that costs shall increase\u00a0but also that the prices that Monaca would charge Venezuelan customers for wheat flour would\u00a0increase even more.933\n766. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, according to Respondent\u2019s experts, Dellepiane/Spiller did not project the selling price\u00a0of wheat flour per kilogram, but rather calculated the price per ton, took its expected costs and\u00a0selling prices in bolivars and converted them into US dollars,934 and assumed that wheat costs\u00a0would increase in the future from USDS 1,344 per ton level in 2012 to USDS 1,548 per ton in 2022,\u00a0that is, an increase of 15%. However, for wheat flour prices, Claimants\u2019 experts assume that the\u00a02012 price of USDS 1,603 per ton would increase to USDS 1,902 per ton, oran increase of 19%.935\n767. \u00a0\u00a0Hart/V\u00e9lez point out that these are ungrounded assumptions by Claimants\u2019 experts to inflate the\u00a0gross margin of wheat in their valuation as they assume that Monaca would charge customers more\u00a0for wheat flour and receive a higher profit.\nDellepiane/Spiller add that prices would not increase gradually, but would increase almost immediately after the Valuation Date and continue with the pricing scheme forever, which \u201cis not\u00a0a valid assumption since it is unreasonable for MONACA to continue to take advantage of its\u00a0customers perpetually, without facing competition or migration to alternative products in the face\u00a0of such a scheme \u201d.936\n768. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s experts conclude that beyond the above problems, Dellepiane/SpiIler\u2019s pricing\u00a0assumptions are unreasonable and that it is therefore necessary to adjust Monaca\u2019s wheat flour\u00a0prices in line with the historical operating margin and raise those prices with inflation rather than\u00a0the Dellepiane/Spiller pricing scheme that they consider \u201cfictitious\u201d. The effect of the proposed\u00a0adjustment to wheat flour prices by Hart/V\u00e9lez is a reduction in the value of the Companies by\u00a0USD$ 104.5 million.937\n913 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report. 176.\n934 Hart/V\u00e9lez Second Report.

The model, proposed by Claimants\u2019 experts, contrary to what Respondent's experts claim,\u00a0takes into account historical trends and the estimation of a 15% cost growth and 19% price growth\u00a0in a scenario in which the measures are no longer in effect and the Companies can operate without\u00a0restrictions. In the context of this market, the model proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller is neither\u00a0unreasonable nor fictitious. Respondent\u2019s experts do not include, in addition, a clear and\u00a0convincing explanation of how they arrive at an adjustment of USDS 104.5 million, which differs\u00a0from the \"unreasonable\" rating of the detailed exercise presented in their two reports by Claimants'\u00a0experts.\n770. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0flic Tribunal considers the sale price calculations proposed by Claimants to be appropriate.938 As\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller prove, if 2008 were to be taken as the base year for the analysis of sales prices\u00a0of wheat Hour - as 1 lart/V\u00e9lez maintains- the Tribunal would be basing itself on an arbitrary year\u00a0to establish future sales;939 when extending the analysis period, it is noted that sales prices have\u00a0increased above Venezuelan infiation. Therefore, it would be reasonable for the selling prices of\u00a0wheat flour to evolve in line with Venezuelan inflation, and for Monaca to be able to pass on to its\u00a0selling prices a portion of the expected devaluation effect.\n771. \u00a0\u00a0Likewise, the Tribunal concludes, for the corn Hour segment in the regulated sector, that it would\u00a0not be appropriate to assume that Venezuela shall maintain a policy of price updating lagging along\u00a0the entire planning horizon.940 With regard to the sales prices of corn Hour in the unregulated sector,\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller arc right to criticize the comparison of I lart/V\u00e9lez between prices denominated\u00a0in different currencies.941\n772. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal takes as projection of the variable cost of the purchase of corn that based on\u00a0expected Venezuelan inflation, as proposed by Dellepiane/Spiller.942 Uart/V\u00e9lez simply make a\u00a0general criticism of the fact that Claimants' experts did not conduct historical analyses of the\u00a0variable costs of Monaca and Demaseca.943 and asset that \"there were other competitive factors\u00a0that produced operating losses of MONACA and DEMASECA in the corn flour business during\u00a0the period 2009-2012\u201d.944\n773. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall, accordingly, take for purposes of calculation of operating margins on wheat\u00a0flour [and corn flour] the DCF economic model submitted by Claimants' experts without the\u00a0adjustments proposed by Respondent's experts.\n(iv) The discount rate\n774. \u00a0\u00a0For the purpose of discounting the estimated future cash flows for Monaca and Demaseca as of the\u00a0Valuation Date. Dellepiane/Spiller used the WACC. WACC represents the average cost of the\u00a0Companies in raising funds from shareholders (capital) and lenders (debt) and has three main\u00a0components: (i) the cost of equity; (ii) the cost debt; and (iii) the capital structure or relative weight\u00a0between debt and equity. Hart/V\u00e9lez do not question the methodology chosen by\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller to discount cash flows but consider that Dellepiane/Spiller does not adequately\u00a0take into account the risks to which Monaca and Demaseca arc subject.945\n9.8 See Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report.

The Tribunal considers that if a size risk premium is to be applied - a matter\u00a0which is debatable as proven by the Parties\u2019 submissions - it must take into account the market in\u00a0which the Companies operate.\n111. According to Respondent\u2019s experts \"small businesses have risk characteristics that differ from those of large firms. Large companies have access to more resources to react better and adapt to\u00a0factors that could negatively affect the business, such as competition, economic crises, etc. Smaller\u00a0firms, on the other hand, have fewer resources to react and adapt to these kinds of factors \u201d.946\u00a0Even assuming that the hypothesis put forward is true, the Tribunal considers that the alleged size\u00a0risk must be measured taking into account the environment in which the Companies operate, that\u00a0is, the competition, crises and other factors in the environment in which they operate: the\u00a0Venezuelan environment.\n778. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s experts determine the size premium by comparing the size of the Companies with\u00a0the large U.S. conglomerates without proposing the adjustments that would be necessary given\u00a0that the Companies operate in Venezuela.917 flic Tribunal considers that, in this case, it would be\u00a0appropriate to compare the size of Monaca and Demaseca with the companies in the market where\u00a0they operate.9\\*8 Indeed, for the Venezuelan market. Companies would be considered \"large\" if they\u00a0were measured by their income, by the number of their employees or by the size of their share\u00a0capital compared to the market capitalization of the companies listed on the Caracas Stock\u00a0Exchange as of December 31. 2012. Therefore, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to apply\u00a0a size premium applying parameters that arc not comparable.\n779. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall therefore no apply a size premium in determining the value of the Companies\u00a0for the purpose of liquidating damages.\n(b) Country risk premium\n780. \u00a0\u00a0The Parties\u2019 experts agree on the need to apply a country risk premium. They also agree that the\u00a0country risk premium reflects the differential represented by the additional risk of operating in\u00a0Venezuela instead of the United States,9\u20199 and that the appropriate methodology for estimating\u00a0country risk is frequently to determine the differential between the yield of sovereign bonds issued\u00a0in dollars by the host country (in this case Venezuela) and bonds issued by the United States\u00a0Treasury with similar maturity (measured by the EMBI).950\n781. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller consider that, in the case of Venezuela:\n\"However, the use of the spread of their own sovereign bonds during the analysis period\n946 Hart/Vclez Second Report. \u2019 85.\n947 Hart/V\u00ealez First Report. \\* 222.\n948 Hart/V\u00e9lcz Second Report.c 91.\n949 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report. \\* 86:1 lart/Velez Second Report. \u2022 93.\nLIC.

In particular, the spread on Venezuelan bond yields averaged 1,087 basis points (namely,\u00a010.87%) over the last five years and stood at 776 basis points on January 21, 2013.\u00a0According to Professor Damodaran, a country risk premium of 10% is attributable to\u00a0countries with a rating of \u201cCaa3\u201d, which represents the lowest tier of the category of\u00a0speculative bonds in bad standing and subject to a very high credit risk (\u201cCaa\u201d). Other\u00a0arbitral tribunals have concluded that, in situations close to default, the interest rate\u00a0differential is no longer an appropriate measure of the country risk faced by a private\u00a0investor\u201d:951 \u00a1\n782. \u00a0\u00a0Next, they point out that Venezuela\u2019s credit rating at the Valuation Date was \u201cBl\u201d which would\u00a0entail a lower risk premium than that shown by its sovereign bonds at that date. They conclude that\u00a0\u201csovereign bond credit ratings are normally given exclusively by the country\u2019s economic capacity\u00a0to repay, which is determined primarily by macroeconomic factors such as the level of reserves\u00a0and the budget deficit\". They also claim that\n\u201cIn the last five years, countries with similar repayment capacity to Venezuela were able to place debt at substantially lower rates than Venezuela had to offer for its own bonds.\u00a0This is an indication that the term yields of Venezuelan sovereign bonds are affected by\u00a0considerations other than their ability to repay the debt, and, accordingly, their credit rating\u00a0and are rather related to the risk of willingness to pay, and to a general investment climate\u00a0perceived as a hostile by foreign investors. That is, conduct that is contrary to the\u00a0investment treaty and should therefore be excluded from the calculation of country risk in\u00a0order to determine compensation based on the fair market value established in the\u00a0treaty\u201d.952\n783. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Claimants\u2019 experts consider that, under these specific conditions, the EMBI does not\u00a0represent an appropriate measure on the risks that should be considered in the fair market value of\u00a0the Companies.953\n784. \u00a0\u00a0Dellepiane/Spiller then conclude that \u201cin order to avoid contaminating the calculation of country\u00a0risk by factors that are not reflected in Venezuela's credit rating, we use as a measure of country\u00a0risk the average yield (above the risk-free rate) of the bonds from countries with credit ratings\u00a0similar to Venezuela, estimated by Professor Damodaran at 400 basis points (namely 4.0%) \u201d.954\u00a0In addition, they argue that the use of Venezuela\u2019s EMBI is not appropriate for estimating the\u00a0discount rate of a private company whose operational risks are not equal to those of a state\u00a0contractor that depends purely and exclusively on the contracts with Respondent.955 Neither do the\u00a0companies depend so closely on the level of income or the economic cycle, nor do they have the\u00a0Venezuelan State as a client, with the risk of defaulting on sovereign bonds.956\n785. \u00a0\u00a0Hart/V\u00e9lez consider that Dellepiane/Spiller\u2019s reasoning is contradictory in that they assert, on the\u00a0one hand, that the sovereign bond spread is not appropriate in this circumstance because it reflects\u00a0that Venezuela is in a bad financial situation and subject to a very high credit risk and yet they\u00a0argue that Venezuela\u2019s credit rating at the Valuation Date was higher - a \u201cB\u201d rating - which would\u00a0entail a lower level of risk.957\n951 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, 176.\n952 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, 177-178 [emphasis added],\n953 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, \\*] 178; Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, 66.\n954 Dellepiane/Spiller First Report, \\*] 179.\n955 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, 69.\n956 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report. 11 70.\n957 Hart/V\u00e9lez First Report, 5220.\n142\n  \nLIC.

In fact, according to them, it is clear that this substitute risk spread does not fully reflect\u00a0the country risk inherent in Venezuela.958\n787. \u00a0\u00a0For Respondent\u2019s experts, \u201cthe appropriate country risk assessment for the Companies is the\u00a0spread of sovereign bonds using Venezuelan bonds ([EMBI])\u201d.959 Claimants\u2019 own experts agree\u00a0that by the Valuation Date the five-year average of this spread was 10.87% (or 1.087 basis points).\u00a0This data, in Respondent\u2019s experts opinion, adequately represents the additional risk that should\u00a0be added to a calculation of cost of capital based on U.S. data for Companies and adds that \u201cthis\u00a0country risk premium does not include forfeiture risk, which can also be considered as part of a\u00a0country risk adjustment, nor does it include currency risks in its cash flows \u201d.960\n788. \u00a0\u00a0In summary, although both Parties\u2019 experts agree that the spread between the yield on Venezuelan\u00a0dollar-denominated sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds with similar maturities (as measured\u00a0by EMBI) is often the appropriate measure to determine country risk, and although both agree that\u00a0for the Valuation Date the five-year average of this spread was 10.87%, the experts of Claimants\u00a0believe that in this case it would not be appropriate to apply this methodology.\n789. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal shall analyze the differences on the issue of the country risk premium in the specific\u00a0context in which they were raised by the Parties\u2019 experts in this arbitration. In this context, the\u00a0Tribunal disagrees with Respondent\u2019s expert assessment. First, while these experts insist that the\u00a0spread between U.S. sovereign bonds and Venezuelan bonds (EMBI) should be taken, they do not\u00a0specifically explain why this spread would reflect more than the risk of the respective country not\u00a0paying its debt and how that risk would impact a specific business or line of business specifically\u00a0in Venezuela. Nor does it explain why this differential \u201cdoes not include forfeiture risk, which can\u00a0also be considered as part of a country risk adjustment nor does it include currency risks in their\u00a0cash flows\",961 or how that differential and Respondent\u2019s risk of inability to pay impacts the\u00a0estimate of the discount rate or private equity companies, whose investment is not tied to state-owned resources, who could initiate a similar transaction in a different country, who do not rely\u00a0on contracts with Respondent, and who do not have Respondent as their primary customer or\u00a0purchaser.\n790. \u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal agrees with Dellepiane/Spiller that the country risk measure proposed\u00a0by Venezuela does not realistically or reasonably measure the risk of the Investments in Monaca\u00a0and Demaseca. For the Companies, as companies whose sales continued to increase despite\u00a0Venezuela\u2019s economic situation, that sell basic necessities, that do not depend on the State as their\u00a0main client, the Tribunal considers it less convenient to apply as a country risk premium the market\u00a0risk perception on Venezuela\u2019s sovereign bonds, bearing in mind that it has not been specifically\u00a0explained either: (i) why it would not be relevant or appropriate to take into account the specific\u00a0characteristics of the business of Monaca and Demaseca, or (ii) how Respondent\u2019s proposed\u00a0measure (EMBI) is appropriate to the specific situation of Monaca and Demaseca.\n791. \u00a0\u00a0The Parties have not submitted an alternative form of country risk calculation and the Tribunal\u00a0could not make an estimate on bases that the Parties have not submitted or alleged. The Tribunal\u00a0considers, for the reasons stated above, that the country risk rate for this specific case that is most\u00a0reasonable with the activity of the Companies and the sector in which they operate is that proposed\n958 id.\n959 Hart/V\u00e9iez First Report, 11 221.\n960 /</\nLie.

The appropriate ERP to use to estimate the cost of the Companies\u2019 own fund\u00a0as of January 21, 2013 is then the ERP offer rate in a long-term horizon estimated at 6.11%.\n(d) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cost of debt and its components\n794. \u00a0\u00a0Hart/V\u00e9lez advocate applying the real historical debt cost of Monaca and Demaseca before taxes,\u00a0for a total of 13%,963 while Dellepiane/Spiller calculate the cost of debt through a synthetic\u00a0approach.964\n795. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has decided not to apply the cost of the debt as proposed by Venezuela, since it\u00a0applies an interest rate denominated in bolivars. The Tribunal finds that Claimants are right that\u00a0the discount rate and discounted cash flows must be denominated in the same currency. Hart/V\u00e9lez\u00a0would be overestimating the cost of the debt in dollars precisely because of the exchange risk\u00a0between the bolivar and the dollar, and the existence of an expectation of devaluation.\n796. \u00a0\u00a0However, there is no disagreement among Parties\u2019 experts on how the synthetic cost of the debt\u00a0would be calculated (composed of: i) the risk-free rate; (ii) the industry risk premium; and (iii) the\u00a0country risk premium). Experts fundamentally agree on the industry risk rate, so the substantial\u00a0difference for the calculation of the cost debt is in the risk-free rate and the country risk premium.965\n797. \u00a0\u00a0As for the latter, the Tribunal has already indicated that it shall take a country risk premium of 4%.\n798. \u00a0\u00a0With respect to the risk-free rate, the Tribunal considers that the corresponding rate for 10-year\u00a0United States Treasury bonds should be applied.\n799. \u00a0\u00a0First, because there must be a coincidence between the horizon of the security chosen and that of\u00a0the assets being valued. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 expert\u2019s assessment\u00a0that this horizon \u201cis measured in terms of \u2018duration \u2019 which is a technical term in finance that\u00a0measures the weighted average time until cash flows are paid to the instrument holder \u201d.966 If the\u00a0calculation of the cash flows (the \u201cduration\u201d of the cash flows) of Monaca and Demaseca is eight\u00a0years, the period is similar to the duration of a ten-year U.S. Treasury bond, which at the Valuation\u00a0Date was approximately nine years. It is, therefore, the measure closest to the horizon of duration\u00a0of the assets valued.\n800. \u00a0\u00a0Second, because the duration of these instruments is similar to that of the market portfolio, they\u00a0have low sensitivity to unexpected changes in inflation and have a low liquidity premium.\n801. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, because the reasoning presented by Claimants\u2019 experts in this arbitration has been\u00a0supported by abundant and forceful references to the financial literature, including the\u00a0recommendation of recognized professors such as Damodaran and Copeland, while the criticism\n962 See Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, 1| 117.\n963 Counter memorial, U 528; Hart/V\u00e9lez First Report, U 230.\n964 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report, 95.\nLIC.

The\u00a0figure of 27,472 MT represents the difference between budgeted sales (158,114 MT) and sales\u00a0actually observed (130,642 MT) during the months of April through December 2012 (period within\u00a0which com from Monaca and Demaseca was destined to other companies in compliance with the\u00a0\u201credirecting\u201d measure).967\n808. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has ruled that the order to redirect corn flour constitutes a breach of the Treaty.968\u00a0The Tribunal shall then accept the calculation of the impact of the redirection of com submitted by\u00a0Claimants, but it shall adjust it taking into account the WACC corrected under the aforementioned\u00a0parameters.\n967 Dellepiane/Spiller Second Report.

Second, because in\u00a0order to estimate the impact of the redirection, it is necessary to include in the sales of the\u00a0Companies corresponding to the period in which the redirection took place, the tons that were not\u00a0sold as a consequence thereof. Third, because nothing in the documents and evidence provided or\u00a0in the Companies\u2019 financial information suggests, as Respondent experts suggest, that the tons of\u00a0com redirected would not have been sold or would have been sold at a different price or margin\u00a0than that presented by Claimants. Finally, because adjusting sales, eliminating the impact of\u00a0redirection, affects the basis on which the fair market value of the Companies is determined. The\u00a0foregoing also demonstrates that there is a sufficient causal link between Venezuela\u2019s conduct\u00a0contrary to the BIT and the loss suffered by Claimants.\nTaking then the marginal contribution (difference between net sales and variable production costs) of the corn flour segment (USD$72.6 million in 2012 which is equivalent to USDS399 per MT),\u00a0an increase in sales of 27,472 MT would result in an increase in the Companies\u2019 marginal\u00a0contribution of USDS 11.0 million (27,472 MT \u2666 USD\u00ce399 per MT). Excluding taxes and royalty\u00a0payments, the Companies could have generated additional cash flows to Claimants of USD\u00ce6.6\u00a0million during 2012, which adjusted to January 21,2013, with WACC of 10.2% results in USDS7.0\u00a0million.\nAs noted above, failure to redirect white com in 2012 would affect the calculation basis for calculating the Companies\u2019 fair market value as of the Valuation Date which would increase by\u00a0USDS43.2 million as of January 21, 2013. Accordingly, the total damages caused to Claimants by\u00a0the redirection of white com in 2012 is equivalent to USD\u00ce50.2 million as of the Valuation Date.\n(vi) Royalty debt\nThe Parties agree, and the Tribunal also understands this, that the value of the Companies must be decreased by the amount corresponding to the debt for royalties amounting to USD\u00ce74.1 million.\n3. Payment in favor of Claimants\nBased on the foregoing, the payment to which Claimants are entitled is the difference between the value of the Investments in the actual scenario, which corresponds to the estimated value resulting\u00a0from the ADM Transaction - USD\u00ce192.6 million - and not to a \u201czero\u201d value as claimed by\u00a0Claimants, and the value of the Investments in the counterfactual scenario, which, applying the\u00a0aforementioned variables, including interest, corresponds to the sum of USDS572.8 million. That\u00a0difference is USDS380.2 million. To the foregoing, one must add: (i) USD\u00ce7.0 million\u00a0corresponding to the increase in the marginal contribution that would have been generated by the\u00a0additional flows that Monaca and Demaseca would have generated for Claimants had it not been\u00a0for Venezuela\u2019s conduct with respect to the redirection of com; and (ii) USD\u00ce43.2 million\u00a0corresponding to the increase in the fair market value of the Investments in the absence of the\u00a0redirection of com. Accordingly, the payment to which Claimants are entitled is USD\u00ce430.4\u00a0million.\nThe Tribunal finally notes that Respondent\u2019s previous valuations or those involving Respondent in 2010 and 2011,969 prove that Claimants\u2019 valuation based on the DCF model - indicative of the\u00a0value of the Investments\u2019 in the counterfactual scenario - is reasonable.

These valuations range from USDS574 million to USD\u00ce659.1 million. For its part, the Tribunal has concluded that by applying the DCF method, the\u00a0value of the Investments in the counterfactital scenario is USD\u00ce572.8 million.\n4. Interest and taxes\n815. \u00a0\u00a0The Treaty does not contain an express clause relating to the payment of interest.970 However, as\u00a0noted above, the Tribunal considers that the compensation to be paid by Venezuela to Claimants\u00a0should be determined by applying the principle of full reparation.971 Accordingly, the interest\u00a0applied by the Tribunal must restore Claimants to the position they would be in if the breach had\u00a0not occurred. In this sense, the Tribunal shares the position taken by the tribunal in Vivendi v.\u00a0Argentina (II), according to which \"the purpose of the award of interest is to compensate for\u00a0damages resulting from the fact that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor\u00a0is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum that he was supposed to receive \u201d.972\n816. \u00a0\u00a0The Parties do not dispute that interest should be recognized on the sums due to Claimants for\u00a0damages,973 but their experts discuss the applicable rate.974 Both accept that interest can be paid on\u00a0the six-month LIBOR rate, but disagree as to whether the rate to be applied is LIBOR plus 4%\u00a0(Claimants) or LIBOR plus 2% (Respondent).975 Claimants\u2019 experts have not provided a\u00a0reasonable justification for applying the fee they are requesting; they basically claim that it was\u00a0the fee that the attorneys requested them to apply.976 Respondent\u2019s experts, for their part, submit a\u00a0study of the ICSID awards in which interest has been applied to support their position on the rate\u00a0to be applied.977\n817. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal does not find, nor to Claimants invoke, a compelling reason to liquidate interest in\u00a0the form and rate proposed by Claimants\u2019 experts. Considering the circumstances of the case and\u00a0the merits presented by the Parties\u2019 experts, the Tribunal finds it reasonable to apply a rate of\u00a0LIBOR + 2%.\n818. \u00a0\u00a0Once the rate has been fixed, it is for the Tribunal to determine the dies a quo. If it were a case of\u00a0direct expropriation, the determination of the starting point for the application of interest would\u00a0have a greater degree of certainty. However, as the tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina noted, where\u00a0there is an indirect expropriation or breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment\u00a0- as in this case - the determination is more difficult and less certain, unless there is an act that\u00a0results in a clear dispossession of the investment.978\n819. \u00a0\u00a0In this case, there is no single action that resulted in Venezuela\u2019s breach of the Treaty, but rather a\u00a0series of actions that lead the Tribunal to conclude that Venezuela breached its obligation under\u00a0Articles IV, III and VII of the BIT.\n820. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has considered the Parties\u2019 submissions, the opinions of the experts and the starting\u00a0points of the different assessments proposed and finds that although there is a debate about the\u00a0effects of the Administrative Ordinance and whether it led to the expropriation of the Companies,\u00a0a circumstance that the Tribunal has answered negatively, the aforementioned Administrative\u00a0Ordinance maintained the powers of the special administrators and is, according to the evidence\n970 Memorial, U 305; Rejoinder, ^1641.\n971 Supra, fl 688-690.\n972 I'ivendi v.

On one hand, Claimants assert that the principle of full reparation requires that interest be\u00a0calculated in a composite manner, in order to place Claimants in the same position that they would\u00a0have had if Respondent had not taken the unlawful measures at issue.979 On the other hand,\u00a0Respondent submits that, under international law, compound interest is appropriate only when\u00a0justified by special circumstances; however, Claimants have not submitted any special\u00a0circumstances justifying deviation from the general rule of international law, which provides for\u00a0the application of simple interest.980\n822. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, in this case, the principle of full reparation requires the\u00a0updating of the indemnity amount by the application of a compound interest rate. This reflects both\u00a0the prevailing practice among investment tribunals,981 and the prevailing reality in the world of\u00a0finance today.\n823. \u00a0\u00a0As regards taxes, since it is a compensation for the loss of value of Companies resulting from\u00a0breaches of Articles IV, III and VII of the BIT, the Tribunal finds no reason to liquidate taxes on\u00a0the amount of compensation. The Tribunal notes that beyond holding that a tax-free payment is\u00a0not due, Respondent\u2019s experts do not state a reason or basis for taxing this payment, nor do they\u00a0state the nature of the tax or the legal provision requiring its collection.\nVII.

Such decision shall form part of\u00a0the award.\nRule 28( 1 ) of the Arbitration Rules provides: \u201c Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment ofthe cost ofthe proceeding, the Tribunal may. unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide: (a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party\u00a0shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for\u00a0the use of the facilities of the Centre; (b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the\nSecretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties \". 991 The remaining balance shall be reimbursed by the Center to Claimants.\n\"T\u00cdE^\u00c1\u00dalVILl\u00c9g\u00c1S^\u00d3j\u00d3^\n149\nExpert Translator \u00a0\u00a0H,\nDirectum Translations \u00a0\u00a0X]\nCase l:19-cv-00046 Document 1-1 Filed 01/08/19 Page 166 of 375\n828. \u00a0\u00a0In exercising the power described in paragraph 827 above, the Tribunal considers that the\u00a0apportionment of costs should be made taking into consideration the relative success of the claims\u00a0and defenses of each Party, in conjunction with the circumstances of the case and the conduct of\u00a0the Parties in the proceeding. Other international arbitral tribunals have adopted similar approaches\u00a0in jointly assessing all or some of these elements.992\n829. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent filed four objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide the merits of this\u00a0dispute or, at least, to rule on the expropriation claim. Although the Tribunal rejected Venezuela\u2019s\u00a0four jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal notes that the question relating to the effects of the\u00a0denouncement of the ICSID Convention in this case involved a complex legal analysis. In the\u00a0Tribunal\u2019s opinion, both Parties presented valid arguments to support their respective positions,\u00a0supported by the expert testimony of two recognized jurists.\n830. \u00a0\u00a0On the merits, Claimants alleged that Venezuela breached its obligations under Articles V, IV, III\u00a0and VII of the BIT. The Tribunal found evidence of breach of there of these provisions, but not of\u00a0expropriation. Nor was it proven that the value of the Companies in the real scenario was equal to\u00a0zero, which was the assumption underlying the valuation offered by Claimants.\n831. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Tribunal considers that, in general terms, both Parties presented their case in\u00a0accordance with the principles of fairness and procedural good faith. Therefore, it does not consider\u00a0it appropriate to apportion costs to one of the Parties because of its alleged lack of diligence or\u00a0cooperation.\n832. \u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Respondent should bear all of its\u00a0own costs. Respondent shall also bear 60% of the costs of the arbitration (namely,\u00a0USD$4O9,347.I4 of a total of USD$682,245.24) and 60% of the legal fees and expenses incurred\u00a0by Claimants (namely, USD$5,516,358 of a total of USD$9,I93,93O).W In total, the Respondent\u00a0shall pay to Claimants the sum of USD$5,925,705.14 as a contribution to the payment of their\u00a0costs in the arbitration.\n833. \u00a0\u00a0With respect to Claimants\u2019 request for reimbursement of costs \u201cwith interest calculated at a\u00a0reasonable commercial rate from the date of the award until the date ofpayment thereof\u201d\u2122\\* - a\u00a0request that was included in Claimants\u2019 Cost Brief, but not in claims of the Memorial or\u00a0Replication - the Tribunal finds that this is not duly justified and is therefore inappropriate.\nVIII. DECISION\n834. \u00a0\u00a0For the reasons given in this Award, the Tribunal unanimously decides:\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent and,\u00a0accordingly, declare that it has jurisdiction to decide this dispute.\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0To declare that Respondent has breached the BIT:\n(a) By failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants\u2019\u00a0investments in breach of Article IV of the BIT;\n992 See, for example, Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, \u00a7 24; Desert Line v. Yemen, fl 303-304; EDF v. Rumania, fl 327-329.\n993 This figure corresponds to the addition of the following concepts detailed in Section II of Claimants' Cost Writ: (i) fees and\u00a0expenses of Covington & Burling LLP (USDS5.948.982); (ii) fees and expenses of Zobrist Law Group (USD$720,646); (iii)\u00a0Venezuelan lawyers' fees and expenses (USDS 152.950); (iv) experts' fees and expenses (USDS2,175,808), and (v) travel expenses\u00a0of Engineers Huerta and G\u00e1miz and attorneys Vargas and Elizondo (USDS195.544).\n994 Claimants\u2019 Cost Writ, 6.\nLIC.
