INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") under the Additional Facility Rules on the basis of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland concerning Business and Economic Relations, signed 21 March 1990 (the \"BIT\", \"U.S.-Poland BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), which entered into force on 6 August 1994 (the text of the BIT is attached to this Award as Annex A). The dispute relates to the construction and intended operation of blood plasma fractionation facilities in Poland.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis (hereinafter the \"Claimants\"), who are both U.S. nationals.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Poland (hereinafter \"Poland\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"parties.\" The parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 July 2010, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Mr David Minnotte, Mr Robert Lewis, and Plasma Fractionation Laboratory, LLP (\"PFL\") against the Republic of Poland (the \"Request\"),1 invoking the ICSID dispute settlement provision for Additional Facility arbitration contained in Article IX of the BIT. Subsequently, by letter of 4 August 2010, the parties notified the Centre that they had agreed to suspend the registration of the Request. On 2 September 2010, the Claimants informed ICSID that they did not wish to further suspend the registration process of their Request.\n\nAt the time, the Request was filed by PFL and Mr David Minnotte, with Mr Minnotte acting as attorney-infact for Mr Robert Lewis. It was later confirmed that Mr Lewis himself wished to be a Claimant in this arbitration. See Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 3-4.\n\n6.\n\nBy letters of 7 and 13 September 2010, the requesting parties supplemented their 16 July Request, informing the Centre *inter alia* that they withdrew the Request for arbitration with regard to PFL.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 September 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID approved access to the ICSID Additional Facility and registered the Request, as amended and supplemented, in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. On the same day, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the registration, and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Article 5(c) and Chapter III of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 14 January 2011, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 9 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Pursuant to that Article, the Tribunal is to consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, and presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n9.\n\nBy the same letter, the Claimants appointed Professor Maurice Mendelson QC, a British national, as arbitrator, and Professor Mendelson subsequently accepted his appointment. Following appointment by the Respondent, Professor Eduardo Silva-Romero, a dual national of Colombia and France, accepted his appointment as arbitrator on 14 February 2011. Further to an agreement reached by the parties, Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, a British national, was appointed as President of the Tribunal, and Professor Lowe accepted this appointment on 25 February 2011.\n\n10.\n\nOn the same day, *i.e*., on 25 February 2011, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms Frauke Nitschke, Legal Counsel at ICSID, was appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first session with the parties on 14 April 2011 in London. The parties confirmed at the session that the Tribunal had been properly constituted, and agreed *inter alia* that the applicable rules would be the 2006 Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules in effect from 10 April 2006, and that the procedural language would be English. It was further decided at the session that the legal seat of proceedings would be England and that English law was the governing law of this proceeding. Absent an agreement by the parties, the Tribunal further determined a schedule for the parties' written pleadings, including production of documents. With regard to confidentiality, it was further agreed that the content of the proceedings was to be kept confidential, but may be disclosed to the extent that the parties so agree. The Tribunal was further asked to rule on the issue of unilateral disclosure of information by a party of any content of the proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nOn 26 September 2011, the Claimants filed a request for provisional measures seeking an interim order from the Tribunal directing (i) that the Respondent suspend criminal proceedings instituted against Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis until after the Final Award in this proceeding has been rendered; (ii) that the Respondent take immediate steps to ensure that no arrest warrants are issued against Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis that could interfere with the conduct of this proceeding; and (iii) that the Respondent confirm in writing the ability of Mr Zygmunt Niziol, a former business partner of the Claimants, to attend the oral procedure in this case without fear of arrest or violation of the terms of his bail..\n\n13.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants' request for provisional measures. Each party filed a further written submission on this request on 4 and 18 November 2011, respectively. A hearing on provisional measures was held by videoconference on 23 January 2012. Besides the Members of the Tribunal, who jointly participated in the hearing from London, and the Secretary of the Tribunal, the hearing was attended by Claimants' counsel Messrs David Baron and Joseph Matthews (participating from ICSID's office in Washington, D.C.), and by Respondent's counsel Dr Sabine Konrad (participating from Frankfurt), and Mr Maciej Jamka, Dr Wojciech Sadowski, and Ms Katarzyna Szostak-Tebbens (jointly participating from Warsaw).\n\n14.\n\nOn 23 February 2012, the Tribunal issued a decision on provisional measures and Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the organization of the proceeding and specifically the hearing of evidence. The Tribunal rejected requests for an Interim Order suspending criminal proceedings and arrest warrants in respect of the Claimants and Mr Niziol regarding alleged offences which the Claimants consider to arise out of and form part of their dispute with the Republic of Poland. The Tribunal decided, however, that it would, *inter alia*, organize its proceedings in such a way that all parties, including Mr Minnotte and Mr Lewis, have the opportunity to participate effectively in all sessions held in these proceedings.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the Summary Minutes and further to an extension granted by the Tribunal, the Claimants filed their memorial on the merits on 7 November 2011.\n\n16.\n\nOn 7 May 2012, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on the merits, a request for bifurcation and objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n17.\n\nFollowing observations by the Claimants on the Respondent's request for bifurcation of 7 May 2012, the Tribunal issued its decision on this matter on 5 June 2012, deciding to join the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to the merits of the dispute.\n\n18.\n\nBy letters of 15 June and 18 July 2012, and following an invitation by the Tribunal, the parties agreed on the procedural calendar for the parties' further written pleadings, and subsequently reached an agreement on dates for the oral procedure. However, the parties were unable to agree on the venue for the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits. In their correspondence, the Claimants indicated that given the criminal proceedings instituted in Poland against Messrs Minnotte and Lewis, they feared *inter alia* possible arrest, at the instance of a Polish prosecutor, in the event that the hearing were to be held inside the area of the European Union.\n\n19.\n\nFollowing several exchanges between the parties and the Tribunal on this matter during the months of June and October 2012, the Tribunal decided on 23 November 2012 that the hearing was to take place in Istanbul, Turkey during the week of 15 April 2013.\n\n20.\n\nOn 11 September 2012, the Claimants filed a request for production of documents, which the Claimants subsequently amended on 25 September 2012. Following written observations by the Respondent, the Tribunal decided on the Claimants' requests in its Procedural Order No. 2 of 2 November 2012.\n\n21.\n\nOn 30 November and 18 December 2012, each party filed a written submission concerning certain remaining document production matters. Following a telephone conference held with the parties on 10 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 dated 14 January 2013 concerning production of documents.\n\n22.\n\nOn 10 April 2013, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the parties by telephone conference to discuss certain logistical questions pertaining to the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits.\n\n23.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in Istanbul from 15 April to 17 April 2013. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:\n\nAttending on behalf of the Claimants:\n\nMr David Minnotte;\n\nMr Robert Lewis;\n\nMr Joseph M. Matthews, Colson Hicks Eidson, P.A.;\n\nMr David Baron, Greenberg Traurig LLP;\n\nMr Pawel Tatarczak, Greenberg Traurig LLP;\n\nMr Antoni Libiszowski, Greenberg Traurig LLP; and\n\nMr Zygmunt Niziol, PFL.\n\nAttending on behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMs Katarzyna Szostak-Tebbens, State Treasury Solicitors' Office;\n\nMr Maciej Jamka, K&L Gates Jamka Sp.K.;\n\nDr Wojciech Sadowski, K&L Gates Jamka Sp.K.; and\n\nMs Anna Leszczynska, K&L Gates Jamka Sp.K.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, Mr Robert Lewis, Mr David Minnotte, and Mr Zygmut Niziol provided oral witness testimony on behalf of the Claimants.\n\n24.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the parties filed a joint proposed list of points for determination by the Tribunal on 28 May 2013 (the \"List\", which is attached to this Award as Annex B). The parties further filed an agreed chronology of events and their submissions on costs on 10 June 2013.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal declared the proceedings closed on 22 April 2014. The Tribunal deliberated in person and by correspondence.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS**\n----------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThis section summarizes the factual background of this arbitration in so far as it is necessary to understand the matters raised in this proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nThe summary is intended to provide a general overview of the issues in dispute between the parties, and is based on the agreed chronology of events filed by the parties in June 2013. It further takes into account the narratives proposed by each party for this section. The summary does not purport to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal for its decision: these will be addressed as necessary in the context of the Tribunal's analysis of the issues in dispute, taking into account all of the written pleadings in this case and the evidence given by witnesses in the course of oral testimony during the hearing held in April 2013.\n\n**A. Blood Plasma Fractionation - General Background**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nBlood plasma is a liquid component of blood. Blood plasma contains a variety of proteins, including albumin, immunoglobulin, and other proteins known as Factor VIII and Factor IX complexes.2 Plasma fractionation involves the separation and clearing of these proteins for pharmaceutical purposes and for the production of blood derivative preparations.3\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b64.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b63.\n\n29.\n\nBlood-derivative medicinal products obtained from the fractionation of plasma, including (i) albumin, (ii) immunoglobulin, (iii) Factor VIII, and (iv) Factor IX are essential for treatment of many diseases, including haemophilia, deficiencies of immunological systems, multiple sclerosis, as well as many forms of cancer. Supply of hospitals and other state-run healthcare establishments with these products is a mandatory element of a health policy of modern states. Governments also provide for reserves of such products to be stored and available in case of necessity.4\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b616.\n\n30.\n\nManufacturing and marketing of blood plasma derivative products has been regulated both in Poland and in the European Economic Community (the \"European Union\"). Council Directive 89/381/EEC of 14 June 1989 extended the requirements applicable to marketing of medicinal products to products derived from human blood. Furthermore, the abovementioned Directive mandated the Member States to adopt supplementary, specific measures necessary to protect public health by avoiding viral contamination.5\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b66.\n\n31.\n\nManufacturing and use of blood plasma derivative products is exposed to a number of unique risks. These include risks relating to (i) the supply of raw material (in most countries, including Poland, blood donations are only permitted if made voluntarily and without any remuneration being paid to the donor), (ii) possible viral contamination of the entire pool of plasma, and (iii) adverse reactions of patients to blood-plasma derivative products.6\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9, 10.\n\n32.\n\nSelf-sufficiency in plasma derivative products has been recommended by the World Health Organization (\"WHO\"), the European Union and the Council of Europe.7\n\nArticle 3(4) of the EEC Directive of 14 June 1989, Article II of Recommendation No. R/88/4 of the European Council, and Recommendation No. R/90/9 of the Council of Europe of 29 March 1990. See Claimants' Memorial, \u00b67.\n\n33.\n\nSelf-sufficiency in blood-plasma derivative products means that the haemotherapy needs of a given country are satisfied using blood (and its derivatives) obtained from the population of that particular country. Such self-sufficiency was, at the time this dispute arose, considered to be beneficial for countries in order to (i) better control the risk of disease transmission, (ii) utilize blood-derivative products sensibly, and (iii) establish domestic reserves of blood and blood-derivatives independent of global price fluctuations.8\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b68.\n\n**B. Blood Plasma Fractionation -** ***Status quo ante*** **in Poland**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIt is undisputed that at the time the present dispute arose, there was no industrial facility in Poland which was capable of satisfying the country's demand for blood-plasma derivative products. During the relevant period, the Republic of Poland attempted to satisfy the needs for blood-plasma derivative products by entering into agreements with fractionation providers located outside of its territory. Between 1993 and 2005, Poland used the fractionation services of the Central Laboratory of Plasma Fractionation (\"ZLB\") of the Swiss Red Cross in Bern, Switzerland.9 ZLB's services were provided on the basis of an agreement signed on 26 March 1993, which was for an initial term of 3 years and was renewed in each subsequent year.10\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b69, Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b617.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b617.\n\n35.\n\nThe responsibility for assuring the supply of blood plasma and products in Poland was vested in the Institute of Haematology, which performed this responsibility by collecting blood plasma donated by Polish citizens in Poland, then shipping it to Switzerland, where ZLB fractionated the plasma into blood derivative products, which then were intended for resale to Poland.11 According to the Claimants, Poland did not purchase all blood-derivative products derived from the blood plasma it supplied to ZLB,12 and therefore did not obtain any benefit from its production and sale. The Claimants estimate that Poland may have left with ZLB immunoglobulin products derived from Polish plasma valued at app. US$108,000,000 to US$200,000,000 per year.13\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b69; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b61.3; Pinkas Report, p. 128.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b69.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b611; see also Claimants' Proposed Statement of Facts/Chronology, para, 8, citing Niziol Witness Statement, \u00b625 and Exhibit C-31.\n\n36.\n\nAn early attempt to construct a blood plasma fractionation plant in Poland was contemplated but abandoned in the early 1990s.14 In 1994, the idea of constructing such a plant in Poland was revisited. According to the Respondent, the Polish government considered it more cost effective to build and operate a private plasma fractionation facility in Poland, which was also viewed as a measure to stabilize the availability of blood plasma products for the Polish health system.15\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b69.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b618.\n\n**C. Poland's Blood Fractionation Program and the Selection of Nedepol**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn 4 August 1994 a committee (the \"First Committee\") was set up by the Minister of Health in order to develop a national program aimed at establishing a modern base for blood fractionation.16 The First Committee comprised representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Institute of Haematology, the Polish Red Cross and the Postgraduate Medical Education Centre.17\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b619.\n\n*Idem*.\n\n38.\n\nThe First Committee also carried out a tender to select an entity which was to build and operate a plasma fractionation plant in Poland. The First Committee evaluated bids made by the following companies: i) Medicplast; ii) Miles Inc.; iii) TERPOL S.A; iv) Octapharma/Cevit and v) NEDEPOL Sp. z o.o (\"Nedepol\"). Nedepol was a company incorporated in Poland and owned by Mr Zygmunt Niziol.18\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, 20; Exhibit R-12, p. 9; see also *infra,* footnote 73.\n\n39.\n\nThe results of the tender are reflected in the Committee's report of 12 April 1995 (the \"First Committee Report\").19 This Report noted that Behringwerke AG, Miles Inc. and Octapharma had adequate technology and financial resources to build and operate a plasma fractionation plant in Poland in a self-reliant manner.20\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b621.\n\nExhibit R-12, pp. 17-19.\n\n40.\n\nWith regard to Nedepol, the First Committee Report concluded:\n\nNEDEPOL, although lacking its own technologies and experience, claims to be capable of constructing a processing plant based on its own capital, a credit line from Kredyt-Bank and technologies of KABI, BAXTER and NOVO NORDISK. NEDEPOL claims to be going [based on an oral declaration] to construct a plasma processing plant in Omsk.21\n\nExhibit R-12, p.17.\n\n41.\n\nThe First Committee Report recommended that an additional round of interviews with the participants of the first tender was needed, and that this task was to be entrusted to an *ad hoc* intra-ministerial committee be established to for that purpose.22\n\nExhibit R-12, p. 21.\n\n42.\n\nIn 1995, the Inter-Ministerial Committee was established (the \"Second Committee\"), which was entrusted with the additional round of interviews.23 In December 1995, the Second Committee issued its final report (the \"Second Committee Report\"), which contained the following statements:\n\nThe analysis of tenders was conducted with consideration of the following criteria:\n\nA - the construction should be entrusted to a counterparty being in possession of modern technology, without prejudice to viral inactivation methods in processed plasma, as well as experience in this field,\n\nB - the construction should not take long and the modular production line should allow the enhancement of plasma processing proportionately to the amount of material obtained,\n\nC - due to the risk, the State Treasury funds should neither be involved in the construction nor should Government loan guarantees be granted. The funds should come from foreign or Polish private investors,\n\nD - the selected counterparty should ensure a sufficient amount of factor VIII whose yield per litre of FFP [ *i.,e. Fresh Frozen Plasma* ] is contingent upon technological procedures applied at the lowest possible prices,\n\nE - the agreement should guarantee that the counterparty will comply with the policy of blood donation and blood transfusion in Poland.\n\nMembers of this Committee were the Assistant Director of the Government Cabinet Agency's Public Administration Department, the Director of the Community Medicine Program at the Postgraduate Medical Education Centre, the Assistant Director of the Economic Department at the Ministry for International Economic Cooperation, an employee of the Economic Sector Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Director of the Department of Medical Technology and Investment at the Ministry of Health and Public Welfare, and an employee of the Department of Medical Technology and Investment at the Ministry of Health and Public Welfare. Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b625; Exhibit R-13.\n\n43.\n\nThe Second Committee Report then reviewed the proposals by three companies, which had confirmed their interest in the second round of the procurement process. These companies were Miles Inc., Nedepol and Terpol.24 The key parameters of each of the bids submitted were summarized by the Second Committee as follows:25\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **No.** | **Criteria - evaluation of conditions** | **NEDEPOL** | **MILES** | **TERPOL** |\n| 1 | Investment financed with extraGovernmental funds | Yes | No | Yes |\n| 2 | Modern technology and experience | Yes | Yes | No |\n| 3 | Double viral inactivation | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| 4 | Construction period (in months) | 12-15 | 18-24 | 24 |\n| 5 | Annual output (in thousand liters per year) | 50-150 | 400 | 50-200 |\n| 6 | Compliance with policy on blood donation and blood transfusion in Poland | Yes | No(1) | No(2) |\n\n(1) guarantee as regards access to sufficient amounts of plasma and exclusive rights to the final product, at least for a certain period of time.\n\n(2) priority in selling preparations\n\nExhibit R-13, p. 5.\n\nExhibit R-13, p. 8 **.**\n\n44.\n\nWith regard to Nedepol, the Second Committee's Report contained the following information:\n\nNEDEPOL Sp. z o.o in Warsaw was represented by its co-owner and Chairman Zygmunt Niziol, MSc. The company has been operating for 6 years. It deals in technology lines for infusion liquids manufacturing, according to Fresenius (Spencer Company, the Netherlands). NEDEPOL intended to build a turn-key plasma processing plant in Omsk in line with the modern technologies of BAXTER (USA), KABI (SWEDEN) and NOVO NORDISK (Denmark). These technologies would be applied in Poland. The investment in Poland would encompass a target processing module of 150 000 litres of FFP together with licences and transport.\n\nThe investment would be financed by shareholders of NEDEPOL and ZAM HOLDING Companies from Poland. Kredyt Bank S.A. confirmed its readiness for loan financing. The investment would start within 3 months following its confirmation and it would last for 12-15 months. Starting production after 15 months, with output at a level of 50% and its regular increase within the subsequent 4-6 months, all aimed at achieving an optimal processing result in the amount of 150 000 L of FFP per year. The investment implementation is in conformity with ISO standards, and the technology line will have a requisite certificate.\n\nThe Company suggests cooperation with the Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion and the Polish Red Cross. Locations in Warsaw, its vicinity, Gdansk or Mielec - special economic zone.26\n\n*Idem*\n\n45.\n\nIn the course of the bidding process, the Second Committee prepared a questionnaire to which Mr Niziol submitted the following answers on behalf of Nedepol:\n\nThe investment will be carried out by a company established for such purpose under a business name of Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza Sp. z o.o. (LFO) with the following shareholders:\n\nZAN Holding BV (international partner; % of shares) and the following Polish companies:\n\nNEDEPOL Sp. z o.o,\n\nIMAR Sp. z o.o. [...]\n\nZAN Holding B.V. is an investment and financing company registered in the Netherlands. The company participated in financing and construction of a similar facility in Omsk. [\u2026]\n\nIMAR Sp. z o.o. is a Polish company, which initiated the construction of Omsk facility. It is the owner of real property and co-owner and constructor of the plant producing glass fiber reinforced tanks and pipes, i.e. Nordcap Plastik Sp. z o.o. [\u2026]\n\nAt the same time we wish to underline that we will use licenses of the following companies in the project:\n\nFactor VIII: NOVO NOROOISK Factor IX: CRTS LILLE\n\nViral inactivation: NYBC [\u2026]\n\nConstruction period of the project will be 12 - 15 months from the beginning of financing. The production will commence after the lapse of 15 months with the output of 50% which will be systematically increase within the next 4 to 6 months in order to achieve maximum capacity of 100%, i.e. 150,000 liters of FFP per year. [\u2026]\n\nWe focus on this issue because during the recent interview on January 24, 1995 in the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare one of the question (32) was as follows: Is the company aware of the fact that it cannot have exclusivity for collection of FFP in Poland? This kind of thinking simply scares us.27\n\nExhibit C-51, p. 8.\n\n46.\n\nThe Second Committee recommended Nedepol as the preferred entity to build and operate a plasma fractionation facility in Poland. The Second Committee Report was subsequently approved by the Ministry of Health.28 Nedepol was notified accordingly by the Ministry by letter of 28 December 1995.29\n\nExhibit R-14.\n\nExhibit R-15.\n\n**D. Establishment of LFO and the 1996 Bank Loan Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nAs proposed by Mr Niziol during the bidding process,30 Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza Sp. z o.o. (\"LFO\") was subsequently created and incorporated in December 1995 as a limited liability company under Polish law. Its initial share capital was PLN100,000 (approximately US$30,000). As evidenced by the 1996 Investors' Agreement, the initial shareholder in LFO was Nedepol.31\n\nSee above, paragraph 45.\n\nSee *infra*, section F; Exhibit C-6.\n\n48.\n\nOn 10 April 1996, LFO submitted an application to Kredyt Bank, a financial institution located in Poland, seeking a loan in the amount of US$35,974,000 to finance its operations. In this application, LFO asserted that a Swedish company PharmaFrac AB was its main contractor and supplier,32 and that the \"technical documentation\" for the construction and operation of a fractionation plant in Poland (the \"LFO Project\") was \"ready\". LFO further stated that construction of the plant was to be completed by 31 December 1997, and that production was to commence on 2 January 1998, with full production capacity to be achieved by 30 June 1998.33\n\nExhibit R-28, p. 5.\n\nExhibit R-28, p. 3.\n\n49.\n\nIn response to LFO's application,34 Kredyt Bank decided to approach other commercial banks to establish a consortium.35 These financial institutions insisted that LFO apply to the State Treasury for a surety as a precondition to the loan being granted to LFO.\n\nSee above, paragraph \u00b648.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 40. The participating banks were: Kredyt Bank, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy, Bank Slaski, Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy and Bank Zachodni.\n\n**E. Involvement of Messrs Minnotte and Lewis in LFO and Their Visits to Poland**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn 1996, Zygmunt Niziol met Mr David Minnotte and Mr Robert Lewis in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.36 It is not disputed that Messrs Lewis and Minnotte travelled repeatedly to Poland in 1996, and met with several representatives of the Polish Government during their visits, including the then Minister of Health, the late Mr Ryszard Zochowski, the then Minister of Treasury and Industry, Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek37 and the then President of the Republic of Poland, Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski.38 According to the Claimants, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Treasury and Industry, and the President of Poland all made representations to Messrs Minnotte and Lewis suggesting *inter alia* that (i) LFO's operations would receive strong support from the Government, (ii) the Government would ensure the delivery of blood plasma products to LFO, (iii) LFO would be gaining a monopoly with respect to the supply of blood plasma products, and (iv) the Government would guarantee up to 60% of the required bank financing to build such blood fractionation facility.39 The Respondent however contends that the Claimants' allegations in this regard are neither supported by evidence nor confirmed by any subsequent measure taken by the Polish authorities.40\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b616.\n\nMinnotte Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b610, 16, 17, 20 and 21.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 17.\n\nMinnotte Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 17 and 30; Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, pp. 106-107.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 316.\n\n**F. The 1996 Investors' Agreement**\n------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nOn 16 September 1996, Zygmunt Niziol, Wlodzimierz Wapinski, Bjorn Hedberg, LFO, Nedepol, Robert Lewis and David Minnotte signed the 1996 Investors' Agreement.41 This agreement contained *inter alia* the mutual rights and obligations of its signatories with respect to the management and operations of LFO, and determined the participation of each party in LFO. According to this agreement, LFO's shareholding structure was as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Zygmunt Niziol: | 49% |\n| David Minnotte: | 16.5% |\n| Robert Lewis: | 16.5% |\n| Bjorn Hedberg: | 1% |\n| Wlodzimierz Wapinski: | 8% |\n| Nedepol: | 9% |\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 5-A.\n\n52.\n\nThe Investors' Agreement further provided for financial contributions by the shareholders to LFO in the aggregate amount of US$12,000,00042 consisting of US$2,500,000 each from Messrs Minnotte and Lewis, and US$7,000,000 from \"the Niziol Group\".43 The Investors' Agreement also called for the financing of the LFO Project by way of bank loan agreements in an amount not lower than US$35,350,000.44\n\nExhibit C-6, Article 3.4.(a).\n\n*Idem*. See also Article 3.4(b). The Niziol Group loans were to be made by Niziol, Walinski, Nedepol and Hedberg.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 5-A, Article 1.1.(g) **.**\n\n53.\n\nThe Investors' Agreement included, as an Appendix C, a business plan for the development and operation of a plasma protein fractionation plant. This business plan notes in its Section 1(1): \" *Within this project it has been assumed that the production would cover 25-30% of domestic requirements for blood plasma products* \".45 Appended to the business plan were a number of financial statements. It is disputed between the parties whether these statements provided for the supply of fresh frozen plasma to LFO before the completion of the plant.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 5-A **,** Appendix C.\n\n54.\n\nFollowing the Investors' Agreement, LFO's shareholders adopted a resolution on 24 September 1996,46 which authorized Mr Niziol to offset a certain amount of his capital contributions due under the Investors' Agreement against a claim for remuneration for services provided by Mr Niziol to a Dutch company, Spencer Holland BV.47\n\nExhibit R-154.\n\n*Idem*. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 148. The Respondent asserts that this resolution was intended to assist Mr. Niziol to evade his obligation to contribute capital funds to LFO and lacked any business rationale.\n\n55.\n\nBased on the Investors' Agreement, Mr Lewis and Mr Minnotte each acquired 16.5% shares in LFO, and were appointed members of the Management Board of LFO.48 According to the Claimants, they subsequently issued the following promissory notes evidencing loans to LFO:49\n\n4 September 1996 US$62,500 from Mr Minnotte\n\n4 September 1996 US$62,500 from Mr Lewis\n\n25 September 1996 US$75,000 from Mr Minnotte 25 September 1996 US$75,000 from Mr Lewis\n\n21 October 1996 US$1,362,500 from Mr Minnotte\n\n21 October 1996 US$1,362,500 from Mr Lewis\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 5-A **,** Article 4.1 **.**\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 6, Annex 5B and 5D (Annex 5D was subsequently re-submitted as Exhibit C-38).\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that they advanced US$500,000 each on 16 December 1996.50 According to the Claimants, these funds were not evidenced by promissory notes, but were loans to LFO evidenced by wire transfer made pursuant to the Investors' Agreement.51 However, the Claimants' payments of 21 October 1996 and 16 December 1996 were not made directly to LFO's bank account in Poland, but into an account located in Guernsey and held by ZAN Trust.52 ZAN Trust was a British company owned by Mr Niziol. The Respondent contends that these two payments had no legal justification and did not make any commercial sense.53 The Respondent further argues that these payments may only be understood as the Claimants' intention to assist Mr Niziol's alleged fraud concerning the amount of his actual contributions to LFO. The Claimants disagree with the Respondent's assertion and contend that the payments were made through the Guernsey entity following a tax advice they had previously received.54\n\nRequest for Arbitration, pp. 6 *et seq*.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, pp. 6 *et seq*., see also Exhibit C-38.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 124.\n\nRespondent's proposed chronology of events.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 16 April 2013, p. 119.\n\n57.\n\nMessrs Minnotte and Lewis provided a further US$650,000 each on 23 February 1998 as a loan evidenced by a letter of credit initially drawn in favour of Kredyt Bank.55\n\nKredyt Bank ultimately relied on this letter of credit to pay the sums due under the Bank Loan Agreement, Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 16 April 2013, p. 115. See *infra.*\n\n**G. Disputed Invoices and Shareholder Contributions by Mr Niziol**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe shareholders of LFO took a number of further measures between September 1996 and April 1997 to comply with the US$12,000,000 contribution requirement established by the Investors' Agreement.56 The parties differ on the significance and/or purpose of the various steps taken, and also on the amounts ultimately contributed to LFO by its shareholders. The most significant differences relate to the payment of three invoices.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6121-153.\n\n**(1) Payment of Invoice No. 140396 dated 4 December 1996 issued by CSL and NYBC**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nOn 4 December 1996, LFO was allegedly charged with an invoice issued jointly by CSL Limited A.C.N, Bioplasma Division (\"CSL\"),57 a corporation incorporated in Australia, and the New York Blood Centre (\"NYBC\"),58 in the amount of US$2,766,750 for \"prepayment of royalties\" and \"fixed up front fees\", and made \"with reference to a recent agreement\".59 The invoice60 was paid by LFO in full in two instalments,61 and payment was made into a bank account located in Switzerland.62\n\nIn the parties' respective pleadings, they differ as to the official name of this company. The Claimant identifies it as CSL Bioplasma Ltd., while the Respondent indicates the name to be CSL Limited A.C.N. See Claimants' Memorial, p. iii; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, p.4.\n\nExhibit R-43.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6128; Exhibit R-43.\n\nThe Claimants sought to introduce a new version of this invoice after the hearing. In their \"Proposed Statement of Facts/Chronology\" dated 10 June 2013, the Respondent opposed its introduction at that stage in the proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider that the new version affects its reasoning in any way; and it is accordingly unnecessary to rule upon its admissibility.\n\nThe precise dates of the payment of these invoices was subject of much discussion during the hearing, see Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 16 April 2013, pp. 40-44, varying between 9, 10 or 12 December 1996 for the first payment and 19 or 20 December 1996 for the second payment.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 129; see also Exhibit R-53, Confirmation of LFO 1st payment to NYBC CSL, and Exhibit R-54, Confirmation of LFO 2nd payment to NYBC CSL.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that this invoice was forged and was intended to: (i) defraud LFO's creditors by purporting to be a purchase of licence rights to technology, and (ii) create a legal basis to transfer the invoiced amounts abroad. In support of these allegations, the Respondent contends that the two payments were made to a Swiss bank account, which was held, not by CSL, but by Mr Wlodzimierz Wapinski, who was himself a shareholder in LFO and a business partner of Mr Niziol.63 The Respondent asserts that subsequently, US$100,000 were transferred from the Swiss bank account to an account held by Mr Wapinski in Poland. The remainder of the funds was then first transferred to an intermediary bank, before being deposited in two tranches into LFO's bank account in Poland. These two payments were made on 16 January 1997 in the amounts of US$1,355,000 and US$1,355,005.03 respectively, and were identified as capital contributions from Messrs Minnotte and Lewis to LFO.64 The Respondent further submits that the forgery of the invoice was confirmed by representatives of CSL and NYBC.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 130; see also bank account agreement between Julius Baer Bank and Wlodzimierz Wapinski, Exhibit R-55; see also excerpt from the Juliusz Baer Bank account of Wlodzimierz Wapinski, Exhibit R-56.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 132; see also fax from Z. Niziol to Bachmann Trust, Exhibit R-57; and 1997.01.16 letter from Bachmann Trust to Barclays Bank, Exhibit R-52.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants dispute that this invoice was forged.65 Relying on testimony by Mr Niziol, the Claimants assert that the invoice was issued by CSL, and that payments were made in instalments due to a shortage in cash flow at LFO at the time.66 The Claimants further state that payment was made in a confidential manner upon CSL's request.67 The Claimants also submit in this regard that after these payments had been made, Mr Niziol entered into a licence agreement with CSL on 31 January 1997,68 and sold to CSL a transferable option to purchase 10% of LFO's shares for US$2,100,000. In light of this agreement Mr Niziol hence returned the US$2,100,000 to LFO.69\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 23.\n\n*Idem*.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 22.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b625; see also Niziol Reply Witness Statement, \u00b6K.\n\n**(2) Payment of Invoice No. 00035/97 dated 17 February 1997 issued by Spencer Holland B.V.**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nOn 17 February 1997, LFO was charged with Invoice No. 00035/97, allegedly issued by Spencer Holland B.V. for the amount of US$2,520,000. This invoice related to a 45% prepayment under a contract for supply of laboratory equipment.70 On 5 March 1997, LFO paid this invoice in full into the bank account of Spencer Holland B.V. at the ING Bank in Warsaw.71\n\nExhibit R-60.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6138; Exhibit R-62.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this invoice too was forged, and that the forgery had been confirmed by representatives of Spencer Holland B.V., who stated that they never delivered any equipment to LFO, nor had they received any payment from LFO.72 In this regard, the Respondent asserts that Mr Niziol was authorized by Spencer Holland B.V. to manage the company's bank account in Warsaw.73 According to the Respondent, the amount of US$2,000,000 was transferred on 11 March 1997 from Spencer Holland B.V.'s account to one of Mr Niziol's personal bank accounts located in the Netherlands.74 Two days later, on 13 March 1997, Mr Niziol then initiated a wire transfer in the amount of US$2,000,000 from his Netherlands account to LFO's account in Poland. In the Respondent's view, Mr Niziol abused his power to manage Spencer Holland B.V.'s bank account, and further presented the payment to LFO as his own financial contribution.75\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6153.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6139. Exhibit R-63 Exhibit R-64. The Respondent further summarizes the relationship between Mr Niziol and Spencer Holland as follows: \"Mr. Niziol was a sales and technical representative of Spencer Holland in Poland from 1985. Then he worked for that company in the Netherlands from 1990 to 1993, where he met Mr. Eduard Krapels, the Director of Spencer Holland. Then, Mr. Niziol founded Nedepol, which was initially owned by Mr. Krapels and Mr. Niziol's wife. Nedepol was the distributor of Spencer Holland's equipment in Poland.\" Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6138.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6140.\n\n*Idem*. 1997.03.12 ABN Amro bank account excerpts (re Spencer), Exhibit R- 65.\n\n**(3) Payment of Invoice No. 140821, issued by E. Krapels Holding and CSL, dated 13 May 1997**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nOn 5 May 1997, LFO was charged with Invoice No. 140821, issued by E. Krapels Holding for the amount of US$1,065,000.76 The invoice indicated that it was issued in relation to a pre-payment for supply of certain gels and filters to be delivered to LFO.\n\nExhibit R-66.\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that after this invoice had been paid in full to Krapels Holding on 17 May 1997, Mr Niziol instructed Krapels Holding on 20 May 1997 to (i) return US$1,005,000 to a personal bank account held by Mr Niziol, and (ii) transfer US$60,000 to CSL in Australia.77 The Respondent further alleges that Mr Niziol transferred on 22 May 1997 US$1,000,000 from his private account to LFO, presenting this sum as his own contribution to LFO.78\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 141.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 142.\n\n**(4) Other Disputed Transactions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that over the period giving rise to this dispute, LFO diverted or misspent substantial financial resources, including funds paid for fictitious suppliers of technology, equipment, and services, or under sham property lease agreements.79 The Claimants dispute these allegations.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 154-184.\n\n**H. The State Treasury Surety and the 1996 Bank Loan Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAs indicated above, the consortium of banks which contemplated the conclusion of a Bank Loan Agreement with LFO requested that LFO obtain a State Treasury surety for the loan in question.80 LFO applied for such surety to the State Treasury on 27 January 1997.81\n\nSee above, paragraph \u00b649.\n\nExhibit R-22.\n\n68.\n\nOn 4 March 1997, LFO entered into a Bank Loan Agreement with a consortium consisting of five private banks.82 Under this agreement, LFO received a loan for an amount equivalent to US$34,651,000.83 The release of the funds to LFO was however conditioned upon the granting of a surety by the State Treasury of Poland.\n\nExhibit C-12\n\nThe Bank Loan Agreement was subsequently amended 10 times by way of further Annexes, concluded during the years 1997 to 2001. One of the collaterals provided for in the original Bank Loan Agreement was the registered pledge on the shares in LFO held by the LFO shareholders. All LFO shareholders signed registered pledge agreements, intended to cover the entire share capital in LFO. The registered pledge agreements also contained a clause that enabled the banks, which were party to the Bank Loan Agreement, to take over the shares in LFO in the event that one of the pledgers defaulted.\n\n69.\n\nOn 27 May 1997, the Polish Council of Ministers adopted Resolution No. 39/97 approving the granting of a surety to LFO, and authorized the Minister of Finance to sign the relevant agreements with LFO.84 The Resolution approved a surety in the amount of up to 60% of the sum due under the Bank Loan Agreement, and also covered up to 60% of the interest. The State Treasury's liability was capped at US$25,900,824.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b642; see also Exhibit R-23, 1997.05.27 Resolution No. 39/97 of the Council of Ministers.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Government's decision to approve these guarantees was based on the information provided by LFO in the course of the application process. According to the Respondent, LFO had not informed the Ministry about a recent change in technological partners from Pharmacia, Novo Nordisc, NYBC and Lille Blood Centre, to CSL. The Respondent hence argues that the information provided by LFO during the application process was incorrect and misleading.85\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b651.\n\n71.\n\nOn 1 July 1997, two surety agreements were signed. One agreement was concluded between LFO and the Minister of Finance acting on behalf of State Treasury (the \"LFO Surety Agreement\"),86 and the second surety agreement was concluded between the Minister of Finance and the consortium of financial institutions which had agreed to provide a loan to LFO (the \"Consortium Surety Agreement\")87.\n\nExhibit R-24.\n\nExhibit R-25.\n\n**I. The Licence Agreements with CSL and the 1997 Elections in Poland**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nOn 21 November 1996, LFO entered into an agreement with CSL to obtain licence rights to technology for blood fractionation processes.88 A further licence agreement between CSL and LFO was subsequently entered into on 31 January 1997.89 LFO and CSL also concluded a Memorandum of Understanding on 1 November 1997,90 which contained specific provisions on toll fractionation procedures.91 A further licence agreement was signed on 1 May 1998.92 The parties differ with respect to the effect of these agreements on the position of LFO. The Claimants contend that by virtue of these agreements, LFO had acquired enforceable rights to the technology required for the operation of its plasma fractionation plant.93 The Respondent submits that the alleged transfer of technology from CSL to LFO had not been proven, particularly given that in all agreements concluded with CSL, LFO's access to technology was dependent on several preconditions which, according to the Respondent, had never been met.94\n\nExhibit C-41.\n\nExhibit R-29.\n\nExhibit C-11 (undated draft), and Exhibit R-42.\n\nExhibit R-42. Toll fractionation is the process of recovering blood products from plasma from a particular country, and returning those products to that country.\n\nExhibit C-43 and Exhibit R-30. The Claimants however contend this document was issued on 29 April 1998.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 107-118. According to the Respondent, this understanding is supported by evidence in that once CSL terminated its negotiations with LFO in June 2000, LFO was left without any enforceable licence rights.\n\n73.\n\nOn 17 September 1997, the Minister of Health Ryszard Zochowski died. On 21 September 1997 parliamentary elections were held in Poland, which resulted in a change of government: the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish People's Party was replaced by the Solidarity Electoral Action. The Cabinet of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek was established in October 1997.\n\n**J. The 1997 Fractionation Agreement**\n---------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nOn 1 October 1997, LFO and the Minister of Health concluded an agreement for the fractionation of blood plasma by LFO (the \"1997 Fractionation Agreement\").95 The relevant provisions of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement are set forth below:\n\nArticle 2 - Documents\n\nThe agreement includes this document and all of the Annexes mentioned below\n\nAnnex 1 Copy of extract from the commercial register\n\nAnnex 2 Records of the departmental commissions and interdepartmental commissions in the PFL matter\n\nAnnex 3 Conditions for the delivery and monitoring of the plasma\n\nAnnex Resolution No 39/97 of the Council of Ministers dated May 27 1997\n\nArticle 3 - Obligations of PFL\n\n3.1 PFL undertakes to build and equip the plant within period of 24 months from the date of signature of this agreement and will begin production of the products within period of 6 months from the date of completion of the construction.\n\n3.2 PFL undertakes:\n\na. To accept plasma from organizational units of the public blood service at its own cost and to assume any risk connected with its care and transport and any liability for delay in the acceptance of the plasma and any damage that may result therefrom in which connection the conditions of acceptance -quantity quality prices time limits for the acceptance of the plasma and for the delivery of the products - shall be agreed upon directly between the suppliers of the plasma and the receivers of the product once during each calendar year in accordance with Article 6.\n\nb. To provide the finished products at its own expense with the resources of the plant;\n\nc. To offer the products at prices lower than global prices. Article 4 - Obligations of the MHaSW\n\n4.1 The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare shall ensure that the organizational actions are taken for the supplying of plasma to PFL by organizational units of the public blood service giving due regard to the requirement specified by PFL for minimum quantity of plasma that is to say 150000 liters per year.\n\nDuring subsequent years the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare shall endeavor to increase the deliveries of plasma to PFL with view to achieving Poland's ability to meet its own needs for plasma-derivative preparations\n\nThe prices of the plasma must not exceed global prices.\n\nArticle 5 - Duration of the Agreement\n\n5.1 The agreement shall enter into force on the date of its signature and shall be valid for period of 15 years\n\nArticle 6 - Price time limits delivery and conditions of payment for the plasma and the products\n\n6.1 The price of the plasma and the products shall be specified for given financial year before June 30 of the preceding financial year\n\n6.2 Each party to the agreement shall before June 30 of the preceding financial year make its orders addressed to the other for the delivery of plasma and products for the following financial year in written form with due regard for:\n\na. The quantity of the plasma supplied\n\nb. The quantity form and type of the products converted from the plasma supplied\n\nc. The place and time for the acceptance of the plasma and the delivery of the products\n\n6.3 The settlement and payment for the delivery of the plasma and the products in given financial year shall take place before the last day of the financial year\n\nArticle 9 - Arbitration\n\n9.2 All disputes between the parties not amenable to amicable settlement which have arisen in connection with or on the basis of this agreement shall be settled by the Arbitral Tribunal at the National Economic Chamber Izba Gospodarcza in Warsaw in accordance with the rules of procedure of that Tribunal and on the basis of the provisions of Polish law\n\nArticle 10 - Miscellaneous provisions\n\n10.1 The Annexes referred to in this agreement constitute an integral part thereof.\n\nExhibit C-13.\n\n75.\n\nThe parties are in disagreement as to the content of the Ministry of Health and LFO's rights and obligations pursuant to the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the 1997 Fractionation Agreement created the right for LFO to receive supplies of fresh frozen plasma, upon LFO's demand, even before the fractionation plant was completed.96 In this regard, the Claimants rely *inter alia* on the Supreme Chamber of Control Audit Report of 2007, which described the 1997 Fractional Agreement in the following manner:\n\nOn October 1, 1997, the Minister of Health and Public Welfare signed an understanding with PFL, which included such items as the obligations of PFL and the Ministry of Health and Public Welfare with regard to the construction of the plasma fractionation plant and the provision of plasma by public healthcare facilities (The Covenant). [...]\n\nIn the Covenant, the Minister of Health and Public Welfare stated that Poland needed a plasma fractionation plant and agreed to take organizational actions in order to supply PFL with 150,000 liters of plasma per year, via public blood service facilities. Plasma prices could not exceed world prices. [\u2026]\n\nThe Covenant of 10/1/97 between the Minister of Health and Public Welfare and PFL was actually an agreement establishing the terms and conditions of business between those parties in the area of plasma processing, made for the term of 15 years (a blanket agreement). [\u2026]\n\nSaid Covenant actually constituted giving PFL exclusivity to process a significant portion of the plasma obtained in Poland, for a term of 15 years, and thus constituted preferential treatment of that company on the Polish market.97\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 37 *et seq*, and 93 *et seq*.\n\nExhibit C-33, p. 28, sec. 3.2.6.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent contends that under Article 3.2. of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement, the obligation of the Ministry of Health to supply fresh frozen plasma was conditional upon the completion of the plant by LFO.98 The Respondent submits that the lack of a provision in the 1997 Fractionation Agreement on (i) the quantity of plasma to be supplied, (ii) the prices any fresh frozen plasma to be supplied, and (iii) the prices for plasma-derivative products, renders it impossible to accept the interpretation proposed by the Claimants that the 1997 Fractionation Agreement envisioned LFO to start production immediately.99\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 66.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\n**K. The Construction of the Fractionation Plant**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nOn 23 October 1996, LFO had obtained a permit to conduct commercial activities in the Special Economic Zone \" *Euro-Park* \" in Mielec, and on 18 December 1997, LFO acquired from the State Treasury the right of perpetual usufruct to 2ha of land located in the Special Economic Zone in Mielec.100 The Claimants contend that the Ministry of Health approved the construction of a fractionation facility on this land, and construction of the LFO plant began in 1998.\n\nExhibit R-27. The State Treasury had leased the land to LFO on 1 March 1997.\n\n79.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, construction of the factory building was completed in 2000.101 The Respondent asserts that due to disputes between LFO and several construction companies, construction of the plant was delayed from the beginning, and works on the facility came to a halt in 1999.102 In the Respondent's view, construction of the plant was never completed.103\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 28; Exhibit C-20.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100; see also Exhibit R-164.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 85.\n\n**L. The Claimants' Request for Supply of Frozen Plasma**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nDuring the period 1998 and 2000, LFO sent a series of letters to the Ministry of Health, including letters dated 20 April 1998,104 12 August 1998,105 24 August 1998,106 9 September 1998,107 12 February 1999,108 29 June 1999,109 26 August 1999110 and 17 September 1999.111 Referencing the 1997 Fractionation Agreement, LFO requested the Ministry in these letters to supply fresh frozen plasma to LFO and indicated that such plasma would be processed at CSL's facilities in Australia.\n\nExhibit C-15. \"In accordance with the Agreement with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in midyear 1998 we are planning to process approximately 50,000 liters of plasma at CSL on the same technological line and using the same technological process. This will considerably speed up the registration of preparations and the preparations will permit to make up the deficit in their supply.\"\n\nExhibit C-56. \"In accordance with the agreement of October 1st, 1997 concluded between the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and Laboratorum Frakcjonowania Osocza we plan to process in CSL approximately 60,000 liters of human blood plasma in the period from October 1998 to May 1999.... I further wish to inform you that from June to the end of December 1999 we plan to process in CSL another 90,000 liters of human-blood plasma on the same terms as presented above.\"\n\nExhibit C-16(A). This letter summarizes a meeting held between LFO, CSL, The Ministry of Health and a representative of Parliament.\n\nExhibit C-16(B). In this letter, LFO indicates that it is ready to process Polish plasma in the amount of 60,000 liters in 1998 and 150,000 liters in 1999. LFO requests from the government \"support in completing the very complex registration procedures (in order to obtain the appropriate documents), just as the support given at registration of plasma derivatives manufactured from Polish plasma by ZLB of Swiss Red Cross.\"\n\nExhibit C-16(C). \" On 16 September 1998 during a meeting at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in accordance with the letter ref. l.dz. 201/9/98 of 9 September 1998 we declared that LFO in cooperation with CSL guaranteed the readiness to process 150 000 liters of plasma in the year 1999. We once again offered to deliver a corresponding quantity of Factor VIII concentrate for Immunoglobulin manufactured, in total it would be 39 million IU. We proposed the first batch of plasma be sent for processing already in November 1998. We are sorry to say that we have had no reply to any of our letters or proposals. The only reply was the message on resignation of Dr M. Kornatowski, Secretary of State, from his post.\"\n\nExhibit C-57. In this letter, dated 29 June 1999, LFO requested that the Ministry of Health order Regional Blood Donation Centers to supply Polish plasma to LFO, reasoning that such instructions would be \"...a necessary document...to continue the registration process of plasma-derived products obtained from Polish human blood plasma.\" *Idem.*\n\nExhibit C-16(D). \"I wish to inform you that till the present moment I have not received any reply to several questions asked in our letters.... In accordance with Article 3.1. of the Agreement of 1 October 1997 between the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and LFO Sp. z o.o., in the 2nd quarter of 2000 we should have commenced manufacture of plasma derivatives. (...) Under the Agreement the Parties were obligated to place, by 30 June this year, written reciprocal orders of plasma and products for the subsequent accounting year. A matter of particular importance is your consent to the acquisition by LFO of 25 000 l of fresh frozen plasma in order to be processed at CSL Limited of Australia, our licensor. Until the commencement of production in Mielec, acting under an agreement with CSL Limited (letter of intent dated 30 July 1999 enclosed herewith) we entrust the production of plasma derivatives to CSL Limited, a company with documented many years' experience in manufacture of the above products. During that period we also intend to send plasma to CSL Limited for fractionation and manufacture of plasma derivatives.\"\n\nExhibit C-16(E).\n\n81.\n\nThe parties differ as to the origin and character of these letters. The Claimants contend that the letters were sent pursuant to LFO's right under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement to receive fresh frozen plasma, and that these letters remained unanswered.112 The Respondent maintains that the issue of intermediate deliveries of fresh plasma to LFO was discussed, but ultimately rejected in the course of the negotiations leading to the 1997 Fractionation Agreement, and that there was no obligation by the government to supply the plasma prior to LFO completing the plant in Poland.113 According to the Respondent, these letters were perceived as an attempt by LFO to change the terms of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 21 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 66; see also Exhibit R-158.\n\n**M. 1998 Tax Inspection & the Ministry's Subsequent Exchanges with Kredyt Bank**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nFrom 19 August 1998 to 17 December 1998 LFO was the subject of an inspection by Polish tax authorities.114 The protocol concluding the inspection contained objections and reservations regarding (i) the amount of the financial contributions made by LFO's shareholders, and (ii) the way in which funds were spent by LFO. This protocol was delivered to LFO, and LFO subsequently filed comments in response to these findings.115\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 117; see also Exhibit R-41.\n\nExhibit R-177.\n\n83.\n\nFollowing the tax inspection, the Ministry of Finance sent a further letter to Kredyt Bank on 29 December 1998, stating:\n\nThe Guarantee Department wishes to express our concern at the deterioration of economic and financial situation of \"Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza\" sp. z o.o. At the same time, considerable delays in the project construction may shortly lead to the Company's loss of credit capacity. [...]\n\nTill the present moment, the Shareholders have failed to make the supplementary payment in full amount, i.e. USD 12 million, to the reserve capital declared. [\u2026]\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance information, considerable expenses not related with the project activities have been accounted as the project costs. [\u2026]\n\nUnder \u00a7 5 of the Guarantee Agreement of 1 July 1997 concluded between the Minister of Finance and Kredyt Bank PBI S.A., we request any and all explanations be provided and necessary documents presented to the fiscal control inspectors carrying their audit of reliability of the Bank supervision over utilization of the State-Treasury guaranteed credit given to \"Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza\" sp. z o.o. and the credit security established by the Bank. Further refusal of cooperation with the fiscal control bodies will be deemed the breach of the terms of the Guarantee Agreement of 1 July 1997. [\u2026]\n\nIn view of the ensuing risk to the repayment of the investment credit by \"Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza\" sp. z o.o., *the* *Ministry of Finance, Guarantee Department requests the payment of the means from the State-Treasury guaranteed credit be suspended until the borrower has fulfilled all the obligations under the credit repayment security agreements and the Bank has provided the Ministry of Finance with comprehensive information*. (emphasis added).116\n\nClaimants refer to this letter as dated 24 December, Claimants' Memorial, | 23(A); see also Exhibit C-17. (ref. DG/S-5/19/491/98, 2 pages) (Exhibit C-17(A)).\n\n84.\n\nThe parties dispute the character of the Ministry's 29 December 1998 letter. While the Claimants contend that this letter was an exercise of *puissance publique*,117 the Respondent asserts that the letter was sent by the Ministry acting in a commercial capacity *qua* party to the Surety Agreements.118\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 51 and 80.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 329.\n\n85.\n\nIt is not disputed, however, that Kredyt Bank refused to accept the requests of the Ministry of Finance. The response of Kredyt Bank of 5 February 1999119 included the following statements:\n\nconsiderable majority of its charges or claims bear testimony of your complete ignorance of the subject and of the documentation concerned by the State Treasury, or possibly show that your information has been acquired from an incomplete source which could not have been the Fiscal Audit Office [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\nTo sum up, we do not share your opinion on credit repayment by the borrower himself being at risk, since project execution does not show any symptoms to suggest that.\n\nExhibit C-17.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants assert that in 1999, Kredyt Bank ceased to provide financing to LFO, and decided to do so based on the Ministry's 29 December 1998 letter.120 The Respondent however submits that throughout 1999, Kredyt Bank continued to provide funds to LFO.121\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b624.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 114; see also Exhibits R-168 to R-164.\n\n87.\n\nOn 4 August 2000, the Ministry of Finance sent a further letter to Kredyt Bank, expressing additional concerns regarding LFO. In its letter, the Ministry stated \"Well-grounded suspicions that LFO utilizes the funds from the State Treasury-guaranteed credit to finance the expenses not directly related with the project activities pose a threat to the execution of the whole project and may have adverse consequences for Kredyt Bank S.A.\"122\n\nExhibit C-17(C).\n\n88.\n\nKredyt Bank responded by letter of 28 August 2000, indicating that it disagreed with the Ministry's assessment of the LFO Project, stating \"[t]he audit results available to our Bank at present, in our opinion do not confirm the fears and suspicions suggested in your letter.\"123\n\nExhibit C-17(D).\n\n**N. CSL's Withdrawal and the 2000 Fractionation Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn 1999, at the initiative of LFO, the Ministry of Health and LFO began to renegotiate the terms of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. CSL was to become a strategic investor in LFO and acquire 35% of its shares. The involvement of CSL in such a manner also required renegotiations of the Bank Loan Agreement, which was amended by Annex No. 6 dated 23 May 2000.124\n\nExhibit R-39.\n\n90.\n\nIn early June 2000, CSL however acquired ZLB and withdrew from the LFO Project. The parties differ as to the reasons why CSL withdrew from co-operation with LFO. The Claimants argue that CSL withdrew because (i) CSL had become aware of the government's delays in delivering blood plasma to LFO; (ii) the Institute of Haematology had interfered in the performance by the Ministry of Health under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement;125 (iii) CSL had made a rational business decision to abandon more than AUS$4,000,000 of unpaid consulting fees from LFO in favour of assuming a contract with ZLB;126 and (iv) the Institute of Haematology \"sweetened\" the contract between the Government of Poland and ZLB for the benefit of ZLB after it was acquired by CSL.127 In turn, the Respondent asserts that the evidence supports the conclusion that CSL withdrew from the co-operation with LFO, because: (i) CSL realized that LFO had no financial resources to complete the project with its own resources,128 (ii) LFO had been unable to convince the Polish Government in the negotiations leading to the 2000 Fractionation Agreement to increase prices for blood derivative products,129 and (iii) CSL discovered the forgery of the invoice No. 140396 mentioned above.130\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 15.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, p. 57 and cf. p. 69; Exhibit R-159.\n\nPinkas Report, p. 133.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 107.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 114; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 107.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 115; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 107; see also Exhibit R-43; Exhibit R-44; Exhibit R-45; Exhibit R-159; Exhibit R-160.\n\n91.\n\nIt is not disputed between the parties that LFO knew about the withdrawal of CSL during the negotiations leading to the 2000 Fractionation Agreement.131\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 27; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 191 *et se* q; Exhibit C-21.\n\n92.\n\nOn 14 June 2000, the 2000 Fractionation Agreement was signed between LFO and the Ministry of Health. This agreement included *inter alia* the following provisions:\n\n(i) \"[LFO] holds unlimited licenses in terms of their life span to fractionate Plasma and produce Derivatives issued by CSL A.C.N Limited with its registered office at 189 Camp Road Broadmeadows Australia under Licensing Agreements of January 31 1997 and May 1998 and that the rights under the licenses acquired thereunder have not been limited for the benefit of any third party\" (Art. 3.1.b);\n\n(ii) \"[LFO] offers to produce the Derivatives and provide Plasma Fractionating abroad starting from January 1, 2001, and from July 1, 2001 the said operations shall be gradually transferred to the Plant\" (Art. 3.1.d);\n\nThe agreement further specified the selling prices for plasma-derived products until 31 December 2004 (Art. 6.3), and contained an obligation by LFO to complete its production facilities within 36 months, i.e., by 14 June 2003. The agreement further contemplated that fractionation production was to reach full capacity within 12 months from the completion of the construction process (Art. 3.1.e).132\n\nExhibit C-21.\n\n93.\n\nIt is undisputed that the entry into force of the 2000 Fractionation Agreement depended on two conditions which were to be fulfilled by 31 December 2000:133\n\n(i) the 2000 Fractionation Agreement was to be cleared by the Ministry of Health and the President of the Public Procurement Office; and\n\n(iii) LFO was obliged to present to the Ministry of Health documents to evidence sufficient financial, organizational and technological support of LFO by an external investor.134\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 188; Claimant's Reply Memorial, \u00b6 132.\n\nExhibit C-21, Article 5(3).\n\n94.\n\nThe 2000 Fractionation Agreement was subsequently cleared by the Ministry of Health and the Public Procurement office, hence the first condition was met.135 The second condition, requiring LFO to provide certain documentation, was not complied with.136\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 189, referencing Niziol Witness Statement, \u00b6 36.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 190.\n\n95.\n\nWith regard to the second condition, LFO undertook a number of steps to comply with this provision. Following CSL's withdrawal from the project, LFO first requested, and obtained, authorization from the Ministry of Health to change the technological provider.137 LFO subsequently entered into an agreement on 6 November 2000 with Octapharma AB, an Austrian company, pursuant to which Octapharma AB was to provide fractionation technology to LFO.138 It is however disputed between the parties whether this agreement entered into force.139\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 312; Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 131.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, 1 27; Exhibit C-23; Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 134.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\n96.\n\nOn 29 December 2000, LFO and the Ministry of Health agreed to further extend the deadline for LFO's delivery of the documents evidencing LFO's sufficient financial and organizational support until 28 February 2001.140\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 194; Annex No. 1 to the 2000 Fractionation Agreement, Exhibit R-104.\n\n97.\n\nBy letter of 7 February 2001, the Ministry of Health reminded LFO to produce the documentation required under the 2000 Fractionation Agreement.141 In response, on 20 February 2001, LFO informed the Ministry of Health that it had signed a \"Term Sheet\" with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) (\"Credit Suisse\"), which reportedly expressed its willingness to invest US$20,000,000 in LFO.142 Following consultations with Kredyt Bank, the Ministry of Health decided to agree to further prolong the time-limit for LFO to produce the required documentation until 30 April 2001.143\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 195.\n\n*Idem*.\n\nAnnex No. 2 to the 2000 Fractionation Agreement was signed on 28 February 2001; see Exhibit R-106, and Exhibit R-107.\n\n98.\n\nOn 27 April 2001, LFO requested a further 2-month extension to file the relevant documentation, indicating that Credit Suisse had not finalized its decision to invest in LFO.144 It is undisputed that the Ministry did not respond to LFO's request.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 196; see also Exhibit R-108.\n\n99.\n\nUpon expiration of the 30 April 2001 deadline, LFO had not provided the relevant documents to the Ministry of Health. According to the Respondent, the 2000 Fractionation Agreement therefore automatically lost all legal effects upon the expiration of this deadline, and the agreement was to be deemed as to never have been concluded, in accordance with its Article 5.3.145 The Respondent further argues that the parties' contractual relationships were therefore continuously governed by the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. The Claimants were also of the view that the 1997 Fractionation Agreement continued to be the determining legal instrument.146\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 197.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 137: \"The Government declared that 2000 Fractionation Agreement did not enter into force due to lack of technology and financial support of the project (\u2026) In response, LFO informed the Government that the provisions of 1997 Fractionation Agreement are binding and requested that the Government perform its obligations arising therefrom.\"; see also Exhibit C-100.\n\n100.\n\nOn 7 May 2001, the consortium of financial institutions party to the Bank Loan Agreement requested LFO to repay all then outstanding sums, which amounted to app. US$7,000,000, within 7 days, indicating that they would otherwise terminate the Bank Loan Agreement.147 LFO did not repay the outstanding amounts within that time-frame.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 198; see also Exhibit R-109.\n\n101.\n\nOn May 14, 2001, LFO filed an application with the Polish court to commence a \"composition procedure,\" which is a type of insolvency proceedings.148 In its application, LFO summarized its inability to pay the current liabilities as follows:\n\nThe reasons for the Debtors cessation in payment of the debts are circumstances independent of the Debtor, particularly the following:\n\n1. the withdrawal of the strategic investor (CSL LTD in Australia) from entering the Company, which was supposed to be associated with a subsidy to the Company in a minimum amount of 10 million USD and assurance of credit resources;\n\n2. the withdrawal of the financial investor (Credit Swiss First Boston LTD) entering the Company, which was supposed to be associated with a subsidy to the Company in the amount of USD 20 million (the SCFB board informed us of the decision to freeze all investments in relation to the loss of 500 million dollars on the international financial market);\n\n3. the need to change the production technology at the design and construction stages, caused by the need to adapt the technology to the Union standards, entailing a growth in the necessary investment expenditures and the lengthening of the investment cycle.\"149\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 199; see also Exhibit R-40.\n\nExhibit R-40.\n\n102.\n\nOn 16 May 2001, a meeting took place between Mr Niziol, one representative of the consortium of the financial institutions who were party to the Bank Loan Agreement, several representatives of the Ministry of Finance, and representatives of the Ministry of Health. In the course of this meeting, the representatives of both, the Ministry of Health and the representative of the consortium of financial institutions indicated their preference for LFO to continue with its project, and also stated their willingness to continue supporting LFO on the condition that LFO find a suitable strategic investor. In the course of this meeting, Mr Niziol asserted that he would present such an investor by 25 May 2001.150 However, Mr Niziol did not present an investor to the Ministry within the timeframe.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, 201; see also Exhibit R-110.\n\n**O. Termination of the Bank Loan Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nOn 31 May 2001, the consortium of financial institutions terminated the Bank Loan Agreement.151 The notice of termination stated that the decision was based on LFO's noncompliance with the credit repayment schedule. On the loan termination date, the overdue principal amounted to US$5,568,279.27, and the interest amounted to US$1,470,792.49. The total amount to be repaid by LFO as of 31 May 2001 (including principal that was not yet overdue) was US$22,746,309. 12.152 The Polish courts later confirmed by way of a final judgment that the Bank Loan Agreement had been properly terminated.153\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b629; see also Exhibit C-25.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6202.\n\nExhibit R-111.\n\n**P. LFO's Attempts to Engage Investors and Technology Providers**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nLFO continued its attempts to engage an outside investor, and on 2 July 2001, LFO signed an investor's agreement with Ciech S.A., a Polish state-owned chemical sector company, which contemplated a US$12,000,000 investment by Ciech in LFO.154 It is not disputed between the parties that this agreement never entered into force, and that Ciech did not ultimately invest in LFO.155\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b627; see also Exhibit C-26(1).\n\nIn their pleadings, the Claimants refer to this agreement as Ciech's written \"offer\" to invest in LFO, Claimants' Memorial, 95, and Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6172; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, 203 argues that the agreement never entered into force as it was conditional on the 2000 Fractionation Agreement and the Bank Loan Agreement - both of which were not in force in July 2001.\n\n105.\n\nBy letter of 20 September 2001, Octapharma, a company which had previously been approached by LFO as a potential investor,156 informed the Ministry of Health that it did not plan to invest in LFO.157The Claimants contend that while Octapharma indicated in this letter that it did not intend to invest in LFO, the letter did not stipulate that Octapharma was unwilling to provide fractionation technology to LFO.158\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 214, see also Exhibit R-117.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 217; see also Exhibit R-117. Claimants contend that Octapharma's letter did not mean that Octapharma was not willing to provide technology to LFO; Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimants assert that any possible co-operation between LFO and Octapharma was frustrated due to pressure from the Polish government, and specifically following an intervention by the Ministry of Health.159 In this regard, the Claimants submit that a person by the name of Mr Andrzej Kaminski, who was allegedly employed by the Ministry of Health, misrepresented to Octapharma in early 2002 that he was an employee of LFO, in order to (i) receive copies of correspondence exchanged between Octapharma and LFO, and to (ii) convince Octapharma to terminate its co-operation with LFO.160 The Respondent rejects these allegations and asserts that these are not credible and not supported by evidence.161 In this regard, the Respondent refers to an email sent by Mr Kim Bjoemstrup, Executive Corporate Vice President of Octapharma, to the Ministry of Health on 18 March 2002, which indicates that while Octapharma had signed two licensing agreements with LFO, neither of these agreements had entered into force and that no payments had ever been received by Octapharma from LFO.162\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 72B and 94; Claimants' Reply Memorial, 11 32 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 33.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 337 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 138; see also Exhibit R-119.\n\n**Q. Termination of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2002, the Ministry of Health informed LFO that it would terminate the 1997 Fractionation Agreement in the event that LFO did not finalize the construction of the fractionation plant and/or start production within a period of 3 months from the date of the Ministry's letter.163 The parties disagree whether the construction of the fractionation plant had ever been completed.164\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 217; see also Exhibit R-121.\n\nSee above, paragraph \u00b679.\n\n108.\n\nOn 22 August 2002, the Ministry of Health sent a notice to LFO terminating the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.165 The termination of this agreement was subsequently confirmed to LFO by the Ministry's letter of 8 October 2002.166\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 128.\n\n*Idem* ; see also Exhibit R-122.\n\n**R. The November 2002 Shareholders Resolution**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nOn 26 November 2002, the shareholders of LFO adopted resolutions,167 which:\n\n(i) decreased the share capital in LFO from PLN100,000 to PLN20,000, by way of redemption of 80% of existing shares (in proportion to the shareholding). The shareholding of the Claimants was thus diminished by 80%, i.e. it decreased from 33% shares to 6.6% shares in the share capital of LFO;\n\n(ii) simultaneously increased the share capital of LFO from PLN20,000 to PLN400,000;\n\n(iii) increased the nominal value of individual shares from PLN100 to PLN500, each;\n\n(iv) issued 600 new shares, constituting 75% of the new share capital, which were offered to Mr Krzysztof Lysakowski, who was an employee of LFO; and\n\n(v) 600 shares were given to Mr Lysakowski in consideration of a fuel tank valued at PLN300,000 (approximately US$87,000).168\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 73D; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 219 *et seq.;* Exhibit R-123.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 219; Exhibit R-125.\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent contends that these resolutions were not in accordance with Polish law and adversely affected the Government and the financial institutions that were party to the Bank Loan Agreement. The Respondent argues in essence that (i) given the redemption of 80% of LFO shares, the registered pledge that constituted a collateral under the Bank Loan Agreement was automatically extinguished;169 (ii) the financial institutions no longer had a legal title to request a lien in their favour since Mr Lysakowski, being the new majority shareholder in LFO, was not a party to the Bank Loan Agreement;170 (iii) the resolutions were in violation of the Bank Loan Agreement171; and (iv) no real value was contributed to LFO by these resolutions given that only the nominal value of LFO share capital was increased.172 The Claimants maintain that these resolutions were considered legal and were adopted on the basis of advice from Polish counsel to LFO.173\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 221.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 222.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 223.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 224.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 144(iv).\n\n**S. Payments by the State Treasury under the Consortium Surety Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe bankruptcy of LFO was declared on 26 June 2006 by the bankruptcy court in Tarnobrzeg.174 Subsequently, the financial institutions that were party to the Bank Loan Agreement unsuccessfully attempted to enforce their claims under the Bank Loan Agreement against LFO. These institutions subsequently requested payment from the State Treasury pursuant to the Bank Loan Agreement and the Consortium Surety Agreement.175 In 2006, Poland paid the surety for LFO to the financial institutions. The sums paid by Poland are as follows:176\n\n(i) PLN8,207,371.26 were paid to Kredyt Bank S.A. w Warszawie;\n\n(ii) PLN12,281,819.91 were paid to Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A.;\n\n(iii) PLN12,281,824.85 were paid to ING Bank Slaski S.A.;\n\n(iv) PLN12,272,095.78 were paid to Bank BPH S.A.;\n\n(v) PLN15,838,927.25 were paid to Bank Zachodni WBK S.A.\n\nThe total amount paid by the State Treasury appears to have been PLN60,882,039.05.177\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 231; Exhibit R-134.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 233; Exhibit R-135.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 233.\n\nThe Respondent in its Counter-Memorial at \u00b6 233 arrives at a total sum of PLN60,887,635.42, which however does not correspond to the total amount of the individual sums listed in (i)-(v) above.\n\n112.\n\nSpecial audit proceedings were also commenced by the Supreme Audit Chamber of the Republic of Poland. The aim of these proceedings was to inspect the regularity and legality of the acts and omissions of the Polish administration with respect to the LFO project.178 The Chamber issued a Report in early 2007.179\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6234.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 8; Request for Arbitration, Annex 7; Exhibit C-33.\n\n113.\n\nLFO was deleted from the commercial register in Poland in January 2012.180\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6231.\n\n**IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n----------------------\n\n114.\n\nAs stated above, the BIT on which the Claimants rely is annexed to this Award as Annex A. At the request of the Tribunal the parties jointly prepared a list of points upon which they wished to the Tribunal decide (the \"List\"). The List is attached to this Award as Annex B. The Tribunal will follow that List as a framework for the analysis in the Award, after some preliminary observations relating to questions of jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n**A. Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n-------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article IX of the U.S.-Poland BIT and the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Article IX of the U.S.-Poland BIT reads as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE IX.**\n\n**Settlement of Disputes Between a Party and an Investor of the Other Party**\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving (a) the interpretation or application of an investment agreement between a Party (including any agency or instrumentality of such Party) and a national or company of the other Party; (b) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by a Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment. A decision of a Party which denies entry of an investment shall not constitute an investment dispute within the meaning of this Article.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party procedures. Each Party shall encourage its nationals and companies to resort to local courts, especially for the resolution of disputes relating to administrative actions. Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, if the dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and negotiation, the dispute shall be submitted for settlement in accordance with previously agreed, applicable dispute-settlement procedures. Any dispute-settlement procedures, including those relating to expropriation, specified in the investment agreement shall remain binding and shall be enforceable in accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, relevant provisions of domestic laws and applicable international agreements regarding enforcement of arbitral awards.\n\n3. (a) At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by concilia~tion or binding arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") or to the Additional Facility of the Centre or pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL\") or pursuant to the arbitration rules of any arbitral institution mutually agree between the parties to the dispute. Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may institute such proceeding provided:\n\n(i) The dispute has not been submitted by the national or company for resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; and\n\n(ii) the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a party to the dispute. If the parties disagree over whether conciliation or binding arbitration is the more appropriate procedure to be employed, the opinion of the national or company concerned shall prevail.\n\n(b) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration:\n\n(i) To the Centre, in the event that the Republic of Poland becomes a party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"Convention\") and the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, and to the Additional Facility of the Centre, and\n\n(ii) to an arbitral tribunal established under the UNCITRAL Rules, as those Rules may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties to the dispute, the appointing authority referenced therein to be Secretary General of the Centre.\n\n(c) Conciliation or arbitration of disputes under (b) (i) shall be done applying the provisions of the Convention and the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, or of the Additional Facility as the case may be.\n\n(d) The place of any arbitration conducted under this Article shall be a country which is a party to the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.\n\n(e) Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any award resulting from an arbitration held in accordance with this Article. Further, each Party shall provide for the enforcement in its territory of such arbitral awards.\n\n4.181 In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party shall not assert, as defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the national or company concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages. However, to the extent that a Party succeeds to the rights or claims of the national or company concerned by reason of subrogation or assignment, the national or company concerned shall not continue to pursue such rights and claims in its own name unless authorized to do so on behalf of the subrogee or assignee.\n\n5. In the event of an arbitration, for the purposes of this Article any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of either Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party, in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\nParagraph 4 is incorrectly labelled paragraph 3 in the copy of the BIT published on the UNCTAD website, and in the copy of the BIT attached to the Claimants' Request.\n\n**(1) The 'investment'**\n------------------------\n\n116.\n\nAn \u2018investment' is defined in Article I(1)(b) of the BIT as \"every kind of investment, in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other party.\" It is also specified in Article I(1)(b) that \"a company or shares of stock\" and \"a claim to money\" are included within the definition.\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimants, whose U.S. nationality is not disputed, assert that their investment took the form of (i) equity shares in the Polish company LFO and (ii) loans to LFO, and that both shares and loans count as \u2018investments' within the meaning of the BIT. The Respondent asserts that the Claimants' shares did not represent an injection of cash, because amounts initially invested were withdrawn from the company and then returned to the company ostensibly as additional investments, in a manner that might be described as \u2018churning'.182 The Respondent's allegations in this regard were directed primarily at the activities of Mr Niziol.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 121-144, 183-184.\n\n118.\n\nFor the purposes of establishing its jurisdiction it is necessary that the Tribunal be satisfied that the Claimants made an investment in Poland. Monies paid by the Claimants to Mr Niziol or to another third party which were intended to be invested in Poland, in LFO, but which were not in fact so invested, are not investments by the Claimants in Poland.\n\n119.\n\nIt is clear, however, that the Respondent does accept that the Claimants made a substantial investment in LFO. In its Counter-Memorial it wrote:\n\nthe contemporary documents originating from LFO demonstrate that the Claimants contributed to LFO only USD 1,980,000 each (totalling 3,960,000 USD) [Fn. 1998.10.20 Letter to Kredyt Bank, Exhibit R-141] **.** The Claimants have not proven that they committed any more funds to the LFO Project, except for the loan agreement for USD 180,000, produced by the Claimants as Exhibit C-22.183\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6372. Respondent did not finally accept that the US$180,000 sum was a genuine loan: see Respondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6381.\n\n120.\n\nWhile the Respondent raises serious questions concerning the reality and validity of several transactions concerning monies transferred in connection with the establishment of LFO, those questions do not affect the fact that it is common ground that the Claimants did make a substantial investment in LFO.\n\n121.\n\nFor the purposes of establishing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims, it is sufficient that there was a real investment. The precise amount of that investment, or its value (which is a different thing), is not critical at this stage of the analysis, without prejudice to its significance when the merits are considered.\n\n**(2) The 'investment dispute'**\n--------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nArticle IX(1) of the U.S.-Poland BIT defines an investment dispute so as to include \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\" The claims in this case fall squarely within that definition.\n\n123.\n\nNotice of the claim was given by the Claimants by letter dated 24 March 2008.184 In that letter it was alleged that the Respondent had failed to treat the Claimants' investment fairly and equitably and without discrimination; and specific reference was made to Articles II(6) [fair and equitable treatment], II(8)(c) and(d) [non-discrimination], III(2)(c) and (d) [nondiscrimination] and III(3). Article III(3) is the broadest of those provisions and reads as follows:\n\nNationals and companies of each Party in the conduct of commercial activities shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law. Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the conduct of commercial activities. Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to the conduct of commercial activities.\n\nThose claims were developed in the Claimants' written pleadings.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 3; Exhibit C-35.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants' letter dated 24 March 2008, requested consultation and negotiation with the Respondent in accordance with Article IX(2) of the BIT.185\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 3; Exhibit C-35.\n\n125.\n\nArticle IX(2) of the BIT requires that the parties should seek initially to settle an investment dispute by consultation and negotiation. Article IX(3) provides that the national or company - *i.e*., the investor - may choose after six months from the date on which the dispute arose to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, provided that the dispute has not been submitted to any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures or to the courts or tribunals of the State Party to the dispute.\n\n126.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID on 14 September 2010 pursuant to Article 4 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, there having been no settlement of the dispute after its notification to the Respondent in the Claimants' letter dated 24 March 2008.186 By letter of September 7, 2010, the Claimants confirmed that they had not submitted the claims in this case to any other tribunal or court. The formal requirements set out in Article IX(2) of the BIT are accordingly met.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 3.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent argues, however, that the Tribunal nonetheless lacks jurisdiction because (i) the investment was tainted by fraud, and (ii) applying the *Oil Platforms* test,187 even if the Claimants' factual allegations are accepted as true they would not disclose any violation of the BIT. We address these points in turn.\n\nSee Judgment of the International Court of Justice in the *Oil Platforms case (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)* (Preliminary Objection) [1996] ICJ Rep 803, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 and *passim*, and also the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, \u00b6 32 and *passim*.\n\n**(3) Question 1. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute in the light of the Respondent's asserted defence based on allegations of fraud and deceit related to the LFO Project*****.***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the investment was from the outset tainted by fraud, deceit and bad faith, contrary not only to domestic Polish legislation but also to international public order, and that the Claimants were consequently deprived of a right to protection under the BIT and the Tribunal was accordingly deprived of jurisdiction.188 While arguing that it would be more efficient and reasonable to deal with this as a preliminary matter, the Respondent submitted in the alternative that if the Tribunal decided to address this point on the merits, it should at that stage dismiss the claims in their entirety for the same reasons.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6284-291; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 136-160.\n\n*Question 1: The Tribunal's analysis and decision*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe allegations of fraud, deceit and bad faith in this case are serious,189 but they are inextricably bound up with the merits of the case. It would not have been practical or efficient to deal with them as a preliminary matter at the hearing, and the Tribunal did not do so.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6119-184, 360-381.\n\n130.\n\nThe practicalities of organizing and making best use of the hearing do not, however, predetermine the content or juridical character of decisions set out in the Award. Having heard and considered all of the evidence, the Tribunal could in principle have decided that the correct legal analysis required it, in this Award, to treat those allegations as a matter going to the question of its jurisdiction rather than to the merits of the claims. Again, however, the Tribunal has decided that the allegations do not have that character.\n\n131.\n\nThe BIT in this case does not define an \u2018investment' in terms that explicitly require the investment to be made in accordance with the host State's law.190 Nonetheless, it is now generally accepted that investments made on the basis of fraudulent conduct cannot benefit from BIT protection; and this is a principle that is independent of the effect of any express requirement in a BIT that the investment be made in accordance with the host State's law.191 In previous cases, as the *Abaclat* Tribunal noted,192 some tribunals have treated arguments based on fraud, etc, as going to jurisdiction or admissibility,193 while others have treated them as arguments going to the merits.194\n\nU.S.-Poland BIT Article 1(1)(b). In contrast, there is a reference to permission and treatment \"in accordance with [the host State's] relevant laws and regulations\" in Article II(1) of the BIT.\n\nSee, e.g., *Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26), Award, 2 August 2006 (\"Inceysa\"), \u00b6\u00b6 230-244, where the Tribunal appears to treat fraud as a matter going to jurisdiction (because States cannot be supposed to have intended to give investments made fraudulently the benefit of BIT protection), and to admissibility (because no claimant can benefit from his own fraud), on grounds that are independent of the wording of the BIT. The *Inceysa* Tribunal also regarded claims in respect of fraudulent investments as barred by international public policy and by the principle of unjust enrichment.\n\n*Abaclat and others (Case formerly known as Giovanna a Beccara and others) v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5), Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2011 (\"Abaclat\"), \u00b6648.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award, 15 April 2009 (\"Phoenix Action\").\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Award, 6 May 2013 (\"Rompetrol\"), *Aguas del Tunari S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3), Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005 (\"Aguas del Tunari\"), *Chevron Bangladesh Block Twelve, Ltd. and Chevron Bangladesh Blocks Thirteen and Fourteen, Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/10), Award, 17 May 2010 (\"Chevron\"), *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey (* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20), Award, 14 July 2010 (\"Saba Fakes\").\n\n132.\n\nThere may be circumstances where fraud is so manifest, and so closely connected to facts (such as the making of an investment) which form the basis of a tribunal's jurisdiction as to warrant a dismissal of claims *in limine* for want of jurisdiction. This situation is, however, likely to be exceptional; and it is not the situation in the present case.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal, having heard the evidence and the points adduced by both parties in relation to the allegations of fraud, deceit and bad faith, has decided that the circumstances in which that investment were made are far from displaying such manifest fraud or other defects as to warrant the conclusion that the Claimants must be denied the benefit of the dispute settlement procedure under the BIT, and so denied any further consideration of the merits of their claims.\n\n134.\n\nIn this case it is not alleged that there was any manifest violation of Polish law, or that the Claimants, Mr Minnotte and Mr Lewis, themselves had actual knowledge of the facts that are alleged to prove that there was fraudulent conduct in the initial making and conduct of the investment. The serious allegations made by the Respondent are primarily directed at Mr Niziol.\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent did not put forward evidence of deliberate fraud on the part of the Claimants in the initial making and conduct of the investment, although it did take the position that by virtue of their role in LFO they could and should have been aware of the nature of the allegedly fraudulent transactions.195 In other words, the Respondent's case is in this respect based essentially upon the alleged negligence of the Claimants.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6240-242.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Respondent had many dealings with and related to LFO prior to the initiation of this arbitration, without manifesting any concern that the investment had been improperly made.\n\n137.\n\nThe question is thus whether this Tribunal's jurisdiction is vitiated by reason of the alleged negligent failure of the Claimants to investigate the factual circumstances surrounding the making of their investment. The Tribunal considers that it is not.\n\n138.\n\nWhile the Claimants' conduct can certainly bear upon the question whether they can benefit from the BIT protections as a matter of the merits of this case, the Tribunal does not consider that the actual terms of the BIT in this case deny them access to a tribunal to have the merits of their claims heard.\n\n139.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider that any principle of international law, such as the principle *ex turpi causa non oritur actio* (assuming, *arguendo*, that principle to have the status of a rule of international law), would bar its jurisdiction in the case of the Claimants whose connection with an alleged fraud consists in a negligent failure to make inquiries which might (or might not) have unearthed evidence of fraud.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that the allegations of fraud, deceit and bad faith in relation to the investment made by the Respondent in this case do not warrant the dismissal of the claims on the basis that the claims do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Nor does the Tribunal consider that the grounds raised by the Respondent would warrant a decision that the claims are inadmissible. The Tribunal will consider the allegations of impropriety in the context of the merits of this case.\n\n**(4) Question 2. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute under the** ***Oil Platforms*** **test.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent argues that even if the Claimants' factual allegations are assumed to be true, the claims do not in any event disclose any violation of the U.S.-Poland BIT: i.e., the claims fail to meet the *Oil Platforms* test.196\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 266-283 and Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6168-170.\n\n*Question 2: The Tribunal's analysis and decision*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent itself sets out certain propositions advanced by the Claimants but asserts that they are easily answered or are without merit.197\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6270-272.\n\n143.\n\nThe *Oil Platforms* test, applied by tribunals in cases such as *Impregilo v. Pakistan*,198 requires the tribunal to ask, not whether the claims *do* disclose violations of the treaty, but rather whether the claims are *capable* of amounting to violations of the treaty on the basis of the facts alleged by the claimant, so that the tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain those claims.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 237-254.\n\n144.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal has no doubt that, whatever the force of the points that the Respondent might make in reply, the claims in the present case are capable of disclosing violations of the BIT. That is evident from the submissions in the Claimants' Memorial, in which the Claimants allege, for example, that the Respondent acted \"arbitrarily and without justification\" in refusing to provide LFO with plasma.199\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 51-88.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly is not deprived by the *Oil Platforms* test of its jurisdiction to determine whether or not the Claimants have made out their case.\n\n**(5) Other matters relating to jurisdiction and admissibility**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nTwo other matters relating to questions of jurisdiction and admissibility were raised during the proceedings. Although they were resolved, it is desirable for the sake of good order that they be recorded in this Award.\n\n147.\n\nFirst, during the initial stages of this arbitration, the Respondent raised a question as to whether or not Mr Robert Lewis was himself to be regarded as a party to the proceedings.200 He had previously granted a power of attorney to Mr Minnotte authorizing him to act as Mr Lewis' agent for the pursuit of this claim, and had not withdrawn that power of attorney; but both Mr Minnotte and Mr Lewis were present at the hearing.201\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 246, 249-265; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6133-135.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, p. 2; see above, footnote 1.\n\n148.\n\nAt the hearing, in the presence of Mr Lewis and Mr Minnotte, it was made unequivocally clear that Mr Lewis is himself a Claimant in these proceedings, with all the rights and obligations of a Party.202 The Respondent withdrew its jurisdictional objection relating to Mr Lewis.203\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 2-4.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, p. 96.\n\n149.\n\nSecond, the Respondent objected to certain specific claims made by the Claimants concerning the conduct of criminal proceedings in Poland.204 The Claimants subsequently withdrew those claims, without prejudice to the possibility of raising them in a separate proceeding.205 The Tribunal therefore determined that those claims lay outside the scope of the present proceedings, although the Claimants were at liberty to make an application to amend the claims in this case so as to include them. No such application was made.206\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 292-305.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 14-15.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 35-36; Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, p. 96.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal is further of the view that the other jurisdictional requirements set forth in the ICSID Additional Facility Rules are also fulfilled in this case, namely:\n\na) There is a legal dispute between a national of an ICSID Contracting State and a State party which is not an ICSID Contracting State, which arises directly out of an investment in accordance with Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules. Messrs Minnotte and Lewis are nationals of the U.S., which is an ICSID Contracting State, while the Republic of Poland is not an ICSID Contracting State. As discussed above, the Tribunal is of the view that Messrs Minnotte and Lewis have made an investment for the purposes of the BIT and hence for the purposes of Articles 4(2) and 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules. Further, the parties disagree about whether the Republic of Poland complied with its obligations under the BIT vis-\u00e0-vis LFO. Therefore, a legal dispute exists between the parties which arises directly out of an investment.\n\nb) The parties have consented in writing to ICSID Additional Facility arbitration.207 The Respondent's advance consent is contained in Article IX of the BIT, the prerequisites of which are fulfilled, and the Claimants' consent is contained in the Request for Arbitration. Further, approval of access to the Additional Facility was granted by the ICSID Secretary-General on September 14, 2010.\n\nIn accordance with Article 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules, the parties also consented to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (in lieu of the Additional Facility) in the event that the Republic of Poland would have become a Contracting State at the time when proceedings were instituted.\n\n**(6) Conclusion on jurisdiction and admissibility**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that it has jurisdiction to consider the Claimants' claims within the scope of the present proceedings, and that those claims are admissible.\n\n**B. Merits**\n-------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Joint List of Points set out a series of questions, there numbered 3 - 8, which covers the Claimant's case. The Tribunal will answer each in turn.\n\n**(1) Question 3. Whether the Claimants' claims should be dismissed on the merits because of the Respondent's defence based on allegations of fraud and deceit related to the LFO Project?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nIt was noted above208 that the Respondent had argued that the Claimants were not entitled to the protection of the BIT because the investment was made in circumstances tainted by fraud and deceit.209\n\nSee paragraphs 128-140, above.\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 284-291, and Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 136-160, 171; Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, pp. 97-106.\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimants did not accept that there had been any impropriety associated with the making of the investment. Further, they suggest that if there were any impropriety it was not their responsibility. Indeed, the Claimants submitted that the Respondent's failure to inform the Claimants in timely fashion of the factual basis for any such impropriety would amount to a further failure by the Respondent to treat the Claimants and their investment fairly and equitably.210\n\nSee *e.g.,* Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 143, 144.\n\n*Question 3: The Tribunal's analysis and decision*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThere are several aspects of this case that prick the curiosity of the observer. The details and purposes of the money transfers associated with the making of the investment are one; the circumstances of the Polish authorities' apparent abandonment in Switzerland of millions of dollars' worth of immunoglobulin derived from Polish blood collections is another. For better or worse, this Tribunal has a limited responsibility and limited powers. It is not an investigative body; and it has not pursued these questions any further than is necessary for the fulfilment of its responsibilities.\n\n156.\n\nAs far as this Tribunal is concerned, the critical question at this stage in its analysis is not whether any fraud or deception occurred, but rather whether, within the framework of these proceedings, it is proved that there was fraud and / or deception of such a kind as to disentitle the Claimants to the protection of the BIT for their investment.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted in the context of its discussion of questions of jurisdiction and admissibility that the definition of an investment in Article I.1(b) of the BIT does not contain an express requirement that the investment be made \"in accordance with the laws [of the host State]\". It has also noted that the Respondent does not directly accuse the Claimants themselves of deliberate fraud or deceit in the making or initial conduct of the investment, but only of negligence.211 The Tribunal concluded in that context that the Respondent's allegations of fraud and deceit were not of such a nature as to exclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or to render the claims inadmissible.\n\nSee above, paragraphs 134-135.\n\n158.\n\nMoving the analysis forward to the next step, the Tribunal now considers whether, having decided that the Claimants' claims are within its jurisdiction and admissible, they should be dismissed on the merits because of the Respondent's defence based on allegations of fraud and deceit related to the LFO Project.\n\n159.\n\nThis question might be approached in two ways. It might be asked whether the investment itself is tainted by fraud, so as to deprive it of the benefit of protection under the BIT. Alternatively, it might be asked whether the investors are tainted by fraud, so as to disentitle them from the benefit of protection under the BIT for their investment.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal must apply the specific terms of the U.S.-Poland BIT. While one of the provisions invoked by the Claimants - Article II(6) - refers to a duty to accord fair and equitable treatment, etc, to \"investments\", the other provisions invoked - Articles II(8)(c) and (d), III(2)(c) and (d), and III(3) - refer to the treatment to be accorded to \"nationals and companies of each Party\".\n\n161.\n\nThus, for instance, it is \"nationals and companies of each Party\" that are protected against treatment that is not \"fair and equitable\", by Article III(3). The Tribunal does not consider that a claimant can be altogether denied the protection of the BIT in respect of treatment that is alleged to be unfair or inequitable by reason of the conduct of some person other than the claimant. Such a bar would be incompatible with the very idea of fair and equitable treatment of the claimant.\n\n162.\n\nThough one provision of the U.S.-Poland BIT - Article II(6) - is phrased in terms that protect \"investments\" rather than \"investors\", that does not materially affect the Claimants' position, because substantially the same rights as are secured by Article II(6) for investments are also secured for investors by Article III(3).\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that there is any warrant in international law for denying altogether the protection of a bilateral investment treaty such as the one applicable in the present case, in every case where the claimant has been negligent in respect of the detection of wrongdoing that is alleged to have accompanied the making of the investment. It is, however, entirely possible that the conduct of a third party, or a claimant's negligence, may justify specific conduct of a respondent that could in other circumstances amount to a violation of the BIT. There may be circumstances in which the deliberate closing of eyes to evidence of serious misconduct or crime, or an unreasonable failure to perceive such evidence, would indeed vitiate a claim; but the Tribunal does not consider that the proven facts provide sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that such circumstances existed in the present case.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that the particular allegations made by the Respondent of fraud and deceit, not being allegations made against the Claimants themselves, and the allegations of negligence made against the Claimants, are not of such a nature as entirely to deprive the Claimants of the benefit of the protections of the U.S.-Poland BIT for their investment in this case. It will consider in the following paragraphs whether the facts underlying those allegations justify some or all of the conduct of the Respondent towards the Claimants' investment.\n\n**(2) Question 4. Whether the Respondent directly or indirectly expropriated the Claimants' investment (direct expropriation) or the value thereof (indirect expropriation) in violation of the U.S.-Poland BIT by:**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4.1. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO's line of credit, based on the Claimants' allegation that this led to acceleration of the loan repayment and Kredyt Bank's motion to institute LFO's bankruptcy proceedings?**\n\n**4.2. Alleged failure to supply blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement?**\n\n**4.3 Alleged action by Respondent, through the Institute of Haematology inducing CSL to back out of the LFO Project?**\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that the Respondent expropriated the Claimants' investment, because it finds that the facts proven in this case do not support such a claim.\n\n*a. Question 4.1.: Kredyt Bank.*\n--------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent improperly brought pressure upon Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO's line of credit, in order to force the failure of the LFO project.\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the communications with Kredyt Bank were motivated solely by the desire to protect its position as guarantor, in accordance with normal commercial practice, and to fulfil its responsibilities as the custodian of public finances.\n\n168.\n\nThe documentary evidence submitted as Exhibit C-17 certainly shows that the Ministry of Finance Guarantee Department expressed \"concern at the deterioration of economic and financial situation of \u2018Laboratorium Frakcjonowania Osocza' sp. S o.o.\" and at delays that \"may shortly lead to the Company's loss of credit capacity, and at \"inadequate security of the investment credit\".212 That concern was, however, expressly placed in the context of \"the Guarantee Agreement of 1 July 1997 concluded between the Minister of Finance and Kredyt Bank PBI S.A.\" and the \"reliability of the Bank supervision over utilization of the State-Treasury guaranteed credit given to [LFO]\".213 In other words, the Ministry was seeking to protect its position, and fulfil its responsibilities, as a public authority that had provided a credit guarantee for LFO.214\n\nLetter dated 24 December 1998, Exhibit C-17-A. For the guarantee arrangement, see paragraph [44] above.\n\nLetter dated 24 December 1998, Exhibit C-17-A.\n\nThe role of Respondent as guarantor is described in the report of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Audit Nos. I/05/014, I/05/017, I/06/023, File No. 7/2007/I05014/I05017/I06023/LRZ (February 2007), Exhibit C-33.\n\n169.\n\nKredyt Bank replied to the Ministry's letter of 24 December 1998 with a brusque but reasonably detailed letter dated 5 February 1999.215 That letter indicated that its author had a low opinion of the Ministry's ability to understand the workings of the Guarantee Agreement, though that opinion was not substantiated by any facts. The letter was written in memorably robust terms, which give no indication that Kredyt Bank either understood itself to be under pressure to cut off LFO's credit or, had it felt itself under such pressure, that it would have done so.\n\nExhibit C-17-B.\n\n170.\n\nOn 4 August 2000 the Ministry of Finance wrote again to Kredyt Bank, drawing attention to certain irregularities in the operations of LFO discovered in the course of an official audit, including the issuance of allegedly forged and fictitious invoices.216 Kredyt Bank's reply, dated 28 August 2000, responded in some detail to the Ministry's letter and indicated that Kredyt Bank had, in the course of its monitoring of LFO, found no evidence of such irregularities.217\n\nExhibit C-17-C.\n\nExhibit C-17-D.\n\n171.\n\nThere is no evidence that indicates that the Respondent's dealings with Kredyt Bank were motivated by anything other than a legitimate concern to protect its position as a guarantor and fulfil its responsibilities as an accountable user of public funds. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent's explanation of its conduct in relation to the Kredyt Bank issue. The Tribunal has relied here upon contemporaneous evidence, but it notes also the account (which is relevant to all of the findings on the merits) given in 2002 by the Minister of Health to the Secretary of the Committee of the Council of Ministers.218 The Tribunal accordingly finds that there is no evidence that the Respondent brought improper pressure upon Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO's line of credit.\n\nLetter dated 7 February 2002, Exhibit R-115.\n\n*b. Question 4.2.* : *Supply* of Plasma.\n----------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal has approached the question of the supply of plasma pursuant to the 1997 Fractionation Agreement bearing in mind that the LFO project involved several phases or aspects, including (a) the testing of LFO's processes and products, (b) the registering of LFO's processes and products as drugs for use in Poland, and (c) obtaining authorizations from the Respondent to register and use its processes and sell its products to the Respondent in Poland. These phases are distinguished as a matter of fact: the 1997 Fractionation Agreement does not itself distinguish between the supply of plasma for different phases or purposes.\n\n173.\n\nIt is common ground that blood plasma was not in fact supplied under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement for the purpose of testing the fractionating process through trials to be conducted abroad before the factory in Poland was completed. The question in the context of this claim is whether the Respondent was under any duty to supply the plasma in such circumstances and improperly refused to do so.\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent was under a duty to supply plasma for testing purposes on demand,219 which it did not fulfil,220 and that the failure to deliver the samples for testing caused delays which led to the failure of the project. The Respondent denies that there was any such duty, and denies that the non-delivery caused the failure of the project.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 66-67.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 64.\n\n175.\n\nAs far as the existence of the duty is concerned, the 1997 Fractionation Agreement221 contains no provision that addresses the question of the supply of plasma for testing abroad, and the Tribunal finds no basis for implying such a term into the contract. Article 3.4 of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement provides that LFO (there described as \u2018PFL') \"shall carry out the registration of the products in accordance with the regulations in force\", but says nothing about the supply of plasma for that purpose or about the schedule according to which registration would be secured.\n\nExhibit C-13.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants' argument that an obligation to supply plasma for testing purposes was created by Article 4.1 of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.222 That provision required the Ministry to \"ensure that the organizational actions are taken for the supplying of plasma to PFL by organizational units of the public blood service\" in the minimum amount of 150,000 litres per year. The obligation in Article 4.1 lasted throughout the 15-year life of the Fractionation Agreement set by Article 5.1, and is plainly a general provision guaranteeing minimum supplies for fractionation, in what was described as \"a framework agreement setting forth the cooperation between the ministry and the company\".223 It is silent on the specific question of the supply of plasma for testing purposes.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 93 -105.\n\nSee Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 16 April 2013, p. 91.\n\n177.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the express terms of Article 4.1 cannot be construed as requiring the Respondent to deliver plasma for the purposes of pre-production testing, either on demand or by any given date. The Tribunal notes that a contractual term that would have imposed such a duty was included in a draft of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement but was not included in the agreed final text of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.224\n\nArticle 4.1.c of the draft, Exhibit R-158; cf., Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, p. 83.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent had monopoly control over the supply of Polish plasma225 (but not over all plasma; and non-Polish plasma could be and was used for the initial stage of the testing).226 It is certainly arguable that the Respondent was obliged to supply Polish plasma at some stage for testing purposes. That conclusion is at least arguably necessary in order to give the 1997 Fractionation Agreement practical effect: at some stage LFO had to obtain Polish plasma for testing from somewhere. But the Claimants' case requires more than that.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, p. 107; Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, pp. 8, 33-34.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 16 April 2013, p. 93.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent wrongfully failed to deliver the plasma when it was demanded; but the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have not shown that there was any legal obligation to supply the plasma on demand and have not shown that the failure to deliver it in 1998 or 1999 was wrongful. Furthermore, the Respondent pointed to the possibility of different scenarios for testing and registration of plasma products, which could have avoided the need for the pre-production delivery of plasma for testing prior to the completion of the construction of the plant.227\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, pp. 82-86.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches this conclusion without the need to explore the question whether, if there had been such an obligation, any failure by the Respondent to deliver supplies of plasma might have been justified in the light of LFO's own conduct.228\n\nSee, *e.g*., Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 136-137.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered whether there was an obligation that arose otherwise than by contract: for example, through the creation by the Respondent of legitimate expectations on which the Claimants were entitled to rely. Though Mr Niziol suggested in his testimony that it had reasonably been assumed or understood that plasma supplies would be provided by the Respondent on request for testing abroad, the Tribunal does not regard this as proven or supported by the evidence before it. No evidence of the Respondent making any specific commitment to supply plasma on demand or at any specific time for testing can be found.\n\n182.\n\nThere is also a factual point to be made. As far as the alleged breach of a duty to supply the plasma for testing is concerned, while there is evidence that LFO communicated to the Respondent its readiness to receive plasma samples and its plans to process them, there appears to be no documentary evidence of any clear request that the Respondent deliver those samples before 1999.229\n\nSee Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 16 April 2013, pp. 9-97; Exhibits C-15, C-16.\n\n183.\n\nArticle 3.2 and Article 6.2 of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement required that requests for the supply of plasma be made once during each (calendar) year, before June 30th of the preceding (financial) year. There is no clear request prior to 30 June 1998. The letter dated 20 April 1998230 is not a request for plasma: it is a statement - a report - of the activities of LFO. Mr Niziol testified that he had requested plasma;231 but it is not until the year preceding 30 June 1999 in the documentary record that actual requests (even then couched in somewhat oblique language) are made for the delivery of the plasma to LFO for testing.232\n\nExhibit C-15.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, pp. 95-96.\n\nSee Exhibit C-16 C-F.\n\n184.\n\nIn these circumstances, and in particular in light of the absence of proof of any specific legal obligation to deliver plasma for testing abroad before the completion of the plant in Poland (let alone, to deliver it by any particular date), the Tribunal is unable to find that the Respondent acted improperly in not delivering plasma samples for testing in Australia. It accordingly rejects the claim that the non-delivery of plasma for testing was conduct that could support a finding that the Claimants' property had been expropriated.\n\n185.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that it is not proven that the Respondent was acting in breach of any legal duty in not delivering plasma to LFO for testing abroad, and that nothing in the circumstances of the non-delivery provides a basis upon which a claim that the Respondent had expropriated the Claimants' property, in violation of the BIT, could be built.\n\n*c. Question 4.3.: CSL's Withdrawal from the project.*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe evidence in this case is insufficient to yield a complete explanation of the circumstances in which, and the reasons for which, CSL withdrew from the project and, in particular, eventually failed to supply LFO with the necessary licences. The Claimants say that CSL was induced or pressured by the Respondent to withdraw from the arrangement with LFO.233 The Respondent denies that allegation, for which it says there is no evidence.234\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b611, 15.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 102-111,\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants have not pointed to any actual evidence that CSL was induced or pressured by the Respondent to withdraw from the arrangement with LFO. They rest their case on inferences drawn from the fact that CSL's withdrawal was followed by its subsequent entry into an advantageous arrangement with ZLB and the Institute of Haematology.235\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 69-70; and see paragraph 90 above.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that there is no evidence in the record that warrants the conclusion that CSL was induced or pressured by the Respondent to withdraw from the arrangement with LFO. It notes that Mr Niziol's Reply Witness Statement puts forward the view that \"CSL was just using LFO to gain access to the Polish plasma market, which access it then exploited when it secretly acquired ZLB.\"236 That suggests what counsel for the Claimants described as the \"very cold, very hard business decision\" by CSL to pull out of its arrangement with LFO.237 Similarly, the suggestion that CSL pulled out because the Respondent was \"blowing hot and cold at the same time toward the LFO project\"238 points to a withdrawal prompted by CSL's commercial judgement rather than engineered by or in collusion with the Respondent.\n\nAt p. 9.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, p. 41.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, p. 57, and cf., p. 69.\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that the allegation that the Respondent induced or pressured CSL to withdraw from its arrangement with LFO is not proven as a matter of fact.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal having found against the Claimants on the facts in relation to this part (i.e., the part addressed in question 4.3) of the claim, there is no basis upon which the claim that the Respondent's conduct constituted expropriation can be built. It is not necessary to decide the question whether the facts as alleged by the Claimants would have amounted to an expropriation contrary to the U.S.-Poland BIT if they had been proved.\n\n**(3) Question 5. Whether the Respondent violated its obligations to the Claimants under the fair and equitable treatment standard of the U.S.-Poland BIT, because of:**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**5.1. Alleged failures to meet legitimate expectations of the Claimants related to their investment;**\n\n**5.2. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO's line of credit;**\n\n**5.3. Alleged failure to supply blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement;**\n\n**5.4 Alleged interference with CSL; and/or**\n\n**5.5 Alleged interference with the Octapharma contract.**\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal's determinations in relation to Questions 1, 2 and 3, above, are applicable also in this context.\n\n*a. Question* 5*.1.: Legitimate Expectations.*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants rely upon representations by Government officials that the Claimants say showed that the Polish Government was \"fully supportive of LFO and its principal, Zygmunt Niziol.\"239 The Respondent says that \"legitimate expectations must be created in a specific and unambiguous manner\", and that this has not been shown by the Claimants.240\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 61; cf., Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, p. 48.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 17 April 2013, p. 116.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal must decide on the basis of the evidence before it. While there may, arguably, be a general expectation that States will observe basic standards such as reasonable consistency and transparency, more specific expectations must be specifically created and proved. In the present case, the Claimants allege that there was a legitimate expectation that the Respondent would provide blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.241 As was noted above,242 however, the Claimants need to show, not merely that there was a legitimate expectation that blood plasma would be provided, but more precisely that there was a legitimate expectation that it would be provided on demand or at a specific time for the purposes of testing abroad prior to the completion of the fractionation facility in Poland.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 159.\n\nAbove, paragraph 181.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants and LFO may have hoped or expected that this would be the case; but there is no documentary, or specific evidential, support for that expectation. This is not merely a question of the form in which the evidence is presented. In the present case, the specific removal from the draft Fractionation Agreement of the explicit obligation concerning the supply of plasma for testing purposes243 created a situation in which LFO, that is, an international business operator, deemed to be a competent professional - should have taken some step to obtain reassurance that the supply would be made as LFO wished. In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants' inability to point to any such reassurance weighs heavily against the claim that LFO had a legitimate expectation upon which they could rely concerning the circumstances in which they could require the supply of plasma for testing purposes, prior to completion of the plant.\n\nSee above, paragraph 177.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered whether the alleged treatment of Kredyt Bank or CSL by the Respondent interfered with any legitimate expectations of the Claimants or LFO. For the reasons stated in response to Question 4, the Tribunal has decided that there is no evidence that the Respondent conducted itself improperly in its dealings with Kredyt Bank or CSL, and accordingly finds that there is no basis for a claim that those dealings defeated any legitimate expectations of the Claimants.\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not shown that they had any legitimate expectations that were defeated by the conduct of the Respondent.\n\n*b. Other claims in relation to 5.2.: Kredyt Bank; 5.3.: Supply of Plasma; 5.4.: CSL.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe question whether the treatment by the Respondent of Kredyt Bank, or of the supply of plasma for testing purposes, or its alleged dealings with CSL, violated the duty of fair and equitable treatment is distinct from (and broader than) the question whether that treatment defeated any of the Claimants' legitimate expectations. In each of those three contexts the Tribunal has already found that the Respondent did not act in a manner that violated any specific obligations by which it was bound to the Claimants and LFO.\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the approach to the interpretation of the duty of fair and equitable treatment adopted by tribunals in cases such as *Waste Management, Myers, Lauder, Saluka* and *TecMed.*244 While the precise formulations of the fair and equitable treatment standard in these, and other, awards differ, they all have in common the notion that the State must be shown to have acted delinquently in some way or other if it is to be held to have violated that standard. It is not enough that a claimant should find itself in an unfortunate position as a result of all of its dealings with a respondent.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. Mexico* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3), Award, 30 April 2004, \u00b6 98 (\"Waste Management\"); *S.D. Myers v. Canada*, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 134 *et seq.*. (\"Myers\"); *Lauder (US) v. Czech Republic,* Final Award, 3 September 2001 (\"Lauder\"); *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 298 & 309 (\"Saluka\"); *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2), Award, 29 May 2003, 1 154 (\"Tecmed\"); see also Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 56, 58, 71; Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6 155.\n\n199.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal can find no evidence that the Respondent acted unlawfully, or that it exercised its rights for an improper purpose or in an improper manner. The Tribunal notes that there were long delays in responding to letters from LFO.245 While those delays may have been inappropriate, they are not of a nature to amount to a violation of its obligations under the BIT. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not made out their claim that the Respondent acted in a manner that was unfair or inequitable.\n\nSee paragraphs 80-81, above.\n\n*c. Question 5.5.: Octapharma.*\n-------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe same conclusion is true of the Respondent's dealings with Octapharma. The Claimants alleged that Octapharma was induced by the Institute of Haematology to cancel its contracts with LFO.246 The Tribunal has considered the evidence carefully, but can find no evidence of conduct towards Octapharma, attributable to the Respondent, that would breach the fair and equitable treatment standard or any other BIT provision. In particular, the Tribunal is unable to find evidence that Octapharma was induced by the Institute of Haematology to cancel its contracts with LFO.\n\nClaimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, pp. 71-72.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Claimants have not shown any breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard of the U.S.-Poland BIT.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered whether the facts might evidence a violation of any other U.S.-Poland BIT provision invoked by the Claimants,247 such as the provision on arbitrary and discriminatory measures in Article III(3), and has concluded that they do not.\n\nSee above, paragraph 123.\n\n**(4) Question 6.Whether the Respondent violated the \u2018umbrella clause' provision in the U.S.-Poland BIT because of the alleged failure to supply blood plasma to LFO under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe last sentence of paragraph 6 of Article II of the BIT provides that \"Each [State] Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\" It is an example of a so-called \"umbrella clause\". The Tribunal has decided that the Claimants have not shown that there was any legal obligation to supply the plasma on demand and have not shown that the failure to deliver it in 1998 or 1999 was wrongful.248 It follows that there can be no violation of the umbrella clause even if (which the Tribunal does not decide) the umbrella clause were in principle applicable in this context.\n\nSee above, paragraph 179.\n\n**(5) Question 7. Whether the Respondent's allegations concerning the Claimants' negligence with respect to the LFO project are well-founded and what relevance the alleged negligence may have on the outcome of the case?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's determination that no breach of the Claimants' rights under the BIT has been established, there is no need to provide an answer to Question 7 in order to decide this case. Nonetheless, the Tribunal thinks it right to state clearly that it has found no evidence of any deliberate wrongdoing by the Claimants.\n\n205.\n\nThe full facts underlying this claim may never be known, but it is evident that the Claimants relied to a remarkable degree upon their trust in their Polish associates, and in particular Mr Niziol. They were unable to speak Polish, and apparently relied upon the accounts given by others of the many papers and conversations concerning LFO that were, naturally, in Polish. It is difficult to see how they could, by so doing, exercise any effective oversight of the company of the kind for which their positions on the management board of LFO made them responsible. It is unclear precisely what they understood to be the reasons for, and effects of, transactions such as the 2002 resolutions, which dramatically altered the position of the company's creditors;249 but whatever the truth may be it cannot affect the outcome of this case or the Tribunal's decisions on the list of questions put to it; and the Tribunal pursues the matter no further.\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 219-227.\n\n206.\n\nIt is tempting to conclude, with hindsight, that the Claimants trusted too much, and perhaps overestimated the extent to which their previous commercial successes demonstrated a level of business acumen sufficient to overcome the obstacles of operating in a foreign country, in a foreign language, and within a foreign legal and administrative system.\n\n**(6) Question 8. What is the evidentiary effect of Decision No. 117/PG/2002 of October 2, 2002 of the Ministry of Economy that the \"main reason for the delay in completion of the investment project was the failure of the Ministry of Health to perform the 1 October 1997 agreement on cooperation with regard to the supply of plasma and collection of finished products health serviceestablishments?\"250**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is an evidential question which logically precedes the Tribunal's finding on the law. But it figures in this position in the Parties' joint list of issues which might require determination; and it is convenient to deal with it here.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Decision No. 117/PG/2002 of October 2, 2002 of the Ministry of Economy (the \"Decision\")251 says that the reason the LFO project had not been completed up until that time was not the fault of the principals of LFO, and that this decision is binding on the Respondent.252\n\nExhibit C-73\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Transcript, 15 April 2013, p. 73; Claimants' Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 140-141.\n\n208.\n\nThat Decision related to the permit under which LFO was allowed to operate in the Special Economic Zone \u2018Euro-Park' Mielec,253 with the various tax advantages which that entailed.254 The permit had expired because the conditions set out in Clause II of the permit, which included the commencement of economic activity at the facility by 31 December 2001, had not been met by LFO. The Decision extended the 2001 deadline until 30 June 2003.\n\nPermit No. 44, Exhibit R-19.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b63(v).\n\n209.\n\nThe extension was based on the finding by the Minister of Economy that \"the circumstances which led to the entrepreneur's failure to meet the terms of the Permit were beyond his control.\"255 LFO had \"pointed out that the main reason for the delay in the completion of the investment project was the failure of the Ministry of Health to perform the 1 October 1997 agreement on cooperation with regard to the supply of plasma and collection of finished products by health service establishments.\" The Decision does not, however, make any explicit determination of the proper interpretation of the contractual obligations under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement: it rests on the finding that the delay was beyond the control of LFO.\n\nExhibit C-73.\n\n210.\n\nMoreover, the Decision records that \"By its letter of September 18, 2002, the entrepreneur added that Court proceedings aimed at reaching a settlement with the Minister of Health are currently underway.\"256 That indicates the existence of a subsisting legal dispute concerning the 1997 Fractionation Agreement.\n\nExhibit C-73. LFO's legal advisor had also taken the position, in a letter dated 26 June 2002, that \"interpretation of these provisions [of the agreement between the parties] is subject to a dispute\": Exhibit C- 71.\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider the Decision of the Minister of Economy on the extension of the deadlines under the Special Economic Zone permit to be a decision (much less, a reasoned decision by a competent judicial authority), whether explicit or implicit, on the interpretation of the terms of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. Neither can it be said to give rise to an estoppel, for there is no evidence that the Claimants or LFO relied on the statement in question, whether to their detriment or at all. The Tribunal has considered the Decision as a part of the factual matrix in this case, but has given it no dispositive or authoritative weight on the question of the interpretation of Respondent's duties arising from the 1997 Fractionation Agreement. The Tribunal's reasoning on the 1997 Agreement is set out above.\n\n**(7) Question 9. On the condition that the Tribunal holds that the Respondent violated its obligations towards the Claimants under the Treaty, what amount of damages the Claimants are entitled to, if any?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal has held that the Respondent did not violate its obligations towards the Claimants under the Treaty. Question 9 does not arise.\n\n**(8) Question 10. How should the costs of the proceedings be allocated between the parties?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nArticle 58 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules provides in that \"[u]nless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne.\"\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal does not question that the claims in this case were initiated and presented in good faith. It does, however, note that (i) the Tribunal has found that the Claimants did not establish any breach of the BIT by the Respondent, (ii) it was evident from the outset that a good deal of weight was placed on inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence, and (iii) the Respondent was put to the burden of producing a good deal of documentary evidence, and refuting the Claimants' arguments, in relation to allegations of wrongdoing for which the Claimants had little or no evidence.\n\n215.\n\nThe cost of the arbitration, which includes, *inter alia*, the arbitrators' fees, the expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretariat's fees and expenses and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, amount to US$573,380.12.257\n\nThis amount consists of the arbitration costs at the time of the Award (i.e., US$573,247.07), and estimated charges of US$133.05 for the costs to be incurred in connection with the dispatch of the Award (*e.g.*, costs related to courier services, binding, and photocopying). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement as soon all invoices are received and the account is final. The balance remaining in the case account will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n216.\n\nPursuant to Article 58(1) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, the Tribunal has decided to apply the principle that costs should follow the event and that the Claimants should bear (i) all the ICSID arbitration costs and expenses, (ii) reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in the preparation of its legal case, and (iii) their own costs and expenses. The Tribunal has decided further that the costs and expenses stated in the Respondent's letter dated 10 June 2013 and the documents that accompanied it are reasonable. As a consequence, the Claimants is ordered to pay (i) the Respondent's share of the arbitration costs, i.e. one half of the total arbitration costs, amounting to US$286,690.06, and (ii) US$931,051.23 for the Respondent's legal fees and expenses. Hence, the Claimants are ordered to pay to the Respondent a total amount of US$1,217,741.29.\n\n**V. OPERATIVE PART**\n---------------------\n\n**FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE**\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal decides:\n\n**(1) That the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the Claimants' claims within the scope of the present proceedings, and that these claims are admissible;**\n\n**(2) That the Respondent did not violate its obligations under the 1990 Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland Concerning Business and Economic Relations, as alleged by the Claimants;**\n\n**(3) As a consequence, that all the Claimants' claims are dismissed;**\n\n**(4) That the Claimants should bear all the ICSID arbitration costs and expenses, reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in the preparation of its legal case, and their own costs and expenses; and**\n\n**(5) As a consequence, that the Claimants shall pay US$1,217,741.29 to the Respondent.**\n\n**ANNEX B** - **JOINT PROPOSED LIST OF POINTS FOR THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION IN THE CASE OF**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v.

It is Respondent's position that the evidentiary effect of the Decision should be considered in light of the arbitration clause provided in Article 9.2 of the 1997 Fractionation Agreement [Exhibit C-13] and other evidence.\n\n*Additional comments to part B (Merits)*\n\nI. The Claimants' claims for violation of the fair and equitable treatment and full security and protection, related to the conduct of the criminal proceedings in Poland have been withdrawn by the Claimants without prejudice to being raised in a separate proceeding.\n\n[Transcript, Day 1, p. 35 line 20 to p. 36, line 13, and the Respondent's position in Transcript, Day 3, p.96, lines 12 to 21]\n\nII. The parties also agree that the following issues could require determination by the Tribunal, for purposes of the analysis whether the alleged violations of the Treaty, referred to in points 4-6 above, occurred:\n\nWhether either of the following acts alleged by Claimants were an exercise of *puissance publique* by Respondent:\n\ni. Alleged pressure on Kredyt Bank to cease funding LFO's line of credit (based on Claimants' allegation that there were acts of *puissance publique* through repeat tax audits that Claimants allege were referred to in the Ministry of Finance letters to Kredyt Bank contained in Exhibit C-17).\n\nii. Alleged failure to supply blood plasma to the LFO Project.\n\nIII. The Claimants propose that within the analysis of the issue in para. 5.3 above, the Tribunal should consider as sub-issues to the alleged failure to supply blood plasma under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement, the following matters:\n\n(a) testing of LFO's processes and products,\n\n(b) Registering of LFO's processes and products as drugs for use in Poland, and\n\n(c) obtaining of authorizations from the Respondent to register and use its processes and sell its products to the Respondent in Poland.\n\n[Claimant's Initial Memorial at para. 21, 52(ii); Claimant's Counter-Memorial at paras. 99 - 102 & nn.69-70; Niziol Witness Statement at para. 30; Niziol Supplemental Witness Statement at 814; Transcript Day 1, page 67, line 23-page 68, line 4; Transcript Day 2, page 90, line 2-page 92, line 4; Transcript Cay 2, page 159, lines 9-19; Respondent's Position at Transcript Day 3, page 87, lines 1-24.]\n\nThe Respondent's position is that the distinction and corresponding arguments were for the first time developed by the Claimants during the Merits Hearing and therefore they are late. It is also the Respondent's position that under the 1997 Fractionation Agreement there were no separate and differentiated conditions for delivery of blood plasma for each of the purposes indicated by the Claimants. Therefore, according to the Respondent, it would first be artificial to split the issue in para. 5.3 into these three sub-issues. Moreover, the determination need not at all be necessary, as the claim may fail on the lack of the *puissance publique* element.\n\n**C.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 20, 2014, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a Request for Interpretation of the Award rendered on May 16, 2014 in ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/10/1, *David Minnotte and Robert Lewis* v. *Republic of Poland* (the \"Request\"), submitted by the Claimants pursuant to Article 55 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. On the same day, the Centre also confirmed its receipt of the prescribed lodging fee.\n\n2.\n\nArticle 55(2) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules provides that \"[t]he Tribunal shall determine the procedure to be followed\" in relation to requests for interpretation. By letter of June 24, 2014, the Tribunal invited both parties to provide their views on certain procedural proposals made by the Tribunal in that letter.\n\n3.\n\nHaving received and considered the parties' respective responses to the Tribunal's letter on June 27, 2014, and having noted that there was agreement that the interpretation proceeding should proceed on the basis of written pleadings and without an oral hearing, on July 10, 2014 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, concerning the procedure to be followed in this phase of the case.\n\n4.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimants submitted their Supplement to the Request for Interpretation (the \"Supplement\") by July 18, 2014, and Respondent submitted its Observations on the Request for Interpretation of the Final Award of 16 May 2014 (the \"Observations\") by August 1, 2014.\n\n**II. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nHaving read and considered these submissions and deliberated, the Tribunal has decided as follows.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Request and Supplementary Request for interpretation were based solely upon ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rule 55.1 Questions of jurisdiction and of the admissibility of the Request must therefore be determined by reference to ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rule 55. which reads as follows:\n\n**Article 55 Interpretation of the Award**\n\n(1) Within 45 days after the date of the award either party, with notice to the other party, may request that the Secretary-General obtain from the Tribunal an interpretation of the award.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall determine the procedure to be followed.\n\n(3) The interpretation shall form part of the award, and the provisions of Articles 52 and 53 of these Rules shall apply.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 1; Supplement \u00b6 20.\n\n7.\n\nThe actual request for interpretation was summarized as follows in paragraph 2 of the Request:\n\nINTERPRETATION REQUESTED BY CLAIMANTS\n\n2. Claimants seek an Interpretation of the Final Award as follows:\n\nA. In order to properly effectuate the stated principle that the costs of this proceeding should follow the events, Claimants request that the Tribunal take more care to evaluate the numerous decisions contained within the Award as well as interim decisions and conduct prior to the Award in order to determine whether an Award of the entire sum of costs sought by Respondent actually complies with the principle that the costs follow the event.\n\nB. In light of the Tribunal's rejection of Respondent's jurisdictional defense based on the alleged fraud (paragraphs 128140) Claimants request that the Tribunal specifically exclude the extensive fees and costs that were incurred by virtue of this defense, which was specifically not sustained.\n\nC. In light of the Tribunal's conclusions rejecting Respondent's other jurisdictional and admissibility defenses (paragraphs 141-151) Claimants request that the Tribunal specifically exclude fees and costs that were incurred by virtue of this defense, which was specifically not sustained.\n\nD. In light of the Tribunal's conclusions rejecting Respondent's defense on the merits of the BIT claims on the basis of fraud and deceit (paragraphs 153-164) Claimants request that the Tribunal specifically exclude fees and costs that were incurred by virtue of this defense, which was specifically not sustained.\n\nE. In light of the Tribunal's conclusion that it does not question that Claimants initiated and presented the claims in good faith, and specifically in light of the obligation under Article IX(2) of the BIT that the parties should seek initially to settle the dispute by consultation and negotiation and the absolute refusal of the Respondent to even meet with Claimants prior to commencement of the ICSID proceeding, Claimants request that the Tribunal reconsider the award of costs in their entirety or, in the alternative, make a significant adjustment to the costs sought by Respondent based on its pre-arbitration conduct in violation of the BIT.\n\nF. In light of the absence of recitation of several procedural matters from the Award that had significant impact on the cost of the proceedings, including specifically the Respondent's refusal to meet with Claimants prior to commencement of this proceeding and the tardy disclosure by one of the Tribunal members of a significant relationship that required careful investigation and analysis of the privilege to challenge said arbitrator, Claimants request that the Tribunal reconsider and exclude fees and costs for such proceedings.\n\nG. In light of Respondent's refusal to accept Claimants' proposal of a single arbitrator, including the proposal that such arbitrator be Professor Vaughan Lowe, and subsequent agreement to Professor Lowe as President of the Tribunal, Claimants request that the Tribunal reduce the amount awarded for arbitrator compensation.\n\nH. In light of the secret criminal proceedings against Claimants and the extensive fees and costs that were necessitated by the need for Claimants to request and be granted in part emergency measures that resulted in the change of venue of the proceedings, Claimants request that the Tribunal reconsider and exclude fees and costs for such proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nIn the Conclusion of the Request, Claimants stated that:\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n28. For all of the foregoing reasons, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal enter an order interpreting the Award pursuant to ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rule 55.\n\n29. Pursuant thereto, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal establish an appropriate procedure to consider a proper cost allocation that will follow all of the events decided by this Tribunal and the Award, not merely allocate every dollar of the costs incurred against Claimants.\n\n30. Alternatively, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal reverse its Award of Costs entirely based upon the failure of Respondent to comply with the BIT obligation to meet and attempt to resolve disputes.\n\n9.\n\nIn the Supplement, Claimants put forward further arguments in support of their position. The Conclusion of the Supplement stated that:\n\n20. For all of the foregoing reasons, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal enter an order interpreting the Award pursuant to ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rule 55.\n\n21. Pursuant thereto, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal adjust its Cost allocation and reduce the sum awarded against Claimants to effect the true intent that the costs should follow all of the events in this proceeding, not just the outcome on the merits of a claim pursued in good faith.\n\n10.\n\nIn the Respondent's Observations, it moved that the Tribunal dismiss the Request and Supplement with costs. As well as (among other things) challenging the Claimants' characterisation of the Award, it observed:\n\nBoth the Request and the Supplement aim to reverse the dispositive part of the Award with respect to the ruling on costs of arbitration. Such action manifestly exceeds the purpose and confines of the procedure instituted by Claimants under Article 55 of the ICSID (Additional Facility) Arbitration Rules.2\n\nObservations, \u00b6 2(a).\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as it was put in the *Wena Hotels* case, there are:\n\ntwo main conditions for the admissibility of an application for interpretation: first, there has to be a dispute between the original parties as to the meaning or scope of the award; second, the purpose of the application must be to obtain an interpretation of the award.3\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd* v *Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on the Application for Interpretation of the Award dated 8 December 2000 issued on 31 October 2005, \u00b6 76. Although the interpretation proceeding in the *Wena* case was conducted in accordance with Article 50 of the ICSID Convention, the same requirements are useful guidance for interpretation proceedings initiated pursuant to Article 55 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.\n\n12.\n\nIn the present case, the complaint is not that it is unclear what this Tribunal decided: it is that on the basis of the facts in this case the Tribunal could and should have come to a different conclusion, even applying the principles that the Tribunal's award indicated that it was applying. That is not a request for interpretation of its decision. It is a request that the Tribunal reconsider and alter its decision.\n\n13.\n\nThis request plainly falls outside the scope of ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rule 55. The Tribunal has no legal power to do what the Claimants request of it, even if it were minded to do so. It accordingly declines the \"request for interpretation\" of its award.\n\n**B. COSTS OF THE INTERPRETATION PROCEEDING**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn its Observations, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimants to reimburse the Respondent for: (i) its legal fees, and (ii) the costs of this proceeding, as established by the Tribunal.4\n\nObservations, \u00b6 38.\n\n15.\n\nBecause there is no genuine dispute over interpretation, it is appropriate that the Claimants, as the unsuccessful applicants, should bear all reasonable costs of this interpretation proceeding.5\n\nThe costs of the interpretation proceeding include, *inter alia*, the arbitrators' fees, the Tribunal's expenses and the Secretariat's fees and expenses. At the time of the Decision this amount is US$14,368.75, which consists of the interpretation proceeding costs of US$14,148.75 and estimated charges of US$220.00 for the costs incurred in connection with the dispatch of the Decision (*e.g.*, costs related to courier services, binding and photocopying). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement as soon as all invoices are received and the account is finalized. Any remaining balance in the case account will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n16.\n\nOn September 22, 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a statement of their costs and fees incurred with respect to the preparation of this interpretation proceeding. After reviewing Respondent's letter of September 26, 2014, the Tribunal has determined that the legal representation costs referenced in this letter are reasonable.\n\n17.\n\nConsequently, the Claimants are ordered to pay the Respondent: (i) the Respondent's share of the interpretation proceeding costs, *i.e.* one half of the total costs for the interpretation proceedings, amounting to US$7,184.38; and (ii) US$15,915.08 for the Respondent's costs for legal representation for the interpretation proceeding. Therefore, the Claimants are ordered to pay to the Respondent a total amount of US$23,099.46.\n\n**III. OPERATIVE PART**\n-----------------------\n\n18.\n\n**FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE**\n\nThe Tribunal decides:\n\n(1) **That the Claimants' request for the interpretation of the Award is dismissed;**\n\n(2) **That the Claimants should bear all reasonable costs of the interpretation proceedings, including all the ICSID arbitration costs and expenses, reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in the preparation of its legal case related to the interpretation proceeding and their own expenses; and**\n\n(3) **As a consequence, the Claimants shall pay US$23,099.46 to the Respondent.**"}]}
