In this case, my discrepancy is eminently conceptual.\n\n3.\n\nThe Concession Contract for the Supply of Renewable Energy to the National Interconnected Electric System (\"the RER-Contract or the Contract\") is a collaborative administrative contract whereby - through the assumption of relevant commitments by both parties - the private contracting party (in this case, Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L.; now, CH Mamacocha S.R.L. or CHM) undertook significant investment obligations in order to supply the awarded energy in exchange for certain commitments, basic but crucial, for the Contract to succeed. Just as the Contract could not succeed absent CHM's investments and fulfillment of its obligations, such result would not be possible absent the State contracting party's due compliance with the obligations undertaken by it.\n\n4.\n\nDue compliance with such obligations gives rise to the so-called *financial-economic balance or equation of the contract* under administrative contract law, and failure to discharge such obligations may (depending on the magnitude of the non-compliance) lead to the impossibility to perform and the virtual death of the contract.\n\n5.\n\nAs reflected by the practice adopted in various countries, the construction of many infrastructure projects requires, for them to be feasible, the introduction of mechanisms guaranteeing a minimum flow of revenue during a long period, to allow an internal rate of return (IRR) sufficient to repay the investment undertaken and adequately compensate for the risk assumed in the context of the project. This occurs in both large infrastructure projects and others, even smaller, where the remuneration generated through ordinary market mechanisms would not suffice to repay the investment and yield the return necessary to encourage private actors to undertake such projects.\n\n6.\n\nThat is particularly the case of certain \"*clean energy*\" generation projects (such as those of a hydroelectric nature, like the one at issue here) under which, while machines are mainly called to dispatch in view of their low operating costs, ordinary remuneration systems (generally, based on marginal cost) are not enough to repay the high investment commitments assumed. Thus, many hydroelectric plants are built by States - which, through them, meet, in turn, other objectives (*e.g.*, regulating water flows for consumption or crops downstream, developing marginal or uninhabited areas, or, even, fostering geopolitical interests) - or by means of a robust subsidy scheme, through either direct (transfer of funds) or indirect (tax relief, guaranteed energy prices, etc.) contributions. When the investment is made by private parties, most of such projects are funded through project finance mechanisms in which resources are obtained from third parties (in general, financial institutions which, in turn, source funds from the markets), who get involved in such funding on the basis of long-term flows of revenue expected and using the income and assets of the project itself as collateral. Hence, such projects are especially sensitive to unexpected changes, regulatory opportunism, etc.\n\n7.\n\nIn my view, the majority opinion fails to properly assess the relevance of certain key elements of the RER-Contract in such financial-economic balance.\n\n8.\n\nBy concluding, for instance, that the RER-Contract did not impose on Respondent the obligation to assure the Guaranteed Revenue,2 to grant the third extension requested (which was crucial in order to reach precisely the 20-year period of guaranteed revenue contractually provided and necessary to repay the project) in the face of delays not attributable to the concessionaire,3 or to actively assist it before regional authorities in the obtention of permits, the majority decision, in practice, endorses the destruction of the financial-economic balance of the Contract mentioned *supra*.\n\nTerm defined in Clause 1.4.26 of the RER-Contract as \"the annual revenue that the Concessionaire Company shall receive for the net injections of energy up to the limit of the Awarded Energy paid at the Award Tariff. It will only apply during the Term of Validity\" (**Exhibit C-2**, RER-Contract, 18 February 2014). The majority rules on this matter in Award, \u00b6\u00b6 711-726. Concerning the operation of the Guaranteed Revenue and the Term of Validity in the RER-Contract, see Benavides Report I, \u00b6\u00b6 171-178.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 727-843.\n\n9.\n\nIn such context, I cannot agree, *inter alia*, with (i) the decision to validate the rejection of the third request for extension4 based on the alleged invalidity of Addenda 1 and 2,5 which - expressly recognizing the existence of the events of non-compliance of the Peruvian State, modified work execution schedules and the date of Commercial Operation Start-up (POC, for its Spanish acronym)6 - *were never declared null and void and remain valid as of the date of this decision*;7 (ii) the decision to validate Respondent's failure to consider the Sosa Report of 22 November 20168 or the reports prepared by Estudio Echecopar of 5 April and 17 April 2018,9 which - despite having been requested by the MINEM itself - were neither assessed nor mentioned when the third request for extension was rejected; (iii) the failure to duly consider Respondent's change of attitude as from late December 2018, who - deviating from the position adopted from the commencement of the Contract and until November 2018 whereby CHM was not to bear the consequences of State interference10 - abruptly modified the criterion adopted, denied the third extension only a month later,11 and - unsuccessfully - attempted to seek the declaration of nullity of Addendas 1 and 2 for the first time by instituting the Lima Arbitration on 27 December 2018;12 or (iv) the decision to declare the RER-Contract *automatically* terminated for not reaching the POC on the specified date, and without any right to compensation whatsoever for CHM, even though CHM had not caused the termination and had made millionaire investments as from the execution of the RER-Contract in February 2014.\n\n**Exhibit C-30/MQ-26/CLC-38**, Official Letter No. 2312-2018-MEM/DGE issued by the MINEM, 31 December 2018, attaching Report No. 511-2018-MEM/DGE, 31 December 2018. The third request for extension was submitted on 5 February 2018 and denied on 31 December 2018, almost eleven months after it had been filed and exactly on the same date as -were the extension not to be granted- the Contract would terminate. In such regard, see Qui\u00f1ones Report I, \u00b6 6; and Qui\u00f1ones Report II, \u00b6 95, where it is observed that, in accordance with Articles 106 and 142 of the Peruvian Law of Administrative Procedures, the Conceding Authority should have answered the request within the general term of thirty business days.\n\n**Exhibit C-8**, Addendum No. 1 to the Concession Contract, 22 July 2015, and **Exhibit C-9**, Addendum No. 2 to the Concession Agreement, 3 January 2017, which agreed to modify the Works Execution Schedule of the Concession Contract and extend the term for the POC by 705 and 462 calendar days, respectively. Addendum 1 provided in its Clause Sixth: \"Inasmuch as the aforementioned delays in the administrative procedures made it impossible to achieve Financial Closing for the project, entailing the failure to comply with the terms of the Milestones of the Works Execution Schedule of the Concession Agreement\u2014having failed to conclude with the process of financing the project\u2014the conclusion must be reached that said events of non-compliance do not fall within the scope of the Concessionaire's liability, applying article 1314 of the Civil Code which establishes that a party acting in ordinary due diligence cannot be held responsible for failure to execute its obligations or for the partial, late, or defective compliance with said obligations. In this sense, via Official Document No. 504-2015-MEM/DGE, the General Directorate of Electricity approved the extension of the term requested due to delays that could be attributed to the State, pursuant to the provisions of Legal Report No. 005-2015-EM-DGE.\"\n\nIn such context, Ministry Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM of 29 December 2016 attached to Addendum No. 2 pointed out in its ninth consideration: \"That, by extending the CCO term four hundred and sixty-two (462) calendar days, the new date for this milestone would be March 14, 2020, exceeding the deadline of December 31, 2018 contained in number 8.4 of Clause Eight of the RER Agreement, the same which stipulates that said date cannot be exceeded *'for any reason', which must be understood, excluding the scope of responsibility of the Concessionaire, non-performance or late or defective performance, directly caused by acts of the contracting Public Administration*\u2026\" (emphasis added).\n\nThe majority rules in connection with this matter in Award, \u00b6\u00b6 819, 823 and 826.\n\n**Exhibit C-12**, Report No. 166-2016-EM-DGE, 6 October 2016, adopted by the then-Director General of Electricity (Carla Sosa Vela), which, under paragraph 2.2.5., stated that the expression for \"*any reason*\" in Article 8.4 of the RER-Contract authorizing automatic termination of the Contract and enforcement of the Performance Bond does not allow inferring the Concessionaire's contractual liability for acts of God, force majeure or acts of prince (including action attributable to the Public Administration).\n\n**Exhibit C-235**, Legal Report of Estudio Echecopar, 5 April 2018; and **Exhibit C-236**, Legal Report of Estudio Echecopar, 17 April 2018. The first report of Estudio Echecopar (dated 5 April 2018) concluded that \"1. *The MEM must extend the COS term beyond two (2) years after the Actual Date set forth in the Tender Requirements and change the Termination Date of the RER Concession Contract in order to recognize the Guaranteed Premium for twenty 20 years as initially contemplated* where RER Awardees show that the COS delay is not attributable to them but rather to unavoidable force majeure events, such as the Administration's delay in granting the required permits. *This extension must be agreed upon in an Addendum to the RER Concession Contract signed by both parties*\" and \"4. In view of the foregoing, we believe that *it is not possible to terminate the RER Concession Contract by way of penalty where the RER Awardee shows that the COS delay was due to a force majeure event, i.e., the administration's delay in the issuance of the authorizations; moreover, in that case, the Performance Bond posted for the State should not be enforced*\" (emphasis added). At the hearing, witness \u00cdsmodes Mezzano (former Minister of the MINEM) was questioned about the first report of Estudio Echecopar (Exhibit C-235) and said that he was not aware of it. Tr. (Day 3), 9 March 2022, 575:2-578:17. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that both reports of Estudio Echecopar were not mentioned or discussed in the decision rejecting the third request for extension (**Exhibit C-30**, Official Letter No. 2312-2018-MEM/DGE, 31 December 2018), where the rejection was determined by the Director General of Electricity himself, Eng. V\u00edctor T. Estrella, to whom both reports were addressed. The majority discusses the relevance of these reports in Award, \u00b6\u00b6 650, 794-795.\n\nOn the basis of which Respondent defended the concessionaire's actions in court within the framework of the *amparo* action, executed Addenda Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and made the regulatory proposal of 11 November 2018 (**Exhibit C-18**, Statement of Reasons of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, 11 November 2018).\n\nTo such effect, it ignored the Addenda signed and decided to attribute Claimants the risk of State interference. In such regard, Respondent's change of view evidenced between November and December 2018 is noteworthy. See, in that regard, Benavides Report I, \u00b6\u00b6 197-201; and Qui\u00f1ones Report I, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 201-202 and 226; as well as the references made by witness \u00cdsmodes Mezzano in the course of the hearing (Tr. (Day 3), 9 March 2022, 618:8-621:20) to the opposition of one of the main gas producers in Peru. Given the abrupt change of attitude observed, it is difficult to justify the failure to produce more contemporaneous documentary evidence in support of the decisions adopted. In these circumstances, I also disagree with the majority decision to reject the request for negative interference in connection with document production requests Nos. 1, 2 and 22. Award, \u00b6\u00b6 252 (i), (ii) and (vii), and 253.\n\n**Exhibit C-96**, Official Letter No. 2300-2018-MEM/DGE, 31 December 2018, attaching the request for arbitration filed before the Lima Chamber of Commerce.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent's actions in dispute entail, in my view, a clear breach of Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37 and 6.3 of the RER-Contract,13 as well as arbitrary conduct on the part of Respondent in violation of the duty to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants' investments assumed by the Republic of Peru under Article 10.5 of the Treaty.\n\nSee, likewise, Benavides Report I, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17, 19, 87, 204, 205 and 266; and Qui\u00f1ones Report II, \u00b6 6.\n\n11.\n\nGiven the terms in which the majority of the Tribunal has ruled, no decision is to be adopted regarding the damages claimed.\n\nDate: [December 20, 2023]"}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ampuero First Statement | First Witness Statement of Mr. Ricardo Ampuero Llerena, dated 3 February 2021 |\n| Ampuero Second Statement | Second Witness Statement of Mr. Ricardo Ampuero Llerena, dated 6 November 2021 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, in force as of 10 April 2006 |\n| Bartrina First Statement | First Witness Statement of Mr. Andr\u00e9s Bartrina, dated 14 September 2020 |\n| Bartrina Second Statement | Second Witness Statement of Mr. Andr\u00e9s Bartrina, dated 20 July 2021 |\n| Benavides First Report | *Opini\u00f3n de Experto en Derecho Peruano* of Dr. Eduardo Benavides Torres, dated 14 September 2020 |\n| Benavides Second Report | Second *Opini\u00f3n de Experto en Derecho Peruano* of Dr. Eduardo Benavides Torres, dated 20 July 2021 |\n| Benzaqu\u00e9n First Statement | First Witness Statement of Dr. Licy Benzaqu\u00e9n, dated 14 September 2020 |\n| Benzaqu\u00e9n Second Statement | Second Witness Statement of Dr. Licy Benzaqu\u00e9n, dated 20 July 2021 |\n| BRG First Report | Expert Report on Damages, prepared by Messrs.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of ***(i)*** the United States \u2013 Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, which was signed on 12 April 2006 and entered into force on 1 February 2009 (\"**TPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"); ***(ii)*** a Concession Contract for the Supply of Renewable Energy to the National Interconnected Electric System, dated 18 February 2014 (\"**RER Contract**\"); and ***(iii)*** the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (\"**ICSID Convention**\"). This proceeding is conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings in force as of 10 April 2006 (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\") except to the extent modified by the TPA.\n\n2.\n\nThis dispute relates to measures implemented by Respondent which allegedly negatively impacted Claimants' investment in the development, construction, and operation of a run-of-the-river 20-megawatt hydroelectric plant and transmission line project near the Mamacocha Lagoon in the Arequipa Region of Peru (\"**Mamacocha Project**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Award is divided into the following sections. Section II sets out the Parties. Section III sets out the procedural background of the case. Section IV sets out the factual background to the dispute between the Parties. A summary of the Parties' claims and reliefs sought is set out in Section V. SectionVI contains an introduction to the Tribunal's analysis. Section VII addresses the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent. Section VIII addresses the merits of Second Claimant's claims for breach of the RER Contract and Peruvian law. SectionIX addresses Claimants' claims for breach of the TPA. Section X addresses Claimants' claim in respect of the Confidentiality Agreement. Section XI addresses the Parties' submissions on costs. The Tribunal's conclusions are set out in SectionXII. The dispositive is contained in Section XIII.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n**A. C laimants**\n-----------------\n\n4.\n\nFirst Claimant is Latam Hydro LLC (\"**Latam Hydro**\" or \"**First Claimant**\"), with principal place of business as follows:1\n\n1865 Brickell Avenue  \nA-1603  \nMiami, Florida 33129-1645  \n United States\n\nRequest for Arbitration \u00b6 279; Memorial \u00b6 192; *citing* **C-019**, Latam Hydro LLC, Certificate of Formation, 5 May 2014.\n\n5.\n\nFirst Claimant is a limited liability company organised and existing under the laws of Delaware, USA, with Delaware File Number 5527780.\n\n6.\n\nSecond Claimant is CH Mamacocha S.R.L. (\"**CH Mamacocha**\", also referred to as \"**CHM**\", \"**Concessionaire Company**\", or \"**Second Claimant**\"), with registered office at:\n\nJuan Dellepiani 354,  \nUrb. Country Club El Golf  \nSan Isidro  \nLima 15076  \n Peru\n\n7.\n\nSecond Claimant is a Peruvian legal entity constituted or organised under the laws of Peru on 15 November 2012.2 Second Claimant was formerly known as Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L.3\n\nMemorial \u00b6 195; *citing* **C-021**, Registration of Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L.'s (today CH Mamacocha S.R.L.) Articles of Incorporation, 23 November 2012.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 195.\n\n8.\n\nFirst Claimant submits its investment claims to arbitration on its own behalf under TPA Article 10.16(1)(a) and on behalf of its subsidiary, CH Mamacocha under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C).4\n\nMemorial \u00b6 194.\n\n9.\n\nClaimants are represented in this arbitration by their duly authorised attorneys, identified on page (i) above.\n\n**B. R espondent**\n------------------\n\n10.\n\nRespondent is the Republic of Peru (\"**Peru**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n11.\n\nRespondent is represented in this arbitration by its duly authorised attorneys, identified on page (i) above.\n\n12.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are jointly referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" Claimants and Respondent are individually referred to as a \"**Party**.\"5\n\nThe Tribunal notes that throughout the proceeding Claimants and Respondent have been referred to as \"Parties,\" and it has chosen the same denomination in this Award in the interest of procedural consistency. The Tribunal is aware that TPA Article 10.28 refers to Claimants and Respondent together as the \"disputing parties\" and to either of them as a \"disputing party,\" and has been mindful of those denominations in its analysis of the TPA provisions. The Tribunal is further aware that the TPA also refers to the States signatories to the TPA (United States and Peru) as \"Party,\" and has also been mindful of those denominations when analyzing the TPA provisions. For the clarity of the Award, however, the State signatories of the TPA will be referred to as the \"TPA Party,\" or the \"TPA Parties,\" or simply Peru and the United States.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn 30 August 2019, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Latam Hydro and CHM against Peru, as supplemented by letter of 18 September 2019 (\"**Request for Arbitration**\"). The Request for Arbitration was accompanied by exhibits C-0001 to C-0027.\n\n14.\n\nOn 19 September 2019, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the notice of registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings in force as of 10 April 2006 (\"**ICSID Institution Rules**\").\n\n15.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding, arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of The Netherlands, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Professor Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, a national of Argentina and Portugal, appointed by Claimants; and Professor Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa, a national of Argentina and Spain, appointed by Respondent.\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 March 2020, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Ana Constanza Conover Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nOn the same date, Respondent submitted an application for the Tribunal: (i) not to read Claimants' notice of intent nor the Request for Arbitration without first ruling on a request from Respondent to expunge information from both documents allegedly covered by a confidentiality agreement entered into between Claimants and Peru's *Comisi\u00f3n Especial que representa al Estado en Controversias Internacionales de Inversi\u00f3n* (\"**Special Commission**\") on 5 December 2017 (\"**Confidentiality Agreement**\"); and (ii) to order the Centre not to publish the notice of intent or the Request for Arbitration on the ICSID website while Respondent's request was pending before the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nOn 12 March 2020, the Tribunal granted one week to the Parties to confer and seek to agree on the confidentiality issues raised by Respondent. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that, failing agreement: (i) Respondent would be allowed to submit an application to the Tribunal on 19 March 2020, indicating the parts of the documents which it considered to be in breach of the Confidentiality Agreement; (ii) Claimants would be allowed to reply to Respondent's submission by 26 March 2020; and (iii) the Tribunal would decide upon any application following receipt of both Parties' views.\n\n20.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, pending any agreement of the Parties or application by Respondent, the Tribunal would not review the notice of intent nor the Request for Arbitration, and ICSID would not publish such documents on its website pending resolution of the issue.\n\n21.\n\nOn 19 March 2020, Respondent filed an application for the Tribunal: (i) to order the expungement of those portions of the notice of intent and the Request for Arbitration which it considered that violated the Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii) not to take that information into account in its deliberations and determinations in this arbitration (\"**Respondent's Application on Confidentiality**\").\n\n22.\n\nOn 26 March 2020, Claimants filed a response to Respondent's Application on Confidentiality (\"**Claimants' Response on Confidentiality**\").\n\n23.\n\nOn 27 March 2020, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to reply to Claimants' Response on Confidentiality. Claimants submitted observations on Respondent's request on the same date. On 30 March 2020, the Tribunal invited Respondent to reply to Claimants' Response on Confidentiality by 1 April 2020 and Claimants to file rejoinder comments by 6 April 2020.\n\n24.\n\nOn 2 April 2020, Respondent submitted a reply to Claimants' Response on Confidentiality (\"**Respondent's Reply on Confidentiality**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn 6 April 2020, Claimants submitted a rejoinder to Respondent's Reply on Confidentiality (\"**Claimants' Rejoinder on Confidentiality**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO 1**\"), setting out its decision on Respondent's Application on Confidentiality. In its order, the Tribunal found, upon review of the Parties' submissions and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, that Respondent had not established a basis for any of the proposed deletions under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejected Respondent's application, indicated that the Parties' costs related to the application would be reserved for later determination, and revoked the instruction not to publish Claimants' notice of intent and the Request for Arbitration on the ICSID's website.\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 April 2020, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by videoconference pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1).\n\n28.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 13 May 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues (\"**PO 2**\"). PO 2 established, *inter alia*, that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, except to the extent modified by Section B of Chapter Ten (Investment) of the TPA and supplemented by any decision adopted by the Commission under Articles 10.22(3) and 10.23 of the TPA; that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish; and that the Tribunal's award, orders and decisions, the notice of intent and the Request for Arbitration, the Parties' pleadings, memorials and briefs, and the transcripts of hearings would be publicly available subject to the deletion of protected information. PO 2 also set out that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, D.C. and included a procedural calendar of the arbitration.6\n\nThe procedural languages in this case are English and Spanish, and the Award is being rendered in both languages (PO 2, \u00b6\u00b6 11.1 and 11.13). However, pursuant to PO 2, in this case the Parties submitted pleadings, witness statements, expert reports, exhibits and legal authorities in either procedural language without translation into the other, and therefore several materials on the record are in only one of the languages (PO 2, \u00b6 11.4). Similarly, the final-corrected version of the transcript only reflects the original language of the speaker (PO 6, \u00b6 52). Accordingly, in this Award, any verbatim quote from a document filed by a Party in only one procedural language without a translation into the other will reflect the original language of the document, and any quote to the transcript will reflect the original language of the speaker/transcript. The Award in English may therefore contain quotes in Spanish, and vice-versa the Award in Spanish may contain quotes in English. The Tribunal considers this is both procedurally efficient and proper in light of the provisions of PO 2 and PO 6 regarding language of the Parties' filings and final transcript, and consistent with the Parties' expectations expressed during the Pre-Hearing Conference. When the Parties did file a translation of the quoted document into the other language, the Tribunal has quoted from that translation.\n\n29.\n\nOn 29 June 2020, the President of the Tribunal, through the Secretary of the Tribunal, sent a letter to the Parties enquiring whether they would agree to the appointment of Ms. Emily Hay, of the firm Hanotiau & van den Berg, as Assistant to the Tribunal. The letter set out Ms. Hay's proposed role and tasks to the Parties.\n\n30.\n\nBy emails of 2 and 6 July 2020, the Parties agreed to Ms. Hay's appointment as Assistant to the Tribunal. On 7 July 2020, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted a copy of Ms. Hay's signed declaration of independence and impartiality to the Parties.\n\n31.\n\nOn 14 August 2020, following an agreement between the Parties to extend several procedural deadlines, including the deadline for Claimants' Memorial, the Tribunal issued an amended procedural timetable for the arbitration.\n\n32.\n\nOn 14 September 2020, Claimants filed a memorial on the merits (\"**Memorial**\"), with exhibits C-0028 to C-0210 and legal authorities CL-0001 to CL-0097. Claimants also filed the following six witness statements and four expert reports:\n\n\u2022 First Witness Statement of Mr. Michael Jacobson, dated 14 September 2020 (\"**Jacobson First Statement**\");\n\n\u2022 First Witness Statement of Mr. Goran Stefan Sillen, dated 14 September 2020 (\"**Sillen First Statement**\");\n\n\u2022 First Witness Statement of Mr. Andr\u00e9s Bartrina, dated 14 September 2020 (\"**Bartrina First Statement**\");\n\n\u2022 First Witness Statement of Mr. Carlos Diez Canseco, dated 14 September 2020 (\"**Diez First Statement**\");\n\n\u2022 First Witness Statement of Second Claimant's External Counsel, dated 14 September 2020 (\"**Second Claimant's External Counsel First Statement**\");7\n\n\u2022 First Witness Statement of Dr. Licy Benzaqu\u00e9n, dated 14 September 2020 (\"**Benzaqu\u00e9n First Statement**\");\n\n\u2022 *Informe Legal Experto* of Dr. Mar\u00eda Teresa Qui\u00f1ones Alayza, dated 8 September 2020, with exhibits MQ-001 to MQ-083 (\"**Qui\u00f1ones First Report**\");\n\n\u2022 *Opini\u00f3n de Experto en Derecho Peruano* of Dr. Eduardo Benavides Torres, dated 14 September 2020, with exhibits EB-0001 to EB-0043 (\"**Benavides First Report**\");\n\n\u2022 Expert Report on Delay Matters, prepared by Mr. John McTyre of HKA Global Ltd., dated 14 September 2020, with exhibits HKA-0001 to HKA-0038 (\"**HKA First Report**\"); and\n\n\u2022 Expert Report on Damages, prepared by Messrs. Santiago Dellepiane and Andrea Cardani of Berkeley Research Group, dated 14 September 2020, with exhibits BRG-0001 to BRG-0079 (\"**BRG First Report**\").\n\n*See* \u00b6 184 below regarding the non-identification of Second Claimant's External Counsel in this Award.\n\n33.\n\nOn 25 January 2021, following an agreement between the Parties to extend the deadline for Respondent's Counter-Memorial, the Tribunal issued an amended procedural timetable for the arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nOn 9 February 2021, Respondent filed a counter-memorial on the merits and memorial on jurisdiction (\"**Counter-Memorial**\"), with exhibits R-0001 to R-0150 and legal authorities RL-0001 to RL-0180.

Matthew Shopp and Kiran Sequeira, dated 9 February 2021, with exhibits VP-0001 to VP-0039 (\"**Versant First Report**\").\n\n35.\n\nOn 16 February 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Tribunal a communication from Respondent of 15 February 2021 informing the Centre and Claimants of clerical corrections made to its Counter-Memorial. Similarly, by email of 19 February 2021, Claimants filed a revised version of their Memorial that corrected clerical errors.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of 22 February 2021, the Tribunal approved the filing of the corrected versions of Claimants' Memorial (attached to their email of 19 February 2021) and of Respondent's Counter-Memorial (attached to its email of 15 February 2021). For the sake of good order, the Tribunal requested both Parties to submit marked-up versions showing the changes made to their respective corrected pleadings. The Parties submitted the requested marked-up versions of their respective pleadings to the Tribunal on 23 February 2021.\n\n37.\n\nOn 23 March 2021, following exchanges between the Parties, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.\n\n38.\n\nOn 1 April 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, ruling on the Parties' respective requests for document production (\"**PO 3**\"). With respect to documents withheld or redacted on the basis of privilege or other alleged confidentiality, the Tribunal invited the Parties to produce, by 13 April 2021, a privilege log identifying any documents or redactions in respect of which a claim of privilege was asserted and the legal basis for such claim. In the event that either Party disputed a claim of privilege identified in the privilege log, the Tribunal noted that such Party could apply to the Tribunal by 20 April 2021, following which the Tribunal would issue further directions.\n\n39.\n\nFollowing an extension of time agreed by the Parties and confirmed by the Tribunal, on 21 April 2021, the Parties filed their respective privilege logs, and applied to the Tribunal with respect to disputed claims of privilege. Respondent's application was accompanied by legal authorities RL-0181 to RL-0183.\n\n40.\n\nOn 3 May 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, deciding on the disputed claims of privilege between the Parties in relation to the production of documents (\"**PO 4**\").\n\n41.\n\nOn 9 May 2021, Claimants filed an application in relation to the allegedly deficient production of documents by Respondent.

These included:\n\n(i) Water Use: One of the authorisations required by the Electricity Concessions Law was an authorisation for the use of natural resources owned by the State (*autorizaci\u00f3n del uso de recursos naturales de propriedad del Estado*).69 For the Project, this entailed a resolution issued by the National Water Authority (*Autoridad Nacional del Agua del Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego del Per\u00fa*, \"**ANA**\"), which would approve a water use study of the water resources available for the power generation activity (*Estudio de Aprovechamiento H\u00eddrico*).70 The *Estudio de Aprovechamiento H\u00eddrico* was approved by the ANA's *Administraci\u00f3n Local del Agua de Caman\u00e1 \u2013 Majes* in August 2013, prior to the execution of the RER Contract.71\n\n(ii) Environmental Certification: Pursuant to the *Ley del Sistema Nacional de Evaluaci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental (Ley No. 27446)*, a prior environmental certification by the competent authority is required before commencing construction projects that may cause negative environmental impacts (\"**Environmental Certification**\").72 The competent authority for certifying the Mamacocha Project was the *Autoridad Regional del Medio Ambiente* (\"**ARMA**\").73 On 11 October 2013, ARMA provided an Environmental Certification of the generation plant as \"Category III,\" requiring a detailed environmental impact study (*Estudio de Impacto Ambiental*, \"**EIA**\").74 Second Claimant appealed the decision, which was granted on 17 February 2014 when ARMA re-classified the generation plant as Category I, requiring only a sworn environmental impact statement (*Declaraci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental*, \"**DIA**\").75 The DIA was approved, and Second Claimant was granted an Environmental Certification for the generation plant of the Mamacocha Project by Resolution dated 3 September 2014 (transmitted on 5 September 2014) (\"**Generation Plant Environmental Certification**\").76 Second Claimant filed a separate application for the Environmental Certification for the 65km transmission line from the project site to the electricity substation, which was classified by ARMA as Category I, requiring a DIA.77 On 24 December 2014, the DIA was approved and the Resolution containing the Environmental Certification was granted for the transmission line (\"**Transmission Line Environmental Certification**\").78 The Environmental Certifications of the Mamacocha Project are the subject of various disputed circumstances that will be addressed in the course of this Award.\n\n(iii) Pre-Operational Grid Impact Study: A certification of a pre-operational study on grid impact is required from the COES.79 The COES is a private non-profit entity made up of stakeholders in the SEIN.80 The COES provided its approval on 28 January 2015.81 According to Respondent, delays in the issuance of this approval were attributable to Second Claimant.82\n\n(iv) Archaeological Certificate: A certification of the absence of archaeological remains is required from the Ministry of Culture for any electricity generation project.83 This was granted for the Mamacocha Project on 6 March 2015.84\n\n(v) Final Concessions: As set out in Clauses 1.3 and 3.2 of the RER Contract (see \u00b6\u00b6102-103 above), the Project needed a Final Concession for power generation in order to operate. The Electricity Concessions Law provides that a final concession is required, *inter alia*, for: (i) the generation of electrical energy that uses hydraulic resources; and (ii) the transmission of electrical energy that affects State property.85 To be granted a final concession under the Electricity Concessions Law, a number of other permits were required, including those outlined above.86 Second Claimant applied for and obtained separate final concessions for power generation and transmission of electrical energy. According to an internal report of Second Claimant, the final concession for the transmission line was granted on 9 March 2016, and the final concession for power generation was granted on 24 June 2016.87\n\n(vi) Civil Works Authorisation: The civil works authorisation (*Autorizaci\u00f3n para la Ejecuci\u00f3n de Obras*, \"**CWA**\") was required to commence construction near waterways such as the Mamacocha Lagoon.88 The competent authority was the *Autoridad Administrativa del Agua I Caplina Oco\u00f1a* (\"**AAA**\"), being a regional branch of the ANA.89 The application for the CWA was filed on 29 November 2016.90 Following an initial denial, the CWA was issued in 5 July 2017.91 On 25 January 2018, the AAA approved Second Claimant's request for rectification of the CWA.92 The circumstances surrounding the granting of the CWA are disputed and will be further addressed in the course of this Award.\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 126-129, 143;

A ddendum 1**\n------------------\n\n112.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, Second Claimant filed a request with MINEM for a 705-day extension to the RER Contract Works Execution Schedule.96\n\n**C-149**, *Carta de HLA (C. Diez) al MINEM (L. Nicho)*, 24 November 2014. *See* Memorial \u00b6 78; Counter- Memorial \u00b6 177.\n\n113.\n\nOn 6 April 2015, MINEM granted the request for a 705-day extension.97 In a legal report of the same date which recommended granting the request for extension, MINEM analysed each of the delays put forward by Second Claimant, including the number of days of delay caused and the party responsible. In summary, MINEM concluded:98\n\n6. As a result of the above, the total net delay attributable to the Administration is of 763 calendar days.\n\n7. In this regard, given that the delays in the abovementioned administrative procedures made it impossible to achieve the Financial Closing of the project, which resulted in the non-fulfillment of the deadlines of the Works Execution Schedule Milestones under the Supply Contract because the financing process of the project could not be completed, it must be concluded that such breaches are not within the Concessionaire\u00b4s scope of responsibility, pursuant to Article 1314 of the Civil Code, which sets forth that whoever acts with the required ordinary diligence may not be held liable for the non-performance of an obligation or for its partial, late or defective performance.*.*\n\n8*.* Following the same criterion, it is important to mention that the OSINERGMIN argues in its Report No. GFE-USPP-23-2015 (submitted through the document referenced in b) above): \"(\u2026) The delays in fulfilling the many requirements for the completion of the Concessionaire's project, as described above by the Concessionaire, should not be attributed to the Concessionaire, since such delays are the result of Government entities taking too long for their approvals. Such delays, which are attributable to third-parties' delayed action or inaction and are beyond Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L.'s control, have affected primarily the Concessionaire's ability to meet in a timely fashion the contractually-set Financial Closing deadline, which has resulted in Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L. not being in a position to comply with the initially-approved Works Execution Schedule \u2026.\n\n9. It is worth mentioning that, even if the delay attributable to the Administration is of 763 calendar days, the maximum term extension that should be granted to the Concessionaire is limited to the term explicitly requested by it, that is, 705 calendar days.\n\n**C-186**, *Oficio 504-2015-MEM-DGE \u2013 MINEM acepta nuevo cronograma*, 6 April 2015. *See* Memorial \u00b6 79.\n\n**C-201**, Legal Report No. 005-2015-EM-DGE, 6 April 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.\n\n114.\n\nOn 3 July 2015, the text of the first Addendum to the RER Contract was approved by MINEM, and as a result of the granted extension, on 17 July 2015 MINEM and Second Claimant signed the first Addendum to the RER Contract (\"**Addendum 1**\"), registered on 22 July 2015.99\n\n**C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 9, p. 8. The Tribunal notes that the text of Addendum 1 on the record is the public record of Addendum 1 by the notary public.\n\n115.\n\nThe Works Execution Schedule in effect prior to Addendum 1 had foreseen the Actual COS to take place on 2 January 2017.100 By the terms of Addendum 1, the parties agreed to modify the Works Execution Schedule, and \"extend, by 705 calendar days, the term for the [COS],\" setting it at 8 December 2018.101\n\n**C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 3.\n\n**C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recitals 7, 8.\n\n116.\n\nThe MINEM Ministerial Resolution of 3 July 2015 approving Addendum 1 stated that \"the General Directorate of Electricity of the Ministry of Energy and Mines deemed it appropriate to grant the extension of the term requested due to delays that could be attributed to the State.\"102\n\nMinisterial Resolution No. 320-2015-MEM/DM, in **C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, p. 9.\n\n117.\n\nReflecting language in the MINEM Ministerial Resolution approving the extension,103 the Fourth Recital to Addendum 1 states, in part:104\n\nThe delays in the approval of the administrative procedures mentioned by the Concessionaire were caused by the Regional Environmental Authority of the Regional Government of Arequipa, in the evaluation of the requests for classification of the preliminary environmental study and the subsequent approval of the Declaration of Environmental Impact (DEI), both for the Laguna Azul Hydroelectric Plant as well as the Transmission Line; by the Ministry of Culture with the approval of the execution of the archaeological evaluation project with excavation, as well as the approval of the Final Report; by the Local Water Authority of Caman\u00e1 - Majes, with the approval of the water use studies; and by the COES with the approval of the Preoperational Study of the project[\u2026]\n\nMinisterial Resolution No. 320-2015-MEM/DM, in **C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, p. 8.\n\n**C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 4.\n\n118.\n\nThe Sixth Recital further provides:105\n\nInasmuch as the aforementioned delays in the administrative procedures made it impossible to achieve Financial Closing for the project, entailing the failure to comply with the terms of the Milestones of the Works Execution Schedule of the Concession Agreement \u2013 having failed to conclude with the process of financing the project \u2013 the conclusion must be reached that said events of non-compliance do not fall within the scope of the Concessionaire's liability, applying article 1314 of the Civil Code which establishes that a party acting in ordinary due diligence cannot be held responsible for failure to execute its obligations or for the partial, late, or defective compliance with said obligations[\u2026]\n\n**C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 6.\n\n119.\n\nRespondent contends that the request for extension which resulted in Addendum 1 was based on false assertions by Second Claimant as to the causes of delay, and should not have been granted.106\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 182.\n\n**J.

Claimants assert that the Project was subject to political opposition by certain members of the legislative council of the Regional Government of Arequipa (\"**RGA Council**\"), who made claims about the environmental impact of the Mamacocha Project which in Claimants' view are unsubstantiated.107\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 80-81. *See also* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 114-118.\n\n121.\n\nAccording to Respondent, on the other hand, there was community opposition to the Project in Ayo, due to Second Claimant's attempt to avoid conducting the necessary environmental studies for the Project.108 In this regard, Respondent states that in July 2016 and January 2018 the Project came close to provoking social conflict, and that in 2017 more than 150 individuals made a written statement of their opposition to the construction of the Project.109\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 201.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 203; *citing* **R-022**, *Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo, Reporte Mensual de Conflictos Sociales No. 149*, July 2016, p. 10; **R-028**, *Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo, Reporte Mensual de Conflictos Sociales No. 167*, January 2018, p. 38; **R-055**, *Oficio No. 039-2017-MDA de la Municipalidad Distrital de Ayo (A.

Second Claimant's request was to move the deadline for Actual COS from 8 December 2018 to 14 March 2020.132\n\n(ii) Modify Clause 1.4.22 of the RER Contract concerning the termination date, i.e., 31 December 2036, taking into account the new proposed Actual COS date of 14 March 2020, and that the time between the Actual COS date and the date of termination of the contract should be at least 20 years. (This request would result in a new termination date of 14 March 2040).\n\n(iii) Modify Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract to specify that the Republic of Peru cannot terminate the RER Contract in the event that the Actual COS date falls after 31 December 2018 for causes attributable to it.\n\n(iv) Add a clause stating that in case of inconsistency between the RER Contract and the consolidated terms and conditions of the third international tender for the supply of electric power to the SEIN using renewable energy resources, the provisions of the RER Contract shall prevail.\n\n**C-157**, *Carta de Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul (C.

W ithdrawal of the RGA L awsuit**\n--------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAround November 2017, the Special Commission hired a Peruvian law firm, Estudio Echecopar, to advise Respondent on the legal merit of the RGA Lawsuit.171 As set out at \u00b6 146 above, the RGA Lawsuit was an administrative litigation claim brought by the RGA Public Prosecutor's Office seeking to annul the Generation Plant Environmental Certification and the Transmission Line Environmental Certification.\n\n**C-010**, Regional Executive Resolution No. 665-2017-GRA/GR, 27 December 2017, p. 3. *See* Memorial \u00b6 119.\n\n170.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, Mr. Juan Carlos Mor\u00f3n Urbina of Estudio Echecopar addressed his legal opinion to the Special Commission that, *inter alia*, the RGA Lawsuit had little chance of success (\"**Mor\u00f3n Report**\").172\n\n**R-140/C-229**, Legal Report by J.C.

Liz\u00e1rraga (Echecopar Law Firm), 5 December 2017, p. 1. *See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 243.\n\n171.\n\nOn 13 December 2017, the Special Commission convened to discuss the Mor\u00f3n Report. The Minutes of that meeting record that:173\n\n\u2026the members of the Special Commission exchanged opinions on the conclusions arrived at in the aforementioned [Mor\u00f3n] Report, and unanimously agreed to submit an official letter to the RGA, together with the [Mor\u00f3n] Report containing the opinion of [Mr. Mor\u00f3n], suggesting that the complaint filed by the RGA would be unlikely to succeed. The intention of the members of the Special Commission is to bring such Report to the attention of the RGA and recommend that any further steps to be taken be properly reassessed, considering such Report.\n\n**C-230**, Dr. Moron Urbina's presentation of his legal report's conclusions, 13 December 2017, p. 7.\n\n172.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, the Special Commission shared the Mor\u00f3n Report with the RGA, summarising its conclusions and mentioning risks associated with international arbitration proceedings. The Special Commission \"expressly classified as confidential\" the document and referred to the Parties' Confidentiality Agreement.174 The Special Commission further stated, among other things, that:175\n\n\u2026the [Mor\u00f3n Report] was requested in the context of the Special Commission's discussion and consultation process at the direct negotiations stage and qualifies as attorney work product and is therefore confidential by law and does not entail the existence, or the State of Peru's acceptance, of any violation of the Treaty or the claims alleged by the [Claimants]; it therefore does not harm the State's future defense in a potential arbitration against it.\n\n...\n\n\u2026in [Mr. Mor\u00f3n's] opinion, the complaint filed by the Arequipa Regional Government would be unlikely to succeed. Having identified the above-described risks and without this document entailing a ruling or qualification as to the legitimacy of the Arequipa Regional Government's actions that led to the court action being filed, the Special Commission is in a position to bring these to the Arequipa Regional Government's attention and recommend that the next steps be reassessed in light of the above.\n\n**R-131**, *Oficio No. 274-2017-EF/CE-36, del MEF (R.

The report stated, *inter alia*, that:181\n\n\u2026the Regional Executive has the obligation to take all measures necessary to safeguard and protect the entity's interests, without approval of a Regional Agreement being therefore required, as per the applicable legislation.\n\n**C-190**, Report No. 77-GRA\\_ARMA, 26 December 2017, p. 2. *See* Memorial \u00b6 126.\n\n178.\n\nOn 27 December 2017, RGA Governor Osorio issued a Regional Executive Resolution taking into account the matters referred to in \u00b6\u00b6 170, 175 and 177 above, and authorised the RGA Attorney General to withdraw the RGA Lawsuit.182\n\n**C-010**, Regional Executive Resolution No. 665-2017-GRA/GR, 27 December 2017, p. 3. *See* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 127-129; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 215.\n\n179.\n\nOn 8 March 2018, the court accepted the withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit.183\n\n**C-192**, *Resoluci\u00f3n No. 12 Expediente No. 1554-2017-0-0401-JR-CI-04, Corte Superior de Justicia Arequipa*, 8 March 2018. *See* Memorial \u00b6 131.\n\n180.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit took place in the context of the Parties' ongoing settlement discussions.184\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 245-248; *quoting* Ampuero First Statement \u00b6 31.\n\n181.\n\nOn 17 April 2018, Claimants referred to the withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit and withdrew their First Notice of Intent, stating:185\n\n*En consecuencia, el principal acto estatal que origin\u00f3 nuestra* [First Notice of Intent] *bajo el* [TPA] *ha cesado.

For the purposes of this Award, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to identify the individual by name, and will refrain from doing so.\n\n185.\n\nIn a document dated 29 March 2019 and received on 13 June 2019, the AEP notified Second Claimant's External Counsel that he was under investigation for signing the application for reconsideration that Second Claimant had submitted to ARMA in 2013, requesting ARMA to reconsider its initial \"Category III\" determination in relation to the Project (see \u00b6 109(ii) above).188\n\n*El investigado\u2026es parte de todo el proceso administrativo cuestionado en la presente investigaci\u00f3n y resulta ser c\u00f3mplice de cada uno de los investigados respecto a los pronunciamientos y autorizaciones emitidos por estos\u2026[cuya colaboraci\u00f3n] evidencia dolo por el contenido irregular de los documentos presentados ante el ARMA*.\n\n**C-284**, *Disposici\u00f3n No. 06-2019-FPEMAMP-AR, Fiscal\u00eda Provincial Especializada en Materia Ambiental, Distrito Fiscal de Arequipa*, 29 March 2019; **R-068**, *Disposici\u00f3n No. 07-2019-FPEMA-MP-AR, Fiscal\u00eda Ambiental de Arequipa*, 29 March 2019.\n\n186.\n\nAccording to Second Claimant's External Counsel, he was denied the opportunity to make a statement or declaration in his defence.189\n\nSecond Claimant's External Counsel First Statement \u00b6 58. *See* Memorial \u00b6 135.\n\n187.\n\nOn 2 May 2019, the AEP declared that it had finished the Criminal Investigation and was ready to bring formal charges.190\n\n**R-113**, *Disposici\u00f3n Fiscal No. 08-2018-FPEMA-MP-AR, Fiscal\u00eda Ambiental de Arequipa*, 2 May 2019; Second Claimant's External Counsel First Statement \u00b6 58. *See* Memorial \u00b6 135; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 227.\n\n188.\n\nOn 18 October 2019 (presented to a judge on 25 October 2019), the AEP brought criminal charges (\"**Criminal Proceedings**\") against the ARMA officials under Article 314 of the Peruvian Criminal Code, which prohibits a public official from granting a permit in an illegal manner. Second Claimant's External Counsel was charged under Article 25, third paragraph, of the Peruvian Criminal Code which permits criminal charges against private individuals as accomplices of a public official crime. The crime alleged was for acting as ARMA officials' accomplice by signing the application which they later approved. The AEP recommended a three-year prison sentence for Second Claimant's External Counsel.191\n\n**R-069**, *Acusaci\u00f3n Fiscal*, *Fiscal\u00eda Ambiental de Arequipa*, 18 October 2019.

The extension of the termination date of the contract would only be allowed for unjustified actions or omissions attributable to a governmental authority.223 These provisions would apply to future public auctions, and potentially to projects under the Third and Fourth Auctions which had not entered into commercial operation.224\n\n**RL-131**, *Resoluci\u00f3n Ministerial No. 143-2018-MEM/DM*, 9 November 2018; **C-018**, Proposed Supreme Decree No. 453-2018-MEM/DM, 11 November 2018. *See* Memorial \u00b6 153; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 275.\n\n**C-018**, Proposed Supreme Decree No. 453-2018-MEM/DM, 11 November 2018, p. 3.\n\n**RL-131**, *Resoluci\u00f3n Ministerial No. 143-2018-MEM*/*DM*, 9 November 2018, p. 9. *See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 276-277.\n\n209.\n\nAlso on 11 November 2018, OSINERGMIN issued comments opposing the Draft Supreme Decree. OSINERGMIN stated, among other things, that the Draft Supreme Decree sought to modify the scheme of incentives and penalties contained in the contracts under the Third and Fourth Auctions, distorting the object and purpose of the agreements that had been freely entered into.225 OSINERGMIN further mentioned that under the new regime in the Draft Supreme Decree, the State would not collect the amount of the performance bonds:226\n\n*...debe hacerse menci\u00f3n que los Concesionarios cuyos proyectos a\u00fan no han sido concluidos y que pertenecen a la tercera y cuarta Subasta, actualmente, mantienen a favor del Concedente (Ministerio de Energ\u00eda y Minas) Garant\u00edas de Fiel Cumplimiento, a trav\u00e9s de Cartas Fianzas Bancarias vigentes, las cuales garantizan la POC de sus proyectos en los plazos contractualmente acordados.

INTRODUCTION TO THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. O verview of T his A ward**\n--------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nIn the Sections that follow, the Tribunal sets out the Parties' positions with respect to the various aspects of the Parties' dispute, together with the Tribunal's analysis and determinations on each matter.\n\n240.\n\nWithin this introductory Section, in Section B below, the Tribunal shall address Claimants' request for adverse inferences.\n\n241.\n\nIn Section VII, the Tribunal deals with the issues raised in relation to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the admissibility of Claimants' claims. Claimants' claims in relation to alleged breaches of the RER Contract and Peruvian law are determined in Section VIII. Section IX covers the alleged breaches of the TPA. In Section X, the Tribunal addresses the alleged termination of the Confidentiality Agreement. Section XI deals with costs, and Section XII summarises the Tribunal's conclusions. Section XIII contains the dispositive.\n\n242.\n\nIn the analysis below, the Tribunal has considered not only the positions of the Parties as summarised in this Award, but also the numerous detailed arguments made in the Parties' written submissions and during the Hearing. In this regard, the Tribunal has received lengthy written submissions from the Parties running to approximately 2000 pages in total (excluding witness statements, expert reports and documentary evidence). In order to maintain the usefulness of this Award as a document, not every argument made by the Parties will be reproduced herein. The Tribunal has generally incorporated the Parties' respective positions into its reasoning without reproducing them in separate sections. To the extent that arguments are not referred to expressly, they have been subsumed into the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**B. R equest for A dverse I nferences**\n----------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal's document production orders were issued with PO 3 (see \u00b6 38 above). In PO 5, in response to an application from Claimants, the Tribunal issued further orders in relation to document production (see \u00b6 42 above).\n\n244.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent largely failed to comply with their document requests, even when ordered to do so by the Tribunal.258\n\nReply \u00b6 303.\n\n245.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal make a number of adverse inferences. Respondent opposes Claimants' requests, and submits that they have already been addressed by the Tribunal in PO 5.259\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 366-367.\n\n**(1) The Legal Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n246.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2) provides that the Tribunal may, *inter alia*, \"call upon the parties to produce documents\u2026\" ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(3) provides:\n\nThe parties shall cooperate with the Tribunal in the production of the evidence and in the other measures provided for in paragraph (2). The Tribunal shall take formal note of the failure of a party to comply with its obligations under this paragraph and of any reasons given for such failure.\n\n247.\n\nPO 2 sets out the applicable rules for the document production phase. PO 2 \u00b6 16.9 further provides:\n\nIn all other matters regarding the receipt of evidence that are not covered by this Procedural Order or others issued by the Tribunal, this procedure may be guided by the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, approved on 29 May 2010 by Resolution of the IBA Council.\n\n248.\n\nArticle 9(5) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence sets out:\n\nIf a Party fails without satisfactory explanation to produce any Document requested in a Request to Produce to which it has not objected in due time or fails to produce any Document ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal may infer that such document would be adverse to the interests of that Party.\n\n249.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the standard for making an adverse inference is a high one, which is not met by a simple failure to produce a document.260 To issue an adverse inference, Respondent submits that the following assumptions must be met: (i) the Tribunal is satisfied that the evidence requested exists and is in the possession, custody or control of the requested party; (ii) the party requesting the inference must have presented all relevant evidence in its possession that would support the inference; (iii) the requested inference is reasonable, consistent with the facts in the record, and logically related to the nature of the evidence; (iv) the party seeking the inference has presented sufficient evidence to satisfy a *prima facie* standard; and (v) the party against whom the inference would be drawn has been informed of its obligation to present evidence rebutting the adverse inference and has had adequate opportunity to present such evidence or explain the failure to present it.261\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 369.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 369; *citing, inter alia*, **RL-214**, *George Edwards v. the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, Oil Service Company of Iran*, Iran-US Claims Tribunal, IUSCT Case No. 251, Award No. 451-251-2, 5 December 1989; **RL-191**, *William J.

Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that additional documents were not produced because they do not support Respondent's interpretation of SD 24.262 According to Respondent, the requested documents do not exist, Claimants have not provided *prima facie* evidence to justify the inference and the inference requested is unreasonable and inconsistent with the facts of the case.263 Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimants seek to reverse the burden of proof as they cannot refute Respondent's interpretation of SD 24 based on the text of SD 24 and the witness testimony of Mr. Jaime Mendoza.264\n\n(ii) Request No. 2 for MINEM or OSINERGMIN memoranda or reports showing Respondent's contemporaneous interpretation of SD 24: Respondent produced two documents containing MINEM responses to third party questions, but no reports from MINEM or OSINERGMIN about SD 24 and its effects on the RER Promotion. Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that additional documents were not produced because they do not support Respondent's interpretation of SD 24.265 According to Respondent, in PO 5 the Tribunal already accepted its explanation that it had been unable to locate documents responsive to this request.266\n\n(iii) Request No. 4 for technical and legal reports from MINEM on the permitting process for RER projects: Respondent produced no documents. Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that the documents were not produced because they do not support Respondent's interpretation of the allocation of risks between the concessionaire and permitting agencies regarding timing, procedure and approvals of permits.267 According to Respondent, in PO 5 the Tribunal already accepted its explanation that it had been unable to locate documents responsive to this request.268\n\n(iv) Request No. 5 for documents from MINEM, OSINERGMIN or ARMA on the environmental classification process for RER projects: Respondent produced no documents. Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that the documents were not produced because they do not support Respondent's position that the RGA and the AEP had a justifiable reason to doubt ARMA's environmental classification of the Mamacocha Project.269 According to Respondent, in PO 5 the Tribunal already accepted its explanation that it had been unable to locate documents responsive to this request.270\n\n(v) Request No. 10 for different categories of documents relating to the RGA and the Project's environmental permits, including documents relied upon in the Regional Investigative Commission's report: Respondent produced four documents, being documents submitted by Second Claimant to ARMA in 2013. Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that additional documents were not produced because they do not support Respondent's position that the RGA and the AEP had a justifiable reason to doubt ARMA's environmental classification of the Mamacocha Project.271 Respondent submits that there is no basis to draw an adverse inference, because it exhibited more than 30 documents that fit the description of this request, conducted a diligent search, and did not withhold any documents.272\n\n(vi) Request No. 12 for documents regarding the RGA's decision to file the RGA Lawsuit: Respondent produced two documents, being the RGA Council's resolution recommending the RGA Lawsuit and correspondence between RGA officials transmitting the Regional Investigative Commission's report. Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that additional documents were not produced because they establish that the RGA Lawsuit was not commenced for *bona fide* administrative law purposes.273 According to Respondent, this request was already addressed by the Tribunal's direction in PO 5 for Respondent to produce any further responsive documents.274\n\n(vii) Request No. 22 for documents regarding MINEM's initial analysis of the Third Extension Request: Respondent produced no documents. Claimants request the Tribunal to infer that documents were not produced because they do not support Respondent's position that the Third Extension Request was effectively dead on arrival.275 According to Respondent, in PO 5 the Tribunal already accepted its explanation that it had been unable to locate documents responsive to this request.276\n\nReply \u00b6 307.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 384.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 382-383.\n\nReply \u00b6 308.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 375.\n\nReply \u00b6 309.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 375.\n\nReply \u00b6 310.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 375.\n\nReply \u00b6 311.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 377-378.\n\nReply \u00b6 312.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 385.\n\nReply \u00b6 313.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 375.\n\n253.\n\nTaking into account the Parties' respective views and the directions already issued in PO 5, the Tribunal is not persuaded that there is sufficient basis to draw adverse inferences as sought by Claimants. In particular, it is not clear in each case that the evidence exists and is in Respondent's possession, custody or control but has been withheld. Additionally, the Tribunal is not in a position to confirm the reasonability of the inferences sought independently of its full assessment of all the circumstances of the case and all evidence and arguments presented to the Tribunal. The Tribunal nevertheless notes Claimants' views on the strength and weight of the evidence that has or has not been provided, and shall take these views into account when weighing the evidence presented by the Parties to the Tribunal in support of their respective cases when reaching its determinations.\n\n254.\n\nNoting that Respondent requests an order for costs against Claimants in relation to this issue,277 the Tribunal reserves its decision on costs to be addressed together with the other costs in Section XI of this Award.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 386.\n\n**VII. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n---------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nBefore deciding on the merits of the dispute before it, the Tribunal must be satisfied that it has jurisdiction over the claims put forward, and that those claims are admissible. In order to address jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal will set out the relevant provisions of the relevant legal instruments in Section A below. In Section B, the Tribunal will summarise the Parties' respective positions on the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, with the United States' Non-Disputing Party Submission and the Parties' comments thereon contained in Section C. Section D contains the Tribunal's analysis of jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n**A.

For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with the license, authorization, permit or similar instrument has the characteristics of an investment.\" Appearing as footnote 15 in this provision of the TPA: \"The term 'investment' does not include an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action.\"\n\n262.\n\nTPA Article 10.28 defines \"investment agreement\" as:\n\n\u2026a written agreement286 between a national authority287 of a Party and a covered investment or an investor of another Party, on which the covered investment or the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself, that grants rights to the covered investment or investor:\n\n(a) with respect to natural resources that a national authority controls, such as for their exploration, extraction, refining, transportation, distribution, or sale;\n\n(b) to supply services to the public on behalf of the Party, such as power generation or distribution, water treatment or distribution, or telecommunications; or\n\n(c) to undertake infrastructure projects, such as the construction of roads, bridges, canals, dams, or pipelines, that are not for the exclusive or predominant use and benefit of the government[\u2026]\n\nAppearing as footnote 16 in this provision of the TPA: \"'Written agreement' refers to an agreement in writing, executed by both parties, whether in a single instrument or in multiple instruments, that creates an exchange of rights and obligations, binding on both parties under the law applicable under Article 10.22.2.

(a) No claim may be submitted to arbitration:\n\n(i) for breach of an investment authorization under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B), or\n\n(ii) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C),\n\nif the claimant (for claims brought under 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under 10.16.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure.\n\n(b) For greater certainty, if a claimant elects to submit a claim of the type described in subparagraph (a) to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, that election shall be definitive, and the claimant may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.\n\n**(2) The ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------\n\n272.\n\nICSID Convention Article 25 provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n...\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n**(3) The RER Contract**\n------------------------\n\n273.\n\nClause 11 of the RER Contract is entitled \"Dispute Resolution,\" and provides as follows, in relevant part:295\n\n11.1 Any conflict or dispute that may arise between the Parties as to the interpretation, execution, fulfillment or any aspect concerning the existence, validity or termination of the Contract shall be defined as a Technical Dispute or a Non-Technical Dispute.\n\nWhere it is agreed that the dispute is a Technical Dispute, it shall be settled in accordance with the procedure provided for in Clause 11.2. Any conflicts or disputes other than those of a technical nature (each referred to as a \"Non-Technical Dispute\") shall be settled in accordance with the procedure provided for in Clause 11.3.\n\nIf the Parties do not agree on whether the conflict or dispute is a Technical Dispute or a Non-Technical Dispute, then such conflict or dispute shall be considered a Non-Technical Dispute and shall be settled in accordance with the relevant procedure provided for in Clause 11.3.\n\nNo Technical Dispute shall arise out of grounds for termination of the Contract, which shall be deemed Non-Technical Disputes in all cases.\n\n\u2026\n\n11.3 Non-Technical Disputes shall be settled through national or international arbitration of law, as follows:\n\na) Disputes involving amounts exceeding Twenty Million Dollars (USD 20,000,000) or its equivalent in national currency shall be settled through international arbitration of law by means of a procedure carried out in accordance with the Rules for Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States approved by Peru through Legislative Resolution No. 26210, to whose standards the Parties submit unconditionally. Where the Concessionaire Company does not meet the requirement to resort to the ICSID, such dispute shall be subject to the rule referred to in subparagraph b) below.\n\nThe Arbitration shall be carried out in the city of Washington, D.C., or in the city of Lima, at the choice of the Concessionaire Company, and shall be conducted in Spanish. The relevant arbitral award shall be rendered within ninety (90) Days following the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three (3) members. Each party shall appoint one arbitrator and the third one shall be appointed by contract of the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties, who in turn shall serve as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. Where the two arbitrators fail to reach an agreement on the appointment of the third arbitrator within fifteen (15) Days following the date of appointment of the second arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICSID at the request of any of the parties.\n\nWhere one of the parties fails to appoint the relevant arbitrator within fifteen (15) Days from the date of receipt of the relevant request for appointment, it shall be deemed that such party has waived its right and the arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICSID at the request of the other party.\n\nb) Disputes involving amounts equivalent to or lower than Twenty Million Dollars (USD 20,000,000) or its equivalent in national currency, or which cannot be quantified or assessed in money, shall be settled through national arbitration of law by means of a procedure carried out in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the National and International Arbitration Center of the Chamber of Commerce of Lima, to whose standards the Parties submit unconditionally. Legislative Decree No. 1071, which regulates Arbitration, shall apply in the alternative. The Arbitration shall be carried out in the city of Lima, Peru, and shall be conducted in Spanish. The relevant arbitration award shall be rendered no later than ninety (90) days following the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three (3) members. Each party shall appoint one arbitrator and the third one shall be appointed by contract of the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties, who in turn shall serve as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. Where the two arbitrators fail to reach agreement on the appointment of the third arbitrator within ten (10) Days following the date of appointment of the second arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Chamber of Commerce of Lima at the request of any of the Parties. Where one of the Parties fails to appoint the relevant arbitrator within ten (10) Days from the date of receipt of the relevant request for appointment made by the other party, it shall be deemed that such party has waived its right and the arbitrator shall be appointed by the Chamber of Commerce of Lima at the request of the other Party.\n\n11.4 The Parties agree that the award issued by the Arbitral Tribunal shall be final and unappealable. Thus, the Parties waive their right to file an appeal proper, a cassation appeal or any other remedy challenging the arbitral award, and declare that the award shall be binding, immediately enforceable and shall be fully complied with.\n\n11.5 While the arbitration is pending, the Parties shall continue fulfilling, to the extent possible, their contractual obligations, including those obligations that are the subject-matter of the arbitration.\n\n11.6 Where the matter of arbitration involves the fulfillment of the obligations guaranteed by a bond pursuant to Clause 8, where applicable, said bond shall not be enforced and shall remain in effect during the arbitration procedure.\n\n11.7 All the expenses incurred as a result of the settlement of the Technical or Non-Technical Dispute, including fees to be paid to the Expert or the Arbitrators taking part in the settlement of the Dispute, shall be borne by the losing Party, unless the Expert or the Arbitrators decide otherwise.\n\n11.8 Costs and expenses such as advisors' fees, internal costs, or others that are attributable to a Party individually, are excluded from the provisions of this Clause.\n\n11.9 The Concessionaire Company hereby expressly, unconditionally and irrevocably waives its right to file any diplomatic claim.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.\n\n**B.

Principles Applicable to the Jurisdictional Analysis***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nRespondent argues that four legal principles should guide the Tribunal in its jurisdictional analysis. First, that consent by the State must be unequivocal and indisputable, and is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of ICSID, and by extension the Tribunal.296 Such consent, in Respondent's view, is often conditional upon certain requirements being fulfilled at the time of the request for arbitration to ICSID.297\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 485-486; *quoting*, *inter alia*, **RL-089**, *Informe de los Directores Ejecutivos acerca del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados*, 18 March 1965, \u00b6 23; **RL-059**, *Daimler Financial Services AG v.

Jurisdiction*** **Ratione Personae*****; Second Claimant***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nSince CH Mamacocha is incorporated in Peru, Respondent submits that it *prima facie* does not satisfy the *ratione personae* jurisdiction requirement under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.303 Respondent also argues that Claimants have failed to prove that the nationality exception under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is met, since Respondent has not \"*acordado atribuirle [a CH Mamacocha] el car\u00e1cter de 'nacional de otro Estado Contratante*.'\"304\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 565.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 566; *quoting* **RL-092**, ICSID Convention, Art. 25(2)(b); *see* Request for Arbitration \u00b6 81; Memorial \u00b6 2.\n\n281.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the exception under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is a manifestation of consent to arbitrate, and as such must be unequivocal and indisputable.305 In this way, Respondent submits that an attribution of the character of foreign nationality is normally explicit. Where it is implicit, Respondent submits that the expression of its intention should leave no doubt.306\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 568; *citing* **RL-059**, *Daimler Financial Services AG v.

Jurisdiction*** **Ratione Voluntatis*****: Waiver Requirement***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimants have not complied with the waiver requirement in TPA Article 10.18(2)(b). Respondent argues that in violation of this waiver requirement, Claimants have brought two types of proceeding before this Tribunal in respect of the same underlying measures: (i) First Claimant's claims under the TPA, on its own behalf and on behalf of Second Claimant; and (ii) Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract.309\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 497; Rejoinder \u00b6 426.\n\n284.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimants' formal compliance by way of its written waiver does not constitute effective material compliance with the requirement.310 Respondent submits that Claimants' claims under the TPA and the RER Contract constitute multiple actions and should be dismissed for failure to comply with the waiver.311\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 498; *citing* **RL-077**, *Waste Management, Inc. v.

Jurisdiction*** **Ratione Voluntatis*****: Criminal Investigation Claims***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants failed to comply with the jurisdictional notice and waiting requirement under TPA Article 10.16.2 with respect to their claims based on the initiation and formalisation of the criminal investigation by the Arequipa Environmental Prosecutor's Office (\"**Criminal Investigation Claims**\"), leading to the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction over those claims.314 This is because TPA Article 10.16.2 requires prior notification of \"the legal and factual basis for each claim,\" in the absence of which, in the Respondent's view, its consent to arbitrate is not perfected.315\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 518, 526; Rejoinder \u00b6 467.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 519-520; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Arts. 10.16.2, 10.17.1.\n\n288.\n\nRespondent argues that 94 days after the Third Notice of Intent, on 30 August 2019 Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration, claiming for the first time that the Criminal Investigation Claims constitute a breach on the alleged basis of (i) Respondent's initiation and formalisation of the criminal investigation against Second Claimant's counsel; and (ii) Respondent's declared intention to bring criminal charges against Second Claimant.316 Since these were not mentioned in the Third Notice of Intent, Respondent submits that they are outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction and must be dismissed.317\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 521; *citing* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.16(2)(c); **C-023**, Latam Hydro LLC and CH Mamacocha, S.R.L.'s Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration, 28 May 2019.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 526.\n\n289.\n\nRespondent relies on the decisions of previous international tribunals which have recognised, in its view, that notice and waiting requirements are conditions of State consent, and failure to comply with them requires dismissal of the relevant claims.318\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 522-523; *quoting* **RL-090**, *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v.

Rather, it is for the Court to determine from all the facts and taking into account all the arguments advanced by the Parties, 'whether the force of the arguments militating in favour of jurisdiction is preponderant, and to ascertain whether an intention on the part of the Parties exists to confer jurisdiction upon it'.\n\nReply \u00b6 319; *quoting* **CL-140/RL-199**, *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

In this respect, First Claimant brings claims: (i) on its own behalf under TPA Article 10.16(1)(a)(i)(A); and (ii) on behalf of Second Claimant under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C) for Peru's alleged breaches of an investment agreement.329 With respect to their claims relating both to investment protection and the investment agreement, Claimants contend that they have \"incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of\" these alleged breaches.330\n\nMemorial \u00b6 188; Reply \u00b6 314.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 210; *quoting* **C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Arts. 10.16(1)(A)(ii), 10.16(2)(A)(ii) [sic.]. *See also* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 391-393.\n\n299.\n\nAccording to Claimants, First Claimant is an \"enterprise of\" the United States of America within the meaning of TPA Articles 1.3 and 10.28 (see \u00b6\u00b6 259-260 above).331 On the basis that First Claimant has \"made an investment in the territory of another Party,\" i.e., Peru, Claimants argue that it is a United States \"enterprise\" and a protected investor under the TPA.332\n\nMemorial \u00b6 192.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 193.\n\n300.\n\nFirst Claimant further invokes TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C) as the basis for its claim on behalf of Second Claimant for Respondent's alleged breaches of the RER Contract.333\n\nMemorial \u00b6 194.\n\n301.\n\nAccording to Claimants, at all relevant times Second Claimant has been 100% owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by a US citizen or US entity.334 In this respect, until May 2014 Second Claimant was controlled and beneficially owned by Mr. Jacobson. From May 2014 to 19 December 2016, Second Claimant was indirectly owned and controlled by First Claimant, through several levels of entities that First Claimant owned and controlled in the US, the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Belgium and Chile. On 19 December 2016, the intermediate corporate levels were collapsed, making First Claimant the 100% direct owner of Second Claimant on that date.335\n\nMemorial \u00b6 197; *citing* Jacobson First Statement \u00b6 88.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 196, \u00a7 II.Q.\n\n302.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent agreed to treat Second Claimant as a national of another Contracting State for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention: (i) by entering into a dispute resolution clause requiring resolution of large disputes before ICSID; (ii) by including Second Claimant in its negotiations before the Special Commission; and (iii) through other course of dealing.336\n\nReply \u00b6 397.\n\n303.\n\nClaimants further submit that the agreement to treat a company as a foreign national because of foreign control does not require any specific form.337\n\nReply \u00b6 404; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 24. *See also* Reply \u00b6 405; Reply \u00b6 403; *quoting* **RL-064**, *Cable Television of Nevis, Ltd. and Cable Television of Nevis Holdings, Ltd. v.

In this respect, Claimants submit that the RER Contract incorporates by reference and was designed to implement Legislative Decree No. 1002, which created Peru's renewable energy resources program, in part, \"to facilitate the implementation of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and its Protocol of Amendment\" by attracting US investors to invest in RER concessions.338 For Claimants, the RER Law, and by inference the RER Contract, were expressly designed to attract foreign investment, with the requirement that foreign investors under the RER Program invest and operate through local operating companies.339\n\nReply \u00b6 412.\n\nReply \u00b6 412 *citing* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.44.\n\n***c.

In this respect, Claimants argue that the first measure by the Peruvian Government that caused damage to Claimants was the RGA Lawsuit, which they learned about in March 2017.352\n\nMemorial \u00b6 216(b).\n\nMemorial \u00b6 216(c).\n\nMemorial \u00b6 216(d); *citing* Benzaqu\u00e9n First Statement \u00b6 15.\n\n311.\n\nClaimants argue that claims additional to those listed in the Notice of Intent are allowed provided they do not change the general character of the case and are related to the same dispute.

Specifically, Claimants argue that First Claimant's investment encompasses: (i) an enterprise (Second Claimant); (ii) ownership of shares in an enterprise (Second Claimant); (iii) loans to Second Claimant; (iv) concession contracts; (v) concessions; (vi) licenses; (vii) authorizations and permits; and (viii) tangible and intangible property rights, among others.360\n\nMemorial \u00b6 201; *citing* Jacobson First Statement \u00b6 89.\n\n316.\n\nAccording to Claimants, First Claimant began investing directly in Peru in 2012, and Mr. Jacobson and First Claimant have made contributions amounting to tens of millions of dollars since then towards the development of the Mamacocha Project.361\n\nMemorial \u00b6 202; *quoting* Jacobson First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 82-85. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 203.\n\n317.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* includes the claims made with respect to the Upstream Projects, which were an integral part of the overall investment by Claimants.

According to Claimants, when they decided to invest in Peru they commissioned a feasibility study for the Mamacocha Project and a conceptual design for the Upstream Projects.363 Moreover, Claimants argue that the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects were presented to prospective investors as a combined product, to be developed in phases starting with the Mamacocha Project first, and, once construction was underway, Second Claimant would transition from the development of the Mamacocha Project to the development of the Upstream Projects.364\n\nReply \u00b6 433; *citing* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 50-58; **C-102**, Email from A.

Claimants rely on the preamble to the RER Contract in this respect, as follows:371\n\nThis Concession Contract for the Supply of Renewable Energy (the \"Contract\") is made and entered into by and between the Peruvian State, herein represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (the \"Grantor\"), and the Concessionaire Company, subject to the following terms and conditions[\u2026]\n\nMemorial \u00b6 226; *quoting* **C-002**, RER Contract, Preamble. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 243.\n\n322.\n\nIn support of its argument that the Peruvian State (and not MINEM) is liable to Second Claimant for breaches of the RER Contract, Claimants rely on:\n\n(i) Clause 1.4.31 of the RER Contract, defining MINEM as \"the Ministry of Energy and Mines, which enters into this Contract on behalf of the Government\";372\n\n(ii) Ministerial Resolution No. 023-2014-MEM/DM of 17 January 2014 annexed to the RER Contract, which \"authorized the General Director of Electricity, on behalf of the Ministry of Energy and Mines as the Grantor, to sign, on behalf of the Peruvian State, the Concession Agreements for the Supply of Renewable Energy to the National Interconnected Electric System (SEIN)\u2026\"373\n\n(iii) The opinions of their experts Dr. Qui\u00f1ones and Dr. Benavides;374 and\n\n(iv) Article 43 of Peru's Political Constitution: \"[t]he State is one and indivisible.

NDP S ubmission**\n----------------------\n\n**(1) The U.S. NDP Submission**\n-------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nIn its NDP Submission, the United States provided its interpretation regarding the following three issues related to jurisdiction under the TPA: (i) the burden of proof in the context of jurisdictional objections (Article 10.22.1); (ii) the requirement for claimants to waive other dispute settlement procedures (Article 10.18.2(b)); and (iii) the requirement of delivery of a notice of intent prior to the commencement of the arbitration (Article 10.16.2).\n\n324.\n\nWith respect to item (i) of \u00b6 323 above, the United States submits that, under general principles of international law, in the context of a jurisdictional objection in international arbitration, the claimant must prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish the tribunal's jurisdiction, while the respondent has the burden to prove the affirmative defenses it raises, if any.376\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.\n\n325.\n\nWith respect to item (ii) of \u00b6 323 above, the United States sets out its interpretation on the scope of the waiver requirement provided in TPA Article 10.18.2(b). After emphasizing that the purpose of this provision is to avoid concurrent and overlapping proceedings, the United States submits that this article requires investors to \"definitively and irrevocably\" waive all rights to pursue claims in another forum. Such waiver includes administrative tribunals or courts under the law of any Party or any other binding dispute settlement procedure, but it does not impede investors to submit concurrent treaty and contract claims pursuant to TPA Article 10.16.1 before one tribunal, insofar as issues such as potential double-recovery and inconsistent findings are otherwise addressed.377\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.\n\n326.\n\nWith respect to item (iii) of \u00b6 323 above, the United States refers to the notice of intent and \"cooling-off\" prerequisites to arbitration provided in TPA Article 10.16.2. It argues that under TPA Article 10.17 the Contracting Parties only consented to arbitrate investment disputes \"in accordance with this [Treaty].\" According to the United States, such consent to arbitrate is not perfected if the investor does not deliver a valid notice of intent 90 days prior to arbitration pursuant to the procedural requirements of Article 10.16.2. The United States further qualify these requirements as \"mandatory\" and \"explicit\" ones which serve substantial functions.378\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 11-16.\n\n**(2) Claimants' Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, Claimants filed their observations on the NDP Submission (\"**Claimants' NDP Observations**\") in which they addressed the issues of interpretation of the TPA put forward by the United States, as briefly summarized below.\n\n328.\n\nFirst, Claimants submit that the United States' comments on the burden of proof fail to distinguish between proof on jurisdiction and proof of specific facts. Although they do not oppose the United States' submission that a claimant has the burden of proving its claims, Claimants consider that such concept is not useful to the question of jurisdiction in which the weight of legal arguments and the interpretation of the relevant treaty are decisive. Moreover, in Claimants' view, the United States fail to acknowledge the differentiations made by prior tribunals regarding issues of jurisdiction and the burden of proof on issues of merits, including the application of burden-shifting rules once a party has provided enough *prima facie* evidence regarding a fact to raise a presumption.379\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.\n\n329.\n\nSecond, Claimants submit that the NDP Submission contains an \"unambiguous endorsement\" of Claimants' argument that the waiver requirement of TPA Article 10.18.2(b) does not preclude Claimants from submitting concurrent treaty and contract claims before the Tribunal.380 They highlight that the United States' position is in line with Claimants' prior submissions and expert report which were also based on \"the ordinary meaning\" of the terms and \"textual context\" of TPA Article 10.18.2(b). Based on the foregoing, Claimants conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction both over Claimants' treaty and contractual claims in this arbitration.381\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\n330.\n\nThird, Claimants address the United States' comments concerning the notice of intent requirement stipulated in TPA Article 10.16.2. Claimants agree with the NDP's position that such prerequisite to arbitration serves \"important functions\" in the dispute and assert that such functions have been served in the present case.382\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n331.\n\nClaimants further point out that the NDP Submission has not addressed Respondent's argument that the specifics of every claim must be included in a notice of intent to be submitted to arbitration. According to Claimants, such interpretation of TPA Article 10.16(2) would be \"unworkable\" and would offer the States the \"obvious moral hazard\" of allowing and promoting breaches after the notice of intent. Moreover, in their view, Respondent's position would be contrary to a contextual reading of the TPA, the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, and to related prior case law.383\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 13-19.\n\n(3) **Respondent's Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, Respondent filed its observations on the NDP Submission (\"**Respondent's NDP Observations**\") addressing the issues of interpretation of the TPA raised by the United States, as briefly summarized below in relation to jurisdiction.\n\n333.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, Respondent submits that the common interpretation of the TPA by the United States and Peru - as reflected in their written submissions \u2013 must be taken into account by the Tribunal as it constitutes a \"subsequent agreement\" and \"subsequent practice\" of the Treaty parties concerning the interpretation of certain provisions of the Treaty under Article 31 of the VCLT. Thus, in its view, the Tribunal must give it authoritative weight as an unequivocal manifestation of their will and intention on the interpretation of the TPA.384\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 4-14.\n\n334.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent argues that under the general rule of interpretation provided by Article 31 of the VCLT, a subsequent agreement or practice of Respondent and the United States must be considered for the purpose of interpreting the TPA.385 Furthermore, Respondent clarifies that such \"subsequent agreement\" may result from separate acts or statements by each party as long as it manifests an undertaking by each party and reflects a common understanding of one or more treaty provisions.386\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.\n\n335.\n\nAfter establishing its position on the significance that must be given to the Treaty Parties' submissions, Respondent argues that both the United States and Respondent agree on the interpretation of the TPA.387\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 15-55.\n\n336.\n\nFirst, Respondent submits that the NDP Submission confirms Respondent's position that Claimants have the burden to prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In particular, Respondent emphasises that TPA Article 10.22.1 provides that the Tribunal must decide the issues in dispute in accordance with the Treaty and \"applicable rules of international law.\" According to Respondent, the United States acknowledges that this reference includes the general principle that a claimant has the burden of proving its claims, including questions of jurisdiction. Since Claimants failed to meet this burden, in its view their case should be dismissed.388\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.\n\n337.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that the United States' interpretation regarding the waiver requirement contained in TPA Article 10.18.2(b) also supports Respondent's position that such waiver prevents Claimants from submitting to international arbitration parallel or duplicative claims that are not based on the TPA.389\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 18-23.\n\n338.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent argues that: (i) the NDP Submission has endorsed that the waiver requirement encompasses parallel proceedings \"under any *other* binding dispute settlement procedure,\" which includes international arbitration proceedings such as the present arbitration;390 and (ii) although the United States noted that treaty and contract claims could proceed concurrently before one tribunal when both types of claims are submitted \"under Article 10.16.1,\" Claimants' contract claims do not meet this standard as they are also brought \"under Clause 11.3(a) of the RER Contract\" and refer to the same measures underlying Claimants' claims under TPA Article 10.16.1.391\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 19-20 (emphasis in original).\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n339.\n\nThird, Respondent asserts that the NDP Submission has supported Peru's interpretation that, under the notice of intent prerequisite to arbitration set out in Article 10.16.2 of the TPA, tribunals lack jurisdiction over claims that were not notified in accordance with such392 provision.\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 24-30.\n\n340.\n\nIn particular, Respondent submits that: (i) the NDP Submission confirms that the notice requirement constitutes a jurisdictional condition and not a procedural rule as alleged by Claimants, and thus failure to comply with this pre-arbitral requisite affects the Parties' consent to arbitrate and precludes the Tribunal's jurisdiction;393 and (ii) as recognized by the United States, the notice of intent serves \"important functions\" that cannot be achieved if it merely identifies the overall dispute and, therefore, to achieve its purpose such notice must provide detailed information regarding each claim following the \"explicit and mandatory\" requirements set out in TPA Article 10.16.2.394\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6 25.\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6 26-30.\n\n**D. T ribunal ' s A nalysis**\n------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nClaimants raise three types of claims in this arbitration, being: (i) claims brought by First Claimant on its own behalf under the TPA and the ICSID Convention; (ii) claims brought by First Claimant on behalf of Second Claimant under the TPA and the ICSID Convention; and (iii) claims brought by Second Claimant on its own behalf under the RER Contract and the ICSID Rules under the ICSID Convention.395 The claims in items (i) and (ii) are First Claimant's claims under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, even if those in item (ii) are made on behalf of Second Claimant. The claims in item (iii) are Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 188, 224; Reply \u00b6 314; **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 54.\n\n342.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal first addresses the guiding principles relevant to the determination of its jurisdiction. Thereafter, the Tribunal shall first analyse various aspects of its jurisdiction under the TPA and the ICSID Convention (i.e., jurisdiction *ratione personae*, jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, jurisdiction *ratione materiae*) before turning to its jurisdiction under the RER Contract.\n\n**(1) Guiding Principles for the Determination of Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nSince Claimants have raised claims both under the TPA and the RER Contract, the Tribunal first addresses its jurisdiction under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, before turning to the RER Contract.\n\n***a. Jurisdiction and Admissibility under the TPA and the ICSID Convention***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nIn order for the Tribunal to establish whether it has jurisdiction under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, it is necessary to consider the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae*, *ratione voluntatis*, *ratione materiae,* and *ratione temporis* which are covered by several provisions of the TPA and the ICSID Convention, as outlined below (see \u00b6\u00b6 256 to 272 above setting out a number of relevant treaty provisions). These provisions set the outer limits to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as well as conditions upon the exercise of that jurisdiction. As explained in relation to the jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, there is a dispute between the Parties as to which requirements are a matter of jurisdiction, or are procedural requirements only. The Tribunal shall address these matters in its reasoning below.\n\n345.\n\nThere is no dispute that the requirements under the TPA and the ICSID Convention are cumulative, in that the provisions of both must be satisfied in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction in this matter.396 It is likewise uncontroversial between the Parties that consent of the Parties is the cornerstone of ICSID's jurisdiction.397 The Tribunal considers that such consent should be clear and unambiguous, or in the terminology used by Respondent, unequivocal and indisputable.398\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 488; Reply \u00b6 318.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 485; Reply \u00b6 318.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 485-486; *quoting*, *inter alia*, **RL-089**, *Informe de los Directores Ejecutivos acerca del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados*, 18 March 1965, \u00b6 23; **RL-059**, *Daimler Financial Services AG v.

Jurisdiction Under RER Contract***\n----------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe requirements to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract are set out in Clause 11.3(a) thereof (see \u00b6 273 above). The Tribunal will consider whether the requirements of Clause 11.3(a) of the RER Contract are met in \u00b6\u00b6 560 *et seq.* below.\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, for present purposes, that the Parties' respective submissions presuppose that the requirements of the ICSID Convention, together with the ICSID Arbitration Rules, apply to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract.399 This not being a disputed issue before it, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis of the Parties' shared understanding.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 237 and 254 (duplicated text) regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract:  \n\"CHM need only satisfy two criteria: \u2026second, the Concessionaire company needs to comply with the requirements to resort to ICSID.\"; Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 239, 256: \"\u2026CHM satisfies the second limb of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and qualifies as a 'National of another Contracting State' for purposes of the ICSID Convention.\"; **RD-01**, Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 15: \"No jurisdiction over CHM's claims: CHM is not a 'national of another Contracting State' under ICSID Convention Art. 25(2)(b).\"; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 567; Rejoinder \u00b6 520.\n\n***c. Burden of Proof***\n------------------------\n\n348.\n\nIn their pleadings, the Parties disagree on the burden of proof for the establishment of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In this regard, Claimants submit, relying in support on the opinion of Prof. Schreuer, that a focus on burden of proof in relation to jurisdiction is not correct. In their view, it has been established by the International Court of Justice and investment tribunals that it is for the court or tribunal to weigh the legal arguments to establish jurisdiction.400\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 319; *quoting* **CL-140/RL-199**, *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

Claimants accepted that \"*en la medida en que se cuestionen hechos que hacen a la jurisdicci\u00f3n, resultan de aplicaci\u00f3n las reglas habituales* [\u2026] *La carga de la prueba recae en la parte que afirma un hecho, sea ella la parte demandante o la demandada*.\"405\n\nClaimants' Opening Presentation, Transcript (Day 1), 7 March 2022, 53:6-11; *see* **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 57; *quoting* **RL-070**, *Spence International Investments, LLC, et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award, 30 May 2017, \u00b6 239.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal affirms the distinction drawn by Respondent, and accepted by Claimants, between the proof of factual assertions relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the interpretation of legal instruments providing for such jurisdiction. Where the Tribunal's jurisdiction depends on the existence of certain facts, such as the nationality of a claimant or the existence of an investment, Claimants bear the burden of establishing those facts. Respondent likewise bears, in principle, the burden of proving any factual assertions underlying its jurisdictional objections.\n\n354.\n\nWith respect to the law, it is for the Tribunal to determine whether and the extent to which it has jurisdiction on the basis of the relevant legal instruments, taking into account the materials presented by the Parties. In the context of that legal determination, it may not be useful to speak of a burden of proof with respect to jurisdiction.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeds to decide upon its jurisdiction in this matter on the basis of the relevant legal instruments, noting that each Party bears the burden of proving its factual assertions made to establish or refute that jurisdiction.\n\n***d. Power to Determine Jurisdiction***\n----------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe separate question of the Tribunal's power to examine the basis of its jurisdiction *proprio motu* is not of direct relevance in the present case. Since it has been raised by the Parties in the context of the burden of proof, the Tribunal observes that, in principle, there is no general obligation on the Tribunal to address a matter of jurisdiction on its own motion. A tribunal may be required to determine a matter of jurisdiction in certain situations, such as when: (i) an objection to jurisdiction is raised by the responding party; or (ii) the responding party does not appear (in which case, the tribunal would raise jurisdiction *proprio motu*). In other situations, it may be prudent to examine and make a determination on a jurisdictional issue, but the tribunal is not required to do so.\n\n***(2)*** **TPA and ICSID Convention: Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nFor the purposes of First Claimant's claims under the TPA, in this Section the Tribunal addresses its jurisdiction over First Claimant, Second Claimant and Respondent under the TPA and under the ICSID Convention, which requirements are to be applied cumulatively (see \u00b6 345 above).\n\n***a. First Claimant***\n-----------------------\n\n358.\n\nTPA Article 10.16 refers to the right of \"the claimant\" to submit a claim to arbitration. The claimant is defined in TPA Article 10.28 as \"an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party\" (see \u00b6 256 above). The definition of \"investor\" under TPA Article 10.28 includes \"an enterprise of a Party, that attempts through concrete action to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party\u2026\" (see \u00b6 258 above). In turn, as per TPA Article 1.3, an \"enterprise\" is \"any entity constituted or organized under applicable law\u2026including any corporation\u2026\" (see \u00b6 260 above).\n\n359.\n\nFor the purposes of its jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the TPA, the Tribunal must therefore be satisfied that First Claimant: (i) is an enterprise of a TPA Party (in this case, the United States); that (ii) has attempted to make, is making or has made an investment in the territory of Peru. Claimants submit that these criteria are fulfilled.406\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 192-193.\n\n360.\n\nRespondent has not objected to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over First Claimant. The Tribunal nevertheless finds it prudent to satisfy itself of its jurisdiction over First Claimant.\n\n361.\n\nAs regards item (i) of \u00b6 359 above, according to Claimants, First Claimant is an \"enterprise of\" the United States of America, being a limited liability company constituted under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 2014, with Delaware File Number 5527780, and principal place of business at 1865 Brickell Avenue, A-1603, Miami, Florida 33129-1645, United States.407\n\nMemorial \u00b6 192; *citing* **C-019**, Latam Hydro LLC, Certificate of Formation, 5 May 2014.\n\n362.\n\nBased on the Certificate of Formation filed by Claimants, the Tribunal is satisfied that First Claimant is a United States limited liability company, and therefore an \"enterprise of a Party\" under TPA Articles 1.3 and 10.28.\n\n363.\n\nAs regards item (ii) \u00b6 359 above, Claimants submit that First Claimant's investment under TPA Article 10.28 encompasses, *inter alia*:408\n\n\u2026an enterprise [Second Claimant]; ownership of shares in an enterprise [Second Claimant]; loans to [Second Claimant]; concession contracts; concessions, licenses, authorizations and permits; tangible and intangible property rights\u2026\n\nMemorial \u00b6 201.\n\n364.\n\nUnder TPA Article 10.28, an \"investment\" is defined as \"every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment,\" which includes \"the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk\" (see \u00b6 261 above). This provision also gives examples of several forms that an investment may take, including \"an enterprise,\" \"shares\u2026in an enterprise,\" \"concessions\u2026and other similar contracts\" (see \u00b6 261 above).\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal shall give further consideration to the precise scope of Claimants' investments in Peru below, since it is also relevant to Respondent's objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over claims made with respect to the existence of an investment agreement (see \u00b6\u00b6 496 *et seq.* below) and the Upstream Projects (see \u00b6\u00b6529 *et seq.* below). For present purposes, the Tribunal is satisfied that First Claimant made an investment in the territory of Peru, among other things in the form of its 100% direct and indirect ownership of Second Claimant, effected through different corporate structures in the period 2014-2019.409\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, **C-070**, *Registro de la Transferencia de Participaciones de Latam Energy Chile SpA y Latam Energy Chile SpA II a Latam Hydro LLC y Modificaci\u00f3n del Estatuto*, 26 December 2016; **C-072**, *Registro del Aumento de Capital y Modificaci\u00f3n del Estatuto de CH Mamacocha*, 22 June 2017; in addition to the chain of ownership in the period January 2014 to December 2016 reflected in exhibits **C-065**, Greinvest Latin America Ltd. - Board Resolution Transfer of Shares to Latam Hydro LLC, 7 May 2014; **C-066**, Greinvest Latin America Ltd - Jacobson Instrument of Transfer of shares to Latam Hydro LLC, 7 May 2014; **C-067**, Greinvest Latin America Ltd Share Certificate (owner Latam Hydro LLC), 7 May 2014; **C-068**, Greinvest Americas LLC - Jacobson Instrument of Transfer of membership units to Latam Hydro LLC, 7 May 2014; **C-077**, Transfer of Ownership Savrocorp Solutions Ltd shares to Greinvest Latin America Ltd., 24 October 2013; **C-078**, Certificate of Change of Name, Savrocorp Solutions Ltd to Latam Energy Cyprus Ltd., 14 November 2013; **C-079**, Latam Energy Belgium BVBA, Extract of Articles of Association, 12 September 2013; **C-025**, Publication of Abstracts of Constitution of Latam Energy Chile SpA and Latam Energy Chile SpA II, 5 October 2013; **C-024**, Registration of Transfer of Participations to Latam Energy Chile SpA and Latam Energy Chile SpA II and Modification of Statutes, 13 December 2013; **C-080**, Certificate of Change of Name Greinvest Latin America Ltd., 14 October 2015; **C-081**, *Escritura de Constituci\u00f3n de Ayo Transmission S.R.L.*, 17 July 2014; Jacobson First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 81-90; *see also* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 177-187.\n\n366.\n\nLeaving aside the disputed issue of the Upstream Projects, the Tribunal is also satisfied that First Claimant committed cash, expected gain or profit, and assumed risk in relation to the Mamacocha Project on the territory of Peru, by making loans and equity contributions to Second Claimant to finance its operations, specifically in relation to the performance of the RER Contract (see also \u00b6\u00b6 517 to 521 below in relation to investments made in reliance on the RER Contract).410\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **C-265**, Latam Hydro LLC's invoices, audited and unaudited financial statements and tax returns; **BRG-004**, BRG Investment Value Calculations; BRG First Report \u00b6\u00b6 161-162, Table 8; **BRG-081**, BRG Updated Investment Value Calculations, tab \"Investment Value Mamacocha\"; **BRG-100**, Claimants' Accounting Records of Actual Expenses; BRG Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 167-171, Table 8.\n\n367.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that First Claimant is an investor of a TPA Party, i.e., the United States, within the meaning of TPA Article 10.28, fulfilling the *ratione personae* requirements of the TPA.\n\n368.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, Article 25(1) provides with respect to jurisdiction *ratione personae* that the Centre's jurisdiction extends to a dispute between \"a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State\" (see \u00b6 272 above).\n\n369.\n\nArticle 25(2) of the ICSID Convention sets out the definition of \"national of another Contracting State\" (see \u00b6 272 above). For present purposes, Article 25(2)(b) is relevant, which refers to \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"\n\n370.\n\nAs noted at \u00b6 362 above, First Claimant is a United States limited liability company created in 2014. First Claimant continued to hold US nationality on 30 August 2019, being the date that Claimants' Notice of Arbitration was received by the Secretary-General of ICSID and therefore the date their claim is \"deemed submitted to arbitration\" under TPA Article 10.16(4) (see \u00b6 264 above). The date of submission to arbitration is also the \"date on which the parties consented\" under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, by virtue of TPA Article 10.17 (see \u00b6 270 above).\n\n371.\n\nFirst Claimant therefore also fulfils the requirements of jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the ICSID Convention.\n\n***b. Second Claimant***\n------------------------\n\n372.\n\nSecond Claimant is a legal entity constituted under Peruvian law on 15 November 2012.411\n\n**C-021**, Registration of Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L's (today CH Mamacocha S.R.L.) Articles of Incorporation, 23 November 2012. *See* **C-020**, Registration of Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Laguna Azul S.R.L.'s name changed to CH Mamacocha S.R.L., 22 February 2017.\n\n*(i) TPA*\n---------\n\n373.\n\nBeing a Peruvian entity, Second Claimant is not a \"claimant\" or an \"investor\" within the definitions in TPA Article 10.28, because it is not in a dispute with \"another Party\" (i.e., other than Peru) and is not claimed to have made an investment in the territory of another TPA Party (i.e., other than Peru) (see \u00b6\u00b6 256 and 258 above).\n\n374.\n\nUnder TPA Article 10.16(1)(b), a claimant may also submit a claim \"on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly\" (see \u00b6 264 above).\n\n375.\n\nAs already noted at \u00b6 372 above, as a Peruvian legal entity Second Claimant is an \"enterprise of the respondent\" referred to in TPA Article 10.16(1)(b). It is also controlled directly or indirectly by First Claimant, as noted in \u00b6 365 above.\n\n376.\n\nSecond Claimant therefore meets the requirements under the TPA for the purposes of a claim made by First Claimant under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b).\n\n377.\n\nAs an enterprise owned directly or indirectly by First Claimant, Second Claimant is also an investment within the meaning of TPA Article 10.28 definition of \"investment\" (see \u00b6 261 above).\n\n*(ii) ICSID Convention*\n-----------------------\n\n378.\n\nFor the purposes of the ICSID Convention, Claimants assert that a dispute has arisen between Respondent and First Claimant, on its own behalf and on behalf of Second Claimant.412\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 220(c), 222.\n\n379.\n\nRespondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Second Claimant, on the basis of its assertion that Second Claimant does not fulfil the requirements of Article 25(1) or 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.413 This objection also relates to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract (see \u00b6 282 above).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 565-581.\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have proceeded on the basis that Second Claimant must satisfy the nationality requirements of the ICSID Convention for the purposes of First Claimant's claims made under the TPA and the ICSID Convention.414 The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis of the Parties' shared understanding.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 220(e) (appearing under \u00a7 III.A.4 entitled \"Peru Has Consented to Arbitration under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention\"): \"CHM has been at all relevant times foreign-controlled and qualifies as a 'national of another Contracting State' for purposes of the ICSID Convention\u2026\"; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 488 (appearing under \u00a7 IV.A entitled \"*Principios legales aplicables a la determinaci\u00f3n de la jurisdicci\u00f3n del Tribunal*\"): \"\u2026 [E]*l Tribunal solo tendr\u00e1 jurisdicci\u00f3n si las Demandantes han cumplido los requisitos jurisdiccionales bajo el Convenio CIADI, El Tratado, y el Contrato RER*\"; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 581 (appearing under \u00a7 IV.F entitled \"*El Tribunal carece de jurisdicci\u00f3n* ratione personae *porque el Per\u00fa no ha atribuido en ning\u00fan momento a CH Mamacocha el car\u00e1cter de 'nacional de otro Estado Contratante' de conformidad con el Art\u00edculo 25(2) del Convenio CIADI*\"): \"\u2026*las Demandantes no han probado que este Tribunal tenga jurisdicci\u00f3n* ratione personae *bajo el art\u00edculo 25 del Convenio CIADI sobre ninguna de las reclamaciones de CH Mamacocha*.\"\n\n(a) Test for Agreement to Treat as Foreign National\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nSecond Claimant is not a national of another Contracting State under the first option of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, since it has the same nationality as the State party to the dispute (\"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute...\"). The question is therefore whether it satisfies the second option in Article 25(2)(b), i.e., a juridical person which has the same nationality as the State party to the dispute, and which, \"because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n382.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that an agreement to treat an entity as a national of another Contracting State may be explicit or implicit, although Respondent emphasises that an implicit attribution still must be indisputable and unequivocal.415 Respondent further submits that Claimants must not merely prove that it is plausible or theoretically possible that Respondent implicitly attributed to Second Claimant the character of a national of another Contracting State, but that their interpretation excludes any other interpretation of the intention of the Parties.416\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 405, 409; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 573.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 580; *citing* **RL-064**, *Cable Television of Nevis, Ltd. and Cable Television of Nevis Holdings, Ltd. v. Federation of Saint Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis*, ICSID Case No. ARB/95/2, Award, 13 January 1997, \u00b6 5.24.\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that any implied agreement to treat Second Claimant as a national of another Contracting State must be clear and unambiguous, leaving no doubt as to the Parties' intentions. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term \"agreed\" in the ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b), in its context, and in light of the purpose of the ICSID Convention. In this regard, the \"agreement\" in question provides a limited exception to the foreign nationality requirement of an entity for the purposes of recourse to the international method of dispute settlement set out therein. No specific requirements as to the form of the agreement are set out. According to its ordinary meaning, an agreement, and in particular a legal agreement, may in many situations be concluded either expressly or implicitly. On the other hand, in light of the significance of sovereign consent to such an international proceeding, such consent is not to be assumed, and as held by the Tribunal must be clear and unambiguous.\n\n(b) Whether Respondent Agreed to Treat Second Claimant as Foreign National\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the fact of Second Claimant's foreign control, but submits that it never agreed to treat Second Claimant as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.417 In this respect, Respondent argues that the option of recourse to ICSID arbitration in Clause 11.3(a) of the RER Contract does not constitute clear and unequivocal attribution of such status, because it allows for different kinds of dispute resolution, and because that contractual clause provides, in part, as follows (see \u00b6 273 above):418\n\nWhere the Concessionaire Company [i.e., Second Claimant] does not meet the requirement to resort to the ICSID, such dispute shall be subject to the rules referred to in subparagraph b) below [i.e., arbitration before the Lima Chamber of Commerce].\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 566, 573.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 577; *quoting* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.3(a).\n\n385.\n\nAccording to Respondent, where it wished to attribute foreign nationality to an enterprise it did so expressly in the contract.419\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 574-575; *quoting* **R-125**, *Contrato de Compromiso de Inversi\u00f3n Central Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Molloco*, 17 October 2013, Clause 9.5(b). *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 531-533.\n\n386.\n\nRespondent further asserts that none of its actions invoked by Claimants prove that Second Claimant has been attributed the status of a foreign national. In this respect, Respondent argues, *inter alia*, that: (i) Peru did not waive its jurisdictional objection by failing to object on this basis to the Notices of Intent;420 (ii) the inclusion of Second Claimant in negotiations with the Special Commission only demonstrates Respondent's good faith attempt to resolve the dispute with Claimants, with Respondent's right to any jurisdictional defence reserved by Clause 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement;421 (iii) the press conference of the Governor of Arequipa did not contain an acknowledgement as argued by Claimants, but only a statement that Second Claimant has foreign capital, and any statements would only reflect her own views and not an attribution of status by Respondent;422 and (iv) Claimants have failed to prove any estoppel, which in any event cannot create a tribunal's jurisdiction.423\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 539; *see* Reply \u00b6 426.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 540; *quoting* **C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, 5 December 2017, Clause 7. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6 541; *quoting* **CL-170**, *Quiborax S.A., et al v.

An agreement to treat Second Claimant as a national of another Contracting State is evident, in Claimants' view, throughout the Parties' course of conduct, due to the inclusion of an ICSID arbitration clause in the RER Contract (see \u00b6 273 above), as well as from the RER Law and Peruvian law.424\n\nMemorial \u00b6 221; *quoting* **CL-084**, Christoph Schreuer, ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2009), p. 304; *also citing*, *inter alia*, **CL-106**, *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

In that clause, the parties agreed:432\n\n\u2026Disputes involving amounts exceeding Twenty Million Dollars (USD 20,000,000) or its equivalent in national currency shall be settled through international arbitration of law by means of a procedure carried out in accordance with the Rules for Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States approved by Peru through Legislative Resolution No. 26210, to whose standards the Parties submit unconditionally. Where the Concessionaire Company does not meet the requirement to resort to the ICSID, such dispute shall be subject to the rule referred to in subparagraph b) below.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.3(a).\n\n391.\n\nWhether the above agreement is classified as an express or at a minimum an implied agreement is of lesser import, noting as the tribunal in *Amco Asia Corp v. Indonesia* did that there is \"no formal or ritual clause being provided for in the Convention, nor needed in order for such an agreement to be binding on the parties.\"433 The ICSID Convention does not impose a particular requirement of form or content of the agreement in question.\n\n**CL-106**, *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, \u00b6 14.\n\n392.\n\nRespondent thereby agreed to arbitrate higher value disputes with Second Claimant in ICSID arbitration, while Clause 11.3(b) of the RER Contract provides that disputes involving amounts lower than USD 20 million were to be resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the National and International Arbitration Center of the Chamber of Commerce of Lima, seated in Lima (see \u00b6 273 above). The necessary implication of this clause is that for the purposes of any such ICISD arbitration, Second Claimant would be treated as a national of another Contracting State under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n393.\n\nTo hold otherwise would be to render meaningless the option of pursuing ICSID arbitration under the RER Contract, which cannot be presumed to be the intention of the parties to the RER Contract. On the other hand, this understanding does not leave the final sentence of Clause 11.3(a) without meaning, which would direct the parties to domestic arbitration \"[w]here the Concessionaire Company does not meet the requirement to resort to ICSID,\" since there may be other reasons why the entity does not meet the ICSID requirements. This could include, for example, a circumstance where the entity in question does not satisfy the requirement of foreign control at the date of consent to arbitration.\n\n394.\n\nRespondent attempts to distinguish the RER Contract from other cases in which ICSID arbitration is the sole exclusive forum for the resolution of disputes.434 The fact that the RER Contract provides for two avenues of dispute resolution does not assist Respondent. The two types of arbitration possible under RER Contract are clearly demarcated based on the amount in dispute, subject to any reason that it may be necessary to resort to the Lima Chamber of Commerce arbitration in the event that Second Claimant does not meet the requirement to resort to ICSID. It remains clear that Respondent contemplated and consented to ICSID arbitration with Second Claimant for higher value disputes, for which it necessarily agreed to treat Second Claimant as a national of another Contracting State.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 570; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 529-530; *quoting* **CL-106**, *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

The tribunal in *Cable Television of Nevis v. St Kitts and Nevis* held that an implied agreement to confer status under Article 25(2)(b) \"would only be acceptable in the event that the specific circumstances would exclude any other interpretation of the intention of the parties.\"438 The parties' explicit agreement to ICSID arbitration in the RER Contract, where other requirements are met (i.e., an amount in dispute above USD 20 million), excludes an interpretation that Respondent had not agreed to treat Second Claimant as a foreign national.\n\n**RL-064**, *Cable Television of Nevis, Ltd. and Cable Television of Nevis Holdings, Ltd. v. Federation of Saint Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis*, ICSID Case No. ARB/95/2, Award, 13 January 1997, \u00b6 5.24.\n\n400.\n\nFindings by the tribunals in in *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*439 and *LETCO v. Liberia*440 likewise support a view that the insertion of an ICSID arbitration clause in a contract presupposes and implies an agreement to treat a claimant as a foreign national for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**CL-033**, *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH et al. v.

This finding is also relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract (see \u00b6 561 below).\n\n***c.

While they were not successful, it is evident from the record that the Parties have engaged in such consultations and negotiations prior to Claimants commencing this arbitration (see, *inter alia*, \u00b6\u00b6 164-167, 191-196, 200-203 above).\n\n411.\n\nRespondent raises two objections with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*. Respondent's objections relate to requirements under the TPA, specifically as to the waiver of multiple actions and the requirement to provide notice of claims. The Tribunal shall address each of these objections in turn.\n\n***a. Waiver Requirement: Multiple Actions***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nTPA Article 10.18(2) provides that a claim cannot be submitted to arbitration unless, *inter alia*, the notice of arbitration is accompanied by written waivers by the claimant and the relevant enterprise (i.e., Second Claimant), of:444\n\n\u2026any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n*See* full text at \u00b6 271 above.\n\n413.\n\nThis waiver requirement falls under TPA Article 10.18 entitled \"Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party.\" The Tribunal understands the waiver requirement to be a condition on Respondent's consent to arbitrate under the TPA, in the absence of which \"[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section [of the TPA].\"445\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.18(2).\n\n*(i) The Parties' Views on the Waiver Requirement*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nRespondent contends that the waiver requirement includes a requirement for Claimants to waive initiation of any proceeding or action before any tribunal, whether the same tribunal or separate tribunals, for the purpose of challenging a measure that is the subject of an action under the TPA.446\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 443.\n\n415.\n\nRespondent argues, in this respect, that the claims based on the TPA and on the RER Contract constitute multiple proceedings contrary to the waiver requirement, because they are brought by different claimants and derive from different instruments with different consent and arbitrator selection requirements.447 In Respondent's view, Claimants' attempt to obtain compensation for the same alleged damage based on the same measures is the type of duplication of remedies that the waiver requirement seeks to avoid.448\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 502; *citing* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.3(a) and (b).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 509.\n\n416.\n\nContrary to Claimants' argument that the waiver requirement only prohibits multiple actions in separate proceedings, Respondent submits that the waiver requirement prohibits duplicative proceedings against the same State measures, regardless of whether those proceedings are brought before the same tribunal or before different tribunals.449\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 430.\n\n417.\n\nIn support of its argument that the waiver requirement is breached, Respondent relies on: (i) Claimants' conduct in initiating two parallel direct dealings in relation to the dispute with MINEM and the Special Commission; (ii) the broad wording of the waiver requirement in the TPA without qualification, which refers to \"any right\" to initiate or continue before \"any administrative tribunal or court\u2026or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach\u2026,\" which in Respondent's view covers international arbitrations;450 (iii) the decision in *Renco v.

The specific wording must still be given effect in accordance with its terms.\n\n424.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimants' interpretation of the waiver requirement and the term \"proceeding\" therein (\"any proceeding with respect to any measure,\" see \u00b6 412 above) requires adding the term \"separate\" which does not appear in the TPA, and ignores the meaning of the term \"*actuaci\u00f3n*\" (procedure) appearing in the Spanish version, as well as the meaning of \"proceeding\" in the English version.460\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 437.\n\n425.\n\nRespondent submits that the Spanish term \"*actuaci\u00f3n*\" covers both the entire set of steps in a proceeding as well as specific steps that make up only part of the same proceeding.461 This is confirmed, it argues, by the use of the term \"*actuaci\u00f3n*\" in TPA Articles 10.20(4)(b) and 10.20(5), both of which refer to the suspension of \"*cualquier actuaci\u00f3n*\" in the sense of proceedings in the same arbitration. The same meaning is given, Respondent submits, to \"*actuaciones*\" in ICSID Arbitration Rule 29.462 Accordingly, it says, the reference to \"*cualquier actuaci\u00f3n*\" in the waiver requirement is not limited exclusively to proceedings in separate or distinct proceedings.463\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 438.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 442.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 439-441; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Arts. 10.20.4(b), 10.20.5. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6 444; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Arts. 10.20.4(b), 10.20.5.\n\n426.\n\nRespondent further relies on the references to \"any proceedings on the merits\" in the English version of TPA Articles 10.20.4(b) (addressing certain objections as a preliminary question) and 10.20.5 (expedited decision on certain objections) which in the Spanish version of those Articles is \"*cualquier actuaci\u00f3n.*\" On the basis that the English and Spanish versions are equally authentic, and that the terms of a treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text, Respondent argues that the same meaning in English and Spanish must apply.464\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 444-445; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Arts. 10.20.4(b), 10.20.5; *also citing* **RL-078**, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Art. 33; **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 23.6.\n\n427.\n\nClaimants, on the other hand, contend that the requirement to waive recourse to \"any\" proceeding only encompasses claims pursued in a \"different\" arbitration proceeding to the one in which it has brought the action.465 Moreover, in Claimants' view, the waiver does not contemplate proceedings before an ICSID tribunal, which is not \"under the law of any Party\" but rather under international law.466\n\nReply \u00b6 335.\n\nReply \u00b6 337; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 52.\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the waiver requirement is inapplicable to proceedings before an ICSID tribunal *per se*. The text of the provision distinguishes between any proceeding \"before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures.\" There is no qualification that such \"other dispute settlement procedures\" must be one \"under the law of any Party\" as is contemplated in relation to the court or administrative tribunal proceedings.\n\n429.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that the waiver requirement obliges Claimants to waive Second Claimant's right to bring its claims under the RER Contract in the same arbitration commenced for First Claimant's claims under the TPA (which comprise both alleged breaches of the TPA, and alleged breaches of an \"investment agreement\" covered by the TPA).467 The words \"other dispute settlement procedures\" in TPA Article 10.18 are the only language which could conceivably apply to arbitration proceedings. The ordinary meaning of the word \"other\" necessarily entails proceedings other than the one in which the waiver is being given. As Claimants point out, it means \"not the same\" and \"different.\"468 The addition of the word \"separate\" is not necessary to give this meaning.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 188, 224; Reply \u00b6 314; **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 54.\n\nReply \u00b6 334.\n\n430.\n\nRespondent argues that the word \"other\" is not opposed to proceedings under the TPA but refers to proceedings based on a different legal instrument, in this case being the RER Contract.469 However, TPA Article 10.18(2)(b) refers to a \"proceeding\", and not to the legal instrument under which a claim is brought.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 446; *see* Reply \u00b6 334.\n\n431.\n\nTPA Articles 10.20.4(b) and 10.20.5 do not assist Respondent, since they refer not to \"any proceedings\" in general but to \"any proceedings on the merits\" (\"*cualquier actuaci\u00f3n sobre el fondo*\").470 This qualification confirms the distinction from the more general \"any proceeding\" (\"*cualquier actuaci\u00f3n*\") referred to in TPA Article 10.18(2), and there is no inconsistency between the English and Spanish authentic texts of the TPA.\n\n**RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Arts. 10.20.4(b), 10.20.5.\n\n432.\n\nIn a situation where Claimants have concurrent rights to bring a claim based on the RER Contract and a claim under the TPA which are compatible to be brought in a single arbitration proceeding under the ICSID Convention, the claim based on the RER Contract is not a relevant \"other dispute settlement procedure\" to be waived.\n\n433.\n\nRespondent further alleges that the TPA and the RER Contract contain different and even contradictory requirements for consent to arbitration, and contradictory methods for the selection of the presiding arbitrator, citing the RER Contract's: (i) Spanish language requirement; (ii) time limit for the rendering of an award; (iii) and the USD 20 million threshold for submitting disputes under the ICSID Convention.471\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 502.\n\n434.\n\nHowever, Respondent has not identified how the differences between the two instruments of consent are incompatible. Specifically, the fact that the RER Contract contains a USD 20 million threshold (which is reached for Claimants' claims in the present case) is not incompatible with the TPA simply because it contains no such threshold. In the same way, the specification in the RER Contract that the arbitration will be conducted in Spanish and that the award will be rendered within an identified time limit is not inconsistent with the TPA which includes no such requirements. Nor has any issue been raised with respect to the method for the selection of the presiding arbitrator.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, in this respect, that Respondent merely alleges an incompatibility but does not actually object to the language arrangements, procedural timetable or selection of the presiding arbitrator that have been adopted in this arbitration, and could hardly do so in light of its procedural agreements with Claimants and its conduct in carrying out those agreements in the course of these proceedings.\n\n436.\n\nThis includes the Parties' agreement to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention (see \u00b6 15 above). Further agreements are recorded in Respondent's correspondence of 23 April 2020 and incorporated in PO 2 dated 13 May 2020 (see \u00b6 28 above), i.e., (i) on a joint proposed procedural calendar exceeding the time limit for rendering an award identified in the RER Contract;472 (ii) specifying that the Tribunal \"will draft all rulings, including the award, within a reasonable time period\";473 (iii) that both English and Spanish shall be the procedural languages of the arbitration (with the Tribunal adopting Respondent's preferred text in relation to the language of written requests and applications);474 and (iv) confirming \"that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that no party has any objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.\"475\n\nRespondent's Email of 23 April 2020, second attachment, \"Annex A \u2013 Procedural Order No. 2.\"\n\nPO 2, \u00b6 5.3.\n\nPO 2, \u00b6\u00b6 11.1, 11.3.\n\nPO 2, \u00b6 2.1.\n\n437.\n\nAs for Respondent's argument based on the term \"*actuaci\u00f3n*\" used in the equally authentic Spanish version of the TPA, as Respondent acknowledges (see \u00b6 425 above), this term can cover both the entire set of steps in a proceeding as well as only specific steps that make up only part of the same proceeding. This is of no assistance to Respondent as the \"proceeding\" or \"*actuaci\u00f3n*\" referred to must still be \"other\" than the present one, as is clear from the first part of the sentence.\n\n438.\n\nMoreover, Respondent's proposed interpretation of the waiver provision focuses on whether the measures underlying the proceedings are the same, rather than having the same claims or proceedings.476 If the focus is on the identity of the measures, as Respondent asserts, it is unclear on what basis Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract are to be understood as \"other\" proceedings, but First Claimant's claims on behalf of Second Claimant under the TPA (for alleged breach of the RER Contract) are not.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 513; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.18(2)(b); Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 513-515; *citing* Request for Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 238-241; Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 260, 284-307, 309-320, 321-333, 334-344, 345-355, 368, 372, 373, 375, 391, 392, 393, 394, 439, 451, 453, 454, 455, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478.\n\n439.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion on the ordinary meaning of the terms in the waiver, the Tribunal has taken into account the opinion of Prof. Reisman in *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* relied on by Respondent, in which he was asked by the respondent State to opine on an identical clause, and commented that the waiver:477\n\n\u2026must apply to proceedings brought before the same tribunal.

The Tribunal does not consider the waiver to require an \"exception\" for proceedings brought before the same tribunal, since the ordinary meaning and full effect of the terms does not cover proceedings before the same tribunal.\n\n441.\n\nAs for Respondent's argument that its proposed interpretation is confirmed because the RER Contract does not fulfil the requirements to be considered an \"investment agreement\" under TPA Article 10.16,478 the Tribunal considers this to be a separate matter that shall be addressed at \u00b6\u00b6 496 *et seq.* below.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 455; *see also* Rejoinder \u00a7 III.E.\n\n(b) Context of TPA Article 10.18(2)(b)\n--------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nThe Tribunal finds nothing in the context of the waiver requirement in the TPA that would indicate a different meaning than that conveyed by the ordinary meaning of its terms.\n\n443.\n\nTPA Article 10.18(4) uses the term \"other binding dispute settlement procedure,\" which is relied on by Respondent to assert that the Treaty prohibits duplicative proceedings, regardless of the forums before which they are brought.479 However, this does not add to the analysis above, since it also refers to \"other\" dispute settlement procedures, which has already been interpreted above.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 447(d).\n\n444.\n\nAs for the other clauses in TPA Article 10.18, which relate to conditions and limitations on the consent to arbitrate, in Respondent's view these serve to confirm that the waiver requirement is designed to protect Treaty parties from abusive situations including facing multiple proceedings against the same measures, such as the situation created by Claimants.480 Relying on the Opinion of Prof. Reisman in *Pac Rim*, Respondent argues that Claimants must choose which type of claim to bring.481\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 448; *quoting* **RL-200**, *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

The conditions and limitations set out in TPA Article 10.18 are each to be given full effect in accordance with their terms, including the waiver requirement.\n\n446.\n\nRespondent further contends that the allowance in TPA Article 10.16 that a claimant may bring a claim alleging that a respondent has breached: \"(A) an obligation under Section A, (B) an investment authorization, or (C) an investment agreement,\" confirms that the claims can only concern one of these three types of breaches.482 Claimants rely on the same provision to argue, to the contrary, that the TPA allows a claimant to pursue different types of claims, and as such a claimant cannot reasonably be required to waive its contract claims in order to pursue treaty claims.483\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 450-451; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Arts. 10.16.1(a), 10.16.1(b).\n\nReply \u00b6 340; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 69.\n\n447.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find the context of Article 10.18(2)(b) to add significantly to its interpretation of the waiver provision.

Respondent argues that the purpose of the waiver requirement is not only to eliminate double recovery or inconsistent decisions from multiple decisions in different forums, but also multiple claims against the same measures, under different instruments.484 In Respondent's view, relying on the opinion of Prof. Reisman in *Pac Rim*, the jurisdictional requirement of the TPA intends to preclude the costs and inequities associated with multiple claims based on the same measures, which bring an unavoidable imbalance in procedural rights.485\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 461; *see* Reply \u00b6 345.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 462-463; *quoting* **RL-200**, *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

To the contrary, the TPA clearly contemplates multiple claims against the same measures by allowing a claimant to submit claims both on its own behalf and (separately) on behalf of an entity it owns or controls, giving a choice of legal instrument on which each such claim may be based (i.e., the TPA, an \"investment authorization\" or an \"investment agreement,\" see \u00b6 264 above).\n\n454.\n\nThe Tribunal subscribes to the determination of the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* tribunal, in this respect, that there is \"no juridical difficulty in having an ICSID arbitration based on different claims arising from separate investment protections and separate but identical arbitration provisions\" and that this solution is in fact in line with \"fairness, consistency and procedural efficiency in international arbitration.\"490\n\n**CL-043**, *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

Even if they are brought under different legal instruments, Claimants' claims made in these proceedings are not inconsistent with the waiver, since they are made in the same arbitration proceeding before the same Tribunal.\n\n456.\n\nWith respect to the different legal instruments, the Tribunal's jurisdiction must be established according to the applicable law relevant to each. Contrary to Respondent's submission,491 Second Claimant's claims made directly under the RER Contract do not seek to evade in an illegitimate manner the limitations on consent under the TPA, but are subject to any requirements under the RER Contract and the ICSID Convention, as shall be addressed at \u00b6\u00b6 560 *et seq.* below.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 452-453; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 69; **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.18.1.\n\n***b.

This concerns the claims relating to the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings.492 According to Respondent, without giving prior notice, in their Request for Arbitration Claimants alleged for the first time a breach of the TPA on the basis of: (i) Respondent's initiation and formalisation of the Criminal Investigation against Second Claimant's External Counsel; and (ii) Respondent's declared intention to bring the Criminal Proceedings against Second Claimant.493\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 518, 526; Rejoinder \u00b6 467.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 521; *citing* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.16(2)(c); **C-023**, Latam Hydro LLC and CH Mamacocha, S.R.L.'s Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration, 28 May 2019.\n\n458.\n\nTPA Article 10.16(2) provides, with respect to notice, as follows:494\n\nAt least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (\"notice of intent\"). The notice shall specify:\n\n(a) the name and address of the claimant and, where a claim is submitted on behalf of an enterprise, the name, address, and place of incorporation of the enterprise;\n\n(b) for each claim, the provision of this Agreement, investment authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;\n\n(c) the legal and factual basis for each claim; and\n\n(d) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.16(2).\n\n*(i) Nature of the Notice Requirement*\n--------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the notice requirement is a jurisdictional rule or a procedural requirement only, and therefore whether failure to comply with the notice requirement means that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Criminal Investigation Claims. While Claimants do not explicitly classify the notice and wait requirement as going to the admissibility of their claim, the Tribunal understands their reference to a \"procedural requirement only\" to mean an admissibility requirement.\n\n460.\n\nFor Respondent, the requirement is a jurisdictional one going to its consent to arbitrate, citing recent decisions in support of this view.495 Respondent further submits that the Tribunal's decision must be based on the wording of the TPA, and not on other arbitral decisions involving different treaties.496 In Respondent's view, the context of the notification requirement in TPA Article 10.16 likewise confirms its jurisdictional character.497\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 470, 483-487; *quoting* **CL-126**, *Daniel W Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v.

Argentina* that pre-arbitral steps can also be fulfilled subsequent to the initiation of arbitration, until a decision on jurisdiction is taken.499 According to Claimants' expert Prof. Schreuer, other tribunals have found that notice and wait provisions were hortatory, or there was no need to comply with a waiting period that would have been futile.500\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 351-355; *quoting* **RL-130**, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9nerale de Surveillance S.A. v.

To that extent, prior arbitral decisions relied on by the Parties which were based on different procedural circumstances and different treaty wording are of limited assistance.\n\n463.\n\nTo the extent that Claimants' proposed interpretation of the notice requirement would deprive the wording of the TPA of its meaning, the Tribunal does not accept that the notice requirement is a discretionary rule that may be disregarded without consequence. Reading the ordinary meaning of the terms of TPA Article 10.16(2) (see \u00b6 265 above), it specifies in mandatory language that a claimant \"shall deliver to the respondent\" a notice, which \"shall specify\" a number of enumerated items. Those items include the alleged provision of the TPA breached \"for each claim\" and the \"legal and factual basis for each claim.\"501 These words of the TPA must be given effect.\n\n**C-001**/**RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.16(2)(b) and (c).\n\n464.\n\nAs held by the Tribunal in *Kappes v. Guatemala* when interpreting a similar provision under the DR-CAFTA:502\n\nThe notice is not characterized as a merely illustrative document, articulating some subset of known claims while omitting others, but rather as a mandatory precondition, requiring advance provision of information regarding all claims the claimant intends to submit to arbitration.\n\n**CL-126**, *Daniel W Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, 13 March 2020, \u00b6 191.\n\n465.\n\nThe mandatory nature of the notice provision is consistent with its context and with its object and purpose. TPA Article 10.16(2) appears under a set of provisions dealing with \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration.\" The premise for the submission of a claim to arbitration is that a disputing party \"considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation.\"503 Before submitting a claim under TPA Article 10.16(1), Articles 10.16(2) and 10.16(3) set out relevant notice (\"[a]t least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration\u2026\") and waiting (\"[p]rovided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim\u2026\") requirements. One key purpose of the notice requirement is therefore to provide an opportunity for potential settlement of a claim by consultation or negotiation.\n\n**C-001**/**RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.16(1).\n\n466.\n\nOther purposes include those identified by the *Kappes v. Guatemala* tribunal:504\n\n\u2026there are several purposes of such [notice and waiting] requirements, including to enable the respondent State to investigate the claim, conduct such dispute settlement negotiations as it considers appropriate, and to take initial steps to organize its defense prior to the proceedings getting underway.\n\n**CL-126**, *Daniel W Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, 13 March 2020, \u00b6 198.\n\n467.\n\nWhether this mandatory requirement is characterised as a condition of the State's consent, or as a question of admissibility, it must be given effect. The Tribunal rejects the contention that it need not be complied with.\n\n468.\n\nRespondent alleges a lack of notice in respect of the Criminal Investigation Claims. This is not, however, a case in which no notice was given to Respondent of the anticipated claims to be submitted in arbitration. As set out in the factual background, three Notices of Intent were issued on: (i) 19 June 2017 (First Notice of Intent, withdrawn on 17 April 2018 see \u00b6\u00b6 161 and 181 above);505 (ii) 8 March 2018 (Second Notice of Intent, see \u00b6 195 above);506 and 28 May 2019 (Third Notice of Intent, see \u00b6 219 above).507 The First Notice of Intent and the Second Notice of Intent were notices to submit a dispute to consultation and negotiation under TPA Article 10.15. The Third Notice of Intent expressed the intent to submit claims to arbitration under TPA Article 10.16. The Third Notice of Intent is the relevant one for the purposes of the present question under TPA Article 10.16.\n\n**C-252**/**MQ-018**, Latam Hydro LLC and CH Mamacocha S.R.L.'s First Notice of Intent, 19 June 2017; **C- 267**, Letter from CH Mamacocha S.R.L. to R.

This is not a situation where no notice under TPA Article 10.16(2) was given.\n\n470.\n\nThe objection under consideration by the Tribunal therefore concerns the narrow question of whether the Criminal Investigation Claims may be decided upon by the Tribunal, since they were not included in the Third Notice of Intent but were included in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n*(ii) Whether the Criminal Investigation Claims May be Decided*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nIn order to determine whether the Criminal Investigation Claims may be decided by the Tribunal, consideration must be given to the level of detail that is required to fulfil the notice requirement in TPA Article 10.16(2)(b), and in what circumstances additional facts or claims may be made subsequently.\n\n472.\n\nClaimants assert that a notice of intent does not have to be complete or exhaustive.508 However, the prior arbitral decisions referenced by their expert Prof. Schreuer in support of that assertion almost exclusively concern the level of detail required for a request for amicable settlement or representations made during consultation and negotiation, and not a notice requirement for submission to arbitration analogous to that under TPA Article 10.16.509\n\nReply \u00b6 357; *citing* Schreuer Report \u00b6 93.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **RL-068**, *Limited Liability Company Amto v.

Canada*, the tribunal held that in a notice of intent the investor \"must articulate its claims with a reasonable degree of specificity.\"511 That case concerned new facts arising after the notice of intent, which the tribunal held to be within the tribunal's jurisdiction if \"sufficient events giving rise to a claim exist six months prior to the submission of the dispute to arbitration.\"512\n\n**RL-136**, *Mesa Power Group v.

The Tribunal further agrees with Respondent that, on the other hand, merely general information about the dispute does not suffice.513\n\n*See* Rejoinder \u00b6 478; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.15.\n\n476.\n\nThe Third Notice of Intent alleges that Respondent breached its obligations under the TPA and customary international law, and separately under the RER Contract. With respect to the TPA, Claimants submitted that Respondent had violated: (i) protections accorded to First Claimant's investment under TPA Article 10.5 and customary international law; (ii) TPA Article 10.7 by indirectly expropriating First Claimant's investment; and (iii) TPA Article 10.4 by treating First Claimant less favourably than investors from other countries.514 Claimants set out a number of different events and circumstances which they considered to constitute interferences with the Mamacocha Project as the basis for the alleged breaches.515\n\n**C-023**, Latam Hydro LLC and CH Mamacocha, S.R.L.'s Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration, 28 May 2019, \u00a7\u00a7 VII.A, VII.B, VII.C.\n\n**C-023**, Latam Hydro LLC and CH Mamacocha, S.R.L.'s Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration, 28 May 2019, \u00a7\u00a7 VI.A-L.\n\n477.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, the same alleged breaches of the TPA are put forward by Claimants, i.e., TPA Articles 10.4, 10.5 and 10.7.516 The factual circumstances described as \"interferences with the Mamacocha Project\" are also almost identical, with only two types of additions. The first relates to the Criminal Investigation Claims and the denial of the Civil Works Authorization, which are mentioned for the first time in addition to the RGA Lawsuit as part of the RGA bringing the Mamacocha Project to an \"abrupt halt.\"517 Respondent has not objected to the inclusion of the denial of the Civil Works Authorization in the Request, which is mentioned 19 times in the Request, but does not appear in the Third Notice of Intent. An additional subheading is dedicated entirely to the Criminal Investigation Claims (\"The RGA Retaliated by Bringing Unfounded Criminal Charges against CHM's Lead Peruvian Lawyer\").518\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00a7\u00a7 V.A, V.B.

Claimants contend that at the time of their Third Notice of Intent dated 28 May 2019, they were still assessing the nature and impact of the AEP's investigation which closed on 2 May 2019. Formal charges against Second Claimant's External Counsel were not lodged until 18 October 2019, five months after the Third Notice of Intent.521 In Respondent's view, these later events did not substantially alter the matters that Claimants were already informed of before the Third Notice of Intent, and Claimants' position is inconsistent with other submissions.522\n\nReply \u00b6 363.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 498; *quoting* Reply \u00b6 179; Rejoinder \u00b6 499; *quoting* Request for Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 31, 184; *also citing* Second Claimant's External Counsel First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 48, 51, 53; Rejoinder \u00b6 500; *quoting* Request for Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 184, 191, 229, 231. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6 501; *citing* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 311, 312, 376, 380.\n\n481.\n\nWhile the Criminal Investigation had already commenced at the time of the Third Notice of Intent, the announcement that the investigation was complete was only made on 2 May 2019,523 a few weeks before the filing of the Third Notice of Intent, with charges brought in October 2019 (see \u00b6\u00b6 187-188 above). As such, these factual circumstances were still developing at the time notice was given, and indeed at the time of the Request for Arbitration of 30 August 2019.\n\n**R-113**, *Disposici\u00f3n Fiscal No. 08-2019-FPEMA-MP-AR, Fiscal\u00eda Ambiental de Arequipa*, 2 May 2019; Second Claimant's External Counsel First Statement \u00b6 58. *See* Memorial \u00b6 135; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 227.\n\n482.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that Claimants failed to identify the legal and factual basis for each of their claims, as required by TPA Article 10.16(2)(c). The legal basis for their claim did not change between the Third Notice of Intent and the Request. The inclusion of the additional factual matters relating to the Criminal Investigation Claims are further additional bases for the existing claims, in the same way as the denial of the Civil Works Authorisation which has not been objected to. In this respect, it is not required that the Notice of Intent set out every factual circumstance in minute detail, as long as the factual basis for each claim can be derived with reasonable specificity.\n\n483.\n\nImportantly, by the omission of the Criminal Investigation Claims from the Third Notice of Intent, Respondent was not deprived of the opportunity to consult and negotiate with Claimants in relation to the dispute, to investigate the claims that would be made against it in arbitration, or to organise its defence. The Third Notice of Intent sets out in detail the factual basis for the claims.\n\n484.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal considers that Claimants fulfilled the notice requirement in this case by: (i) setting out each alleged breach of the TPA, including the treaty provisions relevant to each claim; and (ii) describing the factual circumstances alleged to form the basis of each claim with a reasonable degree of specificity.\n\n*(iii) Incidental or Additional Claims*\n---------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nEven if the Criminal Investigation Claims were characterised as separate legal claims or as a separate factual basis for Claimants' claims (which the Tribunal does not consider to be the case), the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that they are not barred by the TPA or the ICSID Arbitration Rules from raising them in the Request for Arbitration.524 In this respect, both the TPA and the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules contemplate the admission of potential claims \"asserted by the claimant for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted.\"525\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 365-372; *quoting* **C-001/RL-051**, TPA Art. 10.16(4); **RL-092**, ICSID Convention, Art. 46; ICSID Arbitration Rule 40; Schreuer Report \u00b6 109; **CL-123**, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

The Tribunal considers, however, that the Criminal Investigation Claims fulfil this requirement. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Kappes v. Guatemala* that the wording of the TPA (which mirrors that of the DR-CAFTA in that case) suggests that no additional notice of intent is required for new claims admitted after the notice of arbitration pursuant to the applicable procedural rules (in that case, also the ICSID Arbitration Rules).529\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 516; *quoting* **RL-092**, ICSID Convention, Art. 46; *citing* **RL-223**, *David R.

Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, 13 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 196-197.\n\n489.\n\nRespondent argues that TPA Article 10.16(4)(a)531 only determines the temporal question of when a claim made for the first time after a notice of arbitration is \"deemed submitted to arbitration\" and does not affect the pre-arbitration notice requirement or the admissibility of the claim.532 The Tribunal agrees that TPA Article 10.16(4)(a) is not about admissibility of additional claims, which is a matter addressed by the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The point is rather that this provision: (i) presupposes the potential existence of such additional claims, subject to their admissibility under the applicable procedural rules; while (ii) remaining silent as to any additional notice or waiting period that would be required in respect of such claims. The fact that this provision relates to claims submitted to arbitration as opposed to the pre-arbitration notice under TPA Article 10.16(2) does not diminish its relevance, since it would be an illogical result if the admission of additional claims prior to a notice of arbitration is more onerous than additional claims made thereafter.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.16(4): \"\u2026A claim asserted by the claimant for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitral rules.\"\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 509, 510, 514.\n\n490.\n\nMoreover, any requirement for an additional notice of intent for incidental claims that arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute would be artificial, contrary to procedural economy, and inconsistent with the purpose of the dispute settlement provisions of Section B of Chapter 10 of the TPA, which is to provide an effective and efficient mechanism for the resolution of investment disputes. The Tribunal subscribes to the view of the *Kappes v. Guatemala* tribunal that such a requirement would be disruptive and duplicative.533\n\n**CL-126**, *Daniel W Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, 13 March 2020, \u00b6 199.\n\n491.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider its interpretation to deprive TPA Article 10.16(2) of effect (*effet utile*). That provision is to be given its full effect by requiring a notice to be issued that sets out the matters specified, in order to give the opportunity for the resolution of the dispute, as was done in the present case. The text of this provision (and its context, object and purpose) provides no basis for a requirement of an additional notice for matters which either fall within the already-identified legal and factual basis for each claim, or for claims arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute which are subsequently admitted by the Tribunal.\n\n*(iv) Conclusion on Criminal Investigation Claims and Notice Requirement*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal determines that the Criminal Investigation Claims are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and are admissible, and rejects Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over those claims.\n\n**(4)****TPA Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nFirst Claimant makes two types of claims under the TPA: (i) under TPA Article 10.16(1)(a)(i)(A) (see \u00b6 264 above), an alleged breach of Respondent's obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment to First Claimant and its investments, to refrain from directly or indirectly expropriating First Claimant's investments, and to treat First Claimant and its investments no less favourably than investors and investments from non-party States;534 and (ii) under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C) (see \u00b6 264 above), an alleged breach of the RER Contract, being an investment agreement between Second Claimant and Respondent.535\n\nMemorial \u00b6 208.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 209; Reply \u00b6 379.\n\n494.\n\nRespondent makes two objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over these claims.

Whether the RER Contract is an \"Investment Agreement\"***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nFor the purposes of First Claimant's TPA claims based on the RER Contract, Respondent disputes the status of the RER Contract as an \"investment agreement\" under the TPA.538 An investment agreement is defined in TPA Article 10.28 as follows:539\n\n\u2026a written agreement540 between a national authority541 of a Party and a covered investment or an investor of another Party, on which the covered investment or the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself, that grants rights to the covered investment or investor:\n\n(a) with respect to natural resources that a national authority controls, such as for their exploration, extraction, refining, transportation, distribution, or sale;\n\n(b) to supply services to the public on behalf of the Party, such as power generation or distribution, water treatment or distribution, or telecommunications; or\n\n(c) to undertake infrastructure projects, such as the construction of roads, bridges, canals, dams, or pipelines, that are not for the exclusive or predominant use and benefit of the government[\u2026]\n\n**RD-01**, Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 15.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.28.\n\nAppearing as footnote 16 in this provision of the TPA: \"'Written agreement' refers to an agreement in writing, executed by both parties, whether in a single instrument or in multiple instruments, that creates an exchange of rights and obligations, binding on both parties under the law applicable under Article 10.22.2. For greater certainty, (a) a unilateral act of an administrative or judicial authority, such as a permit, license, or authorization issued by a Party solely in its regulatory capacity, or a decree, order, or judgment, standing alone; and (b) an administrative or judicial consent decree or order, shall not be considered a written agreement.\"\n\nAppearing as footnote 17 in this provision of the TPA: \"For purposes of this definition, 'national authority' means an authority at the central level of government.\"\n\n497.\n\nRespondent objects that the RER Contract does not grant rights \"to supply services to the public on behalf of [Peru], such as power generation or distribution, water treatment or distribution, or telecommunications,\" since the RER Contract itself does not confer any right to generate energy. Rather, such right would be granted by the separate final concession.542\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 532-533; *citing* Memorial \u00b6 209; Mendoza First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. *See also* Counter- Memorial \u00b6 535; *quoting* Mendoza First Statement \u00b6 14; Sillen First Statement fn 19; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 548, 553, 557-561.\n\n498.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the \"subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired\u2026in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.\"543 In this regard, Respondent submits that a significant portion of Claimants' alleged investments were carried out before the existence of the RER Contract.544\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 541; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 575.\n\n*(i) Character of the RER Contract*\n-----------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nFor Respondent, the RER Contract is a long-term power purchase and sale contract that guarantees Second Claimant the right to receive the Award Tariff for the contracted energy that Second Claimant agrees to inject in the SEIN. To enjoy the rights associated with an investment agreement set out in TPA Article 10.28, Respondent contends that Second Claimant would have had to obtain a final concession.545\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 554. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 555-557; *quoting* **RL-001**, *Ley de Concesiones El\u00e9ctricas*, Arts. 3, 24, 25; **C-002**, RER Contract, Clauses 1.3, 3.2; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 558-561.\n\n500.\n\nIn support of its view, Respondent relies on: (i) Article 3 of the Electricity Concessions Law, referring to the need for a final concession for the generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy; (ii) Article 24 of the Electricity Concessions Law, providing that the final concession allows the use of public use goods; and (iii) the RER Contract itself, which provides that Second Claimant was required to obtain the final concession.546\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 533-534; Rejoinder \u00b6 554-557; *quoting* **RL-001**, *Ley de Concesiones El\u00e9ctricas*, Arts. 3, 24, 25; **C-002**, RER Contract, Clauses 1.3, 3.2.\n\n501.\n\nClaimants disagree with Respondent's characterisation of the RER Contract as a long-term power purchase agreement which does not confer any right to generate power.547 They rely on the language of the title of the RER Contract (\"Concession Contract for the Supply of Renewable Energy to the National Interconnected Electric System\") and the definition of the \"Contract\" in Clause 1.4.12.548\n\nReply \u00b6 379; *see* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 532.\n\nReply \u00b6 380; *quoting* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.12. *See also* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 10.2(d).\n\n502.\n\nIn any event, Claimants submit that a long-term power purchase agreement would also meet the definition of an investment agreement under the TPA, being: (i) an agreement to supply services to the public, as per TPA Article 10.28(b);549 (ii) an agreement \"with respect to natural resources that a national authority controls\" under TPA Article 10.28(a); and (iii) an agreement \"to undertake infrastructure projects\" under TPA Article 10.28(c).550\n\nReply \u00b6 382; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 129.\n\nReply \u00b6 383; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 130.\n\n503.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls with respect to the burden of proof (see \u00b6\u00b6 353-355 above) that for matters of law, it is the Tribunal's task to interpret the legal instruments relevant to its jurisdiction, taking into account the submissions made by the Parties. This applies, for example, to the definition of an investment agreement under the terms of the TPA. While the existence of the RER Contract is established as a matter of fact, its legal characterisation is disputed and will be decided by the Tribunal on the basis of the wording of the TPA and the materials presented by the Parties in support of their respective positions.\n\n504.\n\nFor matters of fact necessary to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction, Claimants bear the burden of establishing the existence of such facts. For present purposes, this is relevant, for example to establish the fact of Claimants' reliance on an investment agreement under TPA Article 10.28 (see \u00b6\u00b6 514 *et seq.* below).\n\n505.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that as stated at \u00b6 345 above, the jurisdictional requirements of the TPA and the ICSID Convention are cumulative. However, Respondent's objection under consideration in this Section relates to the criteria for jurisdiction under the TPA, and not to whether the RER Contract is a covered investment under the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal therefore focuses on the arguments made under the TPA for present purposes.\n\n506.\n\nThe Tribunal has little difficulty in deciding that the RER Contract is an investment agreement within the meaning of TPA Article 10.28. The RER Contract is a written agreement between a national authority (i.e, \"the Peruvian State, herein represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mines\"551) and a covered investment (i.e., Second Claimant, see \u00b6377 above).\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Preamble.\n\n507.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that to be considered an investment agreement, it is not sufficient that the RER Contract relates to the use of national resources, but must \"grant[] rights to the covered investment or investor\" with respect to one of the enumerated areas as stated in the *chapeau* of TPA Article 10.28.552\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 552; *see* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 533-536.\n\n508.\n\nThe RER Contract grants rights falling under the definition in TPA Article 10.28 in a number of respects, including:\n\n(i) Clause 1.4.45: The \"Award Tariff\" is \"\u2026guaranteed to each Awardee for the Net Energy Injections up to the limit of its Awarded Energy.\"553\n\n(ii) Clause 6.2.1: \"The RER generation plant referred to hereunder shall be paid remuneration for Power in accordance with the Applicable Laws.\"\n\n(iii) Clause 6.2.3: \"Net Energy Injections up to the limit of the Awarded Energy shall be remunerated at the Award Tariff.\"\n\n(iv) Clause 6.3.1: \"The Concessionaire Company shall receive, on a monthly basis, payments on account of Guaranteed Revenues for the energy and power injected into the SEIN.\"\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.45. Under Clause 1.4.17, the \"Awarded Energy\" is defined as \"the annual amount of active energy\u2026that the Concessionaire Company undertakes to produce with the RER generation plant awarded and to inject into the electric system until the Termination Date of the Contract.\"\n\n509.\n\nThese provisions are consistent with Clause 1.4.12, which defines the RER Contract as follows:554\n\nConcession Contract for the Supply of Renewable Energy resulting from the Auction\u2026which contains the commitments and conditions related to the construction, operation, supply of power and tariff regime of the RER power plants\u2026\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.12.\n\n510.\n\nLikewise, the RER Contract contains an option for MINEM to terminate the RER Contract in certain circumstances if Second Claimant \"\u2026continues failing to fulfill its obligations of supplying the generated power in compliance with the safety and quality standards set forth in the Contract and the relevant technical standards\u2026\"555\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 10.2(d).\n\n511.\n\nBy virtue of the above provisions, the RER Contract grants Second Claimant rights to supply power generation services to the public on behalf of Respondent, even if such rights may only be exercised together with a final concession to supply electricity which Second Claimant was required to obtain under the RER Contract and Peruvian law. In Clause 1.4.17 of the RER Contract, Second Claimant \"undertakes to produce\" energy using the generation plant and \"to inject [it] into the electric system.\" It has the right to receive the \"Award Tariff\" or guaranteed tariff for that energy, as acknowledged by Respondent.556 This falls precisely within the scope of TPA Article 10.28(b).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 553.\n\n512.\n\nWhile the title of the RER Contract (\"Concession Contract for the Supply of Renewable Energy to the National Interconnected Electric System\") does not determine the legal rights and obligations agreed therein,557 it is consistent with and confirms the above conclusions.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.7. *See* Rejoinder \u00b6 563.\n\n513.\n\nRespondent's argument that the benefits of the RER Contract cannot be obtained without a final concession is beside the point.558 The RER Contract \"grants rights\u2026to supply services to the public.\"559 These rights have value, even if permits are required to put them into practice. The Tribunal considers it uncontroversial that the rights granted under an investment agreement will be subject to obtaining other permits, licenses and authorisations from competent authorities, which are not (and cannot) be granted by way of a contract such as an investment agreement.\n\n*See* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 560-561, 564-565.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.28.\n\n*(ii) Whether Claimants relied on the RER Contract*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nRespondent further submits that the RER Contract is not an agreement \"on which the covered investment or the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment,\" being another requirement in the *chapeau* of TPA Article 10.28. According to Respondent, Claimants have not established that they relied on the RER Contract to acquire the alleged covered investment, *inter alia* because the RER Contract post-dated the establishment of Second Claimant, and could not legally be the basis for the acquisition of the permits, many of which were obtained prior to the RER Contract.560\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 538; Rejoinder \u00b6 568. *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 539.\n\n515.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimants have asserted but not established that any activities, permits and studies were carried out after the execution of the RER Contract, nor that they constituted covered investments under the TPA themselves.561 As for the approval of concessions for the hydroelectric generation plant and transmission lines, Respondent submits that these are not investments based on the RER Contract, since it is possible to have a final concession without an RER Contract.562\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 573; *see* Reply \u00b6 389.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 574; *quoting* Mendoza Statement \u00b6 14; *see* Reply \u00b6 389.\n\n516.\n\nClaimants disagree with Respondent's argument that they could not have relied on the RER Contract when making their investment.563 Claimants argue, in this respect, that: (i) the execution of the RER Contract after Second Claimant's formation was a requirement of Peruvian law and TPA Article 10.28 itself;564 (ii) the principle of unity of investment views investment activities as an integrated whole;565 and (iii) numerous activities, permits and studies were carried out after the execution of the RER Contract.566\n\nReply \u00b6 386; *see* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 538.\n\nReply \u00b6 387.\n\nReply \u00b6 388; *quoting* Schreuer Report, \u00b6 139; **CL-016**, *Bear Creek Mining Corporation v.

The covered investments therefore entailed the commitment of capital, the expectation of gain and the assumption of risk in the form of an enterprise (Second Claimant)569 and authorisations and permits under Peruvian law.570\n\nReply \u00b6 389; Schreuer Report \u00b6\u00b6 142-143.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **C-265**, Latam Hydro LLC's invoices, audited and unaudited financial statements and tax returns; **BRG-004**, BRG Investment Value Calculations; BRG First Report \u00b6\u00b6 161-162, Table 8; **BRG-081**, BRG Updated Investment Value Calculations, tab \"Investment Value Mamacocha\"; **BRG-100**, Claimants' Accounting Records of Actual Expenses; BRG Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 167-171, Table 8; **CD-06**, Claimants' Closing Presentation, slide 127; Claimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2005:15-2006:7.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.28(a).\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.28(g).\n\n519.\n\nTo recall, as described at \u00b6 109 above, in order to obtain the power-generation and transmission concessions, Second Claimant required a number of permits or certificates including: (i) water use; (ii) environmental certification; (iii) a pre-operational grid impact study; and (iv) an archaeological certificate. The transmission line and the power generation final concessions were issued in March and June 2016, respectively (see \u00b6 109(v) above).571\n\n**R-128**, *Informe de Gesti\u00f3n No. 9, HLA*, 11 July 2015, p. 4. *See* Memorial \u00b6 82; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 169; Bartrina First Statement \u00b6 59.\n\n520.\n\nThe fact that certain of Claimants' investment activities were undertaken prior to the execution of the RER Contract does not negate the fact that Claimants also relied on the RER Contract to continue to establish and acquire covered investments after it was entered into. As is well established, \"an investment typically consists of several interrelated economic activities which, step by step, finally lead to the implementation of a project\u2026\"572\n\n**CL-016**, *Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21, Award, 30 November 2017, \u00b6 296.\n\n521.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore satisfied that Claimants relied on the RER Contract to establish or acquire a covered investment other than the RER Contract, as required by TPA Article 10.28.\n\n522.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address the relevance of Claimants' additional argument that it was required to establish Second Claimant prior to execution of the RER Contract by Peruvian law and the TPA.573 The Tribunal merely notes that this is correct with respect to Peruvian law,574 but as Respondent points out it is not a requirement of TPA Article 10.28.575\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 387.\n\n*See* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.44.\n\n*See* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 569-572.\n\n*(iii) Direct Relationship with Subject Matter and Damages*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nRespondent makes a further assertion that Claimants have not proven that the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, as required by TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C).576 The wording of the provision is as follows:577\n\n\u2026provided that a claimant may submit\u2026a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 541.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C).\n\n524.\n\nClaimants do not consider this objection to be related to the definition of an investment agreement, and argue in any event that the requirement is satisfied in the present case.578\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 392-393.\n\n525.\n\nWhile this text is not part of the definition of an investment agreement in TPA Article 10.28, it may be understood as an aspect of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* on the basis of the requirement that a claimant may submit a claim to arbitration \"only if\" this subject matter requirement is fulfilled.\n\n526.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the subject matter of First Claimant's claim on behalf of Second Claimant under the TPA directly relates to the covered investments that were established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired in reliance on the RER Contract. In this respect, the language of TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C) directly tracks the definition in TPA Article 10.28, by referring to reliance on an investment agreement \"in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself.\"579\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.28.\n\n527.\n\nAside from the claims for the Upstream Projects which will be discussed in the next Section, the subject matter of the claims made for breach of the RER Contract all relate to the Mamacocha Project. These alleged breaches by Respondent with respect to the Mamacocha Project directly relate to the covered investments established or acquired in performing the RER Contract for the purposes of the Mamacocha Project (i.e., the commitment of capital, the expectation of gain and the assumption of risk in the form of an enterprise (Second Claimant) and in the form of authorisations and permits under Peruvian law, see \u00b6 518 above).\n\n528.\n\nLikewise, the damages claimed are based on Claimants' assertion that all or substantially all of the economic value of the Mamacocha Project was destroyed by Respondent's measures.580 This includes, and is directly related to, the capital contributions made and the concessions needed to carry out the Project.\n\nReply \u00b6 941.\n\n***b. Claims Concerning the Upstream Projects***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nRespondent objects that Claimants' claim for USD 0.142 million in relation to the Upstream Projects is not part of a covered investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or TPA Article 10.28.581 The Upstream Projects intended to make use of the waterways upstream of the Mamacocha Lagoon to power a number of small hydroelectric plants (see \u00b6 87 above).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 543, 560; *quoting* **RL-051/C-001**, TPA, Art. 10.28. *See* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, 144, 172, 177, 540-543, fn 965.\n\n530.\n\nRespondent argues that the Upstream Projects are to be treated as independent of the Mamacocha Project,582 while Claimants submit that they are all part of one integrated583 investment.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 545; *see* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 199-203.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 435, 437; *quoting* **CL-122**, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, \u00b6 72.\n\n531.\n\nIn order to decide whether it has jurisdiction over the Upstream Projects, the Tribunal will consider: (i) the scope of investments covered under the ICSID Convention and the TPA; and (ii) whether the Upstream Projects fall within that scope.\n\n*(i) Scope of an Investment and Pre-Investment Activities*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides that the jurisdiction of the Centre extends to a legal dispute \"arising directly out of an investment\" (see \u00b6 272 above). The ICSID Convention does not define what will be considered an \"investment.\"\n\n533.\n\nTPA Article 10.16 sets out that \"an investment dispute\" may be submitted to arbitration (see \u00b6 264 above). TPA Article 10.28 defines an investment as meaning \"every asset that an investor owns or controls\u2026that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk,\" specifying a number of forms that an investment may take (see \u00b6 261 above).\n\n534.\n\nIn the present case, any investments over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction must fulfil the criteria of both the ICSID Convention and the TPA.\n\n535.\n\nRespondent argues that pre-investment activities such as those Claimants undertook for the Upstream Projects do not constitute an \"investment\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.584 In support, Respondent relies on the decisions of: (i) *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka* (lack of jurisdiction over preliminary expenses);585 (ii) *Zhinvali v. Georgia* (rejection of claims for development costs);586 (iii) *Eyre v. Sri Lanka* (preliminary efforts and expenditures do not constitute an investment);587 and (iv) *Nordzucker v.

These decisions confirm that activities constituting the early stage of an integrated investment, being a fundamental part of the overall project, have been considered covered investments.590 The Tribunal in *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* expressed this as follows:591\n\n\u2026a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment.\n\n*See* **CL-174**, *RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/14, Award, 13 March 2009, \u00b6 256.\n\n**CL-122**, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, \u00b6 72.\n\n538.\n\nOn the other hand, where the transaction or activities in question do not form an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment, prior tribunals have held that there is no covered investment. In this regard, the tribunal in *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka* found that:592\n\nThe Tribunal is\u2026unable to accept as a valid denomination of \"investment\", the unilateral or internal characterization of certain expenditures by the Claimant in preparation for a project of investment.\n\n**RL-102**, *Mihaly International Corp. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award, 15 March 2002, \u00b6 61.\n\n539.\n\nThe tribunal in *Eyre v. Sri Lanka* further held that the principle of unity of investment did not \"elevate\" the investor's payments and efforts in relation to a potential hotel development to the contribution and operational risk necessary to prove a qualifying investment.593 It was determined that:594\n\nThere must have been substantive commitments and arrangements entered into, involving specific commitments and financial costs, all of which would entail both certain risks as well as possible benefits.\n\n**RL-100**, *Raymond Charles Eyre and Montrose Development (Private) Ltd v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/25, Award, 5 March 2020, \u00b6 301.\n\n**RL-100**, *Raymond Charles Eyre and Montrose Development (Private) Ltd v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/25, Award, 5 March 2020, \u00b6 301.\n\n540.\n\nThe findings of ICSID tribunals with respect to pre-investment activities that do not qualify as an investment are consistent with the definition of an investment under the TPA, requiring \"the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\" Since the specific criteria of the TPA must be fulfilled in the present case, the Tribunal will use the TPA terminology as the primary reference. The Tribunal does not consider the ICSID Convention definition of an investment to be different to the definition under the TPA for the purposes of the present question before it.\n\n541.\n\nThe Tribunal subscribes to the principle of the unity of an investment, and has already noted at \u00b6 520 above that an investment typically consists of several interrelated economic activities. This does not mean, however, that the scope of an investment is boundless or self-defined by the investor. An investment must satisfy the definition under the TPA and be an investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. In order to be considered a single investment, the economic activities in question must constitute a unified whole, which is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of a particular case based on the economic, legal, operational and temporal relationships between those economic activities.\n\n*(ii) Whether the Upstream Projects are Covered Investments*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nIn order to decide whether the Upstream Projects are, or form part of, First Claimant's covered investments, the Tribunal will consider whether the Upstream Projects entailed \"the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk\" as required by TPA Article 10.28. To the extent that Claimants' activities with respect to the Upstream Projects do not constitute standalone investments under this definition, the Tribunal will consider whether they constitute an integral part of those operations that do constitute a covered investment.\n\n543.\n\nAccording to Claimants, when they decided to invest in Peru, they commissioned a feasibility study for the Mamacocha Project and a conceptual design for the Upstream Projects.595 Claimants argue that the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects were presented to prospective investors as a combined product, to be developed in phases starting with the Mamacocha Project first, and once construction was underway Second Claimant would transition from the development of the Mamacocha Project to the development of the Upstream Projects.596\n\nReply \u00b6 433; *citing* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 50-58; **C-102**, Email from A.

My team would then pivot to developing the Upstream Projects. The rationale for this sequential approach was three-fold. First, it was too expensive to develop the Upstream Projects at the same time as the Mamacocha Project. Second, successful completion of the first project would enhance the team's credibility and provide both legal rights and critical infrastructure for the upstream projects. Third, a successful initial project would permit us to work with and get to know the local communities that were important to the approval of the Upstream Projects.\n\nJacobson Second Statement \u00b6 15.\n\nJacobson First Statement \u00b6 15. *See also* Bartina First Statement \u00b6 25; Sillen First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n\n550.\n\nIn 2015, P\u00f6yry continued working on the conceptual design of the Upstream Projects,605 and in 2016 provided its final report on the conceptual design.606 On Claimants' own evidence, the Upstream Projects did not advance beyond the conceptual design stage.607\n\n**HKA-004**, Mamacocha \u2013 Upstream Projects: Conceptual Design, P\u00f6yry, 30 September 2015; *see* Sillen First Statement \u00b6 38.\n\n**BRG-037**, *Proyectos Alto Castilla: Dise\u00f1o Conceptual y Aplicaci\u00f3n para Derechos de Agua \u2013 Informe de Dise\u00f1o Conceptual*, P\u00f6yry, June 2016.\n\nSillen First Statement \u00b6 41.\n\n551.\n\nIn addition, it has not been asserted that Respondent made any contractual, regulatory or other commitments with respect to the Upstream Projects, whether on a standalone basis or as part of any packaging of the Upstream Projects together with the Mamacocha Project.\n\n552.\n\nBased on the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that the Upstream Projects are not a standalone investment protected under the TPA or the ICSID Convention. In particular, they did not entail the \"commitment of capital or other resources\" or \"the assumption of risk\" as required by TPA Article 10.28 to be considered an investment in their own right. The Upstream Projects did not proceed beyond the preliminary stage of conceptual design, prior to the commitment of capital beyond the commissioning of the feasibility study and conceptual design of the projects.608 The Upstream Projects are typical pre-investment activities as referred to by several other arbitral tribunals (see \u00b6\u00b6 538-539 above).\n\n*See* **BRG-037**, *Proyectos Alto Castilla: Dise\u00f1o Conceptual y Aplicaci\u00f3n para Derechos de Agua \u2013 Informe de Dise\u00f1o Conceptual, P\u00f6yry*, June 2016, p. 1 for the anticipated stages of the Upstream Projects.\n\n553.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider the Upstream Projects to be an integral part of First Claimant's other investments. In this respect, the Mamacocha Project and the Upstream Projects were to run on different timelines, based on separate permits, separate contractual relationships, and separate budgets. While it was anticipated that some reporting and work on community relationships carried out for the Mamacocha Project could be applied to the Upstream Projects,609 and that the Upstream Projects could make use of some of the infrastructure used for the Mamacocha Project,610 this is not sufficient to make them a part of the same project or investment. To consider the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects as two parts of essentially one unified project would be a distortion of the evidence before the Tribunal. The Mamacocha and Upstream Projects were not legally or economically interdependent, and the Upstream Projects are not a fundamental part of the Mamacocha Project, or vice versa.\n\n**C-032**, Latam Hydro's Investor Presentation prepared by Equitas Partners, August 2014, slide 34 (p. 35 of the pdf).\n\nSillen First Statement \u00b6 39.\n\n554.\n\nIn this respect, the fact that the two projects were presented to investors together as part of the portfolio of Second Claimant does not assist Claimants, since the Tribunal is required to examine the objective nature of the projects. Moreover, in the investor presentation the two projects are clearly distinguished (see \u00b6 547 above). Claimants' subjective intention to proceed with the Upstream Projects is not sufficient. As highlighted by prior tribunals, the scope of an investment is not to be determined by an investor's intended acquisitions or unilateral characterisation of its projects (see \u00b6 538 above). Among other things, this would lead to absurd results where an investor could claim protection for all envisaged investments simply by virtue of having made one investment in a country, which would not otherwise be subject to protection. This would discriminate against candidates for future investment who had not yet made such an earlier investment in a country.611\n\n**RL-099**, *Nordzucker AG v. Republic of Poland,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 10 December 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 151- 152.\n\n555.\n\nWhile Claimants argue that the Upstream Projects never proceeded due to Respondent's measures against the Mamacocha Project,612 this is inapposite since the Upstream Projects never attained the status of protected investments under the TPA or the ICSID Convention in the first place, whether on their own or as part of the Mamacocha Project.\n\nSillen First Statement \u00b6 41.\n\n*(iii) Conclusion on Upstream Projects*\n---------------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the claims made or relief sought under the TPA in relation to the Upstream Projects. This conclusion is clear from Claimants' own internal contemporaneous documents (see \u00b6 547 above), as well as the other evidence on the record.\n\n**(5) Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis**\n-------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nClaimants argue that their investments in Peru are qualifying investments under the TPA and the ICSID Convention.613 Respondent has not raised an objection with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 220(b). *See also* Memorial \u00b6 202.\n\n558.\n\nTPA Article 1.3 defines a \"covered investment\" as being \"in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter.\"614 Such \"covered investments\" fall within the scope of TPA Chapter 10.615\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 1.3.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.1(1)(b).\n\n559.\n\nSince Claimants' investments in Peru were made following the entry into force of the TPA (1 February 2009) and the ICSID Convention (entry into force for Peru on 8 September 1993; entry into force for the United States on 14 October 1966), the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Claimants' claims with respect to those investments.\n\n**(6) Jurisdiction under the RER Contract**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nClaimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the RER Contract.616 Respondent's jurisdictional objections are made on the basis of the TPA and the ICSID Convention.617 While Respondent has not raised an explicit objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract on the basis of these matters, the Tribunal understands that certain of those objections may be relevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract, in particular in relation to jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention (see \u00b6\u00b6 347, 379 and 401 above). The Tribunal will examine these points for the purposes of satisfying itself of its jurisdiction.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 225.\n\n*See* **RD-01**, Respondent's Opening Presentation, slide 15.\n\n561.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal confirms its finding that both Claimants fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention, which conclusion applies also to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract (see \u00b6\u00b6 371 and 401 above).\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Respondent argues that the RER Contract only binds MINEM and not the Republic of Peru as a State.618 While this argument does not dispute the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Respondent, the Tribunal merely notes at this stage its conclusion reached below, i.e., that Respondent is the correct counterparty to the RER Contract (see \u00b6 651 below).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 880-892; Rejoinder \u00b6 943.\n\n563.\n\nThe Tribunal reserves the question of its jurisdiction or the scope of any damages with regard to the Upstream Projects for the purposes of the RER Contract, and will address this issue to the extent required (see \u00b6 999 below).\n\n564.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the other key requirements of Clause 11.3(a) of the RER Contract to be met for the purposes of invoking the arbitration clause. One such requirement is that the dispute does not have a technical nature (a \"Non-Technical Dispute\") or there is disagreement about whether it has a technical nature (see Clause 11.1 of the RER Contract at \u00b6 273 above). Claimants have asserted and the Tribunal agrees that the dispute is a non-technical one. Even if there were disagreement about whether the dispute is technical in nature, Clause 11.1 of the RER Contract specifies that it will be treated as a Non-Technical Dispute for purposes of arbitration under Clause 11.3.\n\n565.\n\nAn additional requirement for the exercise of Clause 11.3(a), i.e., ICSID arbitration, is that the dispute involves \"amounts exceeding Twenty Million Dollars (USD 20,000,000) or its equivalent in national currency.\" Since Claimants' claims exceed USD 45 million (see \u00b6 236 above), this requirement is also satisfied.\n\n566.\n\nClause 11.3(a) of the RER Contract further specifies that the arbitration conducted pursuant to that clause \"shall be conducted in Spanish\" and the award \"shall be rendered within ninety (90) Days following the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.\" It further sets out a specific method for selection of the presiding arbitrator. As already noted at \u00b6 435 above, in the course of this arbitration Respondent reached a number of subsequent procedural agreements with Claimants as recorded in agreements concerning the appointment of the presiding arbitrator, as well as its correspondence of 23 April 2020 and Procedural Order No. 2 dated 13 May 2020. These included: (i) English as a procedural language of the arbitration in addition to Spanish; (ii) a procedural timetable exceeding the one provided for under the RER Contract and a provision that the Tribunal will draft the award \"within a reasonable time period\"; and (iii) confirmation that the Tribunal had been properly constituted. The Parties duly performed these agreements by complying with the language arrangements and filing their written submissions in accordance with the agreed timetable. In any event, the Parties have not objected thereto in the course of the proceedings.\n\n567.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms its jurisdiction under the RER Contract to decide upon Claimants' claims.\n\n(7) **Conclusion on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal determines that:\n\n(i) It has jurisdiction over First Claimant's claims under the TPA, with the exception that it has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over First Claimant's claims with respect to the Upstream Projects; and\n\n(ii) It has jurisdiction over Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract.\n\n**VIII. ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE RER CONTRACT AND PERUVIAN LAW**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal shall decide upon Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract and Peruvian law.\n\n570.\n\nWith respect to the structure of its decisions in this Award, Tribunal Question 12 asked the Parties as follows:\n\nAssuming without admitting the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal over Claimants' claims under the Treaty and the RER Contract, should the Arbitral Tribunal consider and decide first on the contractual claims of Second Claimant?\n\n(i) If so, what is the relevance, if any, of such considerations and decisions on the BIT claims of Latam Hydro?\n\n(ii) Conversely, if the BIT claims are decided first, what is the relevance, if any, of the decisions on the BIT claims for the contractual claims of Second Claimant?\n\n571.\n\nClaimants argue that these two claims are \"independent branches or approaches to liability\" and their preference is for the Tribunal \"to decide both in the interests of justice and a complete resolution of the dispute.\"619\n\nClaimants' response to the President's question, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1970:16-22.\n\n572.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal should first consider Second Claimant's claims under the Contract because the success of virtually all Claimants' treaty claims is premised on their interpretation of the Contract.620\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2090:7-20.\n\n573.\n\nIn light of the various overlapping matters between the two claims, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to first decide upon Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract, before turning to First Claimant's claims under the TPA. The Tribunal will consider any implications of its findings under the RER Contract for First Claimant's claims under the TPA at \u00b6\u00b6 1187-1198 below.\n\n574.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants have submitted joint pleadings in relation to their claims made under the RER Contract and the TPA. Second Claimant is the sole Claimant for the claims made under the RER Contract. However, First Claimant also makes claims on behalf of Second Claimant under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C) for Peru's alleged breaches of an investment agreement.621 The Tribunal understands these claims under the TPA to be based upon the same alleged breaches of contract, and will treat them together with Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 188; Reply \u00b6 314.\n\n575.\n\nIn deciding on Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract, in this Section the Tribunal will first consider the law applicable to the RER Contract (Section A), before considering the issue of the parties to the RER Contract (Section B). In Sections C to K the Tribunal decides upon a number of alleged breaches of the RER Contract. In Section L the Tribunal analyses an issue related to the termination of the RER Contract and the execution of the Performance Bond. Section M contains the Tribunal's conclusion on liability under the RER Contract.\n\n**A. L aw A pplicable to the RER C ontract and its I nterpretation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nClause 1.2 of the RER Contract provides:622\n\nThis Contract has been drafted and signed in accordance with the domestic law of Peru, which shall govern its content, performance and any other consequences arising from this Contract.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.2.\n\n577.\n\nClause 1.4.30 of the RER Contract further provides:623\n\n**Applicable Laws** means all binding legal laws and Court precedents that comprise the Internal Laws of Peru, which may be amended or supplemented by Government Authorities from time to time.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.30.\n\n578.\n\nBased on the foregoing provisions, it is evident that Peruvian law governs the RER Contract, and neither Party has contended otherwise. The Parties' disagreements with respect to the applicable law stem from different views as to which provisions of Peruvian law apply to the RER Contract, and the way in which they are applied. The Tribunal will address those disagreements in the course of its reasoning to the extent necessary to resolve particular issues in dispute. At this stage, the Tribunal finds it helpful to clarify: (i) the application of the Peruvian Civil Code to the Parties' dispute; (ii) the relevant principles of contractual interpretation; and (iii) the character of the RER Contract under Peruvian law.\n\n579.\n\nIn reaching its conclusions, the Tribunal makes reference to evidence put forward by the Parties in the form of legal opinions from Claimants' experts Dr. Qui\u00f1ones (Peruvian administrative law) and Dr. Benavides (Peruvian civil law), and Respondent's experts Mr. Lava (Peruvian civil law) and Mr. Monteza (Peruvian administrative law).\n\n**(1) Application of the Peruvian Civil Code**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n580.\n\nThe question of whether and how the Peruvian Civil Code applies to the Parties' dispute is relevant to specific issues that will be addressed below. At this stage, the Tribunal finds it helpful to address the application of the Peruvian Civil Code in general terms only.\n\n581.\n\nClaimants argue that specific provisions of the RER Contract:624\n\n\u2026must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the plain-language of the RER Contract *as well as* the legal principles from the Civil Code, which are expressly incorporated under Clauses 1.2 and 1.4.30. (emphasis in original)\n\nMemorial \u00b6 424. *See also* Reply \u00b6 658.\n\n582.\n\nRespondent disagrees, arguing that all rules in the Peruvian legal system do not apply equally and to the same degree to the RER Contract. In order to know which rules apply to a given situation, Respondent argues that criteria of interpretation must be applied, being the hierarchy of norms, temporality and speciality of the rule.625 For Respondent, Article IX of the Peruvian Civil Code itself provides the answer as to how it applies.626\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 925-926; *quoting* Lava Second Report \u00b6 3.3; *also citing* Lava Second Report \u00b6 3.11.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 931; *quoting* Lava Second Report \u00b6 3.23.\n\n583.\n\nIn accordance with Article IX of the *T\u00edtulo Preliminar* of the Peruvian Civil Code, \"[l]*as disposiciones del C\u00f3digo Civil se aplican supletoriamente a las relaciones y situaciones jur\u00eddicas reguladas por otras leyes, siempre que no sean incompatibles con su naturaleza*.\"627\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Article IX, *T\u00edtulo Preliminar*, p. 63\n\n584.\n\nBoth Claimants' expert Dr. Benavides and Respondent's expert Mr. Lava confirm that Article IX quoted in \u00b6 583 above means that in order to apply the provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code, it is necessary to conduct an analysis on a case by case basis. One must: (i) first, determine whether the legal relationship or situation is regulated by other norms or laws which may provide a solution; and (ii) where the situation is governed by other norms or laws but those norms or laws do not resolve the situation in question, additionally or in a supplementary manner (\"*supletoriamente*\") apply the Peruvian Civil Code where its provisions are not incompatible with the nature of that other law.628\n\nCross-examination of Mr. Benavides, Transcript (Day 4), 10 March 2022,768:8-769:3, 770:14-17; Lava First Report \u00b6 2.14. *See also* Lava Second Report \u00b6 3.102.\n\n585.\n\nThe meaning of \"*supletoriamente*\" is elaborated in commentary cited by Mr. Lava, which states:629\n\n*La aplicaci\u00f3n supletoria significa que, en la medida en que aquellas otras leyes no hayan sido consideradas determinadas soluciones necesarias, entonces podr\u00e1 aplicarse las que contienen las normas civiles.*\n\n*...*\n\n*De tal manera que no puede establecerse reglas generales y v\u00e1lidas para todos los casos. Simplemente, el criterio metodol\u00f3gico a adoptar ser\u00e1 el de analizar, en cada situaci\u00f3n, los principios subyacentes al caso materia de estudio, y compararlos con los principios correspondientes a la normatividad civil que ser\u00eda supletoriamente aplicable*.\n\n**CLC-088**, *Rubio Correa, Marcial. Biblioteca para leer el C\u00f3digo Civil. Volumen III, sexta edici\u00f3n. Lima: Fondo Editorial de la Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa*, pp. 154-164; *see* Lava First Report \u00b6 2.13.\n\n586.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with this understanding and therefore agrees with Respondent that the Peruvian Civil Code applies under the conditions set out in Article IX of the *T\u00edtulo Preliminar* thereof. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to enter into further analysis of the hierarchy of norms or otherwise in order to resolve this issue.\n\n587.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that Peruvian law operates in the manner sought to be established by Claimants. Neither the RER Contract nor the Peruvian Civil Code state that the RER Contract will be interpreted to align with every legal principle in the Peruvian Civil Code. Such an approach would ignore the language of the Peruvian Civil Code itself, which specifies the circumstances in which its provisions apply (see \u00b6 580 above). Clauses 1.2 and 1.4.30 of the RER Contract do not supplant the rules governing the Peruvian legal order, but rather incorporate them.\n\n588.\n\nThe question of whether and to what extent a provision of the Peruvian Civil Code applies to a given situation under the RER Contract must therefore be resolved on a case by case basis. As such, the Tribunal agrees with the opinion of Mr. Lava that \"*el an\u00e1lisis debe partir necesariamente del propio Contrato y dicho an\u00e1lisis no requiere ser consistente con los principios legales del C\u00f3digo Civil*.\"630\n\nLava Second Report \u00b6 3.102.\n\n589.\n\nRegarding Claimants' assertion that the Peruvian Civil Code imposes \"independent legal standards\" that may result in an \"independent breach of the RER Contract,\"631 the Tribunal will examine each specific situation in the course of its analysis in order to determine whether this is the case for the legal standard and alleged breach in question.\n\nReply \u00b6 660.\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal will likewise consider the applicability of other Peruvian laws on a case-by-case basis as relevant, including the Peruvian General Law of Administrative Procedure (\"**GLAP**\") and the *Texto \u00danico de Procedimientos Administrativos* (\"**TUPA**\").\n\n**(2) Principles of Contractual Interpretation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n591.\n\nChapter IV of the Peruvian Civil Code, including Articles 168 to 170 thereof, set out the principles applicable to the interpretation of legal relations and situations. These principles are referred to by both sides' legal experts in support of their respective opinions on Peruvian law.632\n\nBenavides First Report \u00b6 134; Qui\u00f1ones Second Report \u00b6 35; Lava First Report \u00b6\u00b6 5.2, 5.5, 5.8.\n\n592.\n\nPursuant to the analysis under Article IX of the Peruvian Civil Code set out at \u00b6 584 above, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Lava and Dr. Benavides that these provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code apply to the interpretation of the RER Contract. This is on the basis that: (i) the RER Law, the RER Regulations, the Electricity Concessions Law and the Regulations of the Electricity Concessions Law do not contain norms or criteria of contractual interpretation; and (ii) there is no incompatibility between the norms of contractual interpretation in the Peruvian Civil Code and the RER Law, RER Regulations, or other applicable laws.633\n\n*See* Lava Second Report \u00b6 3.37; Benavides First Report \u00b6 84; Cross-examination of Mr. Benavides, Transcript (Day 4), 10 March 2022, 769:15-770:5.\n\n593.\n\nThe Tribunal reserves the question of whether other provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code apply to the Parties' relationship, which are to be examined on a case by case basis.\n\n594.\n\nArticle 168 of the Peruvian Civil Code is entitled \"objective interpretation\" (*interpretaci\u00f3n objetiva*) (also referred to as \"literal interpretation\") and provides that \"[*e*]*l acto jur\u00eddico debe ser interpretado de acuerdo con lo que se haya expresado en \u00e9l y seg\u00fan el principio de la buena fe*.\"634\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 168.\n\n595.\n\nBoth Dr. Benavides635 and Mr. Lava636 link the reference to good faith in Article 168 with Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code: \"[l]*os contratos deben negociarse, celebrarse y ejecutarse seg\u00fan las reglas de la buena fe y com\u00fan intenci\u00f3n de las partes*.\"637\n\nBenavides First Report \u00b6 124; Benavides Second Report \u00b6 216.\n\nLava First Report \u00b6 5.2.\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 1362.\n\n596.\n\nArticle 169 of the Peruvian Civil Code is entitled \"*systematic interpretation*\" (interpretaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica) and provides that: \"[l]*as cl\u00e1usulas de los actos jur\u00eddicos se interpretan las unas por medio de las otras, atribuy\u00e9ndose a las dudosas el sentido que resulte del conjunto de todas*.\"638\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 169.\n\n597.\n\nArticle 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code is entitled \"*interpretaci\u00f3n integral*\" (also referred to as functional interpretation, \"*interpretaci\u00f3n teleol\u00f3gica*\" or \"*interpretaci\u00f3n funcional*\")639 and states that \"[*l*]*as expresiones que tengan varios sentidos deben entenderse en el m\u00e1s adecuado a la naturaleza y al objeto del acto*.\"640\n\nBenavides First Report \u00b6 136.\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 170.\n\n598.\n\nThe Parties' experts are in agreement that Article 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code is to be applied when a literal interpretation is not sufficient to clearly determine what the parties agreed.641 For Dr. Benavides, Article 169 of the Peruvian Civil Code is likewise to be applied in circumstances where a literal interpretation does not allow a clear determination of the Parties' intentions.642\n\nBenavides First Report \u00b6 134; Lava Second Expert Report \u00b6\u00b6 3.81-3.82.\n\nBenavides First Report \u00b6 134.\n\n599.\n\nIn interpreting the RER Contract, the Tribunal will apply Articles 168 to 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code, starting with an objective interpretation under Article 168, and proceeding with Articles 169 and 170 as appropriate.\n\n**(3) Character of the RER Contract**\n-------------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nThe Parties and their respective legal experts agree that the RER Contract is an administrative contract under Peruvian law.643 However, they disagree on what kind of administrative contract, and the implications for interpretation of the RER Contract. Claimants argue that the RER Contract is a \"public-private partnership agreement\" under Peruvian law, while Respondent submits that it is a \"regulated contract\" (*contrato normado*).644\n\nMemorial \u00b6 407; Rejoinder \u00b6 922; **CD-02**, Benavides Presentation, slide 5; **RD-02**, Monteza Presentation, slide 8.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 675, 676; Rejoinder \u00b6 933.\n\n601.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties' respective submissions and the views of their experts, the Tribunal is satisfied that the RER Contract is a *contrato normado* under Peruvian law. As Claimants put it, *contratos normados* are a specific type of contract that allow the State to \"impose inflexible conditions that its counterparty cannot ignore or modify.\"645 Such contracts are covered by Article 1355 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which is entitled \"*Regla y l\u00edmites de la contrataci\u00f3n*\" (\"Rule and limitations on Contracting\") and states:646\n\nThe law, for reasons of social, public or ethical interest, can impose rules or set limits to the contents of the contracts.\n\nReply \u00b6 677.\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 1355, Translation by Claimants at Reply \u00b6 677.\n\n602.\n\nCorresponding to this definition, the RER Regulations issued under the RER Law contain clear provisions which have been incorporated into the RER Contract. This includes provisions defining the contract, its termination date, the revenue guaranteed, and others.\n\n603.\n\nThe provisions corresponding between the RER Regulations and the RER Contract were summarised by Mr. Lava as follows:647\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Contenido, regla o limitaci\u00f3n** | **Reglamento de la Ley RER** | **Contrato** |\n| Cargo por Prima | 1.4. | 1.4.8. |\n| Contrato | 1.8 | 1.4.12 |\n| Energ\u00eda Adjudicada | 1.10. | 1.4.17. |\n| Energ\u00eda Dejada de Inyectar por Causas Ajenas al Generador RER | 1.11. | 1.4.18. |\n| Factor de Correcci\u00f3n | 1.13 | 1.4.20 |\n| Fecha de Cierre | 1.13.A | 1.4.21 |\n| Fecha de t\u00e9rmino del Contrato | 1.13.

As Respondent demonstrates651 and is clear from its text, Article 1355 of the Peruvian Civil Code (see \u00b6 601 above) does not contain a limitation that only contracts between private parties can be *contratos normados*.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 936; *citing* Lava Second Report \u00b6 4.2.\n\n606.\n\nRegarding the contents of the RER Contract (item (ii) of \u00b6 604 above), the Tribunal agrees with Respondent652 that in order to be characterised as a *contrato normado*, it is not required for the entire content of the agreement to be imposed by law. The regulated aspect may concern specific provisions in the agreement, being those set down in the law.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 937; *citing* Lava Second Report \u00b6 4.7.\n\n607.\n\nDr. Benavides' opinion to the contrary is based on his view that the RER Law and RER Regulations do not impose the contents of the RER Contract, and the State (in his view, the counterparty to the RER Contract) has broad leeway in drafting the contractual clauses.653 According to Dr. Benavides, the references to the RER Contract in the RER Law and RER Regulations are scarce.654\n\nBenavides Second Report \u00b6 63.\n\nBenavides Second Report \u00b6 41.\n\n608.\n\nThis view is contradicted by a review of the RER Regulations, which set out key mandatory terms for the RER Contract (see \u00b6 603 above). It is further confirmed in the RER Contract itself, which refers to the legal framework in which the agreement was reached in Clause 1.1:655\n\nThis Contract is entered into as a result of a Public Tender process conducted by OSINERGMIN under Supreme Decrees No. 012-2011-EM and No. 024-2013-EM [i.e., SD 24], Regulations of Legislative Decree No. 1002 on the Promotion of Investment for the Generation of Electricity from Renewable Energies [i.e., RER Regulations]\u2026\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Art. 1.1.\n\n609.\n\nWhile the RER Contract remains a contract, in the sense that it contains an agreement between the parties, certain provisions of that agreement have been set down by law.\n\n610.\n\nIn respect of the public interest (item (iii) of \u00b6 604 above), the Tribunal has little difficulty in finding that the RER Contract furthers the express public interest set out in the Preamble of the RER Law:656\n\nThe promotion of renewable energies, eliminating any barrier or obstacle for their development, implies promoting the diversification of the energy matrix, becoming an advance towards an energy security and environmental protection policy, being of public interest to provide a legal framework in which these energies are developed to encourage these investments and amend existing rules and regulations\u2026\n\n**C-007**, Legislative Decree No. 1002, 1 May 2008, Preamble.\n\n611.\n\nDr. Benavides himself also characterises the RER Contract as \"an administrative contract with the pursuit of public interest,\"657 even if he sees it as a complex or atypical administrative contract.658 Claimants do not contradict this, submitting that the public interest in the RER Law and flowing into the RER Contract is \"the public's interest in promoting, protecting and incentivizing RER projects.\"659 Claimants miss the point by arguing that this interest would be undermined by the \"inflexible and rigid restrictions on concessionaires\" under Respondent's interpretation.660 For present purposes, the Tribunal is satisfied that the RER Contract is executed in furtherance of a public interest set forth in the RER Law. The interpretation of the requirements of the RER Contract will be addressed as relevant later in this Award.\n\nPresentation of Dr. Benavides, Transcript (Day 4), 10 March 2022, 731:10-13.\n\nPresentation of Dr. Benavides, Transcript (Day 4), 10 March 2022, 731:10-18.\n\nReply \u00b6 684; *citing* **C-007**, Legislative Decree No. 1002, 1 May 2008, Preamble.\n\nReply \u00b6 684.\n\n612.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that at least two other arbitral tribunals deciding upon separate disputes under concession contracts pursuant to the RER Law and RER Regulations have reached the same conclusion that contracts like the RER Contract in question are *contratos normados* under Peruvian law.661\n\n**RL-095**, *Electro Za\u00f1a* Award, \u00b6 221; **RL-098**, *Santa Lorenza* Award, \u00b6 164.\n\n613.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the RER Contract is a *contrato normado* under Peruvian law. The RER Contract is executed under a binding legal framework which includes the RER Law and the RER Regulations. The Tribunal accepts Respondent's position that the administrative legal framework must be applied pursuant to the hierarchy of legal norms, as well as the speciality of the legal rule in question.662\n\n*See* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 926-927; *quoting* Monteza Second Report \u00b6 175.\n\n614.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore cannot accept Claimants' characterisation of the RER Contract as a \"partnership\" by which the parties were to collaborate to carry out mutual goals under the RER Law.663 As for the question of the allocation of risk and other arguments by the Parties in relation to this issue,664 the Tribunal does not find it helpful to make generalisations at this stage, and will consider the specific terms of the RER Contract and applicable law as relevant in the course of its analysis.\n\nReply \u00b6 675.\n\n*See, inter alia*, Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 402-407; Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 875-879.\n\n**B.

In their view, MINEM signed the contract only in its representative capacity, not in an individual capacity.667\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 685 *et seq*. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nReply \u00b6 686; *see* Qui\u00f1ones Second Report \u00b6 55.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 695-696; *quoting* Benavides Second Report \u00b6 116.\n\n617.\n\nIn Claimants' view, a three-step interpretation of the RER Contract in accordance with Articles 168, 169 and 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code leads to the conclusion that the entire Peruvian State, and not solely MINEM, has assumed the role of Grantor under the RER Contract.668\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 689-690.\n\n618.\n\nClaimants equate the principle of a unitary State with how States are treated under international law. In their view, \"the state must be imputed with acts and omissions of all government entities, including national, regional, and local entities.\"669\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1949:21-1950:2.\n\n619.\n\nClaimants also argue that it would be unfair and contrary to good faith to adopt an interpretation of the RER Contract which is inconsistent with Peru's contemporaneous interpretation of the RER Contract. Claimants rely, in this regard, on a report by MINEM in relation to a different RER project which refers to the indivisibility of the Peruvian State and the attribution of delays to \"the Administration, therefore, to the Grantor.\"670\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 699-700; *quoting* **C-212(2)**, Legal Report No. 026-2014-EM-DGE, 28 October 2014, pp. 6-7.\n\n620.\n\nFor Claimants, an interpretation pursuant to Article 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code confirms that: (i) the purpose of the RER Contract is to ensure that the concessionaire receives the Guaranteed Revenue, which guarantee can only be made by the State;671 and (ii) the general purpose of the RER Contract is to implement the RER Law, which is enacted by the State to further its goals.672\n\nReply \u00b6 710.\n\nReply \u00b6 711.\n\n621.\n\nRespondent submits that MINEM is the exclusive counterparty to the RER Contract, and did not assume obligations on behalf of all autonomous bodies of the Peruvian State at the national, regional or local level.673\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 882, 885, 892.\n\n622.\n\nRespondent contends that: (i) it is legally impossible for MINEM to assume obligations on behalf of other competent authorities under Peruvian law, which provides for decentralized and autonomous competencies;674 (ii) autonomous levels of government do not affect the principle of the unity of the State; and (iii) Claimants attempt to apply a theory of international law to the contractual sphere.675\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 883-888; *quoting, inter alia*, Monteza Report \u00b6 180; **RL-161**, *Ley No. 27783, Ley de Bases de la Descentralizaci\u00f3n*, 16 July 2002, Art. 10.2; **RL-055**, *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica del Per\u00fa*, 29 December 1993, Art. 188; **CM-039**, *Tribunal Constitucional (2005).

The execution, delivery and performance hereof by the Ministry fall within its powers, are consistent with the Applicable Laws and have been duly authorized by the Government Authority.\"689 Clause 2.2.2 confirms that the validly signed RER Contract \"represents a valid, binding and enforceable obligation for the Ministry.\"690\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 2.2.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 2.2.1.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 2.2.2.\n\n**(3). Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n634.\n\nHaving reviewed the provisions of the RER Contract and the Parties' positions on this issue, the Tribunal finds that Respondent i.e., the State of Peru, is a party to the RER Contract.\n\n635.\n\nThis is clearly expressed in the terms of the RER Contract, which provide that it is (i) \"made and entered into by and between the Peruvian State\" (*chapeau*, see \u00b6 625 above); and (ii) signed by MINEM \"on behalf of the Government\" (Clause 1.4.31, see \u00b6 629 above).\n\n636.\n\nThe fact that the State of Peru acts through MINEM in executing the RER Contract does not change the fact that the State of Peru is the counterparty.\n\n637.\n\nIt does not follow, however, that the Tribunal accepts Claimants' assertion that \"[i]f\u2026the State was the Grantor, then ***all*** government measures that adversely affected the Project\u2026must be imputed to the Grantor under the RER Contract.\"691\n\nReply \u00b6 686 (emphasis in original).\n\n638.\n\nThe State of Peru has agreed that MINEM shall \"act as Grantor\" (see Clause 2.2.1, \u00b6 633 above). The State of Peru has not agreed that every government authority of Peru has undertaken obligations under the RER Contract.\n\n639.\n\nIt is therefore important to refer to the terms of the RER Contract to determine precisely the agreement that has been reached, and the role or responsibility of any specific governmental authority. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent, in this respect, that the RER Contract clearly delineates the role of government authorities in general in Clause 1.4.2 (see \u00b6 627 above).\n\n640.\n\nLikewise, Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract specifically refers to MINEM's role to \"*coadyuvar*\" in certain circumstances as distinct from the role of other government authorities, i.e., where permits were \"not being timely granted by the relevant Government Authority\" (see \u00b6 654 below for the full provision).692\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 4.3.\n\n641.\n\nAuthorities other than MINEM may have specific obligations or duties under the RER Contract. For example, under Article 6.3.3 of the RER Contract, a settlement shall be prepared at the end of each \"Tariff Period\" for the total Premium, \"calculated according to the relevant Procedure as approved by the OSINERGMIN.\"693 The State of Peru has therefore agreed that OSINERGMIN shall undertake this role under the RER Contract.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 6.3.3.\n\n642.\n\nTo the extent that any doubt remains from such a literal interpretation, a systematic and functional interpretation confirms the same.\n\n643.\n\nArticle 1.18 of the RER Regulations confirms that MINEM signs the contract on behalf of the State (MINEM \"*en representaci\u00f3n del Estado firma el Contrato*\").694 This is consistent with Clause 1.4.31 of the RER Contract (see \u00b6 629 above).\n\n**MQ-005**, *Reglamento RER*, Art. 1.18\n\n644.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is consistent with Claimants' argument regarding the indivisibility of the Peruvian State (see \u00b6 616 above). This is a principle of Peruvian law, separate from the attribution of conduct to a State under international law. Being indivisible, the State of Peru as a whole is the counterparty to the RER Contract.\n\n645.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination is also consistent with Respondent's argument that the indivisibility of the Peruvian State must be taken into account together with the decentralisation of the Peruvian State. Under the Political Constitution of Peru, the authorities of the Peruvian State are independent and autonomous from one another.695 This is confirmed by other laws such as the *Ley Org\u00e1nica del Poder Ejecutivo (Ley No. 29158)*.696\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 885-891; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 946-950; R-PHB \u00b6 98. *See* **RL-055**, *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica del Per\u00fa*, 29 December 1993, Art. 188.\n\n**RL-162**, *Ley No. 29158*, 19 December 2007, Arts. 1, 6.\n\n646.\n\nAs explained by Respondent's experts Mr. Lava and Mr. Monteza, the separation of powers and decentralisation of the State is also confirmed by decisions of the Constitutional Tribunal of Peru, which has explicitly confirmed that \"*el Estado unitario es de car\u00e1cter descentralizado.*\"697 As such, a contract by which the State of Peru agrees upon obligations for MINEM or other specific government authorities does not automatically entail the responsibility of every Peruvian government authority under the contract for actions not specified in that contract.\n\nLava First Report \u00b6\u00b6 3.7-3.11; *quoting*, *inter alia*, **CLC-054**, *Tribunal Constitucional del Per\u00fa (2018).

The Tribunal therefore is not persuaded by Dr. Benavides' arguments in reliance on those aspects of Article 2 of the RER Law.700\n\n*See* Presentation of Dr. Benavides, Transcript (Day 4), 10 March 2022, 731:9-18.\n\n649.\n\nClaimants further argue that it is \"neither honest nor fair\" for Respondent to adopt an interpretation of the RER Contract that is \"completely contrary to how it interpreted the RER Contract during the relevant period.\"701 Aside from the fact that the MINEM report relied on by Claimants was issued in relation to a different RER project, such report must be read consistently with the decentralisation of the Peruvian State referred to at \u00b6\u00b6 644-646 above.\n\nReply \u00b6 699; *quoting* **C-212(2)**, Legal Report No. 026-2014-EM-DGE, 28 October 2014, pp. 6-7.\n\n650.\n\nThe fact that the Echecopar Reports relied on by Claimants arrived at a different conclusion is also not decisive, since these are legal opinions drafted by outside counsel and are not binding or a reflection of the parties' views.702\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 720; *quoting* **C-235**, First Legal Report by M.

The Tribunal rejects, however, Claimants' argument that this means that measures taken by every governmental authority implicate responsibility under the RER Contract. This view is premised on the public international law notion of attribution of conduct to a State. The obligations agreed by the State of Peru in the RER Contract, including the responsibility of any governmental authority for a specific role or task, are set out in its express terms. The terms of the RER Contract are therefore the reference to determine what has been agreed, and whether a governmental authority is in breach of the RER Contract by its acts or omissions.\n\n652.\n\nIn the following Sections, the Tribunal will turn to consider the alleged breaches of the RER Contract.\n\n**C.

In Claimants' view, the State of Peru remains ultimately responsible for this obligation, but it is delegated under the RER Contract to MINEM.703 Respondent denies that MINEM breached the RER Contract on this ground.704\n\nMemorial \u00b6 441.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 913.\n\n654.\n\nClause 4 of the RER Contract is entitled \"Construction of the Generation Plant\" and Clause 4.3 provides:705\n\nThe Ministry [i.e., MINEM] shall create any such easements as may be required in accordance with the Applicable Laws but shall not bear any costs incurred in obtaining them.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry shall, upon request of the Concessionaire Company, use its best endeavors in order to allow the latter to access third-party facilities, and shall assist it [\"*coadyuvar\u00e1*\"] in obtaining permits, licenses, authorizations, concessions, easements, rights of use, and any other similar right, in the event of these not being timely granted by the relevant Government Authority despite all requirements and procedures required under the Applicable Laws having been met.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 4.3.\n\n655.\n\nThere being no precise English term corresponding to the Spanish \"*coadyuvar\u00e1*\", the Tribunal will generally refer to the Spanish term in its reasoning.\n\n656.\n\nIn relation to Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract, Tribunal Question 3 asked:\n\nAssuming without deciding that the meaning of \"*coadyuvar\u00e1*\" is to assist or provide support:\n\n(i) Did Second Claimant make a request(s) for assistance under this provision;\n\n(ii) Is it Claimants' position that Respondent is in breach of this provision;

*see* Benavides First Report \u00b6 131; Lava First Report \u00b6 3.61.\n\n664.\n\nWhile they refer to the same definition, the Parties' experts draw opposing conclusions: for Dr. Benavides, the term \"*coadyuvar*\" means that the permit must be granted to fulfil the obligation.714 For Mr. Lava, on the other hand, \"*coadyuvar*\" requires MINEM to contribute and collaborate in obtaining the permits, but limited to actions within its sphere of control within the legal framework.715\n\nBenavides First Report \u00b6 13.\n\nLava First Report \u00b6 3.68.\n\n665.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the ordinary meaning of the term \"*coadyuvar*\" is not merely assistance, but assistance that is linked to an objective, in this case being to obtain the permit, license or similar. However, the Tribunal does not find support in this language for a conclusion that MINEM promised to ensure or guarantee that a permit, license or similar is granted by the competent authority in question.\n\n666.\n\nFurther, the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" can be distinguished from the language of the best efforts obligation (\"*mejores esfuerzos*\") in Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract in relation to access to third party facilities (see \u00b6 654 above). In the Tribunal's view, this does not necessarily reflect different degrees of assistance, but rather different types of assistance due to the nature of the processes in question. Unlike access to third party facilities (\"*instalaciones de terceros*\"), the process of obtaining permits, licenses, authorisations and similar necessarily requires the input of the applicant, i.e., Second Claimant. The term \"*coadyuvar\u00e1*\" implies joint efforts, i.e., a collaboration towards the goal in question between two parties, in this case Second Claimant and MINEM. Clause 4.3 confirms this by referring to \"all requirements and procedures required under the Applicable Laws having been met\" (\"*de haberse cumplido los requisitos y tr\u00e1mites exigidos por las Leyes Aplicables*\").716 Best efforts, on the other hand, refers to the conduct of one party (\"*el Ministerio har\u00e1 sus mejores esfuerzos*\").\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 4.3.\n\n667.\n\nFurther clarity is drawn from systematic and functional interpretations under Articles 169 and 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which read Clause 4.3 in the context of the RER Contract as a whole and in light of its nature and object (see \u00b6\u00b6 596-597 above).\n\n668.\n\nFirst, as the Tribunal has already determined at \u00b6 651 above, while the Peruvian State is the counterparty to the RER Contract, this does not mean that measures taken by every governmental authority implicate responsibility under the RER Contract. For the actions of any particular governmental authority, it will be necessary to verify whether such action constitutes a breach of the RER Contract by reference to the terms of the RER Contract.\n\n669.\n\nWhile Claimants submit that the unitarian rather than federal nature of the Peruvian State means that the State must be imputed with the acts and omissions of all government entities,717 the Tribunal does not agree. As the Tribunal has found above and as Respondent argues, the Peruvian State is also decentralised, with autonomy for regional and local governments which grant permits.718\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1949:19-1950:9. *See* Tribunal Question 16: \"Does the fact that Respondent is a unitarian State (Article 43 of the Peruvian Constitution) and not a federation (or Federal State) have any impact on how the Tribunal should examine the matter of permitting?\"\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2110:10-2112:7.\n\n670.\n\nIn this regard, Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract does not contain an obligation on MINEM to ensure that permits are successfully obtained. Consistent with the decentralised nature of the Peruvian State (see \u00b6\u00b6 645-646 above), the wording of Clause 4.3 itself refers to \"the relevant Government Authority\" from which a permit or authorisation is sought, confirming the separate role and competencies of MINEM and other agencies or authorities in the Peruvian State.719\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 4.3.\n\n671.\n\nClaimants' interpretation that the \"*coadyuvar\u00e1*\" obligation \"takes on a new meaning\" when the subject matter \"concerns a property right issued by a government authority\" is without merit.720 Likewise, it is not correct to speak of MINEM as relying on its \"own breaches\"721 when referring to actions undertaken by separate and independent parts of the Peruvian government.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 445.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 836.\n\n672.\n\nIn addition, Respondent correctly argues that it would be inconsistent with fundamental principles of Peruvian law for one government ministry to be obliged to intervene in, and guarantee the outcome of, a permitting process undertaken by another authority.722 Article 63.1 of the GLAP confirms the independence and autonomy of Peru's administrative authorities:723\n\n*Es nulo todo acto administrativo o contrato que contemple la renuncia a la titularidad, o la abstenci\u00f3n del ejercicio de las atribuciones conferidas a alg\u00fan \u00f3rgano administrativo.*\n\n*See* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1050-1052.\n\n**MQ-002**, *Ley No. 27444, Ley del Procedimiento Administrativo General*, 1 October 2008, Art. 63.1.\n\n673.\n\nThis principle of independence is also protected by way of sanctions under criminal law. Likewise, the Peruvian *Tribunal Constitucional* has confirmed the independence of the judiciary vis-\u00e0-vis other public authorities including the executive and legislative branches of government.724 Article 139 of the Political Constitution of Peru provides, in this respect:725\n\n*\u2026La independencia en el ejercicio de la funci\u00f3n jurisdiccional. Ninguna autoridad puede avocarse a causas pendientes ante el \u00f3rgano jurisdiccional ni interferir en el ejercicio de sus funciones.*\n\n**RL-039**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 635, C\u00f3digo Penal*, 3 April 1991, (\"*C\u00f3digo Penal*\"), Art. 410; **R-165**, *Sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional, Exp. No. 0023-2003-AI/TC*, 9 June 2004, \u00b6 29; **R-166**, *Sentencia del Pleno Jurisdiccional del Tribunal Constitucional, Exp. 0004-2006-PI/TC*, 29 March 2006, \u00b6 18.\n\n**RL-055**, *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica del Per\u00fa*, 29 December 1993, Art. 139.\n\n674.\n\nClaimants' response to this point is that MINEM did not have to force other government authorities to do anything, but rather to \"work with [Second Claimant] to help secure the permits that were unduly delayed or subject to challenge.\"726 This aligns precisely with the Tribunal's interpretation of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract, in the sense that the clause obliges MINEM to work with Second Claimant to help it to secure relevant permits. However, the obligation necessarily falls short of ensuring an outcome, based on the wording of the clause.\n\nReply \u00b6 839.\n\n675.\n\nIn further confirmation of the above interpretation, the express wording of several other provisions of the RER Contract explicitly assign the responsibility for obtaining permits to the concessionaire. Read together with these clauses, the obligation on MINEM to \"*coadyuvar*\" can only be to provide assistance in pursuit of those permits, without guaranteeing that the joint efforts will be successful. In this regard, Clause 1.3 of the RER Contract refers to:727\n\nthe Concessionaire Company's obligation to request, sign and comply with the requirements for the Final Concession of the Power Plant to be obtained by the Concessionaire Company from the Ministry.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.3.\n\n676.\n\nClause 3.2 of the RER Contract further states that \"[t]he Concessionaire Company shall manage and comply with all the requirements in furtherance of obtaining the Final Concession\u2026\"728 The *Bases Consolidadas* (which form a part of the agreement) further confirm this.729\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 3.2.\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Clause 1.4.1: \"\u2026*Cada Adjudicatario debe obtener la Concesi\u00f3n Definitiva cumpliendo las disposiciones establecidas en la LCE* [Ley de Concesiones El\u00e9ctricas] *y el RLCE* [Reglamento de la Ley de Concesiones El\u00e9ctricas], *en caso que no tuviera dicha Concesi\u00f3n Definitiva\u2026En ese sentido, es de su exclusiva responsabilidad el contar con los t\u00edtulos que los habiliten legalmente para la instalaci\u00f3n de la central de generaci\u00f3n RER en el \u00e1rea de terreno que se\u00f1alen para tal fin*\u2026\"\n\n677.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects Claimants' argument that the purpose of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract was to ensure that the Project had all its permits so that the Project could advance to completion.730 While Clause 4.3 provides a mechanism for the Parties to collaborate in specific circumstances to support the permitting process, it was by no means a guarantee that such permits would be granted, or that they would be insulated from requirements or proceedings under applicable law.\n\nReply \u00b6 835.\n\n678.\n\nFor good order, the Tribunal notes that it is not assisted by the example cited by Claimants of MINEM's coordination role which led to a positive result for an issue that arose with OSINERGMIN in relation to the Performance Bond.731 Claimants did not assert that this request was made pursuant to Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract, and did not submit the content of this request to the record. Naturally, none of the Tribunal's findings prevent MINEM from providing assistance to Second Claimant when it makes a request to MINEM that is consistent with Peruvian law but falls outside Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract.\n\nReply \u00b6 841.\n\n679.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds Mr. Lava's interpretation of \"*coadyuvar*\" to be more accurate, requiring MINEM to contribute and collaborate in obtaining the permits, limited to actions within its sphere of control within the legal framework.732\n\nLava First Report \u00b6 3.68.\n\n**(2) Requirements to Activate Clause 4.3**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n680.\n\nThe language of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract refers to three elements necessary to activate the \"*coadyuvar*\" obligation upon MINEM, or circumstances in which that obligation applies. These are: (i) upon request of the Concessionaire Company (\"*de ser requerido por la Sociedad Concesionaria*\"); (ii) in case the permit, license, authorisation or similar was \"not being timely granted by the relevant Government Authority\" (\"*en caso \u00e9stos no fueran otorgados por la Autoridad Gubernamental competente en el tiempo debido*\"); and (iii) the delay in granting it is \"despite all requirements and procedures required under the Applicable Laws having been met\" (\"*a pesar de haberse cumplido los requisitos y tr\u00e1mites exigidos por las Leyes Aplicables*\").733 These requirements are cumulative, in that all three must be satisfied for the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" to be activated.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 4.3.\n\n681.\n\nThe Parties agree on criteria (ii) and (iii) in \u00b6 680 above734 but disagree on the meaning of the first criterion (i), i.e., whether Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract requires an explicit request by the Concessionaire Company invoking the \"*coadyuvar*\" obligation.735\n\nReply \u00b6 831; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 916.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 916; Reply \u00b6 837; Rejoinder \u00b6 1036; R-PHB \u00b6 89.\n\n682.\n\nAccording to Claimants, \"there is no formal notice requirement under Clause 4.3.\" As a result of MINEM's role as representative of Peru, Claimants contend that MINEM was in charge of supervising the RER Contract and ensuring the timely progress of the Project. Claimants argue, on this basis, that MINEM had a *sua sponte* obligation under Clause 4.3 to work with Second Claimant in securing the Project's permits.736\n\nReply \u00b6 837.\n\n683.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no support for Claimants' view in the wording of Clause 4.3, nor in a systematic or functional interpretation of that clause. The wording \"upon request of the Concessionaire Company\" (\"*de ser requerido por la Sociedad Concesionaria*\") necessarily involves an action by the Concessionaire Company to request or require the assistance of MINEM. Claimants' interpretation does not take account of this language and leaves it without meaning.\n\n684.\n\nThe Tribunal further is not persuaded by Claimants' argument based on the punctuation of the clause, i.e., that the wording \"upon request of the Concessionaire Company\" only relates to MINEM's obligation to \"use its best endeavors in order to allow the latter to access third-party facilities,\" due to the comma in that sentence separating the two obligations (see \u00b6 654 above).737 On the Tribunal's reading, the requirement to make a request applies to both obligations in that clause.\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1948:18-1949:5.\n\n685.\n\nClaimants' view further appears based on the premise, already rejected by the Tribunal (see \u00b6 651 above), that authorities and instrumentalities of the Peruvian State generally have direct obligations under the RER Contract.738 Any such obligations must have a basis in the terms of the RER Contract.\n\nReply \u00b6 837; *quoting* Qui\u00f1ones Second Report \u00b6 169.\n\n686.\n\nClaimants rely on the opinion of Dr. Qui\u00f1ones that government authorities have the legal duty to initiate procedures under their responsibility, without waiting for a delay to be brought to their attention.739 As Respondent argues, this is essentially an argument based on administrative law rather than the RER Contract.740 It mixes matters between: (i) the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" triggered by a permit or similar which is delayed in being issued; and (ii) Peruvian administrative law obligations regarding the timely issuance of permits and other authorisations.741 In addition, the opinion of Dr. Qui\u00f1ones cited by Claimants is expressly stated to be independent of the \"*coadyuvar*\" obligation (\"*[i]ndependientemente del deber de coadyuvar*\") and it is therefore unclear what guidance it offers on the interpretation of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract.\n\nQui\u00f1ones Second Report \u00b6 169.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1045.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1047.\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Clause 4.3 does not set any specific requirements with respect to the format or means by which the Concessionaire Company should bring a matter requiring assistance to MINEM's attention. The Tribunal considers it sufficient that the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" is invoked by explicit reference to Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract.\n\n688.\n\nTherefore, while MINEM was required to collaborate with Second Claimant for the purpose of supporting it to obtain necessary permits, this obligation did not arise \"*sua sponte*\" in the absence of a request by Second Claimant. Contrary to Claimants' understanding, and as set out above (see \u00b6\u00b6 675-676 above), several provisions of the RER Contract make clear that Second Claimant was responsible for securing the permits, and the \"*coadyuvar*\" obligation is to be understood in this context.\n\n**(3) Alleged Breaches of Clause 4.3**\n--------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent failed to fulfil its obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" in the following ways:742\n\n(i) By the RGA's commencement of the RGA Lawsuit, which had the purpose of obstructing, not aiding development of, the Project.743\n\n(ii) When MINEM failed to immediately provide assistance to Second Claimant to dismiss the RGA Lawsuit, in spite of Second Claimant's correspondences to MINEM invoking Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract dated 28 March 2017, 21 April 2017, 26 April 2017, 17 July 2017.744\n\n(iii) When MINEM failed to provide assistance to Second Claimant after the AEP commenced a criminal investigation into how Second Claimant obtained the Project's environmental permits (\"**Criminal Investigation**\"), as a result of which Second Claimant's legal counsel is facing criminal charges and a potential three-year prison term for signing a permit-related application for reconsideration on behalf of Second Claimant (the \"**Criminal Proceedings**\").745\n\n(iv) When MINEM failed to provide assistance to Second Claimant's efforts to obtain the Project's CWA. According to Claimants, Second Claimant applied to the AAA for this permit in November 2016, and a determination should have been issued by January 2017. However, the AAA did not issue a valid permit until January 2018. Claimants submit that this caused an unjustified year of delay to the Project, caused by the AAA's arbitrary and unlawful rejection of the permit application in May 2017. This was followed, Claimants argue, by a materially defective permit in July 2017, which the AAA refused to fix until an ANA administrative court ordered it to be reissued in December 2017. While Second Claimant had complied with applicable laws, Claimants argue that the AAA failed in its administrative duty to issue the CWA in a timely manner, and MINEM gave no assistance to Second Claimant.746\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 832.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 451.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 452.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 453.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 454.\n\n690.\n\nRespondent opposes each of these claims on the basis, *inter alia*, that they do not fulfil the requirements or fall under the scope of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract.747\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 938-954; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1048-1062.\n\n691.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider the first two alleged breaches together, followed by the third and fourth breaches separately.\n\n***a. The RGA Lawsuit***\n------------------------\n\n692.\n\nClaimants requested MINEM's assistance in respect of the RGA Lawsuit and invoked Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract in their letters of 28 March 2017, 26 April 2017 and 17 July 2017.748 While Claimants also refer to a letter of 21 April 2017,749 no mention of Clause 4.3 is found in the text of that letter.750 In addition, it appears that the invocation of Clause 4.3 in the letter of 28 March 2017 was primarily made in relation to a separate issue that is not the subject of Claimants' present allegation.751 On the other hand, and contrary to Respondent's assertion,752 the letter of 17 July 2017 does make reference to Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract, even if it does so among other requests and in addition to invoking other legal provisions. Based on the letters of 26 April and 17 July 2017, the Tribunal finds that a request for MINEM to \"*coadyuvar*\" under Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract was made in relation to the RGA Lawsuit.\n\n**C-091**, Letter from C.H. Mamacocha to Ministry of Energy and Mines, 28 March 2017, p. 1; **C-139,** *Carta de CH Mamacocha (C. Diez) al MINEM (G.

V\u00e1squez)*, 17 July 2017, p. 7.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 452; Reply \u00b6 835.\n\n**C-215**, CH Mamacocha S.R.L. Request for Suspension, 21 April 2017.\n\n**C-091**, Letter from C.H. Mamacocha to Ministry of Energy and Mines, 28 March 2017, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1044.\n\n693.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Second Claimant requested assistance not in relation to a delayed permit, but rather asked for MINEM to use its good offices before the Governor of Arequipa and the RGA Council to \"*obtener la revocatoria inmediata de la Resoluci\u00f3n N\u00b0 033-2016-GRA/ ARMA*\" issued by ARMA dated 12 December 2016*,* which had declared that Claimants' environmental permits suffered from nullity and had referred the matter to the RGA Prosecutor (see \u00b6 128 above).753 The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that this does not fall within the scope of the \"*coadyuvar*\" obligation.754 Among other things, it does not satisfy the second criterion to activate Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract as set out at \u00b6 680 above.\n\n*See* **C-139**, *Carta de CH Mamacocha (C. Diez) al MINEM (G. Tamayo)*, 26 April 2017, p. 1; **C-142**/**MQ- 020**, *Carta de CH Mamacocha al MINEM (A. V\u00e1squez)*, 17 July 2017.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 940-941.\n\n694.\n\nIn this regard, Clause 4.3 does not and cannot prevent or preclude competent authorities from commencing administrative or judicial legal proceedings provided for under Peruvian law. Nor does it require MINEM to ensure the revocation of a resolution or dismissal of such a lawsuit, which would be contrary to the separation of powers (see \u00b6 646 above). Claimants see MINEM as the protector of the permits, which must rebuff any challenges and ensure that their validity is maintained. Claimants allege, in this respect, that MINEM \"failed to\u2026*coadyuvar* [Second Claimant] in defending these permits from unreasonable government interferences.\"755 However, this does not accord with the meaning of \"*coadyuvar*\" in the RER Contract determined above (see \u00b6\u00b6 665 to 677 above).\n\nReply \u00b6 832.\n\n695.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects this basis for a claim that MINEM breached Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract.\n\n696.\n\nThis determination is consistent with what MINEM advised to Second Claimant at the time. On 13 July 2017, MINEM indicated to Second Claimant:756\n\n\u2026*la responsabilidad del Estado a trav\u00e9s del [MINEM], se limita a coadyuvar; no existiendo renuncia u obligaci\u00f3n de no ejercer el derecho de acci\u00f3n en el marco de un proceso contencioso administrativo, que tenga por objeto solicitar al Poder Judicial la nulidad de una actuaci\u00f3n administrativa (agotado el plazo para poder declarar la nulidad en sede administrativa, a trav\u00e9s de la autotutela declarativa).*\n\n*...*\n\n*[MINEM] carece de competencias para evaluar la legalidad y oportunidad (en los t\u00e9rminos de la solicitud) de la actuaci\u00f3n del Gobierno Regional de Arequipa (aut\u00f3nomo respecto al Gobierno Nacional, seg\u00fan la legislaci\u00f3n vigente), ni del Poder Judicial (constitucionalmente aut\u00f3nomo).*\n\n**MQ-019**, *Oficio No. 121-2017-MEM/VME del MINEM a HLA*, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 122- 2017-MEM/DGE*, 28 July 2017, pp. 6, 7.\n\n697.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Tribunal need not address Respondent's additional argument that no obligation arose in respect of the RGA Lawsuit because the Amparo Judgment had annulled the permits in question *ab initio*.757\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1053.\n\n***b. Criminal Investigation***\n-------------------------------\n\n698.\n\nSecond Claimant's allegation under this head relates to the Criminal Investigation initiated by the AEP in March 2017 into ARMA officials who were involved in the reclassification and approval of Second Claimant's environmental permits, to investigate whether the officials committed the crime of \"illegal granting of rights\" under Article 314 of the Penal Code, to the detriment of the environment and the State and the benefit of Second Claimant (see \u00b6 149 above).758\n\n**C-188**, *Disposici\u00f3n Fiscal No. 01-2017-0-FPEMA-MP, Fiscal\u00eda Ambiental de Arequipa*, 24 March 2017. *See* Memorial \u00b6 105; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 219.\n\n699.\n\nUnlike the RGA Lawsuit, Second Claimant cites no specific request to MINEM under Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract in respect of the Criminal Investigation. To the extent that Claimants submit that the requests made in relation to the RGA Lawsuit also cover what they refer to as \"the related criminal proceeding,\"759 the Tribunal finds no reference to the Criminal Proceedings in the letters of 26 April and 17 July 2017 and is not persuaded that those requests related to this matter of the Criminal Investigation.760\n\nReply \u00b6 835.\n\n**C-139,** *Carta de CH Mamacocha (C. Diez) al MINEM (G. Tamayo)*, 26 April 2017, pp. 1, 15, 17; **C-142** /**MQ-020**, *Carta de CH Mamacocha al MINEM (A. V\u00e1squez)*, 17 July 2017, p. 7.\n\n700.\n\nIn fact, it is unclear precisely what \"assistance\" Claimants argue that MINEM should have provided in relation to the Criminal Investigation. Claimants merely submit that \"MINEM has never provided any assistance with this matter.\"761 What kind of assistance would have been open to MINEM, while respecting Peruvian law and the separation of powers, has not been established by Claimants.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 453.\n\n701.\n\nAs the Tribunal found in relation to the RGA Lawsuit, this alleged breach of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract also does not concern the delayed issuance of a permit or authorisation. It rather relates to separate legal proceedings brought in relation to the circumstances in which Second Claimant's environmental permit was granted. It therefore does not fulfil the criteria needed to activate Clause 4.3 mentioned at \u00b6 680 above. Claimants' assertion that the Criminal Investigation \"unfairly and baselessly questioned the legality of the Project's environmental permits\"762 is inapposite in light of the Tribunal's findings at \u00b6\u00b6 662-679 above on the meaning and scope of the \"*coadyuvar*\" obligation.\n\nReply \u00b6 832.\n\n***c. Civil Works Authorisation***\n----------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nThis item concerns an alleged failure by MINEM to \"*coadyuvar*\" in relation to the issuance of the CWA. Second Claimant's application for a CWA was subject to delays, including an initial denial by the AAA, and a subsequently defective issuance that required correction as set out at \u00b6\u00b6 151 to 158 above.\n\n703.\n\nIn respect of the delay in obtaining the CWA, Claimants have not asserted that they made a request to MINEM to \"*coadyuvar*\" under Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract. The notice requirement to activate Clause 4.3 is therefore not satisfied. As found above, the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" is not a *sua sponte* one upon MINEM, but is activated only upon request by Second Claimant.\n\n704.\n\nThere being no request, MINEM cannot have failed in its duty to \"*coadyuvar*.\" It is important to note, in this respect, that a delay in issuing the CWA by the AAA is not a breach of Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract. The alleged breach must relate to MINEM's failure to act to assist Second Claimant when requested. The Tribunal therefore rejects Second Claimant's argument under this item.\n\n**(4) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n705.\n\nBased on the Tribunal's determinations in relation to each of the arguments made under Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract, the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's claim for a breach of this clause. As noted above, several of its arguments under this claim are based on an incorrect understanding of the scope of the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" or the role of MINEM as counterparty to the RER Contract.\n\n**D. A lleged B reaches regarding the R ejection of the T hird E xtension R equest**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nBy letter dated 1 February 2018, Second Claimant requested an extension under the RER Contract of the Actual COS date (to 28 February 2021) and the termination date (to 31 December 2041) (\"**Third Extension Request**\").763 The Third Extension Request referred to delays in granting permits and delays resulting from Addenda 1 to 4, which in its view caused reduction of the term of validity of the Award Tariff. Second Claimant requested a modification of the Works Execution Schedule and the date of termination of the contract in recognition of the 1480 calendar days of delay, which it argued were not caused by Second Claimant.764\n\n**C-127**, Letter from CH Mamacocha to A. Grossheim, Minister of Energy and Mines regarding third extension request, 1 February 2018. *See* Memorial \u00b6 142; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 268.\n\n**C-127**, Letter from CH Mamacocha to A.

Carlos) a Mamacocha (C. Diez)*, 31 December 2018, attaching *Informe No. 511-2018-MEM/DGE*, 31 December 2018.\n\n708.\n\nThe Tribunal takes into account the Parties' respective answers to this question in reaching its conclusions.766\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1947:14-1948:10; Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2117:11-19.\n\n709.\n\nSecond Claimant argues that by rejecting its Third Extension Request (see \u00b6 217 above), Respondent has breached the RER Contract. According to Claimants, this denial \"effectively ended the Mamacocha Project.\"767 It is therefore a key issue to be decided by the Tribunal in the Parties' dispute.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 440.\n\n710.\n\nIn order to focus on the matters necessary to reach its decision on this issue, the Tribunal will address the following: (i) whether the RER Contract contains a duty to confer on Second Claimant the economic benefits of a 20-year Guaranteed Revenue Concession; (ii) whether Second Claimant was entitled to an extension under the RER Contract; and (iii) the alleged breach of Addenda 3 to 6.\n\n**(1) Guaranteed Revenue under the RER Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n711.\n\nClaimants argue that \"the chief incentive in the RER Contract\" is its guarantee of \"a fixed price per megawatt hour, for a fixed amount of megawatt hours per year, over a 20-year period\" (\"**Guaranteed Revenue**\").768 Claimants cite, as the source of this obligation, Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37, and 6.3 of the RER Contract.769 In their requests for relief, Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37 and 6.3 are among those for which Claimants seek a declaration that Peru \"has breached its obligations under the RER Contract\" (see \u00b6 236 above).\n\nMemorial \u00b6 31.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 31, fn 30.\n\n712.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal will examine Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37 and 6.3 of the RER Contract to determine the existence and scope of the alleged obligation to provide Guaranteed Revenue.\n\n713.\n\nClause 1.4.26 of the RER Contract defines Guaranteed Revenue as follows:770\n\n**Guaranteed Revenue** means the annual revenue that the Concessionaire Company shall receive for the net injections of energy up to the limit of the Awarded Energy paid at the Award Tariff. It will only apply during the Term of Validity. (emphasis in original)\n\nMemorial \u00b6 412; *quoting* **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.26.\n\n714.\n\nClause 1.4.37 defines the \"Term of Validity of the Award Tariff\" as follows:771\n\n**Term of Validity of the Award Tariff (Term of Validity)** means the period between the Actual Date of Commercial Operation Start-up and the Termination Date of the Contract (December 31, 2036). During the Term of Validity, the Concessionaire Company undertakes to supply electricity to the system using RER technology, and is guaranteed the payment of the Award Tariff for the Net Energy Injections produced by its RER generation plant, up to the limit of the corresponding Awarded Energy.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.37.\n\n715.\n\nClause 6.3 of the RER Contract is entitled \"Billing Procedure and Payment for Supply\":772\n\n6.3.1 The Concessionaire Company shall receive, on a monthly basis, payments on account of Guaranteed Revenues for the energy and power injected into the SEIN.\n\n6.3.2 Injected energy shall be appraised at the Short-Term Marginal Cost, following the same procedures applicable to any other generator in the SEIN. Capacity payments shall be made according to the Firm Capacity, determined pursuant to the COES Procedures.\n\n6.3.3 At the end of each Tariff Period, a settlement shall be prepared for the total amount of the Premium, calculated according to the relevant Procedure as approved by the OSINERGMIN.\n\n6.3.4 The Premium so calculated at the end of the Tariff Period shall result in a debit or credit charge for the Concessionaire Company, as appropriate, which shall be cancelled in monthly installments over the twelve (12) months immediately following the annual settlement period, at the applicable monthly interest rate equal to the annual update rate set forth in Article 79 of the LCE.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 6.3.\n\n716.\n\nThe Actual Date of Commercial Operation Start-up (\"**Actual COS**\") is defined in Clause 1.4.23:773\n\n\"**Actual Date of Commercial Operation Start-up**\" means the actual date of Operation Start-up of each power plant, certified by the COES according to its Procedures, which may not be more than two (02) years after the Reference Date of Commercial Operation Start-up; otherwise, the Contract shall be automatically terminated and the Performance Bond shall be executed.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.23. *See also* Clause 1.4.40: \"**Commercial Operation Start-up**\" means the Actual Date of Commercial Operation Start-up of each plant, certified by the COES according to its procedures.\" (emphasis in original).\n\n717.\n\nThe Reference Date of Commercial Operation Start-up (\"**Reference COS**\") is indicated in Clause 1.4.24 as:774\n\n\u2026December 31, 2016, that is, the date established in Section 1(1), paragraph 3, of the Tender Requirements. The Termination Date of the Contract shall be twenty (20) years after this date.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.24.\n\n718.\n\nClause 1.4.22 defines the \"Termination Date of the Contract\" (\"**Termination Date**\") as follows:\n\n\"**Termination Date of the Contract**\" means December 31, 2036, a date that cannot be modified for any reason whatsoever and until which the Concessionaire is guaranteed the Award Tariff.\n\n719.\n\nBased on a literal interpretation of the above contractual provisions, the Tribunal finds that Second Claimant was entitled to the Guaranteed Revenue as calculated in accordance with Clause 6.3 of the RER Contract for the period between the Actual COS and the Termination Date of 31 December 2036. Evidently, and as stated by Claimants themselves, the Guaranteed Revenue is contingent on Second Claimant supplying electricity to the grid.775\n\nMemorial \u00b6 31. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 413.\n\n720.\n\nIt follows from the above provisions that if the Actual COS (date of certified entry into commercial operation) is the same as the Reference COS (31 December 2016), the period during which Second Claimant will receive the Guaranteed Revenue is 20 years.\n\n721.\n\nAs Claimants acknowledge, this 20-year period would not apply in the event that the Actual COS fell later than the Reference COS.776 In this regard, there was a two year \"cushion\" period between the Reference COS and the Actual COS, in which the Actual COS could validly take place under Clause 1.4.23 (see \u00b6 716 above). In that scenario, Second Claimant would receive the Guaranteed Revenue from the date of the Actual COS until 31 December 2036, the end of the Term of Validity of the Award Tariff.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 416.\n\n722.\n\nTwo years after the Reference COS, the cushion period expires and Clause 1.4.23 states that the RER Contract \"shall be automatically terminated.\" The Tribunal will give further consideration to this at \u00b6 741 and in its further reasoning below.\n\n723.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the wording of the RER Contract to provide a clear basis for its literal interpretation of the above clauses, and does not find it necessary to carry out a further systematic or functional interpretation of the above terms for present purposes.\n\n724.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, any \"duty\" to confer on Second Claimant the economic benefits of 20 years of Guaranteed Revenue would be conditioned on: (i) Second Claimant supplying the requisite electricity to the grid; and (ii) the Actual COS taking place on 31 December 2016. The RER Contract did not guarantee that the Award Tariff would be received for a 20 year period, and explicitly contemplated an 18 year period in the event that Actual COS took place two years after Reference COS. The Tribunal therefore agrees with Respondent that the right to earn the Guaranteed Revenue for 20 years was not an absolute one.777\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 993, 995.\n\n725.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the premise of Claimants' argument that the Third Extension Request asked MINEM \"to extend the COS deadline and Termination Date in a manner that restored the 20-year term of validity that Peru had guaranteed.\"778 The RER Contract contained no guaranteed 20-year term of validity in respect of the Guaranteed Revenue.\n\nReply \u00b6 775.\n\n726.\n\nIn this regard, and leaving aside the question of whether they would apply to the interpretation of the RER Contract at all after taking into account Article IX of the Civil Code (see \u00b6 583 above), the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's arguments that a number of provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code imply that it \"cannot be deprived of its contractual benefits\" and that Peru cannot be \"relieved of its obligation to pay Guaranteed Revenue.\"779 The Tribunal rejects these arguments on the basis of its finding that there is no right to receive Guaranteed Income for a 20-year period.\n\nReply \u00b6 776.\n\n**(2) Whether Second Claimant Was Entitled to an Extension**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal will consider whether Second Claimant was entitled to an extension pursuant to the Third Extension Request under the RER Contract.\n\n728.\n\nSecond Claimant's argument that the obligation to provide the Guaranteed Revenue does arise in this case is premised on its view that: (i) the Actual COS and the Termination Date of the Contract could be moved, and that (ii) Respondent was obliged to move them by granting the Third Extension Request, because it was responsible for the delays to the Project.780\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 421, 433, 438; Reply \u00b6 780.\n\n729.\n\nIn order to decide upon these arguments, the Tribunal will first consider whether the RER Contract permitted or required an extension for delays caused by MINEM or other Peruvian government authorities (Section (a) below). It will then consider the findings of other arbitral tribunals on this issue (Section (b) below), before concluding (Section (c) below).\n\n***a. Whether the RER Contract Permitted or Required an Extension for Delays Caused by Respondent***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n730.\n\nSecond Claimant does not argue that it had an express entitlement to an extension of the Actual COS and the Termination Date in the RER Contract. Its argument is rather that:781\n\nPeru had an obligation to grant these extension requests under the RER Contract because, by Peru's own public admissions, each of the delays to the Mamacocha Project was solely attributable to Peru, and [Second Claimant] at all times acted diligently.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 433.\n\n731.\n\nWith respect to the Termination Date, Second Claimant further argues that:782\n\n\u2026Peru had an obligation under the RER Contract to grant corresponding extensions to the Termination Date in order to preserve the 20-year Term of Validity of the Guaranteed Revenue Concession. Or, alternatively, Peru had an obligation to compensate [Second Claimant] for the time that Peru unjustifiably took away from the Guaranteed Revenue Concession\u2026\n\nMemorial \u00b6 438.\n\n732.\n\nIn effect, Second Claimant argues that MINEM was obliged to amend the RER Contract so as to accommodate its Third Extension Request.\n\n733.\n\nIn addition to Clauses 1.4.22, 1.4.23 and 1.4.24 which are relevant to this point (see \u00b6\u00b6 716-718 above), Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract is entitled \"Commercial Operation Start-up after December 31, 2018\" and provides:783\n\nIf, for any reason, Commercial Operation Start-up of the RER Generation Project provided for hereunder has not taken place by December 31, 2018, this Contract shall be automatically terminated, and the Performance Bond shall be enforced.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 8.4.\n\n734.\n\nA particular disagreement between the Parties stems from whether \"for any reason\" (\"*por cualquier motivo*\") in Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract includes an acceptance by Second Claimant of its responsibility for potential delays to the Actual COS, even if the delays are not attributable to it and are attributable to the Peruvian government administration.784 This was the subject of Tribunal Question 2 to the Parties.785 A related dispute is whether Clause 8.4 operates as a *condici\u00f3n resolutoria*, which would terminate the contract automatically upon fulfilment of the condition therein.786\n\nMemorial \u00b6 421; *citing* **C-009**, Addendum 2 to the RER Contract, 3 January 2017; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 893.\n\nTribunal Question 2: \"In agreeing to Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract (termination as of right in the event that 'Commercial Operation Start-up\u2026has not been completed for any reason whatsoever\u2026'), did Second Claimant assume responsibility for potential delays to Commercial Operation Start-up for which Second Claimant is not responsible?\" *See* Claimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1939:3-1940:6;

(ii) the clause does not explicitly state that Second Claimant accepts such responsibility, which would be required for it to have such effect; (iii) other arbitral awards agree with Claimants' position; (iv) Clause 7.1 of the RER Contract on responsibility reflects the principle that a party cannot be held responsible where its failure to perform was caused by another party; (v) any provision where one party tries to punish another for its own breaches is contrary to the Peruvian Constitution and other applicable laws such as Article 1328 of the Civil Code; and (vi) such a reading would violate the RER's express mandate to create a legal framework that promoted and encouraged investments, as advised in the Echecopar Report.787\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1939:9-1942:7; Memorial \u00b6 421; Reply \u00b6 780.\n\n736.\n\nRespondent submits that pursuant to the RER Regulations, the *Bases Consolidadas* and the RER Contract, the Termination Date, the Reference COS and the Actual COS are interconnected and immovable, so it was proscribed from granting the Third Extension Request.788 Respondent further contends that the RER Regulations set out the direct and automatic consequence of not meeting the Actual COS, being automatic termination of the RER Contract and execution of the Performance Bond.789 By agreeing to Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract (see \u00b6 733 above), Respondent argues that Second Claimant had already accepted that the agreement would be terminated if the Actual COS did not take place by 31 December 2018, regardless of whether the reason for a delay was attributable to Second Claimant, or to Peruvian State agencies.790\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 424, 428;

(ii) refer to a systematic and functional interpretation; (iii) address a good faith interpretation; (iv) consider amendment of the RER Contract or RER Regulations; (v) comment upon the Echecopar Reports; and (vi) consider Addenda 1 and 2.\n\n*(i) Literal Interpretation*\n----------------------------\n\n739.\n\nThe Tribunal makes its literal reading of the plain language of Clauses 1.4.22, 1.4.23, 1.4.24 and 8.4 in the following paragraphs, in accordance with Article 168 of the Peruvian Civil Code. In light of the Parties' strongly diverging interpretations, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to also carry out a systematic and functional interpretation of these provisions under Articles 169 and 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code in addition to a literal one (see \u00b6\u00b6 596-598 above).\n\n740.\n\n*Clause 1.4.22* (see \u00b6 718 above). A literal reading of this Clause is that the Termination Date of 31 December 2036 cannot be modified \"for any reason whatsoever.\" The ordinary meaning of \"any reason whatsoever\" is absolute, expansive and without exclusion.\n\n741.\n\n*Clause 1.4.23* (see \u00b6 716 above). The plain wording of this Clause refers to the Contract being \"automatically terminated\" (\"*autom\u00e1ticamente resuelto*\") in the event that the Actual COS exceeds the Reference COS by more than two years. The ordinary meaning of automatic termination is that it will happen upon occurrence of the event specified in the clause, without further action or exercise of discretion by a contractual party.\n\n742.\n\n*Clause 1.4.24* (see \u00b6 717 above). This clause defines the Reference COS as 31 December 2016, which is set based on a 20-year period until the Termination Date.\n\n743.\n\n*Clause 8.4* (see \u00b6 733 above). This clause provides that if the Actual COS is not reached by 31 December 2018 \"for any reason\", the RER Contract will be \"automatically terminated.\" The words \"for any reason\" are all-encompassing and do not refer to any exception. The words \"shall be automatically terminated\" (\"*quedar\u00e1 resuelto de pleno derecho*\") indicate an automatic termination of the RER Contract in the circumstance that the Actual COS is not achieved by 31 December 2018. Based on the clear wording of this clause, the Tribunal determines it to be a condition subsequent (\"*condici\u00f3n resolutoria*\"), i.e., an automatic termination that operates without discretion, independently of the diligence or lack of fault of Second Claimant. While Claimants argue that there is no explicit statement that Second Claimant accepts responsibility for delays which are not attributable to it, the Tribunal draws that understanding from the words already included in the clause.\n\n744.\n\nHaving reviewed the language of Clauses 1.4.22, 1.4.23, 1.4.24 and 8.4 both separately and in combination (i.e., systematically pursuant to Article 169 of the Peruvian Civil Code), the Tribunal finds that the framework of the RER Contract agreed between Second Claimant and MINEM provides for an interdependence between the Reference COS, the Actual COS and the Termination Date of the Contract, as Respondent argues.793\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 428.\n\n745.\n\nThis framework foresees some level of flexibility for the Actual COS, which may take place up to two years from the Reference COS. Tied to that, on the other hand, are \"hard stops\" for: (i) the Actual COS at 31 December 2018; and (ii) the Termination Date of the Contract at 31 December 2036. Clauses 1.4.23 and 8.4 of the RER Contract consistently refer to the hard stop for the Actual COS in strong and broad language. This strong language is matched in Clause 1.4.22, which forestalls any modification of the Termination Date of the Contract.\n\n746.\n\nIn addition, the *Bases Consolidadas* form part of the RER Contract.794 Clause 1.1 of the *Bases Consolidadas* sets out that:795\n\n*Las Bases, y las Leyes Aplicables tal como \u00e9stas son definidas m\u00e1s adelante, regir\u00e1n la Subasta y el Contrato. Se presumir\u00e1, sin admitirse prueba en contrario, que toda Persona que, de manera directa o indirecta participe en la Subasta, conoce las Leyes Aplicables y los usos y costumbres del mercado peruano. No son de aplicaci\u00f3n a la Subasta ni al Contrato, las normas de la Ley de Adquisiciones del Estado ni su reglamento*.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.1.\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Clause. 1.1.\n\n747.\n\nClause 1.4.4 of the *Bases Consolidadas* further provides that the submission of a bid in the Third Auction would imply full knowledge and acceptance of the terms set out therein:796\n\n\u2026*el pleno conocimiento, aceptaci\u00f3n y sometimiento incondicional del Participante, de todo lo dispuesto en las Bases, as\u00ed como su renuncia irrevocable e incondicional, de la manera m\u00e1s amplia que permitan las Leyes Aplicables, a plantear cualquier acci\u00f3n, reconvenci\u00f3n, excepci\u00f3n, reclamo, demanda o solicitud de indemnizaci\u00f3n contra el Estado Peruano o cualquier dependencia, organismo o funcionario de \u00e9ste, el Ministerio, OSINERGMIN, el Comit\u00e9 y sus Asesores.*\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Clause 1.4.4.\n\n748.\n\nArticle 1.2.31 of the *Bases Consolidadas* defines the Actual COS as follows:797\n\n***Fecha Real de Puesta en Operaci\u00f3n Comercial** : Es la fecha real de entrada en operaci\u00f3n comercial de cada central, certificada por el COES de acuerdo a sus Procedimientos, la cual no podr\u00e1 exceder en dos (02) a\u00f1os la Fecha Referencial de Puesta en Operaci\u00f3n Comercial, caso contrario el Contrato quedar\u00e1 autom\u00e1ticamente resuelto y se ejecutar\u00e1 la Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento.*\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Art. 1.2.31.\n\n749.\n\nAs such, it specifies that the Actual COS may not exceed the Reference COS by more than two years, failing which the contract will be automatically terminated.\n\n750.\n\nArticle 7.1 of the *Bases Consolidadas* further states that the *Fecha de T\u00e9rmino del Contrato* is not modifiable for any reason, even for force majeure (\"*no ser\u00e1 modificable por ninguna causa, ni a\u00fan por Fuerza Mayor*.\")798\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Art. 7.1.\n\n751.\n\nThe *Bases Consolidadas* also refer to the termination date (\"*Fecha de T\u00e9rmino del Contrato*\") as \"*el 31 de diciembre de 2036, fecha no modificable por ninguna causa, hasta la cual se le garantiza al Concesionario la Tarifa de Adjudicaci\u00f3n*.\"799 This mirrors Clause 1.4.22 of the RER Contract.\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Art. 1.2.30.\n\n752.\n\nAt face value, the wording of the RER Contract, including the *Bases Consolidadas* does not provide a basis for extending the Actual COS or the Termination Date of the Contract. To the contrary, it appears to preclude such an extension in clear terms by: (i) setting a deadline for the Actual COS, failing which the RER Contract is automatically terminated; and (ii) specifying that the Termination Date of the RER Contract is non-modifiable. There is no exception provided in the text of these provisions for actions attributable to third parties, even if those third parties are governmental authorities, or other causes outside Second Claimant's sphere of responsibility.\n\n753.\n\nIn the same context, Tribunal Question 6 asked:\n\nWas the period of two years (the \"cushion\") between the Reference COS and the Actual COS intended to accommodate delays attributable to Second Claimant only or also delays attributable to third parties, MINEM, Respondent or its Government Authorities?\n\n754.\n\nClaimants argue that the cushion was meant to accommodate delays by Second Claimant and not Respondent,800 while Respondent submits that it was to accommodate all delays.801 In line with its conclusions above, the Tribunal finds that the cushion period between the Reference COS and the Actual COS was intended to accommodate all kinds of delays, whether attributable to Second Claimant or not.\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1942:17-1944:12.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2108:18-2109:19; R-PHB \u00b6 25.\n\n*(ii) Systematic and Functional Interpretation*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n755.\n\nIn the context of a systematic interpretation, Claimants rely on Clause 7.1 of the RER Contract, which states:802\n\nNeither party shall be liable for the non-performance of an obligation or for the partial, belated or defective performance thereof for as long as the Party bound is affected by an event of Force Majeure, provided that it can prove that such event prevented adequate performance.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 7.1.\n\n756.\n\nThe Tribunal does not understand Clause 7.1 of the RER Contract to assist Claimants. The fact that the clauses setting the Actual COS and Termination Date have liability implications but are not placed in Clause 7 on \"Contract Liability\" is not a reason to deprive them of their meaning as drafted. In addition, as Claimants have emphasised,803 this is not a case of force majeure. The Tribunal does not consider Clause 7.1 to contain a principle that should be applied to other scenarios beyond force majeure, to the effect that a party will not be responsible for late or defective performance which is caused by governmental authorities. Moreover, the *Bases Consolidadas* explicitly exclude modification of the Termination Date of the Contract for force majeure reasons (see \u00b6 750 above).\n\nReply \u00b6 49: \"\u2026it is undisputed that this case does not involve delays caused by *force majeure* events.\" *See also* Claimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1940:19-22.\n\n757.\n\nThe Parties have also raised Clause 10.2(b) of the RER Contract, which provides:804\n\nThe Ministry may terminate the Contract if the Concessionaire Company:\n\n...\n\nb) Fails to fulfill any of its obligations under paragraphs 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4.\n\nReply \u00b6 782; Rejoinder \u00b6 987.\n\n758.\n\nIn relation to this provision, Tribunal Question 1 asked \"What is the relationship between Clauses 8.4 and 10.2(b) of the RER Contract (C-002)?\" The Parties provided their answers in their respective Closing Statements at the Hearing.805\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1945:6-22; Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2101:15-2104:18.\n\n759.\n\nAs Claimants point out,806 the option for MINEM to terminate the RER Contract in Clause 10.2(b) of the RER Contract is difficult to read systematically with Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract which refers to termination \"*de pleno derecho*\", i.e., a termination that would occur as of right and without any exercise of discretion by MINEM. This difficulty was acknowledged by Respondent's expert Mr. Lava, who considered Clause 10.2 to be incongruous with Clause 8.4.807 However, some light is shed by Clause 10.4 of the RER Contract, which contains a procedure for notice and termination of the RER Contract: \"[i]n the absence of any grounds for termination of this contract by operation of law, in which case the contract shall be terminated on the sole basis of the breach\u2026\" (\"*[s]i no mediara una causal de resoluci\u00f3n de pleno derecho de este contrato, en cuyo caso el contrato concluir\u00e1 por el solo hecho del incumplimiento*\u2026\").808 This reference to a termination \"*de pleno derecho*\" precisely mirrors the language of Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract, confirming that where the parties to the RER Contract have specifically provided for automatic termination, the RER Contract will conclude \"on the sole basis of the breach\" and not by the procedure outlined in Clause 10.4 which applies to other circumstances. The fact that Clause 10.2(b) refers to an optional termination under Clause 8.4 therefore cannot deprive Clause 8.4 of its meaning and effect, which is to provide for automatic termination in the event that the Actual COS is not met within two years. The Tribunal considers this reading to give greatest effect to the provisions of the RER Contract as drafted.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 783-784. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6 27.\n\nCross-examination of Mr. Lava, Transcript (Day 4), 14 March 2022, 1403:22-1404:1, 1404:13-14.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 10.4.\n\n760.\n\nThe non-movability of the Termination Date of the Contract was also the subject of a declaration made by Second Claimant on 30 October 2013, prior to signature of the RER Contract:809\n\n*DECLARAMOS BAJO JURAMENTO que reconocemos el car\u00e1cter no modificable de la Fecha de T\u00e9rmino del Contrato, aun cuando se presenten eventos de Fuerza Mayor*.\n\n**R-138**, *Declaraci\u00f3n Jurada sobre reconocimiento de car\u00e1cter no modificable de la fecha de t\u00e9rmino del contrato, aun cuando se presenten eventos de fuerza mayor*, CH Mamacocha, 30 October 2013.\n\n761.\n\nIn response to Tribunal Question 4 on the legal significance of this declaration,810 Second Claimant argues that while it indicates that it assumed the risk that force majeure events would reduce the term of validity of the RER Contract, it contains no statement that Second Claimant assumed the risk of \"government interference\", which would have been required for Second Claimant to assume such risk.811 Respondent submits, on the other hand, that Second Claimant understood and accepted the immutability of the Termination Date, and that its wording (\"*a\u00fan cuando*\") is not exhaustive.812\n\nTribunal Question 4: \"What is the legal significance, if any, of the declaration signed by Second Claimant dated 30 October 2013 (R-138), as follows: [see text of declaration].\"\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1944:17-1945:5. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2105:2-18.\n\n762.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Second Claimant's reading of the declaration does not give due acknowledgement to the statement that Second Claimant \"*reconoce[] el car\u00e1cter no modificable de la Fecha de T\u00e9rmino del Contrato*.\" This non-modifiable character is \"even if\" it is presented with force majeure events, as defined in the RER Contract. It does not suggest that the Termination Date may be moved for other events that are outside Second Claimant's sphere of control but are not necessarily force majeure.\n\n763.\n\nThe non-modifiable character of the Termination Date of the Contract was also clear to participants at the stage of the consultation phase in the Third Auction from a number of queries submitted by participants in the auction. These queries were compiled in circulars which pursuant to Clause 1.4.12 of the RER Contract became part of the RER Contract together with the *Bases Consolidadas*.813\n\n**R-101**, *Circular No. 1, Comit\u00e9 para la Tercera Subasta*, 10 September 2013; **C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.12, which defines the Contract, and provides, in part, that it: \"includ[es] the Tender Requirements and the circulars.\"\n\n764.\n\nFor example, a request was made to alter the agreement with respect to the Termination Date, such that it would be non-modifiable \"*por ninguna causa salvo por Fuerza Mayor*\u2026\" This suggestion was not accepted.814 Likewise, a request was made that Clause 8.4 of the agreement exclude situations of force majeure (\"*por cualquier motivo salvo Fuerza Mayor*\"). This request was also rejected.815\n\n**R-101**, *Circular No. 1, Comit\u00e9 para la Tercera Subasta*, 10 September 2013, p. 15.\n\n**R-101**, *Circular No. 1, Comit\u00e9 para la Tercera Subasta*, 10 September 2013, p. 10.\n\n765.\n\nIn Second Claimant's view, the above interpretation would allow Respondent to:\n\n\u2026act with impunity and any and all benefits that [Second Claimant] and its investors hoped to achieve in executing the RER Contract and making substantial investments in reliance on Peru's commitments would be illusory.816\n\nMemorial \u00b6 421. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 422; *quoting* Qui\u00f1ones First Report \u00b6 81; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 730, 732.\n\n766.\n\nRespondent disagrees, submitting that Claimants had a contractual right to seek damages for any action taken by MINEM in bad faith, and could have sought extra-contractual remedies under general administrative law for unjustifiable delays by other State entities.817\n\nR-PHB \u00b6 84.\n\n767.\n\nClaimants further rely on other provisions and principles of Peruvian law, such as Article 1.8 of the GLAP, which in their view requires the parties to implement the RER Contract in good faith, and Article 103 of the Peruvian Political Constitution, which provides that the State has an obligation to protect others from any abuse of rights.818\n\nReply \u00b6 740.\n\n768.\n\nThis argument is based on Claimants' submission, which has been rejected by the Tribunal, that every authority of the Peruvian State is responsible under the RER Contract. As the Tribunal held at \u00b6 651 above, the fact that the Peruvian State is the counterparty of Second Claimant does not make every authority of the Peruvian State responsible for the progress of the Project under the RER Contract. Nor does the Tribunal consider a situation of abuse of rights to arise.\n\n769.\n\nNotably, Respondent does not argue that concessionaire companies accepted the risk that MINEM itself would not fulfil its own obligations under the RER Contract.819\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 100.\n\n770.\n\nIn Tribunal Question 15, the Tribunal also asked the Parties about Claimants' risk assessment in light of the terms of the RER Contract:\n\nDoes a risk assessment for a project, which will require environmental permits to proceed, take account of the risk that such permits are (i) delayed, (ii) not granted, or (iii) subsequently annulled by competent authorities, due to objections to the environmental impact of the project? If so, did Claimants take account of such risk in their assessment of the proposed contract terms and planning for the Mamacocha Project, and how?\n\n771.\n\nIn Claimants' view: (i) they never assumed the risk of \"government interference\", so they argue that arbitrary conduct by the government would never count against Second Claimant; (ii) the granting and subsequent annulment of a permit should not count against Second Claimant because Peruvian administrative law includes a presumption of validity of the administrative act; and (iii) Claimants mitigated the risk of permitting delays by, starting in 2012, hiring a top Peruvian law firm, and dozens of employees and consultants to liaise with permitting authorities.820\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1954:16-1956:6.\n\n772.\n\nFor Respondent, the risk of permitting delays was identified by the Mamacocha Project's feasibility study in July 2013 and Claimants already experienced such delays prior to signing the RER Contract. Moreover, Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract refers to permitting delays. In its view, the purpose of the two-year cushion period to achieve the Actual COS was to allow for such delays, with the investor bearing the risk.821 Respondent further submits that given that the Mamacocha lagoon is the world's largest natural lagoon, it was foreseeable that there would be community challenges to the Project, as well as engineering challenges affecting the timing of construction.822\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2055:18-2057:20. *See* **RD-06**, Respondent's Closing Presentation, slides 36-37; **C-101**, Mamacocha Hydroelectric Project, Peru: Feasibility Study\u2014Phase I\u2014Final Report, P\u00f6yry, July 2013, p. 158; **C-149**, *Carta de HLA (C.

Nicho)*, 24 November 2014. *See also* R-PHB \u00b6 27.\n\nR-PHB \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\n773.\n\nIn light of the terms of the RER Contract, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the purpose of the cushion period between the Reference COS and the Actual COS was to account for potential delays such as those related to permitting. The Tribunal does not consider permitting delays, in principle, to amount to \"government interference\", noting the conclusions reached above regarding responsibilities under the RER Contract, and that Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract expressly contemplates such delays. Whether any arbitrary conduct took place that would change this analysis will be examined by the Tribunal in the course of this Award.\n\n774.\n\nClaimants further rely on the purpose of the RER Law to eliminate barriers to investment in RER projects, incentivize investors to make investments in RER projects, and provide a stable and consistent legal framework to protect these investments.823 In addition, for Second Claimant, an interpretation in line with the RER Contract's purpose under Article 170 of the Peruvian Civil Code confirms that the deadlines introduced into the RER Contract were in response to substantial delays caused by concessionaires in the first two public auctions, including abuses of force majeure-related extensions.824\n\nReply \u00b6 743; *citing* **C-007**, Legislative Decree No. 1002, 1 May 2008, Preamble and Art. 2. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6 3.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 429-430; **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 131.\n\n775.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that these are among the purposes of the RER Law, which states that the development of electricity generation by means of RER projects is \"of national interest and public necessity.\"825 However, it was for the Peruvian State (in the RER Regulations), and the State together with Second Claimant (as parties to the RER Contract) to detail how those objectives will be achieved, and how delays will be addressed. The Tribunal finds no conflict between these broadly-stated purposes and the specifics of the immovability of the Termination Date of the Contract and the consequences of failing to meet the Actual COS, as determined in the RER Regulations and reflected in the RER Contract. In particular, the Tribunal does not consider such a reading to breach or distort the RER Law contrary to Section 118(8) of the Political Constitution of Peru, or to be inconsistent with Article 51 of the Political Constitution which provides for the hierarchy that laws prevail over legal norms of a lower hierarchy such as regulations.826\n\n**C-007**, Legislative Decree No. 1002, 1 May 2008, Art. 2.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 40-41; *citing* **C-007**, Legislative Decree No. 1002, 1 May 2008; **C-235**, First Legal Report by M.

The Actual COS and the Termination Date are regulated by law and are not open to reinterpretation by way of the Peruvian Civil Code, which applies only in a supplementary fashion (see \u00b6 586 above). Article 1317 of the Peruvian Civil Code itself expressly contemplates the present scenario, providing that an obligor will not be liable for damages resulting from causes not attributable to it \"\u2026unless otherwise expressly provided by law or the title of the obligation\u2026\" (\"*salvo que lo contrario est\u00e9 previsto expresamente por la ley o por el t\u00edtulo de la obligaci\u00f3n*\").830 As noted here, the RER Regulations expressly provide otherwise.\n\n**RL-048/CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 1317. Translation by Claimants at Memorial \u00b6 427.\n\n778.\n\nArticle 1314 of the Peruvian Civil Code likewise cannot rewrite the specific agreement reached in the RER Contract, or interfere with the binding provisions of the RER Law or RER Regulations. Pursuant to Article IX of the *T\u00edtulo Preliminar* of the Civil Code, the Tribunal finds that Article 1314 is not applicable for present purposes.\n\n779.\n\nThe Tribunal further rejects Second Claimant's argument that the RER Law requires that the RER Promotion must be executed in accordance with the protections set out under the TPA, meaning that the RER Contract cannot be interpreted in a manner that would render these protections meaningless.831 The Tribunal finds no such obligation in the text of the RER Law, and no basis for the interpretation sought by Second Claimant.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 428; *citing* **C-007**, Legislative Decree No. 1002, 1 May 2008.\n\n*(iii) Good Faith Interpretation*\n---------------------------------\n\n780.\n\nIn relation to Claimants' argument that the above interpretation would be inconsistent with a good faith reading, the Tribunal observes that as Claimants contend,832 the purpose of a good faith reading is to interpret the contract: (i) in the sense it would have been reasonably understood by loyal economic agents; (ii) preserving the effects of the agreement and discarding readings that lead to ineffectiveness or illegality; and (iii) avoiding absurd, illogical and inconsistent interpretations.833\n\nReply \u00b6 733.\n\nQui\u00f1ones Second Report \u00b6 77; *quoting* **MQ-091**, *Bullard, Alfredo, De Acuerdo en que no estamos de Acuerdo: An\u00e1lisis Econ\u00f3mico de la Interpretaci\u00f3n Contractual, Revista De Instituciones, Ideas y Mercados*, October 2007.\n\n781.\n\nIt should be noted that the good faith reading is part of the literal interpretation exercise under Article 168 of the Peruvian Civil Code (see \u00b6 594 above) and is not designed to rewrite the agreement reached. This is consistent with Article 1361 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which provides:834\n\n*Los contratos son obligatorios en cuanto se haya expresado en ellos. Se presume que la declaraci\u00f3n expresada en el contrato responde a la voluntad com\u00fan de las partes y quien niegue esa coincidencia debe probarla*.\n\n**RL-048/CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Art. 1361.\n\n782.\n\nWhile a good faith interpretation may include interpreting the RER Contract \"in accordance with the investor-friendly objectives of eliminating barriers, [and] creating a consistent legal framework,\" Claimants go too far when they assert that a good faith interpretation requires \"protecting the RER projects, and ensuring their advancement.\"835\n\nReply \u00b6 734.\n\n783.\n\nIn this sense, the Tribunal considers that a good faith interpretation does not justify reading into the provisions of the RER Contract an exception that would allow the Actual COS and the Termination Date to be extended for \"government-caused delays.\" This does not square with the wording of the agreement and would leave Clauses 1.4.22, 1.4.23 and 8.4 ineffective.\n\n784.\n\nIn terms of potential illegality in an interpretation of the RER Contract (being another aspect of a good faith reading), the Tribunal has reviewed the RER Law and the RER Regulations, which are specifically defined in the RER Contract, form part of the \"Applicable Laws\" and are relied on by both Parties in support of their respective interpretations.836 As noted at \u00b6 613 above, the RER Law and the RER Regulations are a binding legal framework within which the RER Contract has been concluded.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 428; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 427.\n\n785.\n\nArticle 1.13C of the RER Regulations provides:837\n\n*Fecha Real de Puesta en Operaci\u00f3n Comercial: Fecha real de entrada en operaci\u00f3n comercial de cada central, certificada por el COES de acuerdo a sus Procedimientos, la cual no podr\u00e1 exceder en dos (02) a\u00f1os la Fecha Referencial de Puesta en Operaci\u00f3n Comercial, caso contrario el Contrato quedar\u00e1 autom\u00e1ticamente resuelto y se ejecutar\u00e1 la Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento*.\n\n**MQ-005**, *Reglamento RER*, Art. 1.13C.\n\n786.\n\nArticle 1.13B of the RER Regulations provides:838\n\n*Fecha de T\u00e9rmino del Contrato: Es la fecha m\u00e1xima establecida en las Bases, no modificable por ninguna causa, hasta la cual se le pagar\u00e1 al Concesionario la Tarifa de Adjudicaci\u00f3n*.\n\n**MQ-005**, *Reglamento RER*, Art. 1.13B.\n\n787.\n\nArticle 1.13D of the RER Regulations further provides:839\n\n*Fecha Referencial de Puesta en Operaci\u00f3n Comercial: Es la fecha establecida en las Bases, considerando veinte (20) a\u00f1os hasta la Fecha de T\u00e9rmino del Contrato.*\n\n**MQ-005**, *Reglamento RER*, Art. 1.13D.\n\n788.\n\nIt is evident from the above provisions that the \"hard stop\" in relation to the Actual COS two years after the Reference COS, and the non-modifiable nature of the Termination Date of the Contract (\"*por ninguna causa*\") are a matter of binding law under the RER Regulations in addition to being aspects of the agreement between the parties to the RER Contract.\n\n*(iv) Amendment of the RER Contract or RER Regulations*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n789.\n\nWhile considering the RER Regulations, the Tribunal notes that Claimants do not allege for the purpose of the contractual claim that Respondent was obliged to amend the RER Regulations in order to grant the Third Extension Request. This was the subject of Tribunal Question 5 to the Parties.840\n\nTribunal Question 5: \"Can the following dates be amended by contract or only by regulatory action: (i) Actual Date of Commercial Operation Start-up [Actual COS]; (ii) Reference Date of Commercial Operation Start-up [Reference COS]; (iii) Termination Date of the RER Contract [Termination Date]?\"\n\n790.\n\nIn Claimants' view, the Actual COS, Reference COS and Termination Date of the RER Contract can be effectively amended by contract, as long as they stay within certain \"parameters\" of the regulation, i.e., that the Actual COS cannot exceed the Reference COS by two years, and the Reference COS must be 20 years from the Termination Date.841 Respondent disagrees, arguing that the critical dates could not be contractually amended because they were set forth in Articles 1.13B, C and D of the RER Regulations.842\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1946:5-18.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2106:4-11.\n\n791.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the Actual COS, Reference COS and Termination Date could only be amended by regulatory action and not by contract, taking into account the binding provisions of the RER Regulations.\n\n792.\n\nEven if a potential contractual amendment of the RER Contract that complied with the RER Regulations could be devised, Claimants have not established that the Third Extension Request proposed such an amendment that would have fallen within the parameters of the legal framework they have identified.\n\n793.\n\nClaimants further allege that Respondent succumbed to \"regulatory opportunism\" by abandoning a draft Supreme Decree which would have amended the RER Regulations to allow for extensions to the Termination Date and Actual COS (\"**Draft Supreme Decree**\", see \u00b6\u00b6 208-212 above).843 The Tribunal will give further consideration to this argument at \u00b6\u00b6 1225-1227 below in the context of Claimants' claim under the TPA.\n\nReply \u00b6 234.\n\n*(v) Echecopar Reports*\n-----------------------\n\n794.\n\nClaimants rely on the Echecopar Reports as evidence that the Third Extension Request could be granted, and that it was \"illegal\" not to grant it.844 Respondent submits, *inter alia*, that: (i) MINEM officials did not share the views in the Echecopar Reports;845 (ii) Echecopar were hired for consultation purposes, not representation purposes, and it was never contemplated that the recommendations of the Echecopar Reports would be binding on MINEM;846 and (iii) the Echecopar Reports had serious conflicts of interest arising from parallel representation of companies seeking to change the regulatory framework governing the RER contracts.847\n\nReply \u00b6 84. *See also* **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 132.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 150.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 151.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 153.\n\n795.\n\nThe Echecopar Reports are legal advice from external counsel to MINEM and do not reflect a binding decision on the issues in dispute or conduct or representations of the Peruvian State.848 The Tribunal does not share the views expressed in the Echecopar Reports, as per the Tribunal's reasoning above.\n\n*See*, in this regard, Rejoinder \u00b6 151. Respondent further alleges that the Echecopar Reports are undermined by conflicts of interest on the part of the law firm. *See* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 152-156.\n\n*(vi) Addenda 1 and 2*\n----------------------\n\n796.\n\nSecond Claimant further argues that an interpretation which is inconsistent with the Parties' prior course of dealing is contrary to good faith. In particular, Second Claimant relies on the extensions to the COS deadline granted under Addenda 1 and 2, which in its view recognised that Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract did not allocate to Second Claimant the risk that the government could delay Second Claimant's execution of the Works Schedule.849 For Claimants, these Addenda are dispositive of the contractual claims.850 According to Respondent, on the other hand, Addendum 2 should not have been granted.851 Since Addenda 1 and 2 were stated to amend the RER Contract, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recount their background and effect.\n\nReply \u00b6 738. *See also* C-PHB \u00b6 11.\n\nC-PHB \u00b6 29.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 450.\n\n797.\n\nBefore doing so, the Tribunal notes that Second Claimant commenced the permitting process prior to the date of the RER Contract, i.e., 18 February 2014 (see \u00b6 109 above). In response to Tribunal Question 13 on the relevance, if any, of delays in permitting prior to the date of the RER Contract, Claimants submit that Respondent was obliged to compensate Second Claimant for those delays, and did partially cure them in Addendum 1 (see \u00b6\u00b6 112 *et seq.* above).852 Respondent argues, on the other hand, that such delays confirm that: (i) Second Claimant was aware that permitting may be delayed; (ii) Second Claimant could not meet the Reference COS, and would not be entitled to the 20 years of Guaranteed Revenue (see \u00b6 97 above); and (iii) Second Claimant was at greater risk of not meeting the Actual COS deadline.853\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1950:10-1951:10.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2069:4-20.\n\n798.\n\nIn Tribunal Question 7A, the Tribunal asked:\n\nPlease advise what changes to the RER Contract were made in Addenda 1 and 2, and how those changes correspond to Clauses 1.4.23, 1.4.24 and 1.4.40 of the RER Contract.\n\n799.\n\nThe Parties provided their views in their respective Closing Statements at the Hearing.854\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1932:6-1933:12; Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2117:4-10.\n\n800.\n\nAddendum 1 granted an extension to the Works Execution Schedule and set a new Actual COS of 8 December 2018.855 It mentions that \"delays in the administrative procedures made it impossible to achieve Financial Closing for the project\u2026\" and that \"said events of non-compliance do not fall within the scope of the Concessionaire's liability, applying article 1314 of the Civil Code.\"856 The delays were was stated to be:857\n\n\u2026caused by the Regional Environmental Authority of the Regional Government of Arequipa, in the evaluation of the requests for classification of the preliminary environmental study and the subsequent approval of the Declaration of Environmental Impact (DEI), both for the Laguna Azul Hydroelectric Plant as well as the Transmission Line; by the Ministry of Culture with the approval of the execution of the archaeological evaluation project with excavation, as well as the approval of the Final Report; by the Local Water Authority of Caman\u00e1 \u2013 Majes, with the approval of the water use studies; and by the COES with the approval of the Preoperational Study of the project[\u2026]\n\n**C-008**, Addendum 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 8.\n\n**C-008**, Addendum 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 6.

The delay not attributable to the Concessionaire creates a delay in the temporary obligation, which afterwards, allows (at a material level) the performance of the obligation[\u2026]\n\nMINEM Ministerial Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM, in **C-009**, Addendum 2 to the RER Contract, 3 January 2017, p. 10.\n\n814.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that contrary to Claimants' interpretation, the Tribunal finds no language in Addenda 1 and 2 that modified Clause 1.4.24 of the RER Contract regarding the Reference COS. It does not follow that because the Actual COS and Reference COS are \"linked together\" in the original text of RER Contract, the Addenda automatically modified those dates as Claimants assert.876 This is precluded by the language of both Addenda, which specifies that provisions of the RER Contract not specifically mentioned in the respective Addenda remain in effect.877\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1933:1-7.\n\n**C-008**, Addendum 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 10; **C-009**, Addendum 2 to the RER Contract, 3 January 2017, Clause 2.3.\n\n815.\n\nFrom the above details about the Sosa Report, Addenda 1 and 2 and the Ministerial Resolutions accompanying them, it is clear that not all of the views expressed by MINEM in the Sosa Report and the Ministerial Resolutions are consistent with the Tribunal's interpretation of the RER Contract. In this respect, the Tribunal refers, *inter alia*, to: (i) the extension by Addendum 2 of the Actual COS to a date falling more than two years beyond the Reference COS; (ii) the meaning of \"for any reason\" in Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract; and (iii) the indication in the Ministerial Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM that the Actual COS \"does not constitute an essential term.\"\n\n816.\n\nIn reading Addenda 1 and 2 harmoniously together with the RER Contract and the binding RER Regulations to the extent possible, the Tribunal first notes that Addendum 1 did not extend the Actual COS to a date beyond the two-year contractual limitation, nor extend the Termination Date of the Contract. The Actual COS was originally 2 January 2017, extended to 8 December 2018 under Addendum 1.878 This was still within two years of the Reference COS of 31 December 2016. As such, it does not have specific contractual implications for the present question before the Tribunal.\n\n**C-008**, Addendum 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 3, 8.\n\n817.\n\nIn respect of Addendum 2, the Tribunal notes that MINEM's focus, as stated in Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM, was \"non-performance or late or defective performance, directly caused by acts of the contracting Public Administration (Ministry of Energy and Mines) in its role as grantor of qualifying licenses (definitive generation and transmission concessions).\"879 The premise for the extension granted in Addendum 2, which went beyond the two year period for the Actual COS, was that MINEM had directly caused the delay in question. This is to be distinguished from Second Claimant's proposed interpretation, which would be to require an extension to be granted for delay caused by any government authority, and not just MINEM.\n\nMINEM Ministerial Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM, in **C-009**, Addendum 2 to the RER Contract, 3 January 2017, p. 10.\n\n818.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that while an extension was granted to the Actual COS in Addendum 2, MINEM explicitly did not accept the movability of the Termination Date of the Contract, which was cited to be inappropriate in light of Article 1.13B of the RER Regulations (see \u00b6 786 above).880 Addendum 2 therefore does not support a view that the Termination Date was movable, or that the Parties had agreed on a guaranteed 20 years of validity for the Award Tariff.\n\n**C-009**, Addendum 2 to the RER Contract, 3 January 2017, pp. 9-10.\n\n819.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal observes that pursuant to Clause 12.3 of the RER Contract, and as repeated in Addendum 1,881 \"[a]mendments or clarifications to the Contract shall only be valid when they\u2026 comply with the relevant requirements under the Applicable Laws.\"882 To the extent that Addenda 1 and 2 are not compliant with Applicable Laws, they are therefore not valid and should not have been granted. Even without this clear language, as a matter of Peruvian law, the binding administrative legal framework within which the RER Contract operates must prevail (see \u00b6 613 above).\n\n**C-008**, Addendum 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, Recital 7.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 12.3.\n\n820.\n\nIn December 2017, according to Claimants, they held discussions with MINEM regarding the basis for a potential extension to the Termination Date of the RER Contract.883 Following those discussions, an email from First Claimant's President at the time Mr. Goran Stefan Sillen, to Mr. Ampuero Llerena, the President of the Special Commission, records as follows:884\n\nI would like to have a private conversation with you with respect to moving the term of the PPA. We are making some progress with MINEM and we are seemingly in agreement that a) our request to move the end date of the contract is legally justified and b) that there is a legal mechanism to do so.\n\nHowever, MINEM wants to make sure that it doesn't create a precedent for other projects and I respect that so we are willing to find ways to achieve that. That said, our case is unique in that the delays are caused by authorities and, hence, the state of Peru whereas other projects may be delayed for reasons which are under the control of the developer or not caused by the state.\n\n**C-233**, Memorandum to the Special Commission regarding the extension of the RER Contract Term Date, 20 December 2017; Sillen Second Statement \u00b6 54; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n\n**C-234**, Email from S. Sillen to R. Ampuero, 23 January 2018.\n\n821.\n\nRespondent submits, on the other hand, that MINEM's exploration of possible alternative solutions in good faith never resulted in any offer to Second Claimant, and Claimants have not produced any document issued by Peru mentioning such an offer.885\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 141.\n\n822.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that the discussions between MINEM and Claimants regarding a hypothetical extension of the end date of the RER Contract to alter any of its conclusions. Whatever the contents of those discussions, they did not result in the implementation of any legal mechanism, contractual or otherwise.\n\n823.\n\nTaking the legal situation as a whole, the Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty posed by MINEM's conduct in entering into Addenda 1 and especially Addenda 2, and subsequently disavowing those Addenda, as a matter of good faith and consistency in the interpretation of the RER Contract. Under different circumstances, the Tribunal would agree with Claimants regarding the agreements reached in Addenda 1 and 2, in particular in light of the matters mentioned at \u00b6 815 above. However, in the present case, the Tribunal is not at liberty to disregard the binding provisions of the RER Regulations, which included a \"hard stop\" for the Actual COS, which Second Claimant was well aware of. Without an amendment of those binding legal provisions, deviation from the mandatory requirements of the RER Regulations was not possible. As such, the Tribunal confirms its literal, systematic and functional interpretation of the RER Contract to the effect that the Actual COS was required to take place by a date two years beyond the Reference COS, and that the Termination Date could not be moved beyond 31 December 2036. The Tribunal finds that Article 1 of Addendum 2 has no effect insofar as it set the Actual COS at 14 March 2020, being a date beyond that prescribed in Article 1.13C of the RER Regulations. The Tribunal will give further consideration to issues of good faith under Peruvian law and the TPA at \u00b6\u00b6 901-906 and 1204 below.\n\n824.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the Parties engaged in contemporaneous discussions which potentially included an offer of an extension to the Termination Date (that was not accepted by Claimants) is of no assistance to Claimants, leaving aside the issue that no agreement was entered into in that respect.886\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 73-75, 87.\n\n825.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that in the context of their argument regarding the principle of estoppel under customary international law, Claimants make passing reference to \"the contractual and Peruvian law principle of waiver,\" which allegedly precludes Respondent's \"various arguments in this arbitration concerning the alleged invalidity of Addenda 1 and 2.\"887 The Tribunal does not consider any claim of waiver with respect to Addenda 1 and 2 to be made out.\n\nReply \u00b6 651.\n\n826.\n\nWhile Respondent has disavowed the validity of Addenda 1 and 2, it has not made any formal request for relief in the form of a request for a declaration of nullity before this Tribunal, and the Tribunal therefore does not have to consider whether such a declaration should be made.888 As confirmed by the Parties in response to Tribunal Question 9,889 the Lima Arbitration was the only forum in which Respondent sought such a declaration, but that arbitral tribunal declined jurisdiction without granting Respondent's request.890\n\n*See* Claimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1931:5-16; Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2118:6-14.\n\nTribunal Question 9: \"Have Addenda 1 and 2 to the RER Contract been declared null and void? If so, please identify when such a declaration was made, and by whom, with reference to the corresponding evidence on the record.\"\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1930:4-1932:5; Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2118:6-14.\n\n827.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning likewise entails the rejection of Claimants' argument that its interpretation of Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract would violate Article 70 of Peru's Political Constitution on the inviolability of property rights.891 Article 70 of the Political Constitution provides that the right to property is exercised \"*dentro de los l\u00edmites de ley*.\"892 The Tribunal does not consider the operation of Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract in accordance with its terms and the terms of the RER Regulations to be inconsistent with the inviolability of property rights. The question of whether an expropriation has taken place at all will be addressed in the context of Claimants' claims under the TPA (see Section IX.C below).\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 786-787.\n\n**RL-055**, *Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica del Per\u00fa*, 29 December 1993**,** Art. 70:  \n\"*El derecho de propiedad es inviolable.

Findings of Other Arbitral Tribunals***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n828.\n\nIn support of their respective arguments on the interpretation of the RER Contract, both Parties have raised the findings of other arbitral tribunals seated in Lima, Peru that have made determinations with respect to other hydropower projects in the Third Auction and Fourth Auction (see \u00b6\u00b6 224-233 above).893\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 452-457; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 763-773; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 131-132, 255-260.\n\n829.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that each of these arbitrations has its own factual matrix, and each tribunal made its decisions based on the arguments made and evidence put before it. This Tribunal is not bound by the findings of other arbitral tribunals, and makes its decision based on the record presented by the Parties. The findings of these tribunals are still of relevance insofar as they interpret identical or analogous provisions of the RER Contract and applicable Peruvian law. The Tribunal therefore notes some of the relevant circumstances and conclusions reached by those tribunals below, many of which correspond with findings made by the Tribunal in this Award.\n\n*(i) Electro Za\u00f1a*\n------------------\n\n830.\n\nThe Electro Za\u00f1a arbitration was brought by a RER concessionaire in the Third Auction. The concessionaire achieved the Actual COS on 15 February 2019, i.e., after 31 December 2018. It suffered delays in obtaining easements necessary for construction, and while its generation units were installed by the time of a test for COS on 28 December 2018, one of the generation units encountered a technical issue and its certification did not become valid until 15 February 2019.894\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c. Republica del Per\u00fa*, Caso Arbitral No. 0677-2018-CLL, Laudo, 21 December 2020, \u00b6 45.\n\n831.\n\nThe tribunal held that the Reference COS and the Actual COS were considered as fundamental milestones to determine the period of validity of the Award Tariff and the RER contract itself.895 The tribunal further characterised Clause 8.4 of the RER contract as a *condici\u00f3n resolutoria*. Taking into account this clause and Clause 10.2(b) of the RER contract, the tribunal held that the State was not entitled to extend the validity of the RER contract or to maintain it if the Actual COS was not achieved in the required period.896\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c. Republica del Per\u00fa*, Caso Arbitral No. 0677-2018-CLL, Laudo, 21 December 2020, \u00b6 211:  \n\"*En consecuencia, queda claro que las fechas, tanto referencial como real, de la POC han sido consideradas por la legislaci\u00f3n como hitos fundamentales para determinar no s\u00f3lo la vigencia de la tarifa de adjudicaci\u00f3n sino tambi\u00e9n del contrato mismo, tal como se ver\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n*.\"\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c. Republica del Per\u00fa*, Caso Arbitral No. 0677-2018-CLL, Laudo, 21 December 2020, \u00b6 241 (*see also* \u00b6 264):  \n\"*Puesto que la resoluci\u00f3n del Contrato se produce en forma autom\u00e1tica por el solo hecho de que la POC real no sea alcanzada por el Concesionario en el plazo m\u00e1ximo establecido, es claro que nos encontramos ante una condici\u00f3n resolutoria y no ante una causal de resoluci\u00f3n del Contrato por incumplimiento, que habilite al Estado a resolver, o no, el Contrato. Y es as\u00ed como deben ser interpretadas las cl\u00e1usulas 8.4 y 10.2.B del Contrato, toda vez que el Estado no tiene la atribuci\u00f3n legal de prorrogar los plazos del Contrato RER ni tiene la atribuci\u00f3n de mantenerlo vigente a pesar de que la POC real no se haya alcanzado dentro del plazo*.\"\n\n832.\n\nThe tribunal held that the time periods set by the RER regime are non modifiable, while the concessionaire company can freely use the two year cushion period between the Reference COS and the Actual COS to account for delays in execution of the works, without having to justify the reasons for such delays and regardless of whether it, the State, or third parties were responsible for them.897 The tribunal saw this two year period as a damage mitigation tool for the concessionaire, which had assumed the risk of any circumstance that could impact on the timing of the execution of the works.898 By using the cushion period, the tribunal noted that the concessionaire would reduce the period that it would receive the Award Tariff, since the Termination Date of the Contract is not modifiable.899\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c.

Republica del Per\u00fa*, Caso Arbitral No. 0677-2018-CLL, Laudo, 21 December 2020, \u00b6 288.\n\n833.\n\nRegarding the operation of the termination in Clause 8.4 \"for any reason\", the Tribunal held that this included causes attributable to the concessionaire, and causes outside its control. Such causes outside its control include facts of nature, acts of government (*fait du prince* or *hecho del pr\u00edncipe*), acts of third parties, and acts attributable to the State.900\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c.

Dentro de estas \u00faltimas puede haber causas atribuibles a hechos de la naturaleza, hechos de pr\u00edncipe, hechos determinantes de terceros e inclusive, hechos atribuibles al propio ESTADO. Si alg\u00fan remedio cabe ante esta situaci\u00f3n, \u00e9ste no es el de modificar la fecha de la POC real para salvar el Contrato, pues esa fecha es inmodificable*.\"\n\n834.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the works execution schedule is unilaterally elaborated by the concessionaire, and is not a contractual document placing obligations on the State. Moreover, the tribunal found that the schedule is only presented to OSINERGMIN and not MINEM, the counterparty to the RER contract. OSINERGMIN does not approve or consent to the works execution schedule, but verifies that its form and contents comply with the contract.901 While Claimants argue that the tribunal found that the State, and not MINEM, is the Grantor under the RER Contract,902 Claimants' citation for that argument is \u00b6\u00b6 1-3 of the award, in which the tribunal sets out the names of the parties and indicates that \"*[l]a parte demandada es el Estado Peruano...representado por* [MINEM]...\"903 It is not clear that the tribunal made the finding that Claimants seek to establish, however, since elsewhere in the award the tribunal refers to MINEM as \"*contraparte en el Contrato celebrado*.\"904\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c.

The tribunal was called upon to decide whether MINEM should have extended the Actual COS due to the existence of force majeure events. It found that the RER contract in that case had terminated automatically when the Actual COS was not achieved by 31 December 2018 due to reasons of force majeure. In doing so, the tribunal distinguished the case before it from causes attributable to the Peruvian State as \"*acreedor*.\"905\n\n**CLC-101**, *Empresa de Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Santa Lorenza S.A.C. c.

The tribunal held that while OSINERGMIN was to approve the works execution schedule, it did not have the nature of a contractual document, and the periods foreseen therein were not enforceable against the State.912 As such, the tribunal held that the State was not obliged to adapt its administrative activities to the periods specified in that document.913\n\n**CLC-103**, *Concesionaria Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Sur Medio S.A. c.

This is consistent with the Tribunal's finding in the present case.\n\n842.\n\nClaimants argue that, to the contrary, these tribunals did not consider Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract to be a liability clause.916 However, the references cited either do not support Claimants' contention, or go to a different question of the consequences of automatic termination, in particular in respect of the Performance Bond.

Conclusion on the Third Extension Request***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n843.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not breach the RER Contract by rejecting Second Claimant's Third Extension Request. Neither the RER Contract nor Peruvian law provide an entitlement to an extension of the Actual COS or the Termination Date of the Contract or an obligation on Respondent to grant one. To the contrary, such an extension would have been inconsistent with the terms of the RER Contract and binding provisions of the RER Regulations. Moreover, insofar as the premise of this claim by Second Claimant's is an alleged entitlement to 20 years of Guaranteed Revenue under Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37 and 6.3 of the RER Contract, this claim is without merit.\n\n844.\n\nThe Tribunal will further discuss the implications of its findings with respect to the termination of the RER Contract at \u00b6\u00b6 977 *et seq.* below.\n\n**(3) Alleged Breach of Addenda 3 to 6**\n----------------------------------------\n\n845.\n\nSecond Claimant argues that by rejecting the Third Extension Request, Respondent also separately breached obligations under Addenda 3 to 6 and Peruvian law to suspend the Works Execution Schedule and to compensate Second Claimant for the 17-month period that the RER Contract was under suspension.917\n\nReply \u00b6 790.\n\n846.\n\nRespondent argues that Addenda 3 to 6 did not release Second Claimant from the requirement to achieve the Actual COS in order to receive the Award Tariff. In its view: (i) neither the RER Contract nor the applicable legal framework permitted an extension of the Actual COS or the Termination Date; and (ii) nowhere in Addenda 3 to 6 did MINEM agree to extend the Actual COS or the Contract Termination Date.918\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1003. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 277-295; R-PHB \u00b6 33.\n\n847.\n\nIn order to determine the merits of Second Claimant's claim, the Tribunal will examine Addenda 3 to 6. Addenda 3 to 6 put in place a series of suspensions related to the RER Contract while the Parties were carrying out negotiations with respect to the dispute (see \u00b6\u00b6 164-166, 191-196, 203 above). Tribunal Question 10 asked the Parties to advise to which rights and obligations the suspension referred to in Addenda 3 to 6 applies,919 which was addressed by the Parties in their respective Closing Statements at the Hearing.920\n\nTribunal Question 10: [quoting Clause 2.1 of Addendum 3]: \"(i) To which rights and obligations under the RER Contract does the suspension referred to in Addendum 3 apply?

Specifically, and without limitation, everything provided for in the Eighth Clause of the RER Concession Contract maintains its full force and effect. (emphasis added)\n\n**C-017**, Addendum 6 to the RER Contract, 23 July 2018, Art. 3.3.\n\n855.\n\nTo recall, Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract provides, in part:937\n\nIf, for any reason, Commercial Operation Start-up of the RER Generation Project provided for hereunder has not taken place by December 31, 2018, this Contract shall be automatically terminated, and the Performance Bond shall be enforced.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 8.4.\n\n856.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the ordinary meaning of the suspension agreed in Addendum 3 and extended in Addenda 4 to 6 was to pause performance of the RER Contract, and in particular the upcoming deadlines in the Works Execution Schedule. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that suspension is not synonymous with modification.938 None of the Addenda refers to a modification of the Actual COS or an entitlement to be granted a subsequent extension of time in relation to the Actual COS. A suspension operates to suspend, i.e., to freeze or pause the obligations in question. While this may be understood to \"stop the clock\" in some sense, it cannot automatically amend the RER Contract or oblige Respondent to do so. This is all the more so when the Actual COS and the Termination Date are regulated by binding law and, as the Tribunal determined at \u00b6 791 above, could not be extended by contract alone.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 286.\n\n857.\n\nThe Tribunal further has difficulty with Claimants' argument, on the one hand, that Addendum 3 had already modified the Actual COS deadline, while the Third Extension Request also sought Respondent's agreement to such an extension.\n\n858.\n\nThe fact that the Works Execution Schedule included an entry for the Actual COS does not imply that Addenda 3 to 6 modified the other provisions of the RER Contract referring to that date. Specifically, Clause 1.4.23 provides that the Actual COS \"may not be more than two (02) years after the\" Reference COS (see \u00b6 716 above), and Clause 8.4 set out the automatic termination of the RER Contract if the Actual COS had not been completed by 31 December 2018 (see \u00b6 855 above).\n\n859.\n\nAny doubt about this interpretation is eliminated by the express wording in Addenda 4 to 6 to the effect that clauses which have not been modified or invalidated remain unchanged, and that Clause 8 of the RER Contract \"maintains its full force and effect\" (see \u00b6\u00b6 852, 854 above).\n\n860.\n\nClaimants submit that Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract does not require Second Claimant to achieve the Actual COS by 14 March 2020, as the obligation to achieve the Actual COS arises from the Works Execution Schedule. In their view, a postponement of the Actual COS would \"similarly postpone\" the deadline in Clause 8.4.939 However, Claimants' proposed interpretation does not withstand scrutiny, because Clause 8.4 does not merely contain a referential deadline but a specific hard stop at 31 December 2018. It also fails to address the requirement in Clause 1.4.23 of the RER Contract that the Actual COS may not exceed the Reference COS by more than two years.\n\nReply \u00b6 158.\n\n861.\n\nThe Tribunal's understanding is also consistent with the purposes of Addenda 3 to 6, which as both Parties acknowledge was to provide room for negotiations with a view to potential amicable resolution of the dispute.940 The immediate concern was, as Claimants point out (see \u00b6 848 above), the impending deadlines in the Works Execution Schedule for financial closing and commencement of civil works, which are expressly referred to in MINEM's resolution confirming the Direct Negotiation Minute.941\n\nReply \u00b6 148; Rejoinder \u00b6 294.\n\nMINEM Resolution No. 356-2014-NEN/DM, in **C-014**, Addendum 3 to the RER Contract, 8 September 2017, p. 16.\n\n862.\n\nConsistent with the fact that the Addenda were for the purpose of allowing negotiations to progress, and only suspended performance of the RER Contract for a specified period, Article 2.2 of Addendum 3 provides that MINEM does not recognise contractual or non-contractual liability of MINEM or the State of Peru, and both parties reserve their rights.942 Addenda 4 to 6 contain the same declaration.943\n\n**C-014**, Addendum 3 to the RER Contract, 8 September 2017, Art. 2.2.\n\n**C-015**, Addendum 4 to the RER Contract, 17 January 2018, Art. 2.2; **C-016**, Addendum 5 to the RER Contract, 26 March 2018, Art. 2.2; **C-017**, Addendum 6 to the RER Contract, 23 July 2018**,** Art. 2.2.\n\n863.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds no support in the language of Addenda 3 to 6 for an alleged obligation to grant the Third Extension Request. Addenda 3 to 6 do not themselves modify the Actual COS, nor do they contain any explicit right to the extension of time sought. Addenda 3 to 6 further do not refer to a right to compensation for the 17-month period of suspension. The Tribunal confirms its findings above that the interdependence between the Actual COS and the Reference COS, as well as the deadline for achieving the Actual COS by 31 December 2018, are binding law.\n\n864.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unpersuaded by Claimants' reliance on MINEM's internal legal memorandum dated 28 June 2017.944 The contents of the document do not refer to the legal effect of the Addenda at all, which had not yet been entered into. The document provides advice on a hypothetical situation of what \"should be\" done in relation to a request for suspension and scheduling of a new COS date if it were granted, specifically flags that consideration should be given to Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract, and ultimately recommends not to grant the suspension.945 Likewise, Claimants' reliance on submissions made by MINEM in the Lima Arbitration do not alter the Tribunal's conclusions reached above.946 The Tribunal agrees with Respondent947 that these submissions are not contemporaneous to the signature of the RER Contract and therefore do not establish the Parties' intentions when entering into it.\n\nReply \u00b6 163.\n\n**C-216**, Official Letter No. 121-2017-MEM/VME, 13 July 2017, \u00b6 2.3, \u00a7 III.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 167.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1014.\n\n865.\n\nClaimants make a further submission in relation to Addenda 3 to 6 that by waiting 10 months to respond to the Third Extension Request and denying it, Respondent repudiated its commitments to good faith negotiation under those Addenda 3 to 6.948 The Tribunal finds this assertion to be unfounded. Whether or not Addenda 3 to 6 contained any binding commitment to negotiate, such negotiations did in fact proceed (see \u00b6\u00b6 191-196, 200-203 above). The fact that such negotiations were unsuccessful and that the Third Extension Request was denied does not constitute a breach of the RER Contract or its Addenda.\n\nReply \u00b6 790.\n\n866.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's claim for alleged breach of Addenda 3 to 6 of the RER Contract as being without merit.\n\n**E.

By initiating the Lima Arbitration, Respondent argues that it reasonably sought to rectify its actions on the grounds that Addenda 1 and 2 were contrary to applicable law.958\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 959; *quoting* Lava First Report \u00b6 6.101.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 960-961; *quoting* Lava First Report \u00b6\u00b6 6.66, 6.103.\n\n872.\n\nIn Respondent's view, Claimants' argument is an example of procedural bad faith and abuse of process.959 Respondent contends that when submitting their bid in the Third Auction, Claimants declared their knowledge of the laws applicable to the RER Contract including the inability to extend the Actual COS and Termination Date and cannot now claim ignorance of them.960 In accordance with the principle of legality, Respondent argues that the public administration must depart from (\"*apartarse de*\") an act issued in contravention of applicable norms. The administration's error does not, it its view, give rise to rights for Claimants.961\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1027.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1030; *citing* **R-001,** *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013; **R-139,** *Declaraci\u00f3n Jurada del Participante*, CH Mamacocha, 22 October 2013.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1032; *citing* Monteza Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 64, 99-111.\n\n873.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's argument that Clause 2.2.1 of the RER Contract is limited to the moment of execution of the RER Contract, to the exclusion of subsequent amendments thereto. The language of Clause 2.2.1 refers to the \"execution, delivery and performance\" of the RER Contract (emphasis added). To the extent that the parties to the RER Contract agree to amendments forming part of the agreement, such actions fall within the scope of this Clause.\n\n874.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants do not argue that Respondent breached the RER Contract by entering into Addenda 1 and 2, which the language of Clause 2.2.1 may call into question. They rather contend that Respondent's disavowal of Addenda 1 and 2 in the Lima Arbitration is a violation of this provision. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the act of resorting to arbitration to challenge Addenda 1 and 2 is not a breach of Clause 2.2.1 of the RER Contract. Clause 2.2.1 of the RER Contract does not insulate MINEM's acts from subsequent question.\n\n875.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's allegation of breach of Clause 2.2.1 of the RER Contract. In doing so, the Tribunal does not consider that Claimants' claim on this ground is brought in procedural bad faith or an abuse of rights, and dismisses Respondent's assertion to that effect.\n\n**F. A lleged B reach for C ommencing the L ima A rbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n876.\n\nClaimants argue that by commencing the Lima Arbitration, Respondent breached its obligation under Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract to submit to ICSID non-technical disputes valued at over USD 20 million.962 They rely on the findings of the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration which dismissed Respondent's claims in their entirety, and held that Respondent's interpretation was: (i) not a good-faith interpretation; (ii) allowed for forum-shopping; and (iii) was nonsensical from an efficiency perspective.963\n\nMemorial \u00b6 455; Reply \u00b6 812.\n\nReply \u00b6 815; *citing* **C-245**, *MINEM v.

It provides for two different types of arbitration of non-technical disputes, depending on the amount in dispute. ICSID arbitration is available for \"[d]isputes involving amounts exceeding Twenty Million Dollars (USD 20,000,000).\" For those \"[d]isputes involving amounts equivalent to or lower than Twenty Million Dollars (USD 20,000,000)\u2026or which cannot be quantified or assessed in money,\" Clause 11.3(b) provides for arbitration in Peru in accordance with the Arbitral Rules of the National and International Arbitration Centre of the Chamber of Commerce of Lima.973\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.3.\n\n882.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty with Claimants' assertion that by filing its claims in the Lima Arbitration MINEM breached Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract. As set out at \u00b6 881 above, the plain language of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract foresees two different possible forums for potential arbitration proceedings under the RER Contract, depending on the amount in dispute. To hold a party liable for seeking recourse in a contractually-provided dispute resolution forum, even if that claim is subsequently found to be without merit, would be exceptional and a significant restriction of a party's contractual rights. Accordingly, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the filing of the Lima Arbitration was a legitimate exercise of the possibility for domestic arbitration foreseen in the RER Contract, and an option which Claimants were aware of.974\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 963; Rejoinder \u00b6 1022.\n\n883.\n\nClaimants have not established that Respondent's interpretation of Clause 11.3 was merely an abusive forum shopping exercise as a means of avoiding having this dispute heard before an ICSID tribunal.975 Claimants argue that it was always clear that the dispute brought in the Lima Arbitration was not one \"which cannot be quantified or assessed in money,\" but rather had a quantifiable and immediate impact of more than USD 20 million.976 This was a matter which the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration was properly competent to determine, and did so when it rejected jurisdiction over Respondent's claims.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 462.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 457-462; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 813-814.\n\n884.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's claim that Respondent is in breach of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract for bringing the Lima Arbitration. There being no breach of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract, the question of harm caused does not arise.\n\n**G.

While the GLAP may be applicable to aspects of Claimants' dealings with the administrative authorities in Peru for the purposes of the Mamacocha Project, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent985 that the concept of good faith under the GLAP is not directly applicable to the contractual relationship under the RER Contract. Even if the RER Contract is an administrative contract, that does not mean that the performance of the RER Contract constitutes an administrative procedure within the meaning of the GLAP.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1063.\n\n890.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal will evaluate Claimants' claim by reference to Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\n**(3) Alleged Breaches of Good Faith**\n--------------------------------------\n\n891.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent breached the obligation of good faith under the RER Contract in a number of ways. In particular, Claimants submit that: (i) the RGA Lawsuit; (ii) the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings; (iii) the rejection of the Third Extension Request; (iv) the initiation of the Lima Arbitration; and (v) AAA's measures delaying the issuance of the CWA, were all violations of good faith.986\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 474-478; Reply \u00a7\u00a7 V.D.1.a-e. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n892.\n\nThe allegations identified as (i), (ii) and (v) in \u00b6 891 above are made against State authorities other than MINEM, on the basis of Claimants' view that the conduct of all Peruvian State authorities is attributable to the State of Peru as contractual counterparty to the RER Contract. The Tribunal has rejected this view at \u00b6 651 above. Neither the RGA, the RGA Public Prosecutor, the AEP nor the AAA, or other authorities and instrumentalities implicated in the circumstances invoked by Claimants, were assigned a role or obligations in the RER Contract.\n\n893.\n\nThe RGA Lawsuit was commenced by the RGA Public Prosecutor's Office and not by MINEM (see \u00b6\u00b6 146-147 above). Claimants have not successfully established a contractual basis on which the RGA or the RGA Public Prosecutor's Office had been assigned a role or obligations in the RER Contract. The question of whether the RGA Lawsuit was brought in good faith therefore does not arise under the RER Contract, and the allegation is rejected.\n\n894.\n\nThe Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings were brought by the AEP against Second Claimant's External Counsel (see \u00b6\u00b6 149-150, 183-190 above).987 In the same way, it has not been established that these proceedings are subject to the contractual relationship in the RER Contract. Second Claimant's claim that there was a breach of good faith under the RER Contract on this basis is rejected.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 854-855.\n\n895.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal finds that the alleged bad faith by the AAA in handling Second Claimant's application for the CWA does not fall under the RER Contract and rejects this submission.988\n\nReply \u00b6 867.\n\n896.\n\nBecause the alleged actions in respect of the RGA Lawsuit, the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings and the AAA do not fall under the RER Contract, the Tribunal will not examine the merits of whether there was any breach of good faith associated with those actions. To the extent relevant to Claimants' claims under the TPA, the Tribunal will consider these matters at \u00b6\u00b6 1043-1185 below.\n\n**(4) The Rejection of the Third Extension Request**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n897.\n\nIn relation to the rejection of the Third Extension Request, Claimants assert that MINEM lacked good faith by reversing its prior interpretation of the RER Contract, and specifically for the first time adopting the position that: (i) Second Claimant had assumed all risks concerning the Project, including the unforeseeable and unquantifiable risk that its counterparty would breach the RER Contract and interfere with the Project; (ii) the RER Contract could not be extended for any reason, even if the delays to the Project were exclusively caused by government agencies; and (iii) the suspensions under Addenda 3 to 6 were not actually suspensions and the 17-month suspension period should count entirely against Second Claimant.989 Claimants additionally assert that the rejection of the Third Extension Request was arbitrary, unreasonable and not based on proper application of Peruvian law.990\n\nMemorial \u00b6 478; Reply \u00b6 858.\n\nReply \u00b6 858.\n\n898.\n\nFor Claimants, this reversal was due to regulatory opportunism, as MINEM believed it was less costly to let the RER projects fail than to pick a fight with the more substantial natural gas industry players.991 In Claimants' view, the rejection of the Third Extension Request made Second Claimant's performance under the RER Contract impossible.992\n\nMemorial \u00b6 478; Reply \u00b6 860; C-PHB \u00b6 12.\n\nReply \u00b6 861.\n\n899.\n\nRespondent denies that it violated the principle of good faith by rejecting the Third Extension Request. In its view, it acted within the limits expressly imposed by the RER Regulations, the *Bases Consolidadas*, the RER Contract, and equal competition between bidders in the Third Auction.993\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 983; Rejoinder \u00b6 1093.\n\n900.\n\nRespondent further contends that it does not argue that Second Claimant assumed the risk that MINEM would breach the RER Contract. Respondent characterises its arguments as being that: (i) MINEM did not breach its obligations under the RER Contract; (ii) MINEM did not contractually oblige other organs or instrumentalities of the State, which would be legally impossible; and (iii) none of the actions of State entities were in bad faith.994\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1094.\n\n901.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that MINEM did not breach the RER Contract by denying the Third Extension Request (see \u00b6 843 above). Those conclusions are also relevant to the allegation that MINEM acted in breach of the principle of good faith under Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code. Among other things, the Tribunal found that neither the RER Contract nor Peruvian law provide an entitlement to an extension of the Actual COS or the Termination Date of the Contract or an obligation on Respondent to grant one. To the contrary, such an extension would have been inconsistent with the terms of the RER Contract and binding provisions of the RER Regulations (see \u00b6 843 above).\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that in Addendum 2: (i) MINEM had not accepted the movability of the Termination Date of the RER Contract in light of Article 1.13B of the RER Regulations (see \u00b6 818 above);995 and (ii) the extension was granted on the basis that MINEM as counterparty had directly caused the delay in question, and not that an extension should be granted for delay caused by any government authority (see \u00b6 817 above). The denial of the Third Extension Request was not inconsistent with these prior positions taken by MINEM.\n\n**C-009**, Addendum 2 to the RER Contract, 3 January 2017, p. 10.\n\n903.\n\nContrary to Claimants' understanding of Addenda 3 to 6, the Tribunal has already found that these Addenda 3 to 6: (i) do not support an alleged obligation to grant the Third Extension Request; (ii) do not themselves modify the Actual COS, nor do they contain any explicit right to the extension of time sought; and (iii) do not refer to a right to compensation for the 17-month period of suspension (see \u00b6\u00b6 856-863 above).\n\n904.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal does acknowledge the difficulty posed by MINEM's conduct in entering into Addenda 1 and especially Addenda 2, and subsequently disavowing those Addenda, as a matter of good faith and consistency in interpretation of the RER Contract (see \u00b6 823 above). This relates, in particular, to the extension granted in Addendum 2 and the views expressed by MINEM in the Sosa Report and the Ministerial Resolutions accompanying Addenda 1 and 2 mentioned at \u00b6 815 above, i.e.: (i) the extension by Addendum 2 of the Actual COS to a date falling more than two years beyond the Reference COS; (ii) the meaning of \"for any reason\" in Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract; and (iii) the indication in the Ministerial Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM that the Actual COS \"does not constitute an essential term.\"\n\n905.\n\nUnder different circumstances, the Tribunal would agree with Claimants regarding the agreements reached in Addenda 1 and 2. However, these matters do not render Respondent's conduct a breach of good faith under Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code. The denial of the Third Extension Request was loyal to and consistent with a binding legal regime, which the Tribunal is not at liberty to disregard, and which is equally relevant to assessing the good faith of Respondent's actions (see \u00b6 843 above). The denial was therefore not in breach Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code. It has not been established that MINEM acted in bad faith with the intention to destroy the Project, or that MINEM sought to discriminate against the Mamacocha Project or favour the interests of other players in the energy industry. The Tribunal finds Claimants' allegations to that effect to be speculative and unsubstantiated.\n\n906.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's claim that Respondent breached the obligation of good faith under Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code with respect to the denial of the Third Extension Request. In denying the Third Extension Request, MINEM did not fail to act with diligence, honesty, prudence or responsibility.\n\n**(5) The Initiation of the Lima Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n907.\n\nClaimants submit that by commencing the Lima Arbitration only four days before denying the Third Extension Request, Respondent evidenced procedural bad faith for bringing a claim to a tribunal without jurisdiction, and a reversal of its prior legal position on granting extensions to compensate for its own delays.996 In Claimants' view, the Lima Arbitration was a \"unilateral, unauthorized, and surreptitious attempt to circumvent the Parties' dispute resolution agreement.\"997 According to Claimants, the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration found that MINEM's position was \"nonsensical\" and lacked good faith.998\n\nMemorial \u00b6 477; Reply \u00b6 863.\n\nReply \u00b6 862.\n\nReply \u00b6 864; *citing* **C-245**, *MINEM v.

The fact that Respondent has not tested its claims in the present arbitration further supports the inference, in Claimants' view, that the Lima Arbitration claims were filed without good faith.999\n\nReply \u00b6 865.\n\n909.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants rely on the agreement between Claimants and the Special Commission in force at the time that MINEM filed the Lima Arbitration which extended the negotiation period between the Parties in the context of Claimants' request under the TPA.1000 This agreement provides, *inter alia*, that the parties pledge \"to make their best efforts to find a solution to the Controversy within this extended period\" and agree to \"maintain the coordination that is necessary for any act or action that they adopt or carry out in order to solve the Dispute.\"1001\n\nReply \u00b6 253; *citing* **C-062**, Direct Negotiations Term Extension Agreement between R.

Claimants also failed to establish that Respondent's interpretation of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract was merely an abusive forum shopping exercise as a means of avoiding having this dispute heard before an ICSID tribunal (see \u00b6 883 above).\n\n913.\n\nWith respect to the alleged reversal of Respondent's position on granting extensions under the RER Contract, the Tribunal refers to its reasoning in relation to the rejection of the Third Extension Request at \u00b6 823 above.\n\n914.\n\nClaimants further refer to the fact that the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration unanimously dismissed the Lima Arbitration for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In doing so, Claimants submit that the tribunal found that MINEM's interpretation of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract was not in good faith. Claimants rely on the tribunal's reasoning as follows:1007\n\nIn this case, the good faith principle contains the Parties' implied obligation to make their best efforts to define and abide by the economic value of the dispute when determining the agreed-upon forum for the resolution of that dispute. In this regard, determining the amount correlatively requires submitting, along with the complaint, such documents or expert reports as will establish the amount of the disputed matter such that the Arbitral Tribunal may determine its jurisdiction.\n\nThe assessment of the value of the disputed matter cannot be left up to the mere will or procedural strategy of one Party alone; rather, it is a reciprocal contractual obligation of the Parties. A contrary argument would mean leaving up to a party's discretion the determination of a forum which could potentially be more favorable to it for the resolution of the dispute, based on whether the Party quantifies the claim and how much it has framed its claims.\n\nReply \u00b6 226, *quoting* **C-245**, *MINEM v.

Translation by Claimants.\n\n915.\n\nIt is clear that the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration declared that it lacked jurisdiction over MINEM's claims. In reaching its conclusion, the tribunal rejected MINEM's proposed interpretation of the RER Contract and MINEM's position regarding the quantification of MINEM's claims.1008 The Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration went so far as to make a finding that MINEM had acted contrary to good faith or even that MINEM's proposed interpretation of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract was not in good faith, as Claimants assert. In the passage extracted at \u00b6 914 above, the tribunal in the Lima Arbitration was carrying out its good faith interpretation of Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract, after having considered a literal and functional interpretation.1009 It makes no express finding regarding MINEM's conduct in that passage. Likewise, the dismissal of MINEM's proposal regarding the potential compartmentalisation of the Parties' disputes as \"nonsensical\" and contrary to procedural efficiency,1010 is not a finding of lack of good faith by MINEM.\n\n*See* **C-245**, *MINEM v. CH Mamacocha S.R.L.*, Arbitration Case No. 0669-2018-CCL, Award on Jurisdiction, 24 December 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 124-126, 138.\n\n**C-245**, *MINEM v.

While it would have been courteous to inform Claimants of the claim to be filed, the Tribunal does not consider the obligation of good faith, or any specific provision of the agreement between Claimants and the Special Commission in force at the time, to require Respondent to give Claimants advance warning of the filing of those claims.\n\n917.\n\nFor the above reasons, the initiation of the Lima Arbitration was not a failure to act in good faith as required by Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code. By initiating the Lima Arbitration, MINEM did not fail to act with diligence, honesty, prudence or responsibility.\n\n**(6) Conclusion on Good Faith**\n--------------------------------\n\n918.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, none of Second Claimant's allegations with respect to good faith under the RER Contract are successful and the Tribunal rejects them.\n\n**H.

The Tribunal notes that Claimants' submission refers to the TUPA rather than the GLAP. Since the extract from the provision and the relevant citation of the Qui\u00f1ones First Report refer to the GLAP, the Tribunal understands that Claimants intended to refer to the GLAP.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 987.\n\n922.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly rejects Article IV, paragraph 1.8 of the GLAP as a basis for an alleged breach of the *actos propios* doctrine under the RER Contract, while accepting that such a claim may be made on the basis of Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\n**(2) The Relevant Test**\n-------------------------\n\n923.\n\nThe Parties agree that the following criteria are necessary to establish a violation of the *actos propios* doctrine: (i) a binding act; (ii) a subsequent act contradictory to that act; and (iii) the two acts have the same subject.1014\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 986; Reply \u00b6 872.\n\n924.\n\nRespondent further submits that the doctrine must not be applied automatically, because it does not apply when there is a legally valid reason legitimising the contradictory conduct.1015 Claimants acknowledge that an exception to the *actos propios* doctrine allows inconsistent positions where not doing so would be akin to validating an objectively illegal act, although they argue that it is a narrow one.1016 This is confirmed by Claimants' expert Dr. Benavides, who states that the doctrine of *actos propios* \"*no permite convalidar conductas ilegales*\" and \"*no permite convalidar actos jur\u00eddicos viciados de nulidad*.\"1017\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 986; *quoting* Lava First Report \u00b6 6.29.\n\nReply \u00b6 872.\n\nBenavides Second Report \u00b6 317.\n\n925.\n\nFor present purposes, the Tribunal finds it established that the doctrine is applicable in principle under Peruvian law between the parties to the RER Contract, subject to meeting the relevant test. The Tribunal considers the debate about whether the *actos propios* doctrine is of broad or residual application to be largely an academic one, which does not add to the criteria outlined above.1018\n\n*See* Lava First Report \u00b6\u00b6 6.27-6.28; Benavides Second Report \u00b6\u00b6 307-314.\n\n**(3) Alleged Breaches of Actos Propios**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n926.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent violated the doctrine of *actos propios* by: (i) reversing its legal position by attempting to annul its prior approval of the environmental permits in the RGA Lawsuit;1019 (ii) seeking to annul the extensions under Addenda 1 and 2 via the Lima Arbitration;1020 (iii) denying the Third Extension Request;1021 and (iv) refusing to accommodate an extension to the contract milestone schedule after agreeing to suspend the RER Contract for 17 months.1022\n\nMemorial \u00b6 482.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 483.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 484.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 485.\n\n927.\n\nRespondent argues that the conduct with respect to the RGA Lawsuit cannot constitute a breach of the RER Contract because it is an action by the RGA and not MINEM.1023 Consistent with its determination at \u00b6\u00b6 892-893 above, the Tribunal agrees and rejects this aspect of Claimants' claim.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 990.\n\n928.\n\nIn relation to the Lima Arbitration, Respondent submits that Addendum 1 was granted on the basis of Second Claimant's misleading and erroneous request, while the extension under Addendum 2 was granted in error contrary to the RER Regulations, the *Bases Consolidadas* and the RER Contract. For Respondent, the Lima Arbitration was initiated in accordance with MINEM's rights under the RER Contract to correct the nullity of Addendum 2. In its view, this constitutes a legally valid reason to take this action and does not violate the doctrine of *actos propios*.1024\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 995.\n\n929.\n\nClaimants disagree, arguing that it has not been proven that the extension in Addendum 1 was wrongly granted, taking into account the lengthy independent analysis undertaken by MINEM at the time.1025 Likewise, Claimants submit that Addendum 2 was also correct and consistent with the Sosa Report and Echecopar Reports.1026\n\nReply \u00b6 882.\n\nReply \u00b6 883; *citing* **C-012**, MINEM Report No. 166-2016-EM-DGE to Carla Sosa, Director General of Electricity, 6 October 2016; **C-235**, First Legal Report by M.

The Tribunal further determined at \u00b6 917 above that the initiation of the Lima Arbitration was not a failure to act in good faith as required by Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\n931.\n\nSpecifically, in respect of *actos propios*, the Tribunal considers that the doctrine does not apply to the initiation of the Lima Arbitration because a legally valid reason existed for the contradictory act. As noted at \u00b6 904 above, even though it did not breach the obligation of good faith under Peruvian law, MINEM's conduct in entering into Addendum 1 and especially Addendum 2, and subsequently disavowing those Addenda, poses difficulty as a matter of good faith and consistency in interpretation of the RER Contract (see \u00b6 823 above). However, there was a valid reason to pursue the arbitration on the basis that MINEM believed Addendum 2 to be issued contrary to the mandatory provisions of the RER Regulations, the *Bases Consolidadas* and the RER Contract. In this regard, the doctrine of *actos propios* does not apply when the original legal act is \"*nulo[] de pleno derecho, incapa[z] de ser convalidado[] o subsanado[] por actividades de los sujetos intervinientes*.\"1027\n\nLava First Report \u00b6 6.30; *quoting* **CLC-063,** Castillo Freyre, Mario, Sabroso Minaya, Rita, *La Teor\u00eda de los Actos Propios y la Nulidad: \u00bfRegla o Principio de Derecho?*, Lima-Per\u00fa (2008).\n\n932.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it established that Second Claimant's request that led to Addendum 1 was misleading or erroneous. To the extent that there was not a basis under the mandatory provisions of the RER Regulations to challenge Addendum 1, the Tribunal considers this to be an error without legal consequence, as the Lima Arbitration never proceeded beyond the jurisdiction phase. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider *actos propios* to be relevant.\n\n933.\n\nItems (iii) and (iv) at \u00b6 926 above relate to the denial of the Third Extension Request. For Claimants, these actions reversed years of consistent application of the RER Contract and Peruvian law toward the Project.1028 Respondent denies that this conduct breached the *actos propios* doctrine, on the basis that it had no obligation to accept the Third Extension Request and could not accept it, since it was contrary to the RER Regulations, the *Bases Consolidadas* and the RER Contract.1029\n\nReply \u00b6 886.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 996.\n\n934.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal's prior determinations in relation to the Third Extension Request (see, *inter alia,* \u00b6\u00b6 843, 863 above) that there was no breach of the *actos propios* doctrine in respect of the denial of the Third Extension Request. The fact that the Third Extension Request could not be granted under the terms of the RER Contract, the RER Regulations and the *Bases Consolidadas* means that Respondent had a legally valid reason for rejecting the request. The Tribunal therefore rejects this aspect of Claimants' claim.\n\n935.\n\nWith respect to the alleged refusal to \"credit\" the suspension granted under Addenda 3 to 6,1030 the Tribunal finds no inconsistent act for the purposes of the *actos propios* doctrine. As found at \u00b6 856 above, Addenda 3 to 6 paused performance of the RER Contract, and in particular the upcoming deadlines in the Works Execution Schedule, but did not modify the Actual COS, nor did they contain any explicit right to the extension of time sought under the Third Extension Request. The Addenda were executed for the purpose of allowing negotiations to progress, and only suspended performance of the RER Contract for a specified period (see \u00b6 862 above). There is therefore no inconsistency between the suspension granted under Addenda 3 to 6 and the rejection of the Third Extension Request.\n\nReply \u00b6 886.\n\n***I.*** **A lleged B reach of the P rinciple of** ***C** **onfianza**  **L** **eg\u00edtima***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Applicability**\n---------------------\n\n936.\n\nClaimants claim that Respondent violated the principle of *confianza leg\u00edtima*, or legitimate expectations, enshrined in paragraph 1.15 of Article IV of the Preliminary Title of the GLAP.1031 This provision is as follows:1032\n\nPrinciple of predictability or legitimate trust.

Relying on the opinion of Mr. Monteza, Respondent submits that as the RER Contract is an administrative contract, the rules of the GLAP only apply in a supplementary manner.1033 For Respondent, the principle of *confianza leg\u00edtima* applies to the acts of the administration within an administrative procedure which has the purpose of issuing administrative acts. As such, in its view, the GLAP applies in the pre-contractual stage only, and not generally to contractual performance.1034\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1001; *quoting* Monteza First Report \u00b6 220.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1002; *quoting* Monteza First Report \u00b6 258(ii).\n\n938.\n\nConsistent with its observations in relation to good faith at \u00b6 889 above, the Tribunal finds that the concept of *confianza leg\u00edtima* under the GLAP is not directly applicable to the contractual relationship between MINEM and Second Claimant under the RER Contract. This is reflected in the language of paragraph 1.15 of Article IV of the Preliminary Title of the GLAP, which refers to \"each proceeding under [the] responsibility\" of an administrative authority.1035 The RER Contract is not an administrative procedure, but a contract which sets out the rights and responsibilities of each party. As an administrative contract, it is governed by binding provisions of law set out in legislation such as the RER Law and RER Regulations. The GLAP may apply to certain activities relevant to Second Claimant's interactions with the Peruvian authorities in the context of the Mamacocha Project, and in particular in the precontractual stage, as pointed out by Respondent. This does not render it applicable to the performance of the RER Contract.\n\n**MQ-002**, *Ley No. 27444, Ley del Procedimiento Administrativo General*, 1 October 2008, Art. IV, \u00b6 1.15.

As already highlighted at \u00b6 889 above, while the RER Contract is an administrative contract, that does not mean that the performance of the RER Contract constitutes an administrative procedure or act within the meaning of the GLAP. When making the Third Extension Request, Claimants were not initiating an administrative procedure but a contractual one. MINEM's handling of the Third Extension Request was likewise not an administrative procedure or act but a contractual one. The Third Extension Request is therefore to be handled in accordance with the provisions of the RER Contract. The Tribunal finds no basis to import time limits from the GLAP into a contractual request.\n\n950.\n\nThe TUPA is likewise a regulation in the context of administrative proceedings, governing the length of time within which an agency can review a permit or concession application.1049 The Tribunal understands that Claimants' argument based on the TUPA review periods is also linked to the GLAP.1050 For the same reasons as those applying to the GLAP, the Tribunal finds that the TUPA does not apply directly to the contractual relationship under the RER Contract, and its deadlines are not enforceable under the RER Contract.\n\n*See* Memorial, p. vii.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 490, 495, 498; *citing* Qui\u00f1ones First Report \u00b6 107; Reply \u00b6 911; *citing* **CL-209**, *Decreto Supremo No. 001-2010-AG, Aprueban Reglamento de la Ley No. 29338, Ley de Recursos H\u00eddricos*, 23 March 2010. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 74.\n\n951.\n\nIn relation to the alleged failure of the AAA to issue the CWA in a timely manner, this was not a contractual request and the timeliness or otherwise of AAA's handling of the request is not a matter falling under the scope of the RER Contract. As determined at \u00b6\u00b6 892 and 895above, it has not been established that the AAA was assigned a role or obligations in the RER Contract.\n\n952.\n\nMoreover, as highlighted by Respondent,1051 an importation of time limits from Peruvian administrative law for the purposes of the CWA would be inconsistent with Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract (see \u00b6 654 above), pursuant to which MINEM was obliged to \"*coadyuvar*\" with obtaining necessary permits in the specific circumstances set out therein, one requirement being that the competent government authority had not granted a relevant permit in a \"timely\" manner (\"*en el tiempo debido*\"). Clause 4.3 clearly sets out MINEM's foreseen role in relation to obtaining the permits necessary for the RER Contract.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1147-1148.\n\n953.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses Second Claimant's claim for alleged breach of timeliness obligations under Peruvian administrative law with respect to both the Third Extension Request and the issuance of the CWA, on the basis that the alleged obligations do not fall under the RER Contract.\n\n**K.

In that case, Second Claimant would be immediately and permanently freed from its contractual obligations to develop, construct, and operate the Mamacocha Project.1056\n\nMemorial \u00b6 500; Reply \u00b6 915.\n\n960.\n\nRespondent relies on its expert Mr. Lava to submit that an alleged impossibility under Article 1432 of the Peruvian Civil Code must be absolute, in the sense that the impediment cannot be overcome by human strength, regardless of the effort applied.1057 For Respondent, it is a very high standard and entails more than mere difficulty in compliance.1058\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1052; *quoting* Lava First Report \u00b6 7.8; **CLC-087**, Osterling Parodi, Felipe, Rebaza Gonz\u00e1lez, Alfonso, \"*La Equidad y su funci\u00f3n cuantificadora de los da\u00f1os de imposible probanza, a prop\u00f3sito del art\u00edculo 1332\u00ba del C\u00f3digo Civil Peruano*\", *Incumplimiento Contractual.

An impossibility within the second paragraph of Article 1432 exists when the situation preventing performance is caused by the creditor (i.e., the State of Peru) and the debtor (i.e., Second Claimant) cannot avoid or overcome the outcome in question. An \"impossibility\" is by nature a high standard, which is not met in circumstances where performance merely becomes more difficult.\n\n**(3) Application of Article 1432**\n-----------------------------------\n\n964.\n\nIn Claimants' view, the RGA Lawsuit, the criminal proceeding, the AAA delays, the Lima Arbitration and the denial of the Third Extension Request all led to the impossibility of performing the RER Contract.1062 According to Claimants, they are entitled to the full consideration they would have received had Respondent not made it impossible, including the 20 years of \"Guaranteed Revenue.\"1063\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 502-503; Reply \u00b6 915.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 501, 505; Reply \u00b6 915.\n\n965.\n\nRespondent opposes Claimants' arguments on the basis that: (i) the denial of the Third Extension Request on 31 December 2018 did not cause the impossibility of meeting the Actual COS under Addendum 2 (i.e., 14 March 2020), since construction had not begun and no milestones had been met in the Works Execution Schedule by that date;1064 (ii) the RGA Public Prosecutor, AEP and the AAA are not parties to the RER Contract, and their measures did not prevent Second Claimant from complying with the RER Contract;1065 (iii) the absence of financing does not constitute impossibility;1066 and (iv) the commencement of the Lima Arbitration did not prevent Second Claimant from achieving the Actual COS or make the performance of its obligations impossible, since Addendum 2 remained valid until declared null and void.1067\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1054.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1056-1061.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1063.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1064.\n\n966.\n\nIn line with its determination at \u00b6 892 above, neither the RGA, the RGA Public Prosecutor, the AEP nor the AAA, or other authorities and instrumentalities implicated in the circumstances invoked by Claimants, were assigned a role or obligations in the RER Contract. As such, their conduct does not enliven the second paragraph of Article 1432 of the Peruvian Civil Code. Actions or omissions by these authorities are not conduct of a creditor within the meaning of that provision for purposes of the RER Contract.\n\n967.\n\nWith respect to the denial of the Third Extension Request, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this action by MINEM rendered it impossible for Second Claimant to perform the RER Contract. According to Claimants, the denial left 15 months to complete the Works Execution Schedule, while construction alone was projected to take approximately 26 months.1068 However, the fact that construction had not already commenced at the time the Third Extension Request was denied obviously played a large role in determining the feasibility of meeting the Actual COS in that timeline. Claimants have not established that they could not move forward with the Project while the Third Extension Request was pending for reasons attributable to MINEM.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 503; Reply \u00b6 915. *See also* Claimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1951:11-1954:2 in response to Tribunal Question 11: \"What is Claimants' response to Respondent's argument that Claimants could not have completed construction by Actual COS or COS under Addendum 2?\"\n\n968.\n\nIn seeking to assign responsibility for the delays exclusively to MINEM, Claimants conflate the \"measures\" which they submit \"made it impossible for CHM to advance the Project,\" referring to the events cited at \u00b6 964 collectively. It is these \"measures\" which in their view resulted in the suspension of the RER Contract under Addenda 3 to 6 and Claimants' inability to achieve Financial Closing.1069\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 919-920.\n\n969.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this characterisation of the course of events to be unpersuasive, and revealing of the fact that the denial of the Third Extension Request was not the determining factor in whether Second Claimant was able to perform the RER Contract. As already mentioned, the RGA Lawsuit, the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings, and the AAA issues were not conduct by MINEM at all. The Tribunal must apply Article 1432 of the Peruvian Civil Code in accordance with its terms, which specify that the impossibility is caused by the creditor.\n\n970.\n\nClaimants further submit that Second Claimant could not achieve Financial Closing as a result of the measures which \"would have prevented any rational financial institution, investor, and sponsor from financing the Project.\"1070 However, under the RER Contract it was Second Claimant's responsibility to obtain financing necessary to perform the Mamacocha Project.1071 To the extent that Claimants' inability to move forward with the Project was due to a failure to secure financing, this falls within the sphere of responsibility of Second Claimant under the RER Contract. Moreover, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the absence of financial means to perform an obligation qualifies as an \"impossibility\" under Article 1432 of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\nReply \u00b6 920.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 3.3: \"The Concessionaire Company shall\u2026provide the financing and supply the goods and services required to build, operate and maintain the power generation plant\u2026\"\n\n971.\n\nElsewhere in their submissions Claimants deny that they were solely responsible for the risk of financing the Project. They argue that Second Claimant did not assume the risk that the government of Peru would interfere with Second Claimant's efforts to obtain financing.1072 Claimants further assert that Second Claimant's financing obligations must be interpreted in accordance with the applicable laws, including the Peruvian Civil Code, GLAP and Political Constitution.1073 For Claimants, the \"normal commercial allocation of risks\" for a large-scale energy or infrastructure project is that the developer may take on the obligation to attract financing, but must rely upon the credibility of the government to uphold the rule of law and make the required payments under the contract.1074\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 757, 761, 762.\n\nReply \u00b6 757.\n\nReply \u00b6 758.\n\n972.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that MINEM may be obliged not to interfere with Second Claimant's efforts to obtain financing. This does not translate, however, to an obligation on the entire Peruvian government and every individual agency and instrumentality thereof. The plain wording of Clause 3.3 of the RER Contract places responsibility on Second Claimant to \"provide the financing and supply the goods and services required to build, operate and maintain the power generation plant\u2026\"1075\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 3.3.\n\n973.\n\nAs for as the alleged inconsistency with good faith because MINEM Resolution No. 320-2015-MEM/DM had stated that \"delays in the administrative procedures made it impossible to achieve Financial Closing for the project,\"1076 the Tribunal does not find such a statement in a Resolution to alter its decision, in light of the considerations above.\n\nReply \u00b6 759; *quoting* **C-008**, Addendum No. 1 to the RER Contract, 22 July 2015, p. 8.\n\n974.\n\nClaimants have also failed to establish that the initiation of the Lima Arbitration rendered it impossible for Second Claimant to perform the RER Contract. Claimants assert that \"[Second Claimant] could not have performed while, its counterparty, Peru was actively seeking to terminate the RER Contract.\"1077 However, Respondent was unsuccessful in its attempt to annul Addenda 1 and 2 by way of the Lima Arbitration. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the mere commencement of that arbitration meets the high threshold of an \"impossibility\" preventing Second Claimant from performing the RER Contract while it was ongoing. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent in this respect1078 that the decision not to proceed during the Lima Arbitration falls into the sphere of Claimants' business decisions.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 504.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1064.\n\n975.\n\nWhile the denial of the Third Extension Request and the Lima Arbitration may have created additional challenges for Second Claimant to perform the RER Contract, it did not render such performance impossible. Importantly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that in the absence of MINEM's rejection of the Third Extension Request and the initiation of the Lima Arbitration, Second Claimant would have been in a position to timely perform the RER Contract. The Tribunal refers to its reasoning at \u00b6 967 above, to the effect that the fact that construction had not already commenced at the time the Third Extension Request was denied obviously played a large role in determining the feasibility of meeting the Actual COS.\n\n976.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects Second Claimant's claim under Article 1432 of the Peruvian Civil Code and declines to declare that the RER Contract was terminated as a result of an impossibility created by Respondent.\n\n**L.

However, this does not exclude that the RER Contract may have terminated on the same date for other reasons.\n\n978.\n\nRespondent submits that the RER Contract terminated as a matter of law on 31 December 2018 because Second Claimant failed to achieve COS by the Actual COS deadline.1079 As a consequence, Respondent asserts that it is entitled to execute the Performance Bond upon termination of this arbitration, in accordance with Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract and subject to the Tribunal's decision in this arbitration.1080\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1164.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 473; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1164, 1211.\n\n979.\n\nClaimants contest Respondent's submission that the RER Contract can be terminated and the Performance Bond taken regardless of whether the RER concessionaire did anything wrong.1081\n\nReply \u00b6 36.\n\n980.\n\nIn line with the Tribunal's analysis in Section VIII.DD(2) above, and taking into account its conclusions reached in relation to the various other matters raised in relation to the RER Contract, the Tribunal confirms that the RER Contract terminated automatically (\"*de pleno derecho*\") on 31 December 2018 when Second Claimant failed to achieve the Actual COS. The question that follows from this determination is the consequences for the Performance Bond in favour of MINEM. Under Clauses 1.4.25 and 8 of the RER Contract, this bond had the purpose of guaranteeing the fulfilment of the Works Execution Schedule.1082\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.25.\n\n981.\n\nIn their most recent request for relief in the Reply, Claimants request that the Tribunal (see \u00b6 236 above):1083\n\nORDER that Peru may not call or collect any bond put up by either Claimant in relation to the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects, including the US$ 5 million bond under the RER Contract and the US$ 71,500 bond that CHM put up to obtain the final concession for the transmission line.\n\nReply \u00b6 1045(i).\n\n982.\n\nIn their Memorial, Claimants additionally request that the Tribunal (see \u00b6 235 above):1084\n\nDECLARE that all bonds put up by either Claimant as part of the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects be returned to CHM, including the US $5 million performance bond under the RER Contract[\u2026]\n\nMemorial \u00b6 547(d).\n\n983.\n\nWhile the same declaration is not sought in the prayers for relief section of Claimants' Reply, the request is repeated at \u00b6 25 of the Reply which contains a summary of Claimants' requests for relief as follows:1085\n\n\u2026 Claimants seek the following relief: \u2026 (ii) return of the US $5 million performance bond under the RER Contract and the US $71,500 performance bond for the transmission line[\u2026]\n\nReply \u00b6 25.\n\n984.\n\nClaimants make further reference to this request in their submissions on quantum in the Reply, arguing that \"neither Peru nor Versant have stated that Peru does not expect to execute the Performance Bonds when this arbitration is concluded, unless the Tribunal issues the Declaratory Relief requested by Claimants requiring MINEM to release the bond to Claimants.\"1086 In these circumstances, in the absence of any indication that Claimants have abandoned or withdrawn the request for return of the Performance Bond, the Tribunal understands that its omission from the request for relief section of the Reply (at \u00b6 1045 thereof) is an oversight and that the request for relief that Respondent must return the Performance Bond to Second Claimant is maintained.1087\n\nReply \u00b6 1004.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 547(d).\n\n985.\n\nThe Tribunal notes with respect to the USD 71,500 bond that Second Claimant put up to obtain the final concession for the transmission line that Claimants have not established that this bond was required by the RER Contract. According to Claimants, this bond is associated with the transmission line from the Mamacocha Project to the Chipmo substation.1088 Respondent objects that this Performance Bond is governed by the terms of the Final Concession Contract for the Transmission Line, the interpretation of which is beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction.1089\n\nReply \u00b6 999, fn 1563. *See* BRG First Report, \u00b6 134; *citing* **BRG-065**, *Carta Fianza No 623742 de Banco de Cr\u00e9dito de Per\u00fa*, 8 May 2015.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1212; Rejoinder \u00b6 1383.\n\n986.\n\nFor present purposes, the Tribunal is considering Claimants' claims covered by the RER Contract only. The Tribunal does not consider it established that it has jurisdiction over the bond for the transmission line as a matter of the RER Contract, and upholds Respondent's objection with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over that bond. Accordingly, the Tribunal excludes the performance bond for the transmission line from the present analysis under the RER Contract. The Tribunal reserves the question of whether First Claimant's claims made under the TPA may provide a basis for the order sought in relation to the bond for the transmission line, to be addressed at \u00b6 1280 below. The present analysis concerns the USD 5 million Performance Bond issued under the RER Contract only.1090\n\n**BRG-063**, Letter of Credit from Wells Fargo to *Banco de Cr\u00e9dito de* Per\u00fa, 11 February 2014; **BRG-064**, *Carta Fianza No. G706797 de Banco de Cr\u00e9dito de Per\u00fa*, 12 February 2014; **BRG-074**, Private Banking Market Rate Savings, Account Number 3243881079, Statements from December 2014 and July 2020.\n\n987.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal excludes from consideration any performance bond in relation to the Upstream Projects. While Claimants make reference in their request for relief to \"any bond put up by either Claimant in relation to the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects\" (see \u00b6 235(i) above), they have not substantiated the existence of a performance bond in relation to the Upstream Projects or a basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction over such a bond under the RER Contract.\n\n988.\n\nWhile Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract mentions that \"the Performance Bond shall be enforced\" in circumstances of termination under that provision, a careful reading of the clause reveals that the execution of the Performance Bond is not automatic upon termination of the RER Contract. The termination of the agreement \"automatically\" (\"*de pleno derecho*\") occurs when \"for any reason, Commercial Operation Start-up of the RER Generation Project\u2026has not taken place by December 31, 2018.\"1091 However, the \"any reason\" does not naturally apply to the final part of the sentence: \"and the Performance Bond shall be enforced\" (see \u00b6 733 above). In this sense, the termination of the RER Contract is automatic in the circumstances provided for in Clause 8.4 but the execution of the Performance Bond is not.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 8.4.\n\n989.\n\nThe same result is clear from Article 1.2.31 of the *Bases Consolidadas* (\"*caso contrario el Contrato quedar\u00e1 autom\u00e1ticamente resuelto y se ejecutar\u00e1 la Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento*\").1092\n\n**R-001**, *Bases Consolidadas para la Subasta de Suministro de Electricidad con Recursos Energ\u00e9ticos Renovables*, September 2013, Art. 1.2.31.\n\n990.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to assume that MINEM is entitled to recover the Performance Bond in the absence of fault by Second Claimant in the performance of the RER Contract. Should the parties to the RER Contract have intended that consequence, it must be reflected in clear language to that effect. The Tribunal has made no finding, and does not consider, that the termination of the RER Contract occurred due to fault on the part of Second Claimant. The termination of the RER Contract took effect automatically upon fulfilment of the condition in Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Second Claimant is entitled to the declarations sought for return of the USD 5 million Performance Bond under the RER Contract, and preventing MINEM from calling upon or collecting it.\n\n991.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that while Respondent objects that the Performance Bond was paid by Mr. Jacobson and Mr. Bengier in their personal capacities rather than by First or Second Claimant, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Performance Bond was paid pursuant to Clause 1.4.25 of the RER Contract \"for the purpose of guaranteeing compliance with the Works Execution Schedule by [Second Claimant].\"1093 Claimants have further provided evidence that in the event of the release of the Performance Bond, it would have been contributed to First Claimant as additional capital contribution. This is recorded in First Claimant's Amended and Restated Operating Agreement as follows:1094\n\nThe original Operating Agreement provided that the two Members would each be credited with $2.5 million that was used to collateralize the standby letters of credit required by OSINERGMIN for a completion bond associated with HLA's [i.e., Second Claimant's] power purchase agreement. It further provided that when the collateralization was reduced or eliminated (whether pursuant to the terms of the OSINERGMIN bond or to a take out by a third party), the amounts released would be contributed to the Company [i.e., First Claimant]. These provisions continue in effect, provided that any amount contributed to the Company pursuant to this provisions [*sic*] are treated as \"Future Capital Contributions,\" and any amount contributed as \"Future Capital Contributions\" serves to reduce the amount that needs to be contributed upon reduction of collateralization.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 1.4.25.\n\n**BRG-101**, LATAM Hydro LLC Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, dated 31 December 2015, p. 24.\n\n992.\n\nWhile not binding on this Tribunal, and on the basis of a different reasoning applicable in the specific circumstances of each case, the Tribunal observes that in the *Electro Za\u00f1a*, *Santa Lorenza,* and *Sur Medio* cases the respective arbitral tribunals all likewise concluded that termination of the RER contract did not automatically entitle MINEM to the execution of the performance bond.1095\n\n**CLC-102**, *Electro Za\u00f1a S.A.C. c. Republica del Per\u00fa*, Caso Arbitral No. 0677-2018-CLL, Laudo, 21 December 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 345-349; **RL-098**, *Santa Lorenza* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 242-243; **CLC-103**, *Concesionaria Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Sur Medio S.A. c. Republica del Per\u00fa*, Caso Arbitral No. 0330-2019-CLL, Laudo, 31 May 2021, \u00b6\u00b6 388-394.\n\n**M. C onclusion on L iability under the RER C ontract**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n993.\n\nIn the above Sections, the Tribunal has reached a number of determinations with respect to the Parties' dispute, including:\n\n(i) Respondent did not breach Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37 or 6.3 of the RER Contract with respect to Guaranteed Revenue under the RER Contract (see \u00b6 843 above);\n\n(ii) Respondent did not breach Clause 2.2.1 of the RER Contract in relation to the authorisation of MINEM to act under the Contract (see \u00b6 875 above);\n\n(iii) Respondent did not breach Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract regarding the obligation to \"*coadyuvar*\" in relation to Second Claimant's permits (see \u00b6 705 above);\n\n(iv) Respondent did not breach Clause 11.3 of the RER Contract in relation to the dispute resolution provision (see \u00b6 884 above);\n\n(v) Respondent did not breach Addenda 3 to 6 of the RER Contract in relation to suspensions granted therein (see \u00b6 866 above);\n\n(vi) Respondent did not breach the Peruvian law doctrines of good faith, *actos propios*, and *confianza leg\u00edtima* (see \u00b6\u00b6 918, 934 and 939 above);\n\n(vii) The GLAP and the TUPA do not directly govern the contractual relationship under the RER Contract and any time periods specified therein are not enforceable as a matter of the RER Contract (see \u00b6\u00b6 889, 921, 938, 949, 950 above).\n\n994.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects Claimants' request for a declaration in respect of the matters set out in \u00b6 993 above.\n\n995.\n\nThe Tribunal has found at \u00b6 980 above that the RER Contract is terminated, although not on the basis that Claimants had argued. The Tribunal therefore grants Claimants' request for a declaration to that effect (see \u00b6\u00b6 235(c) and 236(c) above), while declining the language \"and, with it, all of CHM's obligations and duties owed thereunder,\" which the Tribunal considers to be overly broad. This request has not been demonstrated to be justified with respect to every obligation and duty of Second Claimant under the RER Contract.\n\n996.\n\nBased on the Tribunal's determination in relation to the Performance Bond (see \u00b6\u00b6 986, 987, 990 above), the Tribunal further partially grants the declarations sought by Claimants in relation to that Bond (see \u00b6\u00b6 235(d), 235(j) and 236(i) above). Specifically, the orders that (i) the USD 5 million Performance Bond under the RER Contract is to be returned to Second Claimant; and (ii) Respondent may not call or collect the Performance Bond under the RER Contract are granted. The part of the order sought in respect of any bond put up for the Upstream Projects or the final concession for the transmission line is rejected, for the reasons stated at \u00b6\u00b6 986-987.\n\n997.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal partially grants the orders sought by Claimants as per \u00b6\u00b6 995-997 above, and rejects the remainder of Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract against Respondent. None of the Tribunal's findings entail a breach of the RER Contract by Respondent.\n\n998.\n\nBecause the Tribunal rejects Second Claimant's claims that Respondent has breached the RER Contract, it follows that First Claimant's claims on behalf of Second Claimant under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C) for Peru's alleged breaches of an investment agreement are also rejected.1096\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 188; Reply \u00b6 314.\n\n999.\n\nThere being no breach of the RER Contract by Respondent, it is unnecessary to address the scope of any damages with respect to the Mamacocha Project or the Upstream Projects.\n\n1000.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that it is not necessary to receive an update from Claimants in relation to the calculation of their damages claim. Claimants had requested the opportunity to provide such an update in the event that they would prevail on any of their claims (see \u00b6 67 above). The Tribunal considers this request to be moot.\n\n**IX.  ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE TPA**\n------------------------------------\n\n1001.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal addresses First Claimant's claims under the TPA, which includes claims made on behalf of Second Claimant.\n\n1002.\n\nUnder the TPA, First Claimant claims that Respondent has: (i) breached the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") under TPA Article 10.5; (ii) indirectly expropriated the Mamacocha Project in violation of TPA Article 10.7; and (iii) breached the most-favoured-nation (\"**MFN**\") provision in TPA Article 10.4.1097\n\nMemorial \u00a7\u00a7 IV.B, IV.C, IV.D; Reply \u00a7\u00a7 IV.A, IV.B, IV.C.\n\n1003.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the context of the TPA claims to be decided under international law, Respondent is the Republic of Peru as a State. Peru is responsible for the acts of its government authorities and instrumentalities which are attributable to the State under international law. As such, unlike the claims made under the RER Contract, in the context of the TPA the Tribunal is not limited to considering whether any given government authority or instrumentality had a specific role or task set out in the RER Contract (see \u00b6651 above). This does not mean that the RER Contract is irrelevant to the claims made under the TPA. As will be discussed below as appropriate, the contractual relationship between Second Claimant and Respondent is an important contextual factor to certain of the claims.\n\n1004.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal will first set out the relevant provisions of the TPA (Section A). In Section B, the Tribunal will decide upon Claimants' claim for breach of the FET standard. Section C concerns the alleged expropriation of Claimants' investment. In Section D, the Tribunal will address the claim under the MFN clause. Section E concludes on liability under the TPA.\n\n**A. R elevant P rovisions**\n----------------------------\n\n1005.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention states:1098\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n**RL-092**, ICSID Convention, Art. 42(1).\n\n1006.\n\nTPA Article 10.4 is entitled \"Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment\" and provides as follows:1099\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of investors of any other Party or of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.1100\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.4.\n\nFootnote 2 to Article 10.4 states: \"For greater certainty, treatment 'with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments' referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 10.4 does not encompass dispute resolution mechanisms, such as those in Section B, that are provided for in international investment treaties or trade agreements.\"\n\n1007.\n\nTPA Article 10.5 is entitled \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\"1101 and provides:1102\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:\n\n(a) \"fair and equitable treatment\" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and\n\n(b) \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.\n\nFootnote 3 to Article 10.5 states: \"Article 10.5 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 10-A.\"\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.5.\n\n1008.\n\nTPA Article 10.7 is entitled \"Expropriation and Compensation\"1103 and provides:1104\n\n1. No party may expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\"), except:\n\n(a) for a public purpose1105;\n\n(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;\n\n(c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation; and\n\n(d) in accordance with due process of law and Article 10.5.\n\n2. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1(c) shall:\n\n(a) be paid without delay;\n\n(b) be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (\"the date of expropriation\");\n\n(c) not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier; and\n\n(d) be fully realizable and freely transferable.\n\n3. If the fair market value is denominated in a freely usable currency, the compensation referred to in paragraph 1(c) shall be no less than the fair market value on the date of expropriation, plus interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n4. If the fair market value is denominated in a currency that is not freely usable, the compensation referred to in paragraph 1(c) \u2013 converted into the currency of payment at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment \u2013 shall be no less than:\n\n(a) the fair market value on the date of expropriation, converted into a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, plus\n\n(b) interest, at a commercially reasonable rate for that freely usable currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n5. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement, or to the revocation, limitation, or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation, or creation is consistent with Chapter Sixteen (Intellectual Property Rights).\n\nFootnote 4 to Article 10.7 states: \"Article 10.7 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 10-B.\"\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.7.\n\nFootnote 5 to Article 10.7 states: \"For greater certainty, for purposes of this article, the term 'public purpose' refers to a concept in customary international law. Domestic law may express this or a similar concept using different terms, such as 'public necessity,' 'public interest,' or 'public use.'\"\n\n1009.\n\nTPA Annex 10-A is entitled \"Customary International Law,\" and provides:1106\n\nThe Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 10.5 results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Annex 10-A.\n\n1010.\n\nTPA Annex 10-B is entitled \"Expropriation,\" and provides:1107\n\nThe Parties confirm their shared understanding that:\n\n1. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.\n\n2. Article 10.7.1 addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\n3. The second situation addressed by Article 10.7.1 is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\n(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:\n\n(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;\n\n(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and\n\n(iii) the character of the government action.\n\n(b) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Annex 10-B.\n\n**B. A lleged B reach OF F air and E quitable T reatment under TPA A rticle 10.5**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1011.\n\nThe Tribunal shall use the term \"**FET**\" to describe the standard set out in TPA Article 10.5, giving further precision as to the content of that standard below, and without assuming the identity of that standard with any autonomous standard of FET. The FET standard under the TPA being the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, it may also be referred to as \"**MST**.\"\n\n1012.\n\nIn order to decide upon First Claimant's FET claim, the Tribunal will consider the applicable standard in Section (1). Section (2) summarises the United States' NDP submission and comments thereon by the Parties. Section (3) considers and decides upon the various alleged breaches of FET.\n\n**(1) Applicable Standard**\n---------------------------\n\n1013.\n\nPursuant to TPA Article 10.5.2 (see \u00b6 1007 above), it is clarified that the FET standard of treatment is \"the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens,\" and not beyond that standard. The Parties disagree on the interpretation of this standard.\n\n1014.\n\nBoth Parties further rely on TPA Annex 10-A,1108 which is entitled \"Customary International Law\" and states:\n\nThe Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 10.5 results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 269; Reply \u00b6 444; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 586.\n\n1015.\n\nFor Claimants, customary international law has evolved such that the minimum standard of treatment contains the same substantive protections as those under the autonomous fair and equitable treatment standard.1109 In their view, TPA Article 10.5 provides the following protections: (i) preserving an investor's legitimate expectations; (ii) acting with transparency; (iii) not engaging in arbitrary conduct; (iv) refraining from discriminatory conduct; and (v) acting in good faith.1110\n\nMemorial \u00b6 272; *quoting* **CL-059**, *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

It is for the Tribunal to determine the content of the law, taking into account the materials presented by the Parties to persuade the Tribunal of their respective views. In determining the content of TPA Article 10.5, the Tribunal shall have a healthy regard for previous decisions of investment arbitration tribunals as relied upon by the Parties. The Tribunal is mindful that it is not bound by such decisions, and undue fidelity to the decisions of past arbitral tribunals may lead to a situation of \"once wrong, always wrong.\"\n\n1019.\n\nIn the present case, having reviewed the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary or helpful to enter into detailed discussion of the different interpretations of the FET standard under customary international law. Both Parties have invoked the standard as described by the NAFTA arbitral tribunal in *Waste Management II*.1116 The Tribunal finds this standard to be an accurate statement of the fair and equitable treatment standard under customary international law and therefore reflective of the standard under TPA Article 10.5:1117\n\n\u2026Taken together, the *S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF and Loewen* cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\n\nEvidently the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 273; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 591.\n\n**CL-065**, *Waste Management Inc. v. The United Mexican States (\"Number 2\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\n1020.\n\nThe Tribunal will address some key disputed aspects of the FET standard between the Parties.\n\n1021.\n\nAs Respondent argues, it can still be controverted whether the FET standard under customary international law includes protection of the legitimate expectations of an investor (see \u00b6 1016 above). The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide this point, because even if legitimate expectations would be considered a part of the FET standard under the TPA, those expectations were not breached in this case (see \u00b6 1228 below). However, without recognising legitimate expectations as part of the FET standard under the TPA, in order to do justice to the arguments presented by the Parties, the Tribunal will give consideration to Claimants' alleged legitimate expectations in the context of their FET claim.\n\n1022.\n\nIn relation to transparency, the *Waste Management II* standard references \"a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process\" as an example of \"a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"1118 Claimants make the argument, however, that the obligation to act transparently is a standalone element of the FET standard.1119 Claimants cite a number of examples of breaches of transparency found by other arbitral tribunals, *inter alia*: (i) taking inconsistent positions with respect to key permits;1120 (ii) adopting measures that put a project in \"contractual limbo\";1121 (iii) invoking domestic laws and regulations or government structure to deny an investor its right to be dealt with transparently;1122 (iv) adopting contradictory and inconsistency conduct, contrary to the elements of stability and predictability of the State's legal order;1123 and (v) failure to sign a crucial document without any explanation.1124\n\n**CL-065**, *Waste Management Inc. v.

One such example is a complete lack of transparency in an administrative process cited by the *Waste Management* tribunal. Another would be a failure to ensure that \"\u2026the legal framework for the investor's operations is readily apparent and that any decision affecting the investor can be traced to that legal framework,\" being the characterisation of transparency proposed by Respondent.1127\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 303, 305, 319, 327, 341; Reply \u00b6 483.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 626; *quoting* **RL-153**, Christoph Schreuer, Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice, The Journal of World Investment and Trade, June 2005, p. 374.\n\n1025.\n\nClaimants have provided examples of other cases in which arbitral tribunals have referred to a lack of transparency in State conduct. Upon review, those cases do not necessarily support the existence of transparency as a standalone obligation, but consider it in the context of or in combination with other aspects of the FET standard.1128 One of the cases relied on does not find a lack of transparency at all, but rather that the government conduct in question was \"unfair and inequitable within the meaning of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA.\"1129\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Reply \u00b6 487; *quoting* **CL-026**, *Crystallex International Corporation v.

Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2013-22, Award, 27 September 2016, \u00b6 379. The only reference to transparency in that award is a statement that \"\u2026the conduct of the Ontario Government during the period leading up to the moratorium could have been more transparent\u2026\" *Id*., \u00b6 376.\n\n1026.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it necessary to make a definitive decision on whether the FET standard includes an obligation of transparency. Without recognising an independent obligation of transparency, in order to do justice to the arguments presented by the Parties, the Tribunal will give consideration to Claimants' submissions on an alleged lack of transparency in the context of their FET claim. Even if transparency were to be considered a part of the FET standard under the TPA, there was no breach in this case (see \u00b6 1228 below).\n\n1027.\n\nSimilarly, in respect of good faith, the Tribunal accepts Claimants' submission that good faith is inextricably linked to the fair and equitable treatment standard.1130 That being said, the Tribunal finds it a stretch of FET to assert a free-standing positive obligation to act in good faith separate from or additional to the standard encapsulated in the minimum standard of treatment. To the extent that the State's failure to act in good faith is conduct which is \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic,\" (see \u00b6 1019 above) it may be conduct that violates the FET standard. Bad faith conduct may likewise breach the FET standard. Without recognising a separate obligation of good faith, in order to do justice to the arguments presented by the Parties, the Tribunal will give consideration to Claimants' submissions on an alleged lack of good faith in the context of their FET claim.\n\nReply \u00b6 503.\n\n1028.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the standard for a breach of FET to be a high one, as reflected in the various examples set out by the *Waste Management II* tribunal. This includes the standard for arbitrary conduct and discrimination, which Respondent has highlighted as a high threshold to meet. Other than its finding that the standard is generally a high one, the Tribunal does not find it useful to enter into abstract debates or issue directives about the relative height of the standard divorced from the specific facts in which they will be applied.\n\n1029.\n\nThe Parties have each cited some of the same formulations on discriminatory treatment drawn from arbitral practice, such as the statement in *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania* that discriminatory conduct \"unduly treats differently investors who are in similar circumstances.\"1131 The Tribunal endorses this definition of discrimination. Differential treatment being the essence of discrimination, a comparator will typically be relevant and necessary to establish the existence of discriminatory treatment.\n\n**CL-044**, *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 368. *See* Memorial \u00b6 281; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 640.\n\n1030.\n\nClaimants further argue that a differential impact of the measure on the investment is sufficient and it is not required to prove discriminatory intent.1132 The Tribunal accepts that it is not required to establish subjective bad faith or malicious intent of the State.1133 However, the Tribunal does not understand Respondent to argue that it is required to prove discriminatory intent. Respondent's submission is rather that the differential treatment in question must be on the basis of the foreign character of an investor.1134 In respect of the FET standard under the TPA, the Tribunal finds no specific requirement that discrimination constituting a breach of the standard is limited to discrimination on that basis.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 281; *citing* **CL-057**, *Siemens v.

This is also clear from TPA Article 10.11, which provides:1137\n\nNothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.\n\nThe Tribunal shall take this into account as appropriate in reaching its decisions.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.11.\n\n1033.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to carry out the highly fact-specific exercise of applying the FET standard, and will consider different aspects in more detail as required in the course of its analysis.\n\n**(2) NDP Submission**\n----------------------\n\n***a. The U.S. NDP Submission***\n--------------------------------\n\n1034.\n\nIn its NDP Submission, the United States provided its interpretation regarding the content of the MST and its connection with the FET standard (TPA Article 10.5).\n\n1035.\n\nThe United States sets forth its interpretation of the content and outer limits of the MST protection contained in TPA Article 10.5.1138 In this regard, the United States submits, *inter alia*, that: (i) customary international law is the standard applicable to the MST protection and Annex 10-A to the Treaty provides for a two-element approach to determine the existence of a rule of customary international law, which requires a State practice and *opinio juris*;1139 (ii) other treaties' autonomous standards that expand the MST protection are irrelevant for interpreting TPA Article 10.5, which expressly ties the definition of such protections to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment;1140 (iii) the burden of establishing that a rule of customary international law exists and has been violated lies on the claimant, noting that a violation of domestic law does not necessarily constitute a violation of Article 10.5;1141 and (iv) the FET standard is part of the MST protection as expressly recognized by TPA Article 10.5(2)(a), unlike other concepts such as legitimate expectations, transparency, good faith, and non-discrimination which are not part of the FET standard under customary international law and thus cannot give rise to independent obligations for the host State.1142\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 17-30.\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 25-30.\n\n***b. Claimants' Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1036.\n\nClaimants reject the United States' interpretation regarding the FET standard contained in the MST protection under TPA Article 10.5, which they describe as unduly restrictive and not supported by case law.1143 Claimants introduce their argument by submitting the following three general observations: (i) the United States' restrictive interpretation on this matter reflects its practice of serving States' interests and thus is neither authoritative nor binding;1144 (ii) the NDP Submission is \"internally inconsistent\";1145 and (iii) the NDP does not consider the consistent arbitral case law that finds a convergence between the autonomous FET standard and the FET component of the MST.1146\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations, Section VI.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6 39.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6 41.\n\n1037.\n\nIn addition, Claimants submit that: (i) the United States' position erroneously excludes arbitral decisions as evidence of the content of customary international law and ignores that it is State practice to look to arbitral decisions as a source of customary international law;1147 (ii) the distinction made by the United States between the FET component of the MST and the autonomous FET standard is \"artificial\" given that the FET under customary international law provides the same level of protection as the autonomous FET standard and the United States' restrictive position is inconsistent with Article 31 of the VCLT which provides that treaty provisions must be interpreted \"neither liberally nor restrictively\";1148 (iii) contrary to the NDP's unsupported observations, the concepts of legitimate expectations, transparency, discrimination, and good faith form part of the FET standard under TPA Article 10.5, based on the findings of prior tribunals;1149 and (iv) the State's failure to comply with its own domestic law may amount to a violation of FET, as opposed to the NDP's interpretation.1150\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 42-53.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 55-58.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 59-71.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 72-76.\n\n***c.

The Tribunal will group certain of the alleged breaches and address in turn: (i) the RGA Lawsuit; (ii) the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings; (iii) the CWA; (iv) the commencement of the Lima Arbitration; and (v) the denial of the Third Extension Request.\n\n***a. Filing of the RGA Lawsuit***\n----------------------------------\n\n1043.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the filing of the RGA Lawsuit did not fall under the parties' contractual relationship in the RER Contract, and therefore the Tribunal made no determinations with respect to this conduct in relation to Second Claimant's contractual claims.\n\n1044.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent breached their legitimate expectations and acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily, inconsistently and without good faith when it filed the RGA Lawsuit on 14 March 2017.1159 Respondent disagrees.1160\n\nMemorial \u00a7 IV.B.1.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 659.\n\n1045.\n\nThe Tribunal will first focus on the alleged breach of legitimate expectations before turning to the other aspects of Claimants' FET claim based on the RGA Lawsuit.\n\n*(i) Legitimate Expectations*\n-----------------------------\n\n1046.\n\nFor Claimants, the filing of the RGA Lawsuit breached their legitimate expectations that they had relied on, being: (i) the Mamacocha Project was a Category I project and, consequently, Second Claimant only required a DIA to secure its Generation Plant Environmental Certification (see \u00b6 109(ii) above); (ii) ARMA had authority to grant the Environmental Certifications for the Mamacocha Project; (iii) ARMA's resolutions granting the Project's Environmental Certifications had been vetted, tested, and approved by ARMA and were not subject to change; (iv) the RGA would not commence or continue for nearly a year a baseless lawsuit that brought the Project to a halt; and (v) MINEM would partner with Second Claimant to protect and ensure the validity of the Project's permits.1161\n\nMemorial \u00b6 288.\n\n1047.\n\nIn Claimants' view, the RGA Lawsuit attempted to change long-held requirements for the Environmental Certifications, based on rules that had never been applied to the Project, nor any other RER project.1162\n\nMemorial \u00b6 291.\n\n1048.\n\nAlthough the RGA Lawsuit was ultimately withdrawn, Claimants argue that Respondent failed to restore the year it took away from the Project, which \"proved to be fatal.\"1163\n\nMemorial \u00b6 288. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6 5.\n\n1049.\n\nRespondent objects to the RGA Lawsuit as a basis for Claimants' claim, arguing that the lawsuit was withdrawn as a result of good faith actions taken by the Peruvian State in the context of the negotiations between the Parties.1164 By withdrawing their First Notice of Intent after the RGA Lawsuit's withdrawal, Respondent argues that Claimants acknowledged that the act had ceased.1165 In Respondent's view, Claimants have not proven a causal link between the RGA Lawsuit and the failure of the Mamacocha Project.1166\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 659.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 659.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 159, 189.\n\n1050.\n\nRespondent further argues that: (i) Claimants' expectations are neither reasonable nor legitimate;1167 (ii) it has not been established that the expectations correspond to commitments by Respondent or were relied upon;1168 (iii) administrative acts relating to environmental impact assessments are not exempt from challenge in the administrative courts;1169and (iv) Claimants could not have been unaware of the illegality of the mechanism used to process their Environmental Certifications which they had been warned about by third parties.1170\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 661-666.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 668.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 698. *See also* R-PHB \u00b6 43.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 701(c)-(e); *citing* Monteza Second Report \u00b6 227; *also quoting* **C-247**, Report from CMS Grau Law Firm to DEG setting forth analysis of certain legal proceedings related to the Mamacocha project, 21 December 2018, p. 4; **R-140/C-229**, Legal Report by J.C.

Liz\u00e1rraga (Echecopar Law Firm), 5 December 2017, p. 2, \u00b6 (h).\n\n1051.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in October 2013, ARMA initially classified the Mamacocha Project as a Category III project, requiring a more comprehensive EIA.1171 Second Claimant appealed this decision and in February 2014 obtained a reclassification as Category I (see \u00b6 109(ii) above).1172\n\n**C-184**, *Oficio No. 748-2013-GRA/ARMA/SG de la Autoridad Regional Ambiental a HLA*, 11 October 2013, p. 5.\n\n**C-185**, *Informe No. 009/2014-GRA/ARMA-SG-EA-E*, 17 February 2014, p. 6. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6 6.\n\n1052.\n\nThe RGA Lawsuit was commenced following an investigation by the RGA Council into Claimants' Environmental Certifications, and specifically the reclassification from Category III to Category I of the Generation Plant Environmental Certification (see \u00b6 146 above). The RGA Lawsuit argued that ARMA erred when it reclassified the permit as Category I because of the Project's expected environmental impact.1173\n\n**C-087**, *Demanda Contencioso-Administrativa del Gobierno Regional de Arequipa*, 14 March 2017. *See* Memorial \u00b6 102.\n\n1053.\n\nThe RGA Lawsuit was withdrawn following the filing of Claimants' First Notice of Intent and interactions between the Special Commission, the RGA Regional Attorney General, ARMA, and Governor Osorio (see \u00b6\u00b6 169-179 above). The Special Commission had also obtained legal advice in the form of the Mor\u00f3n Report indicating, *inter alia* that the RGA Lawsuit would have little chance of success (see \u00b6 170 above).\n\n1054.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing the fair and equitable treatment of First Claimant by the Peruvian authorities, the Tribunal finds it key that the Special Commission participating in negotiations with Claimants under the TPA undertook specific efforts to intervene on Claimants' behalf with the relevant authorities which resulted in the withdrawal of the lawsuit. This conduct is equally part of Respondent's treatment of First Claimant and its investment which must be evaluated as a whole. Claimants contend that the RGA Lawsuit was ordered to be withdrawn by Governor Osorio not for reasons of good faith but due to the risk of exposure to significant liability.1174 Undoubtedly, a desire to avoid exposure to liability plays a role in parties' conduct when seeking to resolve a dispute. The Tribunal does not consider this alone to constitute evidence of bad faith on the part of Respondent, and will evaluate the Parties' conduct in all the circumstances.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 139-141.\n\n1055.\n\nIn these circumstances, the focus of the claim falls on whether the fact of filing the RGA Lawsuit on 17 March 2017 and its continuation until the court accepted its withdrawal on 8 March 20181175 breached the FET standard of the TPA.\n\nOn 27 December 2017, the RGA Governor issued a Regional Executive Resolution authorising withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit, which was subsequently accepted by the Court in March 2018. *See* **C-010**, Regional Executive Resolution No. 665-2017-GRA/GR, 27 December 2017; **C-192**, *Resoluci\u00f3n No. 12 Expediente No. 1554-2017-0-0401-JR-CI-04, Corte Superior de Justicia Arequipa*, 8 March 2018.\n\n1056.\n\nIn respect of First Claimant's alleged legitimate expectations (see \u00b6 1046 above), the Tribunal considers that its expectations regarding the Project go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n1057.\n\nFirst Claimant asserts an expectation that the Mamacocha Project was a Category I project and, consequently, Second Claimant only required a DIA to secure its plant environmental permit. However, such an expectation is not founded in representations by Respondent or in Peruvian law.\n\n1058.\n\nClaimants rely on a categorisation issued by MINEM on 31 January 2012 indicating that run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects located in the mountains and not specifically protected by environmental laws would be subject to a DIA only.1176 As Respondent points out,1177 on 18 June 2012, however, MINEM issued an updated report on categorisation specifying that with respect to the categorisations provided on 31 January 2012, these are merely for reference and could differ from the categorisation given to a specific plant:1178\n\n*...debemos se\u00f1alar que el Informe N\u02da 026-2012-MEM-AAE/NAE-MEM...es un informe que contiene una clasificaci\u00f3n meramente referencial, es decir, es posible que a algunos proyectos de inversi\u00f3n se les pueda otorgar otra clasificaci\u00f3n diferente a la se\u00f1alada en el referido informe, dependiendo de los impactos a generarse, las \u00e1reas donde se realizar\u00e1n los proyectos, las poblaciones involucradas, etc.*\n\n**C-088**, MINEM's Report No. 0026-2012-MEM-AAE-NAE/MEM regarding the updating of environmental electrical regulations and categorization of activities, 31 January 2012, p. 2. *See* Memorial \u00b6 43.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 703.\n\n**R-146**, *Informe No. 0196-2012-MEM-AA-NAE/KCV*, MINEM, 18 June 2012, p. 3.\n\n1059.\n\nAt the relevant time, Claimants were carrying out a pre-feasibility study which was finalised in October 2012.1179 The permit application was filed by the predecessor of Second Claimant in July 2013. At the time of filing, therefore, both MINEM reports were available and the Tribunal finds no basis for Claimants to rely on one without the other. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no guarantee by MINEM or other Peruvian authorities that the Mamacocha Project would be considered a Category I project and rejects this as a basis for First Claimant's legitimate expectations.\n\n**C-100(a)**, *CESEL Ingenieros, Estudio de Prefactibilidad \u2013 Vol. I Resumen Ejecutivo*, 26 October 2012. *See* Memorial \u00b6 46.\n\n1060.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal does not consider the cases of *RDC v. Guatemala* or *Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan* relied on by Claimants to provide relevant guidance for the present case,1180 as those tribunals made findings about the existence of legitimate expectations regarding the contractual and legal framework in those cases which are not applicable here.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 520; *citing* **CL-049**, *Railroad Development Corporation (RDC) v.

Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 10 November 2017.\n\n1061.\n\nClaimants further submit that they legitimately expected that ARMA had authority to grant the Environmental Certifications for the Mamacocha Project and its resolutions were not subject to change, and that the RGA would not commence or continue a \"baseless lawsuit\" (see \u00b6 1046 above).\n\n1062.\n\nRespondent argues, in response, that: (i) ARMA's competence to issue the Environmental Certifications cannot be confused with their legality;1181 (ii) the Environmental Certifications contained only two short paragraphs analysing the formal requirements, contrary to Claimants' submission that they \"had been vetted, tested and approved\" by ARMA;1182 and (iii) the RGA's filing of the lawsuit was a legitimate exercise of the control of legality of administrative acts and did not bring the Project to a halt.1183\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 706.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 707.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 709, 710.\n\n1063.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider there to be any doubt that ARMA had authority to grant the Environmental Certifications for the Mamacocha Project. However, this does not mean that the permits were insulated from measures available under Peruvian law to challenge or alter those permits, including by Peruvian authorities. Respondent made no representation to Claimants otherwise.\n\n1064.\n\nIn circumstances where Second Claimant's permit was originally classified as Category III and was only reclassified as Category I following a recourse procedure by Claimants, the Tribunal has difficulty concluding that only this second administrative decision was immune from challenge. Just as Second Claimant had recourse to applicable procedures under Peruvian law to apply for reconsideration of the original classification, the decision to reclassify the Project as Category I was subject to challenge under Peruvian law. Respondent did not, and could not, have guaranteed or insulated Claimants from any such challenge.\n\n1065.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not accept the legitimacy of the expectations put forward by First Claimant as item (iii) and (iv) at \u00b6 1046 above, and does not consider the expectation at item (ii) to assist it, since ARMA's competence does not mean that the permit may not be challenged.\n\n1066.\n\nIn respect of First Claimant's expectation that MINEM would partner with Second Claimant to protect and ensure the validity of the Project's permits (see item (v) at \u00b6 1046 above), the Tribunal finds First Claimant's expectation to go beyond what is legitimate in the circumstances. Respondent's representations to Claimants with respect to MINEM's role in the validity of the Project's permits are clearly set out in the RER Contract. The Tribunal has considered MINEM's role under Clause 4.3 of the RER Contract at \u00b6\u00b6 663-679above. It follows that MINEM's role was not to ensure the validity of the Project's permits.\n\n*(ii) Arbitrariness, Bad Faith*\n-------------------------------\n\n1067.\n\nClaimants further submit that the RGA Lawsuit breached good faith and was arbitrary, as it was brought for the bad faith purpose of destroying the Mamacocha Project. According to Claimants, the RGA Council had been responsible for political attacks against the Project and had publicly made it clear that it would do anything to thwart it.1184 Claimants contend as a basis for this alleged breach that: (i) the RGA Attorney General advised against filing the lawsuit because it lacked merit; (ii) Regional Council members admitted that 109 similar permits for other projects may have had identical irregularities but were not challenged; (iii) the report of the Regional Investigative Commission lacked any basis in scientific or environmental studies; and (iv) the RGA Lawsuit was filed after the applicable statute of limitations had expired.1185\n\nMemorial \u00b6 292.\n\nReply \u00b6 523. *See also* C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\n1068.\n\nRespondent denies acting arbitrarily or deliberately to destroy or frustrate the investment in bad faith.1186 Respondent further contends that: (i) the Mor\u00f3n Report did not confirm that the RGA Lawsuit was without merit;1187 (ii) the recommendation of the RGA Attorney General to discontinue the RGA Lawsuit confirms the Peruvian State's good faith conduct;1188 (iii) Claimants incorrectly rely on a MINEM report which provides for referential environmental classification of the Project only;1189 and (iv) the Amparo Judgment confirms the reasonableness of the RGA Lawsuit, since it challenged the same ARMA resolutions on nearly identical grounds.1190\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 669, 671, 672.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 670. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 170-181; R-PHB \u00b6\u00b6 59-62.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 671.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 673.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 716.\n\n1069.\n\nThe scope of the question before the Tribunal is whether the act of bringing the RGA Lawsuit and maintaining it for one year before its withdrawal was arbitrary or in bad faith. The fact of bringing a legal challenge to the Mamacocha Project's permits is not *per se* arbitrary conduct, even if that challenge is brought by the State authorities. In order to be arbitrary, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the conduct in question must have no rational relationship with the purported goal of that measure or is otherwise unreasonable, prejudicial or capricious.1191\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 280; Reply \u00b6 476.\n\n1070.\n\nIt is not the task of this Tribunal to decide upon the merits of the RGA Lawsuit. The Tribunal inquires into the grounds for the RGA Lawsuit only for the purpose of determining whether it had no rational relationship with its stated goals, or was otherwise unreasonable, prejudicial or capricious.\n\n1071.\n\nThe RGA Lawsuit was brought upon the recommendation of a Regional Investigative Commission created by the RGA Council, which approved its report and recommendation.1192 The Regional Investigative Commission concluded that there were a series of irregularities with respect to the Environmental Certifications obtained by Second Claimant. Among other things, the Regional Investigative Commission found: (i) the Mamacocha Lagoon is the habitat of the Pacific otter (a species at risk of extinction) and river shrimp, and is an environmentally fragile area; (ii) the initial environmental evaluation of the Project concluded that it should be classified as Category III; (iii) the re-categorisation to Category I following the request of Second Claimant was based only on a legal report, without a technical evaluation; (iv) there were indications that the authorities deliberately favoured Second Claimant's Environmental Certification without carrying out duly detailed analysis considering the circumstances of the location of the Project and without due formal consultation of the population; and (v) the office within ARMA that issued the permits lacked legal authority.1193\n\n**C-049**, *Acta de Sesi\u00f3n Ordinaria del Consejo Regional de Arequipa*, 21 October 2016, p. 24.\n\n**R-137**, *Informe final de la Comisi\u00f3n Especial Investigadora encargada de fiscalizar la emisi\u00f3n de las Resoluciones Sub Gerenciales No. 1102014-GRA/ARMA-SG y No. 158-2014-GRA/ARMA-SG y otras, emitidas por la Autoridad Regional Ambiental-ARMA*, pp. 83-88. *See also* **C-049**, *Acta de Sesi\u00f3n Ordinaria del Consejo Regional de Arequipa*, 21 October 2016, pp. 19-20, 23-24.\n\n1072.\n\nThe Regional Investigative Commission recommended that the RGA Public Prosecutor's Office initiate legal action to obtain a declaration of nullity of the resolutions approving the environmental impact statements for the generation plant and transmission line of the Project.1194\n\n**R-137**, *Informe final de la Comisi\u00f3n Especial Investigadora encargada de fiscalizar la emisi\u00f3n de las Resoluciones Sub Gerenciales No. 1102014-GRA/ARMA-SG y No. 158-2014-GRA/ARMA-SG y otras, emitidas por la Autoridad Regional Ambiental-ARMA*, p. 88. *See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 209.\n\n1073.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, ARMA issued a resolution stating that the resolutions linked to the approval of the environmental impact statements for the generation plant and transmission line violated administrative legality (*la legalidad administrativa*) and the public interest. It was further resolved that since the time for filing an administrative proceeding for nullity had expired, it would be necessary to do so in a judicial proceeding.1195\n\n**C-085**, *Resoluci\u00f3n Gerencial Regional No. 033-2016-GRA/ARMA*, 12 December 2016. *See* Counter- Memorial \u00b6 211.\n\n1074.\n\nClaimants assert that the RGA Lawsuit was a pretext for destroying the Project and was politically motivated.1196 In their view, the environmental allegations put forward in the RGA Lawsuit were debunked or discredited, by:1197 (i) an apparently recorded conversation of an RGA official involved in the lawsuit who said that certain of the allegations were \"really wrong\";1198 (ii) a November 2017 report by international otter specialists finding that during construction of the Project, there may not be permanent disturbances to the lagoon fauna, and once in operation the plant would have no impact on the otter population;1199 (iii) an interview with Mr. Benigno Sanz, of ARMA, stating that he would like to see an expert report evidencing the alleged ecological damage;1200 and (iv) the RGA Attorney-General Office's report stating that they had recommended against filing it (see \u00b6 1081 below).1201\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 80, 292; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 107, 523, 525, 531.\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1958:8-1960:6; **CD-06**, Claimants' Closing Presentation, slides 57-60; C-PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. *See* Tribunal Question 14A: \"The Parties are invited to provide any context, based on the evidence on the record, for the greater number of environmental issues that were raised with respect to the Mamacocha Project from 2016 onwards, as compared to the years prior to that.\"\n\n**C-084**, Email from R.

Osorio, Governor of Arequipa, 21 December 2017, pp. 4-5.\n\n1075.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, submits that Claimants deceived ARMA by \"illegally\" submitting separate applications for the generation plant and transmission line, as opposed to a single application for the whole Project.1202 In its view, Claimants mischaracterise the contemporaneous documents and the statements of public officials they rely upon have no legal weight.1203\n\nR-PHB \u00b6 13.\n\nR-PHB \u00b6 45.\n\n1076.\n\nBased on the materials before it, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the RGA Lawsuit was politically motivated. On the face of the Regional Investigative Commission's report, as approved by the RGA Council and followed up by ARMA, the Tribunal does not find evidence of an intent to destroy the Project. While Claimants contest and rebut the environmental concerns raised by the Regional Investigative Commission,1204 the Tribunal does not find the concerns to be unreasonable, prejudicial or capricious. In particular, it is not unreasonable to hold concerns for flora and fauna of the site which include an endangered species of otter, and to inquire into the circumstances around the reclassification of the level of environmental risk of the Mamacocha Project. The same applies to the concerns raised by the Regional Investigative Commission regarding the authority of ARMA officials.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 115-121.\n\n1077.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal is not suggesting that the allegations made in the RGA Lawsuit are well-founded or could not have been refuted. Nor does the Tribunal consider it established that Claimants were attempting to deceive ARMA by submitting two separate applications for Environmental Certification.\n\n1078.\n\nThe records of press interviews with RGA Council members, Mr. Sanz of ARMA and Governor Osorio, relied on by Claimants, do not evidence bad faith or arbitrariness in the RGA Lawsuit.1205\n\n*See* **C-089**, Transcript of Councilman Edy Medina Interview, 11 April 2017; **C-090**, Transcript of Councilman James Posso Interview, 11 April 2017; **C-011**, Newspaper Correo Arequipa, Interview of Yamila Osorio Delgado, Governor of Arequipa, 30 December 2017; **C-218**, Benigno Sanz Interview, Diario Correo, 19 July 2017. The Tribunal notes that the interview transcripts in **C-089** and **C-090** have been submitted in English only, without an identifying source.\n\n1079.\n\nLeaving aside Respondent's comment regarding the RGA Council interview transcripts, which were submitted only in English,1206 Councilman James Posso's primary objection to Second Claimant's environmental approval related to the potential destruction of the habitat of the endangered species of otter.1207 The focus of Councilman Edy Medina, on the other hand, was on alleged irregularities in administrative action by ARMA.1208 Neither of the interview transcripts evidence animosity towards Second Claimant or political motivations against the Mamacocha Project. Rather, the focus of attention is ARMA's conduct.1209 The fact that ARMA issued 109 other resolutions, which in the Councilmen's view suffered from the same alleged irregularities, does not establish political targeting of the Mamacocha Project. Contrary to Claimants' assertion, it is not known that the 109 resolutions granted Environmental Certifications, as they could have dealt with any subject matter, as stated by Councilman Posso.1210 In addition, this does not undermine the environmental concerns held by the Councilmen specific to the granting of Second Claimant's permit.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1068.\n\nQuestion: \"Is that the only objection?

Within weeks of its issuance, the above chain of correspondence ensued and on 30 December 2017, Governor Osorio ordered the immediate withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit.1217 The only indication that a member of Respondent's authorities or instrumentalities may have had an earlier view that the RGA Lawsuit lacked merit was the RGA Attorney-General, who mentions in December 2017 that \"this Office had already pointed out that the likelihood of succeeding in this Proceeding\u2026would be minimal.\"1218 Claimants themselves refer to this statement as an \"on-the-record 'finger-pointing' exercise.\"1219\n\n**C-010**, Regional Executive Resolution No. 665-2017-GRA/GR, 27 December 2017.\n\n**C-095**, Report No. 287-2017-GRA/PPR from RGA Regional Attorney General's Office to Y.

Osorio, Governor of Arequipa, 21 December 2017, pp. 1, 2.\n\n1084.\n\nIn sum, none of these documents establish that the RGA Lawsuit was commenced in bad faith or arbitrarily. Nor do they establish that Respondent admitted or acknowledged that the RGA Lawsuit was baseless. At most, they demonstrate that the RGA Lawsuit had low prospects of success. Those prospects were principally identified by Dr. Mor\u00f3n in December 2017, and his opinion was swiftly acted upon by the Special Commission, the RGA Attorney General and the RGA Governor to result in the withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit.\n\n1085.\n\nIn all the circumstances, while the Tribunal shares Claimants' concerns regarding the merits of the RGA Lawsuit, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the RGA Lawsuit was unreasonable, prejudicial or capricious. The fact of bringing a lawsuit that may ultimately be unsuccessful is not, on its own, sufficient to constitute arbitrary or bad faith conduct in breach of the FET standard.\n\n1086.\n\nIn reaching the above conclusions, the Tribunal emphasises that beyond an inquiry into whether there was conduct inconsistent with the FET standard, it is not for this Tribunal to assess the merits of the original or revised Environmental Certification by the Peruvian authorities,1224 or the merits or prospects of success of the RGA Lawsuit or the Amparo Action (see \u00b6\u00b6 129-134 above). This Tribunal's determination is limited to assessing whether the filing of the RGA Lawsuit itself violated the FET standard, whether because it breached First Claimant's legitimate expectations, was arbitrary, discriminatory, non-transparent or in bad faith.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 515; Rejoinder \u00b6 699.\n\n1087.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to address the Parties' respective arguments on whether the RGA Lawsuit did in fact cause the destruction of the Project, noting that this is a contested issue.1225\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Reply \u00b6\u00b6 93-100; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 189-199.\n\n1088.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that at least two other challenges to Second Claimant's environmental permits were pursued by different parties in the Peruvian courts in addition to the RGA Lawsuit. One was an administrative lawsuit filed by Mr. David Ger\u00f3nimo Miranda Soto on 17 February 2017.1226 The other was the Amparo Action, which was filed by a private citizen against a number of respondents including Second Claimant and MINEM (see \u00b6\u00b6 129-134 above). Neither of these lawsuits is alleged by First Claimant to constitute a breach of the TPA or international law.1227 In Claimants' view, \"because the project was dead when [the Amparo Judgment] occurred CHM had no actionable claim under either the treaty or the contract.\"1228\n\n**R-065**, *Demanda Contencioso Administrativa de David Geronimo Miranada Soto*, 14 February 2017. *See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 207, 1133; Reply fn 181.\n\nReply \u00b6 652, fn 1106.\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1968:12-14. *See* Tribunal Question 17(i):  \n\"Is it Claimants' position that Respondent is in breach of the RER Contract or the Treaty, or both, in respect of the Amparo Action?\"\n\n1089.\n\nWhile the RGA Lawsuit was withdrawn, the Amparo Action was ultimately successful in obtaining a declaration of nullity of the Environmental Certifications of the Mamacocha Project and the final concession of the generation plant.1229 The Specialised Constitutional Court of Arequipa (\"*Juzgado Especializado Constitucional de Arequipa*\") found, among other things, that the drastic change of environmental classification of the Project was surprising, considering the significant environmental harm that could be caused to the Mamacocha Lagoon and its surroundings, including a protected species.1230 It also found a violation of the principle of \"indivisibility\" (\"*indivisibilidad*\") in Second Claimant's Environmental Certifications for the Mamacocha Project, which were applied for as two separate permits for (i) the power plant; and (ii) the transmission line.1231\n\n**R-070**, *Sentencia No. 29-2020, Resoluci\u00f3n No. 33, Juzgado Especializado Constitucional de Arequipa*, 30 January 2020, pp. 62-63.\n\n**R-070**, *Sentencia No. 29-2020, Resoluci\u00f3n No. 33, Juzgado Especializado Constitucional de Arequipa*, 30 January 2020, \u00a7 3.3.\n\n**R-070**, *Sentencia No. 29-2020, Resoluci\u00f3n No. 33, Juzgado Especializado Constitucional de Arequipa*, 30 January 2020, \u00a7 3.2.\n\n1090.\n\nTwo attempts by Second Claimant to challenge the Amparo Judgment in court were unsuccessful: (i) an appeal of the Amparo Judgment;1232 and (ii) a petition for an *amparo* action against the Amparo Judgment and the appeal rejection.1233 A third appeal against the adverse decision on the petition for an *amparo* action remained pending as at the Hearing (see \u00b6 134 above).\n\n**C-295**, Judgment No. 72-2021 from the Superior Court of Arequipa, First Civil Chamber, 4 February 2021.\n\n**R-182**, *Resoluci\u00f3n No. 1: Proceso de Amparo, Exp.

The Tribunal takes into account that the RGA Lawsuit and the Amparo Action are different types of legal proceedings brought on independent legal bases. The Tribunal notes, however, that the overlap in certain grounds of the RGA Lawsuit and the Amparo Action, some of which were ultimately upheld in the Amparo Judgment and in further instances in court, does undermine Claimants' argument that the RGA Lawsuit was arbitrary conduct.\n\n*(iii) Transparency*\n--------------------\n\n1094.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the RGA Lawsuit breached the transparency component under the FET standard because the RGA never substantiated the basis for its \"drastic reversal in policy with respect to the Project's environmental permits.\"1247 In their view, it lacked transparency because: (i) the basis for the RGA Lawsuit was an internal, *ex parte* investigation by the RGA Council; (ii) the RGA Lawsuit contains only conclusory allegations without citing any policy changes, environmental studies or evidentiary documents; and (iii) the RGA Council never disclosed the findings of the investigation or legal bases for the Lawsuit.1248\n\nMemorial \u00b6 303.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 303; Reply \u00b6 534.\n\n1095.\n\nFor Claimants, the RGA Lawsuit can be compared to other cases where arbitral tribunals have found that a government taking inconsistent positions regarding key permits or putting a project in \"contractual limbo\" is a violation of the transparency component of FET.1249\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 304-306; *citing* **CL-037**, *Metalclad Corporation v.

It argues that the analysis on what environmental assessment will be required for a project depends on the corresponding technical studies, and was not pre-established by the MINEM memorandum of January 2012.1250 Respondent further submits that Claimants have not established a causal link between the RGA Lawsuit and the failure of the Mamacocha Project.1251\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 675; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 717-718.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 719.\n\n1097.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its findings at \u00b6\u00b6 1024-1026 above regarding the existence of a separate transparency obligation under the FET standard.\n\n1098.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal's reasoning in relation to legitimate expectations, arbitrariness and lack of good faith that the transparency ground of First Claimant's claim must also be rejected. On the 2012 MINEM memorandum regarding the classification of the Project, the Tribunal refers to its observations at \u00b6\u00b6 1058-1059 above. In relation to the inconsistent position taken by first granting and subsequently challenging the Environmental Certification, the Tribunal refers to its observations at \u00b6\u00b6 1063-1065 above.\n\n1099.\n\nMoreover, it has not been demonstrated that the conduct of the investigation by the RGA Council or the submissions filed by the authorities in the RGA Lawsuit breached any transparency requirements applicable to such procedures, or that any decision taken affecting Claimants or their investments cannot be traced to the applicable legal framework.\n\n1100.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal does not find the circumstances around the filing and subsequent withdrawal of the RGA Lawsuit to lack transparency such as to amount to a breach of the FET standard under the TPA.\n\n*(iv) Discrimination*\n---------------------\n\n1101.\n\nClaimants submit that the RGA Lawsuit is *per se* discriminatory because it specifically targeted the Mamacocha Project. While every hydro project in the RER Promotion received its plant Environmental Certification using a DIA, only the Mamacocha Project was sued for using a DIA instead of an EIA. In addition, Claimants assert that the RGA Council members admitted that the RGA Lawsuit was the first challenge to ARMA's authority to issue the Project's environmental permits, while ARMA had previously issued 109 Environmental Certifications for other projects.1252\n\nMemorial \u00b6 307.\n\n1102.\n\nIn the absence of a reasonable justification for a differential treatment, Claimants argue that arbitral practice has found a breach of FET.1253 In Claimants' view, what is decisive to show discrimination is not discriminatory intent, but the impact of the measure on the investment.1254\n\nMemorial \u00b6 308; *citing* **CL-052**, *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 498.\n\nReply \u00b6 537.\n\n1103.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimants have not identified a comparator in like circumstances, which is required to establish discrimination.1255 Respondent submits that other RER projects cannot act as general comparators for environmental classification because each one has specific circumstances and differences such as location, area affected, technologies, and nearby population.1256\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 676; Rejoinder \u00b6 720.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 676.\n\n1104.\n\nRespondent further contends that Claimants have not proven that every other hydroelectric project received environmental approval for a DIA, and in any event that would not establish that the projects were in like circumstances.1257\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 721.\n\n1105.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its reasoning at \u00b6\u00b6 1028-1030 above with respect to the standard for discriminatory treatment. The Tribunal notes that Claimants have not identified a comparator for the purposes of establishing discriminatory treatment.\n\n1106.\n\nFurther and in any event, the Tribunal does not find the claim of discriminatory treatment to be made out in this case. As discussed at \u00b6\u00b6 1069-1086 above, the filing of the RGA Lawsuit was not arbitrary or without rational basis. For the same reason, Claimants have failed to establish that there was no reasonable justification for the RGA Lawsuit, assuming without deciding that it was different to the treatment given to other hydropower projects. The environmental situation for each hydropower project is specific to its geography, flora and fauna and other circumstances, meaning that there is a basis for differential treatment of hydropower projects arising from their different circumstances. The fact that the RGA Lawsuit also included allegations about the validity of ARMA's decisions which have not been raised against other hydropower projects is insufficient to establish discrimination, since the specific environmental circumstances of the Mamacocha Project may have brought to light other legal inquiries such as this.\n\n*(v) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n1107.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal rejects the allegation that the filing of the RGA Lawsuit constitutes a breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA.\n\n***b. Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1108.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings did not fall under the parties' contractual relationship in the RER Contract, and therefore the Tribunal made no determinations with respect to this conduct in relation to Second Claimant's contractual claims.\n\n1109.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that this ground of First Claimant's claim involves a criminal investigation into Second Claimant's External Counsel (see \u00b6 183 above). Claimants have previously sought redaction of the name of the individual in question from material to be published in relation to this case, which redactions Respondent had agreed to.1258 For the purposes of making its determinations under this ground, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to identify any of the individuals under investigation by name in this Award, and will refrain from doing so.\n\n*See* Letter from Claimants to A. Conover, 22 May 2020; Letter from Respondent to A. Conover, 22 May 2020.\n\n1110.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent violated the FET standard when: (i) the AEP included Second Claimant in the Criminal Investigation regarding the Project's Environmental Certifications; and (ii) on 2 February 2018, when the AEP announced it had decided to formalise and continue the investigation, naming Second Claimant's External Counsel as a criminal suspect in the Criminal Proceedings.1259 Claimants contend that the investigation was brought only on the basis of the allegations in the RGA Lawsuit, which Respondent has admitted are baseless.1260 In addition, Claimants argue that the AEP failed to provide proper notice of the proceeding and applied a criminal statute that was not in existence at the time of the alleged wrongdoing.1261\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 309, 310.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 309.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 310.\n\n1111.\n\nIn Claimants' view, these measures deprived First Claimant of its legitimate expectations, violated Respondent's obligation to act in good faith, were arbitrary, lacked transparency, and were discriminatory.1262\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 311-312, 314, 316, 318, 320. *See also* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 539-550.\n\n1112.\n\nRespondent argues, in response, that Second Claimant's External Counsel is distinct from the investor and its investment and Claimants have not proven that he is covered by the protections under the TPA, or that measures taken in relation to third parties can engage the State's liability under the TPA.1263\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 680.\n\n1113.\n\nRespondent further submits that it has a margin of appreciation in criminal investigations, being a most obvious and undisputed part of its sovereign right to enforce national law.1264 Respondent denies that the contested measures breached Claimants' legitimate expectations, were contrary to good faith, were arbitrary, lacked transparency or were discriminatory.1265\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 681; *quoting* **RL-116**, *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v.

According to Respondent, while the paragraph in question was introduced after the relevant conduct by Second Claimant's External Counsel, the same legal principle was already being applied by the courts before its formal incorporation, and Claimants' argument on this ground was already rejected by the Judge of the Preparatory Investigation (*Juez de la Investigaci\u00f3n Preparatoria*).1271\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 693; *citing* **R-119**, *Resoluci\u00f3n No. 18-2020, Quinto Juzgado de la Investigaci\u00f3n Preparatoria de Arequipa*, 4 November 2020.\n\n1119.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that First Claimant's alleged legitimate expectations in respect of the RGA Lawsuit, which are also relied on in relation to the Criminal Investigation, go beyond what is reasonable in the circumstances (see \u00b6\u00b6 1056-1065 and 1114 above). For the same reasons, the Tribunal rejects them as a basis for Claimants' arguments in relation to the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings.\n\n1120.\n\nIn relation to the expectations put forward at \u00b6 1115 above, the Tribunal confirms the legitimacy of an expectation to be treated fairly, reasonably and in good faith. However, First Claimant has not established a breach of that expectation with respect to the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings.\n\n1121.\n\nIn this regard, as for the RGA Lawsuit (see \u00b6 1070 above), it is not for the Tribunal to make a determination on the merits of the Criminal Investigation or Criminal Proceedings. The Tribunal is being asked to decide whether these proceedings are unfair, unreasonable or lacking in good faith. In making this assessment, the Tribunal is mindful of the State's sovereign power to investigate and prosecute potential crimes committed under national law. Being treated fairly, reasonably and in good faith does not confer immunity from legal proceedings or criminal investigations.\n\n1122.\n\nThe Criminal Investigation which led to the Criminal Proceeding was brought following a complaint of 8 March 2017 by two private citizens to the AEP for potential environmental crimes related to the Mamacocha Project.1272 The AEP subsequently concluded that there was sufficient evidence for an investigation into a number of ARMA officials.1273 In this regard, the AEP referred to the reclassification of the Generation Plant Environmental Certification from Category III to Category I, and specifically alleged irregularities by officials of ARMA in that procedure, as investigated by the RGA Council.1274\n\n**R-066**, *Oficio No. 001-2017, Denuncia presentada por Roberto Nieves Molina Llerena y Flavio W.

In circumstances where Claimants and their legal counsel had access to and sought recourse to the Peruvian courts on these procedural irregularities, it is not the role of this Tribunal constituted under the TPA to substitute its own assessment.\n\n**C-285**, *Resoluci\u00f3n No. 04-2018, Corte Superior de Justicia de Arequipa, 5to Juzgado de Investigaci\u00f3n Prep.

While the proceedings relate to the same circumstances, i.e., the granting of Second Claimant's environmental permits, this does not mean that they have the same prospects of success, or that there is an obligation to have the Criminal Proceedings halted.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 188; Memorial \u00b6 314.\n\n1132.\n\nIn the same way, contrary to Respondent's submission,1289 the ultimate success of the Amparo Action does not weigh into the Tribunal's assessment of the reasonableness of the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 219.\n\n1133.\n\nOn the basis of the materials on record, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings breached Claimants' legitimate expectation to be treated fairly, reasonably and in good faith.

The Tribunal has already decided that these proceedings did not breach First Claimant's legitimate expectation to be treated fairly, reasonably and in good faith. For completeness, the Tribunal will address Claimants' additional arguments raised specifically on these points.\n\n1138.\n\nClaimants assert that the Criminal Investigation was \"beset with due process vulnerabilities that themselves constitute breaches of FET.\"1292 Claimants further submit that the Criminal Investigation was \"shrouded in conduct lacking transparency,\" infringing the due process rights of Second Claimant and its lawyer by failing to take their statements, attempting to criminalise a legally protected act, and using a retroactive application of a criminal statute.1293 For the same reasons as those set out at addressed by the Tribunal at \u00b6\u00b6 1126-1133 above with respect to legitimate expectations, the Tribunal rejects the assertion that these arguments establish a breach of FET on the basis of lack of due process or lack of transparency to Second Claimant and Second Claimant's External Counsel.\n\nReply \u00b6 548.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 318.\n\n1139.\n\nClaimants submit that the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings violated good faith as they were brought on the basis of the unsubstantiated and meritless allegations by the RGA Council.1294 In respect of the RGA Lawsuit, the Tribunal has held that RGA Council's concerns that were the subject of its special investigation and the RGA Lawsuit were not unreasonable, prejudicial or capricious, including with respect to the circumstances around the reclassification of the level of environmental risk of the Mamacocha Project (see \u00b6\u00b6 1076, 1084 above). These same considerations are relevant to the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings. The Tribunal is not in a position to find that there was no basis for them, and does not consider that the AEP \"should have never commenced\" the Criminal Investigation, as Claimants submit.1295\n\nMemorial \u00b6 314.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 314.\n\n1140.\n\nClaimants further assert that the AEP acted arbitrarily, *inter alia*, because the substance of the charges against Second Claimant's External Counsel concerned the \"mere act of signing an application for reconsideration on behalf of his client,\" which offends common sense and the Peruvian Constitution.1296 Respondent argues, on the other hand, that the charges against Second Claimant's External Counsel were not for filing the application in question, but for wilfully collaborating with public officials in the commission of a crime against the environment.1297\n\nMemorial \u00b6 316.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 701.\n\n1141.\n\nAs set out at \u00b6 1069 above, arbitrary conduct has no rational relationship with the purported goal of that measure or is otherwise unreasonable, prejudicial or capricious. Claimants have not established that the Criminal Investigation or Criminal Proceedings have no rational relationship with the goal of enforcing Peruvian law. Claimants' submissions, in this respect, require the Tribunal to make assumptions about the purpose of the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings that are not supported by the evidence on the record.\n\n1142.\n\nThe Tribunal is further not persuaded that the Criminal Proceedings are frivolous or a discriminatory measure targeted at \"killing\" the Project.1298 Like the RGA Lawsuit, Claimants have failed to establish that there was no reasonable justification for the Criminal Proceedings, assuming without deciding that it was different to the treatment given to other hydropower projects. The fact that the RGA Lawsuit and the Criminal Proceedings include allegations about the validity of ARMA's decisions which have not been raised against other hydropower projects is insufficient to establish discrimination, since the specific environmental circumstances of the Mamacocha Project may have brought to light other legal inquiries such as this.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 317, 320.\n\n1143.\n\nFor these reasons, the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings were not a violation of the FET standard for lack of good faith, arbitrariness, lack of transparency or discriminatory treatment. Aside from Claimants' other requests for relief that will be addressed below, the Tribunal finds no basis for Claimants' request for an order that Respondent \"cease and desist\" its harassment of Second Claimant and Second Claimant's External Counsel by terminating the Criminal Proceedings (see \u00b6 235(g) above).\n\n1144.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore does not need to decide upon Respondent's other arguments and objections, including that the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings did not prevent Claimants from reaching the Actual COS, and that the protections of the TPA do not extend to Second Claimant's External Counsel.1299\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 416, 680; Rejoinder \u00b6 221.\n\n***c. Civil Works Authorisation Permit***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1145.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent's measures with respect to the Project's CWA breached the FET standard.1300 For Claimants, the \"obstructive measures\" by the AAA and MINEM in the delayed and defective issuance of the CWA breached Claimants' legitimate expectations, violated transparency, were arbitrary, and were not undertaken in good faith but as part of a discriminatory effort to kill the Mamacocha Project.1301 Respondent denies the allegations.1302\n\nMemorial \u00b6 321.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 321-332. *See also* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 551-559.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 709 *et seq*.\n\n1146.\n\nThe CWA was required in order to begin construction on the Project since the Project was located on natural water sources.1303 The factual circumstances relating to the CWA were briefly set out at \u00b6\u00b6 151-158 above.

For Claimants, the issuance of a defective permit by AAA also deprived First Claimant of its legitimate expectation derived from the TUPA regulations that the permitting authorities would issue permits that are valid and free from defects.1324\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 321, 324; Reply \u00b6 199.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 324.\n\n1161.\n\nRespondent argues that the delays in the CWA process were largely due to deficiencies in Second Claimant's application and the nullity motion filed by private citizens.1325 It further submits that Claimants were already aware that there could be delays in the administrative process, including in relation to the AAA, due to delays that had already occurred before signing the RER Contract.1326 Respondent also disputes an expectation that the permit would be free from defects, citing the existence of an established procedure for rectifying errors as evidence against a standard of perfection.1327\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 711; R-PHB \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 712.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 714.\n\n1162.\n\nThe Tribunal finds in favour of Respondent on the reasonability of Claimants' expectations, in particular regarding the issuance of an error-free permit. The FET standard does not operate as a guarantee of error-free administrative decisions by government authorities. Importantly, in the present case, the permit in question was rectified following Second Claimant's request.\n\n1163.\n\nNor does the FET standard guarantee strict compliance by authorities with deadlines for processing permitting applications. While the legal frameworks and deadlines therein are relevant to an investor's expectations, it is necessary to examine the circumstances of a specific case to determine what is reasonable and when those reasonable expectations have been violated. Not every administrative deadline exceeded will be conduct which is \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic\" as required to establish a breach of the FET standard (see \u00b6 1019 above).\n\n1164.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants' account that the AAA \"exceeded its review deadlines\" by more than five months omits at least two occasions on which Second Claimant itself requested an extension of time for providing information that had been requested, first by 30 days,1328 followed by a request for suspension of the calculation period altogether (see \u00b6 1147 above).1329\n\nMemorial \u00b6 322; **R-045**, *Carta de HLA (C.

Osorio)*, 14 February 2017.\n\n1165.\n\nFor Claimants, the evaluation for the CWA should have been straightforward, and AAA's \"constant requests for further information\" were not necessary and were pretextual grounds to delay a decision.1330 Respondent argues that the requests for further information were necesary due to omissions and defects in the application, and Second Claimant was late to provide the addditional information.1331\n\nReply \u00b6 202.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 330-332.\n\n1166.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Claimants' characterisation that the AAA's requests for information were pretexts for delay, there being no basis for such a finding in the materials put before the Tribunal.\n\n1167.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the originally-granted CWA was defective, contending that these were \"*errores inocentes.*\"1332 Claimants have not asserted that the errors were deliberate. They argue that it is not necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether the errors were a reflection of administrative negligence or intentional sabotage, as in either case they are a breach of AAA's responsibility to approve permit applications diligently and within the timing of administrative regulations.1333 The Tribunal has already found First Claimant's expectations in this respect to exceed what is reasonably expected by an investor for treatment under the FET standard. Aside from exceeding statutory time limits, it has not been established that Respondent treated Claimants unfairly or failed to follow applicable procedures in the course of the CWA permitting process.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 228.\n\nReply \u00b6 203.\n\n1168.\n\nIn addition, the record shows that for almost the entire duration that Second Claimant's application for rectification of the CWA was pending (from 18 July 2017 to January 2018), Respondent's authorities were addressing an application for nullity against Second Claimant's CWA brought by private citizens (from 11 August 2017 to 24 January 2018) (see \u00b6\u00b6 1151, 1153, 1158, 1159 above).\n\n1169.\n\nRespondent submits that due to the application for nullity, the AAA was obliged to refer the administrative file to the Water Tribunal and it was legally impossible to accept the request for rectification while the file was transferred.1334 Claimants dispute that the AAA was prevented from issuing the CWA while it was under challenge by a private third party, and submit that there is no evidence of any injunction to that effect.1335 Claimants further dispute Respondent's submission that while the administrative file was with the Water Tribunal, the AAA was prevented from issuing a decision on the application for rectification.1336\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 337; *citing*, *inter alia*, **R-058**, *Oficio No. 2604-2017-ANA/AAA I C-O de la Autoridad Nacional del Agua (V.

The Tribunal notes, however, that contemporaneous correspondence from the AAA to the Water Tribunal does refer to the AAA having lost competence to handle that matter (\"...*en tal sentido al haber perdido competencia para emitir un pronunciamiento se remite para la prosecuci\u00f3n del tr\u00e1mite...*) (see \u00b6 1156 above).\n\n1171.\n\nIn all the circumstances of the present case, in which Respondent's authorities: (i) initially denied the CWA; (ii) upon application by Second Claimant, revised the initial determination and granted the CWA; and (iii) subsequently granted Second Claimant's request for rectification of the CWA, immediately after disposing of a challenge to the permit by private citizens, the Tribunal finds that Respondent's conduct does not rise to the threshold of constituting a breach of FET for failure to protect legitimate expectations. Crucially, the permit was granted and rectified.\n\n1172.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal does not find the prior arbitral decisions cited by Claimants to be analogous to, or be instructive for, the present case.1337\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 325; *citing* **CL-020**, *William Richard Clayton and others v.

Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 10 November 2017.\n\n1173.\n\nClaimants further submit that if the AAA exceeded its review period, Second Claimant had the legitimate expectation that MINEM would issue an extension to the RER Contract such as those issued in Addenda 1-2, which \"became the course of dealing\" between Second Claimant and Respondent under the RER Contract.1338 The Tribunal does not consider this expectation to be a reasonable one, and refers to its findings above on MINEM's role under the RER Contract in relation to permitting (see \u00b6\u00b6 663-677 above).\n\nReply \u00b6 199.\n\n1174.\n\nHaving rejected Claimants' arguments about the reasonability of First Claimant's expectations in relation to the CWA and finding no breach of FET in that regard, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to enter into further consideration of the arguments made about whether Claimants were delayed in filing the CWA application, whether the application was flawed, or whether the delayed granting of the CWA actually prevented Claimants from achieving financial closing or Actual COS.1339\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 327-330, 341-356; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 198, 200-201, 207-211; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 238- 246.\n\n*(ii) Transparency, Arbitrariness, Good Faith*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1175.\n\nWith respect to First Claimant's TPA claims, Claimants also submit that Respondent's conduct in respect to the CWA lacked transparency,1340 was arbitrary,1341 and lacked good faith.1342\n\nMemorial \u00b6 327.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 330.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 332.\n\n1176.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the circumstances around the CWA meet the threshold for a breach of FET on any of the grounds invoked by First Claimant.\n\n1177.\n\nIn relation to transparency, the Tribunal recalls its findings above with respect to the role of transparency in FET (see \u00b6 1024 above).\n\n1178.\n\nThe present circumstances are not ones which the Tribunal finds to reflect a lack of transparency arising to a breach of FET, for example where there was a complete lack of transparency in an administrative process or a failure to ensure that the legal framework is readily apparent and that any decision affecting the investor can be traced to that legal framework (see \u00b6 1024 above). Claimants assert that they were not kept fully informed of the status of the CWA, in the sense that their requests for updates were faced with administrative silence.1343 However, based on the record before it, the Tribunal is able to trace the administrative procedure and the legal framework within which it was made. To the extent that Claimants were not made aware at all times of the status of the proceedings before the Water Tribunal brought by private citizens, the Tribunal does not consider this to be conduct of the necessary seriousness to meet the high threshold for a breach of the FET standard (see \u00b6\u00b6 1147-1159 above).\n\nReply \u00b6 558.\n\n1179.\n\nIn addition, Claimants' assertion in support of the alleged lack of transparency that \"every measure that AAA took was ultimately reversed by ANA\"1344 is not an accurate representation of the record. Claimants' account is that following the initial rejection of the CWA in May 2017, \"upon appeal\", the central government's water authority, the ANA \"sided with CHM, rejected AAA's baseless challenge, and ordered AAA to reverse its decision and grant the permit.\"1345 Respondent disputes this account, asserting that the ANA never intervened to order that the CWA be granted.1346\n\nMemorial \u00b6 327.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 107; *citing* Bartrina First Statement \u00b6 65.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 333.\n\n1180.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to find support for Claimants' allegation based on the evidence in the record. Pursuant to the documents on record, Second Claimant's application for reconsideration was submitted to, and answered by, the AAA and not the ANA.1347 Even the evidence of Mr. Bartrina relied on by Claimants in support of this assertion does not state that the ANA ordered the AAA to reverse its decision and grant the permit. The relevant evidence of Mr. Bartina is that Second Claimant met with the ANA, which \"agreed that AAA's rejection of our permit request was unfounded and recommended that we file a motion for reconsideration.\"1348 That application was accordingly filed with the AAA, entailed further communication with the AAA, and was granted by the AAA.1349\n\n**R-053**, *Recurso de Reconsideraci\u00f3n*, 29 May 2017; **C-122**, *Resoluci\u00f3n Directoral Nro. 1928-2017-ANA/AAA I C-O*, 5 July 2017.\n\nBartrina First Statement \u00b6 65.\n\n**R-054**, *Carta de HLA (C.

The email contains updates concerning a number of ongoing matters related to the Project and associated legal proceedings. One of the items provides as follows:1353\n\nAs you have noted from Carlos' email, the files are now back to AAA from the water tribunal with an express request to resolve the material defects in the resolution for the works authorization.

Sillen to M. Jacobson, et al., 22 December 2017.\n\n1183.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to identify the \"express request\" from the Water Tribunal referred to by Mr. Sillen, whether in December 2017 or otherwise, by which the Water Tribunal ordered the AAA to reissue the permit. The evidence on file in this arbitration shows an internal AAA report in August 2017 recommending that the permit be revised as Second Claimant had requested, and that this reconsideration was ultimately granted.1354\n\n**R-088**, *Informe T\u00e9cnico No. 062-2017-ANA-AAA I C-O*, 11 August 2017, p. 2; **HKA-035**, *Resoluci\u00f3n Directoral Nro. 151-2018-ANA/AAA*, 25 January 2018.\n\n1184.\n\nFor the same reasons as those outlined at \u00b6\u00b6 1162-1171 and 1179-1183, the Tribunal also finds that Respondent's handling of the CWA permit was not arbitrary, and that Claimants' description of the events does not correspond to the evidence on record.\n\n1185.\n\nThe Tribunal likewise rejects the assertion that Respondent's conduct in relation to the CWA was in bad faith or part of a discriminatory effort to kill the Project.1355 There is insufficient basis on the record to support Claimants' arguments that the real reason for intransigence with respect to the permit was due to the RGA Lawsuit,1356 that the initial denial of the CWA in May 2017 was premised on a \"bogus claim\",1357 or that the AAA used its licensing authority to prevent the Project from moving forward.1358\n\nMemorial \u00b6 332; Reply \u00b6 559.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 332. *See also* Bartrina First Statement \u00b6 67; Bartrina Second Statement \u00b6 55: \"\u2026in late 2017, we learned through members of our team that\u2026AAA's then-manager, was reluctant to correct the defective [CWA] Permit because of the pending RGA Lawsuit.\"\n\nReply \u00b6 559. *See also* Bartrina First Statement \u00b6 64.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 332.\n\n***d. Commencement of the Lima Arbitration***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1186.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent breached the FET standard when MINEM commenced the Lima Arbitration on 27 December 2018.1359 Respondent denies this ground of First Claimant's claim.1360\n\nMemorial \u00b6 334; Reply \u00b6 560.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 731; Rejoinder \u00b6 723.\n\n*(i) Implications of Findings under the RER Contract*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1187.\n\nThe Tribunal notes its finding in relation to the RER Contract that MINEM did not breach the RER Contract by initiating the Lima Arbitration (see \u00b6 884 above). Specifically, the Tribunal held that the filing of the Lima Arbitration was \"a legitimate exercise of the possibility for domestic arbitration foreseen in the RER Contract, and an option which Claimants were aware of\" (see \u00b6 882 above).\n\n1188.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls Tribunal Question 12 to the Parties (also extracted at \u00b6 570 above), as follows:\n\nAssuming without admitting the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal over Claimants' claims under the Treaty and the RER Contract, should the Arbitral Tribunal consider and decide first on the contractual claims of Second Claimant?\n\n(i) If so, what is the relevance, if any, of such considerations and decisions on the BIT claims of Latam Hydro?\n\n(ii) Conversely, if the BIT claims are decided first, what is the relevance, if any, of the decisions on the BIT claims for the contractual claims of Second Claimant?\n\n1189.\n\nClaimants argue that these two claims are \"independent branches or approaches to liability\" and their preference is for the Tribunal \"to decide both in the interests of justice and a complete resolution of the dispute.\"1361\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1970:15-22.\n\n1190.\n\nRespondent submits that if the Tribunal concludes that MINEM did not violate the RER Contract, then First Claimant's treaty claims on this ground must fail.1362 Respondent further submits that for any of First Claimant's claims under the TPA to succeed, it needs to prove that Respondent violated the RER Contract, acting in its sovereign capacity, and in breach of the applicable TPA provisions.1363\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2090:13-18.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2091:6-13. *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 783-786.\n\n1191.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract and First Claimant's claims under the TPA have an independent legal basis, and are decided as such by the Tribunal. In this Award, the Tribunal has first set out its decisions in relation to the RER Contract before turning to the TPA. However, the existence of the RER Contract, the contractual relationship between Second Claimant and Respondent, and the Tribunal's determinations in relation thereto has relevance for the Tribunal's decisions on First Claimant's claims under the TPA, beyond the overlapping factual scenario.\n\n1192.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has already reached a number of determinations under the RER Contract which have entailed the rejection of Second Claimant's contractual claims. The question is therefore not whether a breach of a contract may in addition constitute a breach of a treaty. The question is rather whether, in the absence of a breach of contract, Respondent can be held to violate the TPA in relation to the same conduct.\n\n1193.\n\nProvided that the conduct in question is carried out under the RER Contract (and not independently of the RER Contract as an exercise of sovereign authority), the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that if a specific ground of Second Claimant's contractual claim has failed, the corresponding claim for breach of the TPA based on the same circumstances falls away. If the Tribunal has held that Respondent acted within the bounds of its contractual rights and obligations, that same conduct cannot meet the threshold of unfair or inequitable treatment contrary to the FET standard under the TPA.\n\n1194.\n\nThis echoes a finding of the arbitral tribunal in *R\u00edos v. Chile*:1364\n\n...*para comprometer la responsabilidad internacional del Estado por la violaci\u00f3n de un tratado de inversi\u00f3n el Estado debe haber actuado en ejercicio de prerrogativas soberanas, y no como parte en una relaci\u00f3n contractual.

Rep\u00fablica de Chile*, Caso CIADI No. ARB/17/16, Laudo, 11 January 2021, \u00b6 259.\n\n1195.\n\nAs further stated in the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, \"[t]he breach by a State of a contract does not as such entail a breach of international law. Something further is required before international law becomes relevant...\"1365\n\n**CL-072**, Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentary, Art. 4, \u00b6 6.\n\n1196.\n\nIn the present case, Respondent was in a contractual relationship with Second Claimant, which relationship was governed by the terms of the RER Contract and applicable law. The Tribunal does not consider that Respondent entered into the RER Contract in its sovereign capacity.\n\n1197.\n\nIt is not excluded that in specific circumstances, a sovereign may be held in breach of a treaty for conduct that purportedly took place under a contractual relationship. That would typically be the case in the situation of an appropriately worded umbrella clause. While other examples of responsibility under a treaty for contractual conduct are very limited, in the case of *Crystallex v. Venezuela* relied on by Claimants,1366 the arbitral tribunal found that while the disputed measure was a termination of a contract for an alleged contractual ground, \"the true nature of the act...was one of exercise of sovereign authority.\"1367 In order to give due consideration to this possibility, the Tribunal will consider whether each disputed measure in question was a contractual one or an exercise of sovereign authority by Respondent. Subject to that assessment, where the conduct in question is undertaken by Respondent in the context of the contractual relationship under the RER Contract, it will ordinarily be in the capacity of contracting party to the RER Contract.\n\nReply \u00b6 605; *quoting* **CL-026**, *Crystallex International Corporation v.

On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that the true nature of the act of commencing the Lima Arbitration was as a contractual party and not as a sovereign. The arbitration proceedings were initiated, carried out and decided upon within the framework of the RER Contract. The Tribunal finds the assertion of a State policy to destroy the Mamacocha Project to be unsubstantiated, either in general or specifically by way of the Lima Arbitration.\n\n1203.\n\nAs a matter of contract, the Tribunal has found that the Lima Arbitration was \"a legitimate exercise of the possibility for domestic arbitration foreseen in the RER Contract, and an option which Claimants were aware of\" (see \u00b6 882 above). Also relevant are other findings made in relation to the RER Contract, including that: (i) the initiation of the Lima Arbitration was not a failure to act in good faith as required by Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code (see \u00b6 917 above); (ii) commencement of the Lima Arbitration was not a breach of the *actos propios* doctrine, since there was a valid reason to pursue the arbitration on the basis that MINEM believed Addendum 2 to be issued contrary to the mandatory provisions of the RER Regulations, the *Bases Consolidadas* and the RER Contract (see \u00b6 931 above); and (iii) while it would have been courteous to inform Claimants of the claim to be filed in the Lima Arbitration, the Tribunal does not consider the obligation of good faith, or any specific provision of the agreement between Claimants and the Special Commission in force at the time, to require Respondent to give Claimants advance warning of the filing of those claims (see \u00b6 916 above). In the Tribunal's view, these findings are inconsistent with a conclusion that Respondent failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants on the grounds put forward.\n\n1204.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes its acknowledgement at \u00b6\u00b6 823 and 904-905 above regarding the difficulty posed by MINEM's conduct in entering into Addenda 1 and especially Addenda 2, and subsequently disavowing those Addenda, as a matter of good faith and consistency in interpretation of the RER Contract. This relates, in particular, to the extension granted in Addendum 2 and the views expressed by MINEM in the Sosa Report and the Ministerial Resolutions accompanying Addenda 1 and 2 mentioned at \u00b6 815 above, i.e.: (i) the extension by Addendum 2 of the Actual COS to a date falling more than two years beyond the Reference COS; (ii) the meaning of \"for any reason\" in Clause 8.4 of the RER Contract; and (iii) the indication in the Ministerial Resolution No. 559-2016-MEM/DM that the Actual COS \"does not constitute an essential term.\"\n\n1205.\n\nHowever, as noted, this difficulty does not give the Tribunal liberty to rewrite the agreement reached in the RER Contract, or to disregard the binding provisions of the RER Regulations to the effect that the Actual COS was required to take place by a date two years beyond the Reference COS, and that the Termination Date of the Contract could not be moved beyond 31 December 2036. Respondent's conduct in initiating the Lima Arbitration and challenging Addenda 1 and 2 was loyal to and consistent with the applicable binding legal regime, which is equally relevant to assessing the good faith of Respondent's actions. While lacking in full consistency, Respondent's conduct in challenging those Addenda by way of the Lima Arbitration therefore does not rise to the level of treatment contrary to the FET standard.\n\n1206.\n\nIn light of these findings and all of the conclusions reached in relation to the RER Contract, the Tribunal considers that MINEM's initiation of the Lima Arbitration was not lacking in transparency, arbitrary, lacking in good faith or contrary to First Claimant's legitimate expectations. The Tribunal therefore rejects First Claimant's claim for breach of the FET standard on this ground.\n\n1207.\n\nClaimants have further raised an argument based on the customary international law principle of estoppel.1375 According to Claimants, the principle of estoppel obliges a State to be consistent with regard to a factual or legal situation.1376 In their view, this prevents Respondent from contending that Addenda 1 and 2 of the RER Contract are invalid, because Respondent, through its representative, executed the Addenda, creating an expectation of validity.1377\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 642 *et seq*.\n\nReply \u00b6 643; *quoting* Schreuer Report \u00b6 42.\n\nReply \u00b6 650.\n\n1208.\n\nIn response, Respondent submits that: (i) Claimants' estoppel argument is inadmissible as it was only made in the Reply, which should be confined to responding to the first round of submissions;1378 (ii) by a plain reading of TPA Article 10.5 (see \u00b6 1007 above), it does not include the principle of estoppel;1379 and (iii) the customary international law requirements to establish estoppel are not met because the Peruvian State did not benefit from the extensions set forth in Addenda 1 and 2, and those Addenda were adopted in good faith.1380\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 903-904.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 909.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 916.\n\n1209.\n\nClaimants submit that estoppel applies in circumstances where there is a statement or representation made by one party to another and reliance upon it by that party to its detriment or to the advantage of the party making it.1381 Respondent's criteria are not materially different, i.e., that: (i) there was a clear and unequivocal statement of fact; (ii) the statement must have been voluntary, unequivocal and authorised; (iii) the party receiving the statement has acted to its detriment on the basis of the statement and/or that the party that formulated the declaration has benefited.1382\n\nReply \u00b6 644; *quoting* **CL-238**, *Case Concerning the Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v.

In light of the Tribunal's other conclusions reached in this Award with respect to the legal regime applicable to Addenda 1 and 2, good faith considerations under the RER Contract, the denial of the Third Extension Request, and the initiation of the Lima Arbitration, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent should be estopped from making \"various arguments in this arbitration concerning the alleged invalidity of Addenda 1 and 2,\" as Claimants request.1384 Claimants' mere assertion that the Addenda \"induced Claimants to invest further\" in the Project is further insufficient to establish an estoppel. Moreover, it is unclear that the estoppel sought by Claimants would be determinative for the conclusions reached in relation to Claimants' claims.\n\nReply \u00b6 651.\n\n***e. Denial of CH Mamacocha's Third Extension Request***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1212.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent breached the FET standard when it denied Second Claimant's Third Extension Request under the RER Contract.1385 Claimants argue that this measure denied First Claimant's legitimate expectations, lacked transparency, was arbitrary, and lacked good faith.1386 Respondent denies a breach of the FET standard on this ground.1387\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 345-355; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 566-578.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 347, 350, 352, 354.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 742-755; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 761-786.\n\n1213.\n\nIn relation to the denial of Second Claimant's Third Extension Request, the Tribunal made a number of findings under the RER Contract, including that the RER Contract contained no guaranteed 20-year term of validity in respect of the Guaranteed Revenue (see \u00b6 725 above). In addition, the Tribunal held at \u00b6 843:\n\nRespondent did not breach the RER Contract by rejecting Second Claimant's Third Extension Request. Neither the RER Contract nor Peruvian law provide an entitlement to an extension of the Actual COS or the Termination Date of the Contract or an obligation on Respondent to grant one. To the contrary, such an extension would have been inconsistent with the terms of the RER Contract and binding provisions of the RER Regulations.\n\n1214.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal's findings on the denial of the Third Extension Request in relation to the RER Contract that this same denial is not a breach of the FET standard. The denial of the Third Extension Request was consistent with, and required by, the applicable legal regime at that time.\n\n1215.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the denial of the Third Extension Request was part of a \"sudden and complete reversal\" of Respondent's legal approaches to the Mamacocha Project and a \"classic illustration of regulatory opportunism.\"1388 In their view, this measure was taken through the exercise of public authority. They argue that the governmental, rather than commercial, nature of the acts is evidenced by the fact that the Addenda to the RER Contract were approved through a series of government approvals and authorisations.1389\n\nReply \u00b6 216. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 352.\n\nC-PHB \u00b6 24.\n\n1216.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that this is the case. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that the true nature of the act of denying the Third Extension Request was as a contractual party and not as sovereign. The denial of the Third Extension Request (like the execution of the Addenda to the RER Contract) was carried out within the framework of the RER Contract. The fact that there are procedural and administrative formalities of contracting with a sovereign does not translate those contractual acts into governmental ones.\n\n1217.\n\nIn addition, the denial of the Third Extension Request was consistent with the law. Being consistent with the law, it was not an arbitrary decision without a rational decision-making process, as Claimants allege.1390\n\nMemorial \u00b6 353.\n\n1218.\n\nClaimants have further not successfully established that the real reason for the denial of the Third Extension Request was because it was a politically advantageous way to avoid an over-supply crisis in the energy sector.1391 Nor were MINEM's actions sovereign \"government meddling\" as alleged by Claimants.1392\n\nMemorial \u00b6 354.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6 352.\n\n1219.\n\nClaimants' reliance on the Statement of Reasons published by MINEM in relation to the Draft Supreme Decree is likewise misplaced.1393 The Draft Supreme Decree will be further discussed at \u00b6\u00b6 1225-1227 below. The Statement of Reasons does not affirm an obligation under Peruvian and international law to grant extensions to projects to rectify government interferences. It merely includes a general objective to \"[a]void the diversion of resources in national and international arbitrations\" and \"reduce the liability of the entities involved.\"1394 The fact that Respondent prepared the Draft Supreme Decree but following public consultation ultimately did not proceed with the legislation, or the fact that the Statement of Reasons included these statements but the extension was not granted is not a *volte face* on risk allocation or a flip-flop on the extension.1395 Claimants appear to invoke the Statement of Reasons as a public statement of MINEM's position rather than the Draft Supreme Decree legislation itself.1396 In either case, the denial of the Third Extension Request was not unfair or inequitable treatment contrary to the FET standard.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 350; Reply \u00b6 574.\n\n**C-018**, Proposed Supreme Decree No. 453-2018-MEM/DM, 11 November 2018, p. 5.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 350; Reply \u00b6 574.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 574.\n\n1220.\n\nFor the above reasons, the denial of the Third Extension Request was not a violation of First Claimant's legitimate expectations, lacking in transparency, arbitrary, or lacking in good faith in a manner which is grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, or otherwise contrary to the standard set out at \u00b6\u00b6 1013-1014 and 1019 above.\n\n***f. Circumstances as a Whole***\n---------------------------------\n\n1221.\n\nIn addition to examining each ground of First Claimant's FET claim individually, the Tribunal has considered the circumstances as a whole as presented to the Tribunal, including all of the alleged individual bases of the FET claim. Taken together, the Tribunal maintains its conclusion that Respondent's treatment of Claimants was not contrary to the FET standard of the TPA.\n\n1222.\n\nWhile Claimants faced several obstacles in the course of the Mamacocha Project, these can fundamentally be traced back to constraints imposed by mandatory provisions of law relevant to the deadlines under the RER Contract. These deadlines were agreed to by Second Claimant at the relevant time, in full knowledge of the potential for delays and the \"hard stop\" set out in Clause 8.4 thereof.\n\n1223.\n\nAs the record demonstrates, over the course of the Mamacocha Project, MINEM and the Special Commission made efforts to support Claimants in certain of the challenges they faced. Ultimately, the efforts were not successful. The Tribunal does not find Claimants' characterisation of Respondent's conduct as a \"pivot\" in late 2018 from its \"long-held interpretation\" of the RER Contract to measures which killed the Project to add to the analysis.1397 Even after December 2018, MINEM continued to support the legality of Second Claimant's environmental permits in the Amparo Action, even if those submissions are not aligned with the position taken by Respondent in this arbitration (see \u00b6\u00b6 135-136 above).1398\n\n*See* **CD-06**, Claimants' Closing Presentation, slide 95; C-PHB \u00b6 10; C-PHB, Annotated Index, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n*See* Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2115:15-2116:8; R-PHB \u00b6\u00b6 12-14; Claimants' Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 1969:5-12. *See also* Tribunal Question 18A:  \n\"The Tribunal understands that the Amparo Action was initiated on 13 September 2016 by a private citizen, P. J. Begazo L\u00f3pez, against various authorities of Respondent. In those proceedings, Claimants argue that some of the defendant authorities took positions in support of the validity of the environmental permits on which Claimants rely (*see* Reply \u00b6 293), and that authorities of Respondent continued to take that position on appeal, but were ultimately overruled in 2020 and 2021 (*see* **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, Slides 48-49, **C-305/R-070**, **C-295**).  \nOn the other hand, the Tribunal understands that Respondent's authorities: (i) on 27 December 2018, decided not to proceed with the draft Supreme Decree to amend the RER Regulations (**C-175/R-104**); (ii) on 27 December 2018, commenced the \"Lima Arbitration\" against Second Claimant, *inter alia*, seeking the annulment of Addenda 1 and 2 to the RER Contract (**C-097**); and (iii) on 31 December 2018, rejected Second Claimant's request for an extension under the RER Contract to the COS date and the Termination Date (**MQ-026**).  \nIs there a difference in position taken by Respondent's authorities with respect to the above? If so, what is the significance, if any, for this arbitration?\"\n\n1224.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has expressed its concerns with respect to certain aspects of Respondent's conduct in the course of this Award, among other things by entering into and subsequently disavowing Addenda 1 and 2, Claimants' attempt to link the various obstacles suffered by the Mamacocha Project as a concerted or deliberate plan by Respondent to destroy the Project is not borne out by the evidence on record.\n\n1225.\n\nThe Tribunal further wishes to note that while Claimants have not invoked the circumstances around the non-passage of the Draft Supreme Decree as a basis for First Claimant's FET claim, in other parts of their submissions Claimants have referred to the Draft Supreme Decree as forming part of Respondent's alleged \"multi-prong litigation strategy to unwind the RER projects,\"1399 and argue that it was part of a \"sudden and complete reversal of [Respondent's] legal approaches to the Mamacocha Project\" and \"a classic illustration of regulatory opportunism.\"1400 According to Claimants, the Draft Supreme Decree was further not necessary because the existing legal regulations allowed MINEM to grant extensions, so it would only have \"codified what was already accepted legal jurisprudence.\"1401\n\nReply \u00b6 14. *See also* Reply \u00b6 224.\n\nReply \u00b6 216. *See also* Reply \u00b6 234.\n\nReply \u00b6 234.\n\n1226.\n\nRespondent opposes Claimants' characterisation of the Draft Supreme Decree, denying that there was any assurance that it would be approved.1402 According to Respondent, following public consultation, MINEM concluded that the Draft Supreme Decree would have unlawfully affected the rights of and legal certainty for third parties, by retroactively modifying the premises on which investors had made a decision whether or not to participate in the Third Auction.1403\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 305.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 307-308. *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 278-284; R-PHB \u00b6 77.\n\n1227.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty with Claimants' position that, on the one hand, the Draft Supreme Decree was unnecessary while, on the other hand, relying on Respondent's alleged acknowledgement that it *was* a necessary amendment of the legal regime.1404 In any event, the Tribunal does not accept that the non-passage of the Draft Supreme Decree was part of a strategy to destroy the Project. This legislative process came to a halt following a transparent process of public consultation1405 and there is no evidence to support Claimants' contention that it was abandoned for political reasons.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 215.\n\n*See* comments received in written submissions such as **R-108**, *Observaciones remitidas por Kallpa Generaci\u00f3n S.A* and **R-133**, *Observaciones remitidas por Inland Energy, Registro No. 2874802*, 23 November 2018.\n\n**(4) Conclusion on FET**\n-------------------------\n\n1228.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not breach the FET standard of the TPA and rejects First Claimant's claims to that effect. The Tribunal accordingly denies Claimants' request for a declaration that Respondent has breached Article 10.5 of the TPA (see \u00b6 236(a) above).\n\n**C. A lleged I ndirect E xpropriation under TPA A rticle 10.7**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1229.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent indirectly expropriated First Claimant's rights in the Mamacocha Project, contrary to TPA Article 10.7.1406 Specifically, Claimants submit that the Mamacocha Project was indirectly expropriated through three principal and interrelated measures, being: (i) the RGA Lawsuit; (ii) the denial of the Third Extension Request; and (iii) the Lima Arbitration.1407\n\nReply \u00b6 579.\n\nReply \u00b6 579.\n\n1230.\n\nAlternatively, Claimants contend that Respondent's measures constituted an indirect expropriation of their investments in the form of a \"creeping\" expropriation, comprised of a series of seven measures which cumulatively impaired the value of the Project.1408 These were: (i) the commencement of the RGA Lawsuit; (ii) the AEP's Criminal Investigation; (iii) the AAA's initial denial of Second Claimant's CWA; (iv) the AAA's issuance of a materially defective CWA; (v) the AEP's decision to formalise and continue the Criminal Proceedings, including naming Second Claimant's External Counsel as a suspect; (vi) MINEM's commencement of the Lima Arbitration; and (vii) MINEM's rejection of the Third Extension Request.1409\n\nReply \u00b6 581.\n\nReply \u00b6 614.\n\n1231.\n\nRespondent denies that an expropriation of Claimants' investment took place. In its view, the alleged measures do not meet the required criteria of the TPA, there was no interconnection between the measures or a pattern that would constitute a composite act, and Claimants have failed to prove that each of the measures had an adverse impact on their investment.1410\n\nR-PHB \u00b6 111.\n\n1232.\n\nIn order to decide upon the expropriation claim, the Tribunal will consider the applicable standard in Section (1) below. Section (2) contains the summary of the United States' NDP Submission on this issue and the Parties' comments thereon. Section (3) addresses the issue of interference with reasonable expectations, while Section (4) covers the character of the government action. Section (5) concerns other aspects of indirect expropriation, and the Tribunal concludes this issue in Section (6).\n\n**(1) Applicable Standard**\n---------------------------\n\n1233.\n\nThe standard for expropriation under Article 10.7 of the TPA is set out at \u00b6 1008 above. Claimants do not allege a direct expropriation of First Claimant's investments, but an indirect expropriation.1411 Pursuant to Annex 10-B of the Treaty (see \u00b6 1010 above), an indirect expropriation takes place where \"an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\" As such, whether under Claimants' primary or alternative arguments set out at \u00b6\u00b6 1229 and1230 above, the relevant criteria of an indirect expropriation in Annex 10-B, paragraph 3 of the TPA apply (see \u00b6 1010 above).\n\nMemorial \u00b6 361.\n\n1234.\n\nWhile they have differing interpretations of the criteria, the Parties are in agreement that a determination of whether an indirect expropriation has taken place under Annex 10-B of the TPA involves analysing, *inter alia*: (i) the economic impact of the government action; (ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (iii) the character of the government action.1412\n\nMemorial \u00b6 361; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 767; Reply \u00b6 588; Rejoinder \u00b6 788.\n\n1235.\n\nThese three criteria are drawn from paragraph 3(a) of TPA Annex 10-B, which specifies that the determination of whether an indirect expropriation has taken place \"requires\" an \"inquiry that considers, among other factors,\" these three elements (see \u00b6 1010 above). The mandatory language of \"requires\" means that all three factors must be taken into account, without dictating the relative weight to be attributed to each of them. As per paragraph 3(a)(i) of Annex 10-B, however, \"the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred.\" Taking into account that paragraph 3 also indicates that the inquiry is to be \"case-by-case\" and \"fact-based\", it follows that it is for the Tribunal to make its determination in all the circumstances, as long as these three factors are included in its assessment, and that the specification with respect to adverse economic effect is respected.\n\n1236.\n\nIn the following Section, the Tribunal will summarise the NDP Submission and comments thereon. Having reviewed the Parties' respective submissions on whether First Claimant's investments were indirectly expropriated,1413 the Tribunal will thereafter consider the criteria (ii) and (iii) in \u00b6 1234 above, before turning to determine other matters as appropriate.\n\n*See* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 359-382; Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 756-829; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 579-624; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 787-862.\n\n**(2) NDP Submission**\n----------------------\n\n***a. The U.S. NDP Submission***\n--------------------------------\n\n1237.\n\nIn its NDP Submission, the United States provided its interpretation regarding the relevant test for determining indirect expropriations (TPA Article 10.7).\n\n1238.\n\nThe United States refers to the relevant factors that an arbitral tribunal adjudicating a claim of indirect expropriation must consider, in its view, pursuant to Annex 10-B, paragraph 3(a) of the TPA: (i) the economic impact of the government action (*i.e.*, whether the measure in question \"destroyed all, or virtually all, of the economic value of its investment, or interfered with it to such a similar extent\"); (ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, which is linked to the regulatory situation at the time of the investment; and (iii) the character of the government actions.1414\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 33-37.\n\n1239.\n\nMoreover, the United States contends that the wording in Annex 10-B, paragraph 3(b) of the TPA that \"non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives\" do not constitute indirect expropriations, should not be construed as an exception, but as additional guidance for tribunals to assess whether an indirect expropriation has occurred.1415\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6 37.\n\n***b. Claimants' Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1240.\n\nClaimants mention that the United States' observations regarding the expropriation provision of the TPA merely summarize its text and neither add nor detract from either Party's prior submissions.1416\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6 95.\n\n***c. Respondent's Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1241.\n\nRespondent contends that the United States agrees with it on the correct test that the Tribunal shall apply when assessing the existence of an expropriation under TPA Article 10.7. Respondent argues that, contrary to the \"substantial deprivation\" test invoked by Claimants, the NDP Submission confirms that, to prove an expropriation under the TPA, Claimants must establish that the government measures in question \"destroyed all, or virtually all, of the economic value of its investment, or interfered with it to such an extent and so restrictively as to support a conclusion that the property has been taken.\"1417\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.\n\n**(3) Interference with Reasonable Expectations**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1242.\n\nParagraph 3(a)(ii) of Annex 10-B to the TPA provides that the determination of whether an action or series of actions constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a fact-based inquiry that considers \"the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations\" (see \u00b6 1010 above).\n\n1243.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the assessment of reasonable expectations for the purposes of an expropriation claim under the TPA is \"akin to legitimate expectations under FET.\"1418 In Respondent's view, the applicable standard for reasonable expectations in the context of expropriation under the TPA is more demanding than the legitimate expectations under FET.1419\n\nMemorial \u00b6 362.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 803; *citing* **RL-046**, *Carlos R\u00edos y Francisco R\u00edos c. Rep\u00fablica de Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/16, Award, 11 January 2021, \u00b6 258.\n\n1244.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide on whether the standard of reasonable expectations for the purpose of an expropriation claim under the TPA is more demanding than the FET standard. Even taking the standard proposed by Claimants as a reference, the Tribunal has rejected First Claimant's claim that Respondent breached its legitimate expectations under the FET claim with respect to: (i) the RGA Lawsuit (see \u00b6\u00b6 1065-1066 above); (ii) the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings (see \u00b6 1133 above); (iii) the CWA, including its initial denial and subsequent defective issuance (see \u00b6\u00b6 1171, 1173 above); (iv) the commencement of the Lima Arbitration (see \u00b6 1206 above); and (v) the denial of the Third Extension Request (see \u00b6 1220 above).\n\n1245.\n\nThese determinations of the Tribunal cover the circumstances invoked by First Claimant in both its primary and alternative arguments on indirect expropriation (see \u00b6\u00b6 1229 and 1230 above). As such, the Tribunal finds that the actions alleged by Claimants to constitute an indirect expropriation did not interfere with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations as provided by the TPA.\n\n**(4) Character of the Government Action**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1246.\n\nParagraph 3(a)(iii) of Annex 10-B to the TPA further provides that the determination of whether an action or series of actions constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a fact-based inquiry that considers \"the character of the government action\" (see \u00b6 1010 above).\n\n1247.\n\nIn Claimants' view, this element is \"akin to the discriminatory and good-faith components under the FET standard.\"1420 For Respondent, on the other hand, this criterion refers to the requirement that a State may only be held responsible for the violation of an investment treaty if the State acted in exercise of its sovereign prerogatives and not as a contracting party.1421 Claimants do not specifically dispute Respondent's assertion, rather arguing that the measures were plainly carried out in Respondent's capacity as a sovereign authority.1422\n\nMemorial \u00b6 362.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 783; Rejoinder \u00b6 805; R-PHB \u00b6 110.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 605-606.\n\n1248.\n\nFirst Claimant's claim for indirect expropriation fails under both perspectives of the character of the measures in question.\n\n1249.\n\nWith respect to the commencement of the Lima Arbitration and the denial of the Third Extension Request, the Tribunal has determined at \u00b6\u00b6 1200-1203 and 1215-1218 above that the measures in question were undertaken by Respondent as contracting party to the RER Contract and not under the sovereign prerogative of Respondent. For that reason, these measures cannot be expropriatory.\n\n1250.\n\nIt should be noted that while Claimants contend that Respondent's argument \"implicitly concedes that Peru executed the RER Contract in its sovereign capacity,\"1423 the Tribunal does not understand that to be the case. Respondent's argument is precisely the opposite, i.e., that the initiation of the Lima Arbitration and the rejection of the Third Extension Request were acts by Respondent, through MINEM, as contractual party and not an exercise of sovereign powers.1424\n\nReply \u00b6 604.\n\n*See* Rejoinder \u00b6 807.\n\n1251.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has separately rejected First Claimant's claim that Respondent's conduct was arbitrary, discriminatory or lacking in good faith contrary to the FET standard of the TPA in respect of: (i) the RGA Lawsuit (see \u00b6\u00b6 1085, 1100 above); (ii) the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings (see \u00b6 1143 above); and (iii) the CWA, including its initial denial and subsequent defective issuance (see \u00b6\u00b6 1178, 1184, 1185 above).\n\n1252.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal rejects Claimants' argument that those same measures were not *bona fide* government measures because they arbitrarily and discriminatorily targeted the Mamacocha Project.1425 The same applies to the initiation of the Lima Arbitration and the denial of the Third Extension Request. These were contractual and not sovereign measures by nature, and the Tribunal has found that they did not breach the RER Contract, and did not breach the Peruvian Civil Code with respect to the obligation to act in good faith or otherwise. Accordingly, this conduct was also not arbitrary, discriminatory or lacking in good faith.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 603.\n\n**(5) Other Aspects of Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1253.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's findings with respect to reasonable expectations under Annex 10-B of the TPA and the character of the government actions, the Tribunal does not consider any of the actions invoked by Claimants, whether taken individually or together, to constitute an indirect expropriation within the meaning of TPA Article 10.7 and Annex 10-B, whether understood as a single action or a \"creeping expropriation\" by a series of actions. As mentioned at \u00b6 1235 above, under paragraph 3(a)(i) of Annex 10-B, \"the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred.\" It follows from the Tribunal's conclusions in relation to reasonable expectations and the character of the government actions that these factors do not support a determination of the existence of an indirect expropriation. In the circumstances, an adverse economic impact alone does not constitute an indirect expropriation.\n\n1254.\n\nIt is therefore unnecessary to give further consideration to the other aspects of indirect expropriation, such as the economic impact of the contested measures. The Tribunal will not enter into a detailed analysis of the Parties' other arguments in respect of those matters, which are also disputed. Specifically, the Tribunal makes no finding regarding whether the contested measures had sufficient adverse economic impact to meet the standard of indirect expropriation.\n\n1255.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusions, it is not necessary to consider whether any expropriation of First Claimant's investments complied with the requirements in TPA Article 10.7 regarding compensation, due process, etc., there being no expropriation in the present case.\n\n(6) **Conclusion on Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1256.\n\nIn light of the above findings, the Tribunal rejects First Claimant's claim for indirect expropriation under the TPA. In doing so, the Tribunal wishes to emphasise that its findings are also a rejection of Claimants' narrative that each of the seven measures are interconnected events forming part of a \"linked, cumulative effort to stop, stall and eventually destroy the Project.\"1426 While the Tribunal has expressed its concerns with respect to certain aspects of Respondent's conduct in the course of this Award, among other things by entering into and subsequently disavowing Addenda 1 and 2, as held at \u00b6 1223 above, Claimants' attempt to link the various obstacles suffered by the Mamacocha Project as a concerted or deliberate plan by Respondent to destroy the Project is not borne out by the evidence on record.\n\nReply \u00b6 623.\n\n1257.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the non-passage of the Draft Supreme Decree was not invoked by Claimants as one of the seven measures forming part of the creeping expropriation. However, it is referred to by Claimants as one of the three measures in December 2018 that were part of a \"litigation strategy by MINEM to end the economic viability of the Project.\" This alleged strategy comprised: (i) the revocation of the Draft Supreme Decree that would have provided a \"lifeline\" to the Project; (ii) the denial of the Third Extension Request; and (iii) the commencing of the Lima Arbitration.1427\n\nReply \u00b6 622.\n\n1258.\n\nAs already found by the Tribunal, the denial of the Third Extension Request and the commencement of the Lima Arbitration are both related to the constraints imposed by mandatory provisions of law relevant to the deadlines under the RER Contract. In line with its considerations at \u00b6 1227 above, the Tribunal also dismisses Claimants' submission that the Draft Supreme Decree was abandoned for political reasons or reflected an intention to destroy the Project.\n\n1259.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects Claimants' request for a declaration that Respondent has breached TPA Article 10.7 with respect to First Claimant and its investments (see \u00b6 235(a) above).\n\n**D. A lleged B reach OF MFN C lause under TPA A rticle 10.4**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1260.\n\nTPA Article 10.4 (\"**MFN Clause**\") sets out the TPA obligation to provide Most-Favoured Nation (\"**MFN**\") treatment to investors of another Party and covered investments (see \u00b6 1006above). Claimants assert that Respondent breached this provision with respect to First Claimant and its investments.\n\n1261.\n\nSection (1) below summarises the United States' NDP Submission and the Parties' comments thereon. Section (2) contains the Parties' positions on this issue. Section (3) sets out the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**(1) NDP Submission**\n----------------------\n\n***a. The U.S. NDP Submission***\n--------------------------------\n\n1262.\n\nIn its NDP Submission, the United States provided its interpretation regarding the conditions for establishing a breach of the MFN Clause (TPA Article 10.4).\n\n1263.\n\nIn the United States' view, the claimant must prove that it or its investment: (i) were accorded \"treatment\"; (ii) were in \"like circumstances\" with other identified investors or investments; and (iii) the treatment received was \"less favorable\" than the one granted to those identified investors or investments - and that the measure at issue is not subject to the exceptions contained in Annex II of the TPA.1428 Moreover, the treatment identified by a claimant must correspond to treatment actually being accorded with respect to an investor or investment of a non-TPA Party or another TPA Party in like circumstances, and not a mere speculation on how a hypothetical measure would be applied.1429\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6\u00b6 38-41.\n\nNDP Submission \u00b6 42.\n\n***b. Claimants' Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1264.\n\nClaimants submit that the NDP Submission does not address Claimants' prior allegations that they are entitled to rely on the more favourable substantive protections accorded by Respondent in other investment treaties. Instead, Claimants argue that the United States has merely put forward a restrictive interpretation of the MFN Clause that is contrary to the ordinary meaning of TPA Article 10.4 and established practice.1430\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 78-94.\n\n1265.\n\nIn particular, Claimants argue that: (i) based on the \"ordinary meaning\" criterion of Article 31 of the VCLT, the language of TPA Article 10.4 does not limit the application of the MFN Clause to measures that have been \"adopted or, maintained\" nor does it preclude the possibility to import more favourable provisions in treaties with other States, which Claimants describe as an \"established practice\";1431 (ii) by merely reserving the right to adopt or maintain nonconforming measures in the future, Respondent has not properly exercised its right under Annex II and Article 10.13 of the TPA to deny Claimants the protection of the MFN Clause;1432 and (iii) in any event, Claimants have demonstrated that Respondent's violations meet the \"like circumstances\" test under Article 3(2) of the Paraguay-Peru BIT, on which Claimants rely on by virtue of the TPA's MFN Clause.1433\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 84-90.\n\nClaimants' NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 91-93.\n\n***c. Respondent's Comments on the U.S. NDP Submission***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1266.\n\nRespondent submits that the NDP Submission contains three fundamental observations for interpreting the MFN Clause, all of which allegedly support Respondent's position.1434\n\nRespondent's NDP Observations \u00b6\u00b6 44-52.\n\n1267.\n\nIn that regard, Respondent argues that the United States agrees with Respondent by concluding that: (i) any non-conforming measure listed in Annex II of the TPA is excluded from the scope of application of the MFN Clause, and the burden to prove that such exclusion does not apply relies on Claimants; (ii) the MFN Clause applies only regarding investors or investments that are in \"like circumstances\" with Claimants or their investment; and (iii) to conclude that the MFN Clause has been breached, Claimants must identify actual treatment that Respondent accorded to a third-party investor or investment, and not the mere existence of clauses in other treaties signed by Respondent.\n\n**(2) Parties' Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n1268.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent has breached the TPA by treating First Claimant and its investments less favourably than it treats investments from other States.1435 According to Claimants, pursuant to the MFN Clause, they may rely on other bilateral investment treaty provisions in which Respondent confers more favourable treatment to third party investors.1436 In Claimants' view, this includes: (i) Article 3(2) of the Paraguay-Peru BIT; and; (ii) the umbrella clauses contained in the Thailand-Peru BIT, the Netherlands-Peru BIT and the United Kingdom-Peru BIT.1437\n\nMemorial \u00b6 383.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 388; Reply \u00b6 625.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 389, 396; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 633, 637.\n\n1269.\n\nRespondent denies that the MFN Clause permits the importation of the legal protection of the treaties cited by Claimants, which in its view would modify its consent to the TPA by way of interpretation.1438 Respondent further submits that Claimants' claims on this ground are inadmissible pursuant to TPA Article 10.13.1439 According to Respondent, the MFN Clause in the TPA requires identification of an investor in like circumstances, and to show that the treatment of the investor has been unjustifiably less favourable.1440 Respondent further denies that it has breached the provisions in question.1441\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 834-842; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 869-872; R-PHB \u00b6 114.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 868; R-PHB \u00b6 112. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6 865 regarding non-conforming measures in Annex II of the TPA.

In light of the Tribunal's determinations already made under the RER Contract and the TPA, Claimants' claims under this ground cannot be sustained, even if the importation of the provisions relied on by Claimants were accepted.\n\n1271.\n\nWith respect to Article 3(2) of the Paraguay-Peru BIT, this provides:1442\n\nA Contracting Party which has admitted an investment in its territory shall grant the permits necessary in relation to such investment, including the performance of licensing agreements and technical, commercial or administrative assistance\u2026\n\n**CL-068**, *Convenio entre la Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa y la Rep\u00fablica del Paraguay Sobre la Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n Rec\u00edproca de Inversiones*, 31 January 1994, Art. 3(2). Translation by Claimants at Memorial \u00b6 389. The Spanish original provides:  \n\"*La Parte Contratante que haya admitido una inversi\u00f3n en su territorio, otorgar\u00e1 los permisos necesarios en relaci\u00f3n a dicha inversi\u00f3n, incluyendo la ejecuci\u00f3n de contratos de licencia y contratos de asistencia t\u00e9cnica, comercial o administrativa\u2026*\"\n\n1272.\n\nClaimants submit that the following measures negatively affected the Project's permits and approvals in violation of the TPA: (i) the commencement of the RGA Lawsuit, which sought to annul the Project's environmental permits; (ii) the commencement of the Criminal Investigation and Criminal Proceedings that attempted to cast doubt on the validity of the Project's environmental permits; (iii) the arbitrary denial of the Project's CWA; and (iv) the issuance of a materially defective CWA and failing to fix it for over six months, losing precious time and compounding the effects of the RGA Lawsuit.1443\n\nReply \u00b6 634.\n\n1273.\n\nRespondent opposes each of the alleged bases of this claim.1444\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 846-856; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 878-890.\n\n1274.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that none of the alleged measures cited by Claimants constitute a breach of the FET standard of the TPA or an indirect expropriation under the TPA (see \u00b6\u00b6 1228, 1256, 1259 above). In reaching those conclusions, the Tribunal has given detailed consideration to each of the circumstances. Those findings are inconsistent with the arguments Claimants seek to make regarding adverse impacts upon the Project's permits. The Tribunal refers to those findings and does not consider it necessary to repeat them here.\n\n1275.\n\nIn accordance with an interpretation of Article 3(2) of the Paraguay-Peru BIT under the VCLT, the ordinary meaning of the words \"shall grant the permits necessary in relation to such investment\" are an imperative. However, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent1445 that the provision neither expressly nor implicitly exempts an investor from the requirements of national law with respect to the granting of such permits. Nor does it insulate an investor from legal proceedings challenging a given permit, much less legal proceedings which indirectly \"cast doubt\" on a permit (see item (ii) at \u00b6 1272 above). Only one of Claimants' allegations concern a failure to grant a permit, being the CWA (see item (iii) at \u00b6 1272 above). However, that ground has no basis as the CWA was ultimately granted.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 845.\n\n1276.\n\nIn summary, none of First Claimant's claims under Article 3(2) of the Paraguay-Peru BIT withstand scrutiny, based on a plain reading of that provision and in light of the Tribunal's considerations in respect of each of the alleged bases for the claim which have already been analysed in this Award.\n\n1277.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal has found that Respondent did not breach the RER Contract (see \u00b6\u00b6 993-997, 998 above). Claimants' submission that any such breaches \"likewise constitute internationally wrongful acts\"1446 therefore falls away. If there is no underlying breach of contract, there is no breach to be \"elevated\" to a breach of a treaty. There can therefore be no recourse to the umbrella clauses contained in the Thailand-Peru BIT, the Netherlands-Peru BIT and the United Kingdom-Peru BIT. The Tribunal therefore does not consider it necessary to further address the arguments made in relation to that claim.1447\n\nMemorial \u00b6 395.\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 395-398; Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 858-863; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 637-640; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 892- 897.\n\n1278.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal rejects First Claimant's claims under the MFN Clause of the TPA.\n\n**E. C onclusion on L iability for B reaches of the TPA**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1279.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, the Tribunal rejects First Claimant's claims under the TPA, including those brought on behalf of Second Claimant. Specifically, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not breach TPA Article 10.5 (see \u00b6 1228 above), TPA Article 10.7 (see \u00b6\u00b6 1256-1259 above) or TPA Article 10.4 (see \u00b6 1278 above) in respect of its treatment of Claimants or their investments. The Tribunal accordingly rejects Claimants' request for a declaration in respect of such breaches (see \u00b6 235(a) and \u00b6 236(a) above).\n\n1280.\n\nThere being no breach of the TPA, the Tribunal also rejects Claimants' claim for damages and other relief resulting from any such breach, including: (i) compensation for losses (see \u00b6 235(e) and \u00b6 236(e) above); (ii) the request for a declaration in relation to the USD 71,500 bond put up by Second Claimant to obtain the final concession for the transmission line bond (see \u00b6 235(j) and \u00b6 236(i) above); and (iii) the request for an order that Respondent \"cease and desist\" its harassment of Second Claimant and Second Claimant's External Counsel by terminating the Criminal Proceedings (see \u00b6 235(g) and \u00b6 236(g) above).\n\n1281.\n\nIn light of the rejection of Claimants' damages claims, the Tribunal does not need to further address the Parties' arguments and the NDP Submission with respect to the quantum of such damages, or any order for pre-Award interest.\n\n1282.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that it is not necessary to receive an update from Claimants in relation to the calculation of their damages claim. Claimants had requested the opportunity to provide such an update in the event that they would prevail on any of their claims (see \u00b6 67> above). The Tribunal considers this request to be moot.\n\n**X. ALLEGED TERMINATION OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1283.\n\nThe Confidentiality Agreement was entered into between the Special Commission, First Claimant and Second Claimant on 5 December 2017 (see \u00b6 167 above).\n\n1284.\n\nOn four occasions when extending the period of negotiations between the Parties in relation to the dispute (*trato directo*), the Parties affirmed that the Confidentiality Agreement covered the ongoing negotiations.1448\n\n**R-129**, *Primer Acuerdo de Extensi\u00f3n de Plazo entre la Comisi\u00f3n Especial*, *Latam Hydro LLC y CH Mamacocha SRL*, 26 December 2017, Clause 3; **C-195**, *Acuerdo de Extensi\u00f3n de Plazo entre la Comisi\u00f3n Especial*, *Latam Hydro LLC y CH Mamacocha SRL*, 27 February 2018, Clause 4; **R-130/C-196**, *Acuerdo de Extensi\u00f3n de Plazo entre la Comisi\u00f3n Especial, Latam Hydro LLC y CH Mamacocha SRL*, 28 June 2018, Clause 4; **C-062**, Direct Negotiations Term Extension Agreement between R. Ampuero (Special Commision), S. Sillen (Latam Hydro LLC) and C. Diez Canseco (CH Mamacocha SRL), 21 September 2018, Clause 4.\n\n1285.\n\nBy way of background to this ground of Claimants' claim, PO 1, the Tribunal decided upon Respondent's application to expunge certain information and exhibits from Claimants' Notice of Intent and Request for Arbitration (see \u00b6 26 above). Respondent had argued that certain information in those submissions was covered by the Confidentiality Agreement dated 5 December 2017 between Claimants and the Special Commission.\n\n1286.\n\nIn PO 1 the Tribunal rejected Respondent's application, finding, *inter alia*, that: (i) while it takes the confidentiality of settlement negotiations seriously, the information sought to be excluded does not constitute confidential settlement information; and (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement does not restrict the use of information which has entered the public domain.1449 In relation to the disagreement over whether certain actions by Respondent were admissions of responsibility or good faith efforts to resolve the dispute amicably, the Tribunal indicated that this would be a matter for the Tribunal to weigh when reaching its determinations on the merits.1450\n\nPO 1, \u00b6 33(a) and (b).\n\nPO 1, \u00b6 33(c).\n\n1287.\n\nClaimants seek a declaration from the Tribunal that \"the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated and, with it, all of CHM's obligations and duties owed thereunder.\"1451 Respondent opposes Claimants' request.1452\n\nReply \u00b6 1045(d).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1389.\n\n1288.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal sets out the relevant provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement in Section A. Section B contains the Parties' positions on this issue. Section C contains the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**A. R elevant P rovisions**\n----------------------------\n\n1289.\n\nClause 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement provides, in part:1453\n\nThe Parties acknowledge that this Agreement shall be solely binding on the Special Commission, Latam Hydro and [CH] Mamacocha, which shall be collectively referred to as \"the Parties.\" In this regard, the Special Commission's powers to represent the Peruvian State shall, for all relevant purposes, be limited to the provisions of Law No. 28933, and its Regulations.\n\nAs a result, the effects of this Confidentiality Agreement and/or the scope of the Peruvian State's representation hereunder shall exclusively apply to the negotiations over the Dispute, and shall not extend to any other agency or entity of the Peruvian State, or have any bearing on their powers and/or duties as set forth in the relevant statutory and constitutional provisions applicable in the Republic of Peru.\n\n**C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, 5 December 2017, Clause 2.\n\n1290.\n\nClause 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement is as follows:1454\n\nIn the spirit of full cooperation, the Parties undertake to keep all matters related to the discussions, talks, documents and information held and/or exchanged between each other within the scope of the Consultation and Negotiation strictly confidential. The only instrument evidencing the conduct of the Consultation and Negotiation procedure shall be the minutes or the final settlement agreement, or any other kind of agreement reached by the Parties, which, at the end of such procedure, shall be executed and duly signed by both Parties in two original copies, one for each of them.\n\n**C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, 5 December 2017, Clause 3.\n\n1291.\n\nClause 4 of the Confidentiality Agreement provides:1455\n\nThe negotiations between the Parties during the Consultation and Negotiation period shall be without prejudice to either Party's case in a potential international arbitration commenced before the ICSID, or before any other forum to which the dispute may be submitted, in the event that the Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement. In addition, the Parties' proposals during the Consultation and Negotiation procedure shall be confidential, and may not be used as evidence in future international arbitration proceedings. The Parties agree that the existence of the Consultation and Negotiation procedure and of this Confidentiality Agreement shall not be confidential in nature.\n\n**C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, Clause 4.\n\n1292.\n\nClause 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement is set out below:1456\n\nThe Parties declare, acknowledge and accept that talks within the scope of the Consultation and Negotiation procedure shall be held in good faith and shall not be binding upon the Parties, unless a written agreement is reached so that neither Party's legal or contractual rights, causes of action and privileges are harmed, negatively affected, terminated, restricted or cancelled. The Parties hereby reserve their right to raise any jurisdictional defense or defense on the merits, and to assert any claims that they may deem appropriate or convenient. Therefore, the conduct of the Consultation and Negotiation procedure shall under no circumstances be deemed as an acceptance or acknowledgement of the other Party's case.\n\n**C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, Clause 7.\n\n1293.\n\nClause 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement provides:1457\n\nThe Parties agree that under no circumstances, and in no way, may any statement or communication, whether oral or written, from one Party to the other or to a third-party, or any action taken over the course of the Consultation and Negotiation procedure, including this Confidentiality Agreement, be used now or in the future by either Party in any other context, including any international or domestic arbitration proceedings, or any other legal or contentious proceedings before any domestic or foreign courts, whether pending or threatened to be commenced by the Parties. In this regard, the Parties agree to handle all information, representations and materials and/or documents created or disclosed during the course of the Consultation and Negotiation procedure in strict confidentiality, except for any information which is generally available to the public or which has come into the public domain for reasons other than a breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by either Party. The Parties accept that the provisions of this clause shall apply to all exchanges between them since the Consultation and Negotiation procedure commenced.\n\n**C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, Clause 8.\n\n1294.\n\nUnder Clause 14 of the Confidentiality Agreement, \"\u2026the Parties' duty of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\"1458\n\n**C-028**, Confidentiality Agreement, Clause 14.\n\n**B. P arties ' P ositions**\n----------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1295.\n\nClaimants assert that with the Counter-Memorial, Respondent submitted testimony of Mr. Ricardo Ampuero Llerena, former President of the Special Commission which is \"replete with allegations that contain non-public information exchanged between the Parties, or between the Special Commission and third-parties, arising from the Parties' settlement discussions.\"1459 Claimants take issue, in particular, with paragraphs 18-36 and 43-45 of Mr. Ampuero's first witness statement.1460\n\nReply \u00b6 926.\n\nReply \u00b6 926.\n\n1296.\n\nContrary to Mr. Ampuero's statement that he believed the Confidentiality Agreement was only in effect until 1 April 2019, Claimants argue that its restrictions survive termination of the Agreement as provided by Clause 14 of the Confidentiality Agreement.1461\n\nReply \u00b6 930.\n\n1297.\n\nClaimants contend that as a result of its unauthorised disclosures, Respondent has waived its protections or rights under the Confidentiality Agreement.1462 It follows, in their view, that Claimants are relieved of their obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.1463\n\nReply \u00b6 931.\n\nReply \u00b6 935.\n\n1298.\n\nIn any event, Claimants argue that Respondent's breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement give Claimants the right to be relieved of their contractual obligations and terminate the Confidentiality Agreement as a matter of law, pursuant to Articles 1428 and 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code.1464\n\nReply \u00b6 936.\n\n**(2) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1299.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants continue to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement.1465 In its view, it is Claimants who are in breach of the Confidentiality Agreement for misrepresenting facts and statements attributed to Peru during the *trato directo* stage.1466 According to Respondent, the statements made by Mr. Ampuero in his first witness statement were a response to those misrepresentations.1467 Moreover, Respondent argues that Mr. Ampuero did not reveal confidential information.1468\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 394.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 391.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 392.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 396-401.\n\n1300.\n\nRespondent denies that Claimants are at liberty to breach the Confidentiality Agreement while Respondent is unable to respond without waiving its protections.1469\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 402.\n\n1301.\n\nBy making an allegation of breach of the Confidentiality Agreement covertly in the course of the document production only, Respondent accuses Claimants of procedural manoeuvring, bad faith and intentional lack of clarity.1470\n\nRejoinder \u00a7 II.I.2, \u00b6\u00b6 405, 409.\n\n1302.\n\nRespondent contends that even if Respondent had breached any obligation under the Confidentiality Agreement, the requirements of Article 1428 and 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code for termination of the agreement are not met.1471\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 405-408.\n\n**C. T ribunal ' s A nalysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1303.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has not contested the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Claimants' claim on the basis of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Tribunal understands the Parties to confer upon the Tribunal jurisdiction to resolve the dispute under the Confidentiality Agreement in the interest of complete resolution of their dispute.\n\n1304.\n\nClaimants take issue with paragraphs 18-36 and 43-45 of Mr. Ampuero's first witness statement. In particular, Claimants highlight the following examples:1472\n\n24. \u2026I also recall that, on the occasion of several meetings with Claimants, I expressly corrected such assertions by Claimants, made orally or in writing, which mistakenly suggested that the Special Commission had authority to force or order State entities to adopt a specific action.\n\n...\n\n34. \u2026I recall expressly mentioning at the various meetings with the Claimants that the [Confidentiality] Agreement was essential to us, as it had to be absolutely clear that the State's good-faith actions in the context of the direct negotiations, and the communications exchanged in connection with the dispute between the parties, were, quite obviously, without prejudice to the parties' positions and rights.\n\n35. I even recall myself repeating, at a fair number of meetings with Claimants' representatives, that the purpose was to maintain the status quo (in order not to exacerbate the dispute from the perspective of any of the parties), and that neither party should use any acts done in the context of the direct negotiations stage against the counter-party. At the meetings, Claimants expressly represented that they understood and agreed with this. I was emphatic on this point[\u2026]\n\n...\n\n43. I want to be absolutely clear about this as well: I noted, on multiple occasions at meetings with Claimants, that not only was the Draft Supreme Decree covered by the Confidentiality Agreement\u2026but also it was neither a promise nor a guarantee. I explained that this was an alternative under examination\u2026I recall this clearly because I wanted to remove any false expectations about a Draft Supreme Decree\u2026I expressly recall saying, on more than one occasion, that\u2026Claimants led us to believe, at the various meetings we held, that they understood and accepted that this was so[\u2026]\n\nReply \u00b6 926; *quoting* Ampuero First Statement \u00b6\u00b6 24, 34, 35, 43.\n\n1305.\n\nRespondent argues that the paragraphs cited by Claimants do not reveal confidential information since Mr. Ampuero did not refer to any of Claimants' settlement proposals or actions to resolve the dispute.1473 In its view, the statements by Mr. Ampuero were necessary to respond to assertions made by Claimants in their Memorial, such as that:1474 (i) the Special Commission ordered MINEM to retroactively suspend the RER Contract effective as of 21 April 2017 upon commencement of the *trato directo* process;1475 (ii) the Special Commission evaluated the merits of the RGA Lawsuit;1476 and (iii) the Draft Supreme Decree was \"necessary to give back to the RER projects time lost due to unjustified interferences by the government.\"1477 Mr. Ampuero further sought to clarify, according to Respondent, that Respondent acted at all times in good faith, and on the basis that actions taken in the context of the *trato directo* were without prejudice to the positions of the Parties in the arbitration.1478\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 396-397.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 396; *citing* Ampuero First Statement \u00b6 23.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 112.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 119.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 153.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 400.\n\n1306.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the testimony of Mr. Ampuero to be inconsistent with the requirement in Clause 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement to \"\u2026keep all matters related to the discussions, talks, documents and information held and/or exchanged between each other within the scope of the Consultation and Negotiation strictly confidential.\" (see \u00b6 1290 above). In particular, Mr. Ampuero mentions statements that he made to Claimants or that Claimants made to him in the course of the consultation and negotiation procedure. As recorded in Clause 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement, the \"only instrument evidencing the conduct of the consultation and negotiation procedure shall be the minutes or the final settlement agreement\u2026\"\n\n1307.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that these disclosures were justified by a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement by Claimants. In this regard, Clause 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement prevents the Parties from using any statements made by one party to the other party, or to a third party, or any action taken over the course of the consultation and negotiation procedure, in a future arbitration (see \u00b6 1293 above). However, there is an express carve-out in Clause 8 for information which is \"generally available to the public or which has come into the public domain for reasons other than a breach of this Confidentiality Agreement\" (see \u00b6 1293 above). Respondent has not established that Claimants revealed non-public information in making their assertions. Nor is the Tribunal satisfied that by making these assertions, Claimants effectively \"opened up\" the content of the Parties' settlement discussions.\n\n1308.\n\nThe Tribunal is further not persuaded that Mr. Ampuero's statements were necessary to rebut Claimants' allegations. Respondent could, and did, rebut Claimants' submission by reference to other evidence.1479\n\n*See*, *e.g*., Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 246-247.\n\n1309.\n\nIt should be noted that while Mr. Ampuero's statements are not in line with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Tribunal does not consider them to constitute a \"material breach\" of that agreement, as Claimants argue.1480 As stated in PO 1, the Tribunal takes the confidentiality of settlement negotiations seriously, and settlement negotiations are understood to be conducted on a without prejudice basis.1481 However, none of Mr. Ampuero's statements reveal a confidential proposal made during the consultation and negotiation procedure.\n\n*See* Reply \u00a7 VI.A.\n\nPO 1, \u00b6 33(a).\n\n1310.\n\nWhile not specifically argued by Respondent, since Mr. Ampuero refers to the potential expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement,1482 the Tribunal confirms that even if the agreement had terminated, which has not been established, the Parties' duty of confidentiality survives termination (see \u00b6 1294 above).\n\nAmpuero First Statement \u00b6 22.\n\n1311.\n\nClaimants argue that as a result of Respondent's affirmative use of this evidence, Respondent has waived any rights or protections that may still exist with respect to the settlement discussions and may not raise any privilege-related defence with respect to allegations, documents, or testimony concerning those discussions.1483 The Tribunal is open to considering the application of the affirmative use provision in the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in any specific circumstance, and indeed has done so in the course of these proceedings.1484 However, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary or appropriate to issue open-ended directions on this matter without a specific situation before it. Claimants have not sought to introduce any specific evidence in response to Respondent's statements, but primarily seek to preclude Respondent from raising additional privilege-related defences. In the circumstances, the Tribunal declines to order that Claimants are generally relieved of their obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 931-934.\n\n*See* PO 4, \u00b6 53(i).\n\n1312.\n\nClaimants also argue that the Confidentiality Agreement has terminated as a matter of law under Articles 1428 and 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code.1485 The Tribunal notes that the Confidentiality Agreement does not contain provisions on termination aside from Clause 14 (see \u00b6 1294 above). Respondent has not contested the potential application of Articles 1428 and 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code to the Confidentiality Agreement, although it denies that their requirements are met in the present case.1486\n\nReply \u00b6 936.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 408-409.\n\n1313.\n\nArticles 1428 and 1429 state:1487\n\nArticle 1428.- Termination for Breach\n\nIn contracts with reciprocal benefits, when one of the parties fails to comply with its provision, the other party may request the fulfilment or termination of the contract and, in either case, compensation for damages.\n\nArticle 1429.- Termination as of Right\n\nIn the case of article 1428, the party that is harmed by the breach of the other may request it by means of a notarial letter to satisfy its provision, within a period of no less than fifteen days, under the warning that, otherwise, the contract is terminated.\n\nIf the provision is not fulfilled within the specified period, the contract is fully terminated, with the debtor being responsible for compensation for damages.\n\n**RL-048**/**CL-149**, *Decreto Legislativo No. 295, C\u00f3digo Civil*, 24 July 1984, Arts. 1428 and 1429, Translation by Claimants at Reply \u00b6 936.\n\n1314.\n\nAccording to Claimants, they provided written notice to Respondent of its breach on three occasions: (i) in their 2 March 2021 request for production of documents; (ii) in their 23 March 2021 response to Respondent's objections to those requests; and (iii) in their 21 April 2021 objections to Respondent's privilege log.1488\n\nReply \u00b6 938; *citing* Claimants' Request for Production of Documents, 2 March 2021; Claimants' Response to Respondent's Objections, 23 March 2021; Claimants' Objections to Respondent's Privilege Log, 21 April 2021.\n\n1315.\n\nHowever, the documents relied on by Claimants as notice are not notarised letters, do not contain language referring to a notice of breach, do not refer to a cure period of 15 days, and do not contain a warning about termination of the agreement. They rather refer to Respondent's alleged waiver of the protection of the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to IBA Rule 9(3)(d),1489 or to Respondent's alleged failure to invoke privileges under the Confidentiality Agreement.1490 The Tribunal rejects the contention that these can be considered notices issued pursuant to Article 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code, and accordingly rejects the argument that the Confidentiality Agreement has terminated as a result.\n\n*See* Introduction to Claimants' Replies to Respondent's Objections of 23 March 2021, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimants' Objections to Respondent's Privilege Log dated 21 April 2021, \u00b6 51.\n\n1316.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants have not asserted that they have requested the \"fulfilment\" of the Confidentiality Agreement under Article 1428 of the Peruvian Civil Code (see \u00b6 1313 above), and therefore does not need to address that aspect of the provision.\n\n1317.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Respondent breached the Confidentiality Agreement, however rejects Claimants' claims with respect to the consequences of that breach. In this respect, the only request for relief by Claimants in relation to the Confidentiality Agreement is a request for a declaration that it is terminated and with it, Second Claimant's obligations and duties thereunder (see \u00b6 236(d) above). The Tribunal rejects that request. Accordingly, the finding of breach is inconsequential and the Confidentiality Agreement remains in force between the Parties.\n\n**XI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n1318.\n\nIn light of the foregoing decisions, the Tribunal shall decide on the allocation and quantification of costs in these proceedings. The Tribunal first sets out the relevant TPA, RER Contract, and ICSID Arbitration Rules provisions (A), before summarising the Parties' positions (B), and then turning to its considerations on costs (C).\n\n**A. R elevant P rovisions**\n----------------------------\n\n1319.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n1320.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 28 is entitled \"Cost of Proceeding,\" and provides:\n\n(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:\n\n(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;\n\n(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.\n\n(2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the cost of the proceeding.\n\n1321.\n\nIn addition, ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) states, in relevant part, that:\n\n(1) The award shall be in writing and shall contain:\n\n...\n\n(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\n\n1322.\n\nTPA Article 10.26(1) provides:1491\n\nWhere a tribunal makes a final award against a respondent, the tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:\n\n(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest; and\n\n(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.\n\nA tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.26(1).\n\n1323.\n\nTPA Article 10.26(3) provides:1492\n\nA tribunal may not award punitive damages.\n\n**C-001/RL-051**, TPA, Art. 10.26(3).\n\n1324.\n\nClause 11.7 of the RER Contract provides as follows:1493\n\nAll the expenses incurred as a result of the settlement of the Technical or Non-Technical Dispute, including fees to be paid to the Expert or the Arbitrators taking part in the settlement of the Dispute, shall be borne by the losing Party, unless the Expert or the Arbitrators decide otherwise.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.7.\n\n1325.\n\nFurthermore, Clause 11.8 of the RER Contract provides as follows:1494\n\nCosts and expenses such as advisors' fees, internal costs, or others that are attributable to a Party individually, are excluded from the provisions of this Clause.\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.8.\n\n**B.

Amount of Costs***\n------------------------\n\n1326.\n\nClaimants contend they are entitled to costs, ranging from USD 17,522,014.25 to USD 23,318,729.25, in light of the discounted fee arrangement entered into with their counsel, with a success fee uplift.1495 The amount of Claimants' claimed costs within that range varies under four scenarios, depending on the amount awarded to Claimants as damages in a successful award.1496 Without any success fee uplift, the breakdown of the amount of USD 17,522,014.25 is as follows:1497\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Type of Cost** | **Amount (USD)** |\n| Procedural Costs | 650,000.00 |\n| BakerHostetler Legal Fees and Expenses | 12,804,811.99 |\n| Local Peruvian Counsel Legal Fees and Expenses | 260,907.53 |\n| Expert Fees and Expenses | 2,083,968.02 |\n| Additional Expenses | 1,722,326.71 |\n| **TOTAL** | **17,522,014.25** |\n\nC-CS \u00b6 1.\n\nC-CS \u00b6 1; C-CS Annex A, Table B(1)(b).\n\nC-CS \u00b6 1; C-CS Annex A, p. 1. With regard to the item \"Procedural Costs,\" the Tribunal notes that this amount does not reflect the fourth advance payment of USD 150,000 requested from each of the Parties on 22 September 2023, and paid by Claimants on 20 October 2023, after the Parties' Submissions on Costs dated 1 August 2022 were filed. *See* ICSID's communication of 24 October 2023. Accordingly, ICSID's financial records reflect that adding the fourth advance payment, Claimants made advance payments totaling USD 799,970.00.\n\n1327.\n\nClaimants submit that any cost award in their favour should carry the pre-award interest of 7.06%, as applicable to Claimants' damages.1498\n\nC-CS \u00b6 27; *see* Reply \u00b6 1037.\n\n***b. Allocation of Costs***\n----------------------------\n\n1328.\n\nClaimants submit that the Tribunal has discretion regarding cost-apportionment for the TPA claims, but that tribunals routinely follow the \"costs follow the event\" principle, which has emerged as the preferred methodology.1499\n\nC-CS \u00b6 4; *citing* **CL-011**, *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

If Claimants succeed on any of their claims, in their view they will have likely prevailed on all or substantially all of the major disputed issues.1502\n\n(iii) Respondent's jurisdictional objections would not have a significant impact on the quantum of the award, as they apply only to certain measures related to the TPA claims and have no effect on the RER Contract claim.1503 Claimants argue that Respondent's objections concern only discrete legal issues for which neither party expended significant resources.1504\n\nC-CS \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; *citing* **CL-286**, *Veteran Petroleum v.

Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, \u00b6 533.\n\n1343.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal finds that one or more claims were to fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction or are found to be meritless, Respondent argues that Claimants should pay all of Respondent's costs.1531\n\nR-CS \u00b6 8. *See* R-CS \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 elaborating on the alleged jurisdictional defects and lack of merit in Claimants' claims.\n\n1344.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimants' procedural behaviour warrants an allocation of costs against them, which includes:\n\n(i) Advancement of meritless claims that Respondent has had to expend significant State resources to defend against.1532\n\n(ii) Mischaracterisation of evidence: Respondent argues that Claimants mischaracterised its statements made in the course of friendly consultations as admissions of liability, despite those consultations being conducted on a \"without prejudice\" basis.1533 Further, Respondent contends that Claimants failed to disclose the Amparo Judgment to the Tribunal, and when they did address it during the Hearing, they presented a truncated quotation in an attempt to mislead the Tribunal as to the significance of that ruling.1534 In another example, Respondent asserts that Claimants characterised the Mor\u00f3n Report as a categorical condemnation of the RGA Lawsuit, however, that report details various grounds on which the Project permits could be challenged successfully, and ultimately were the grounds on which the Amparo Judgment later invalidated the permits.1535\n\n(iii) Mischaracterisation of Respondent's position: According to Respondent, Claimants have mischaracterised Respondent's position on various points and procedural communications which thereby increased Respondent's costs.1536\n\n(iv) Baseless requests for adverse inferences: Further, Respondent contends that Claimants' unsuccessful application for further documents and search descriptions as well as their unjustified demands for adverse inferences to be drawn against Respondent's response to Claimants' document production requests required Respondent to devote a portion of its Rejoinder to address Claimants' submissions.1537\n\n(v) Joint hearing bundle: Respondent also argues that Claimants' approach to the joint hearing bundle, contrary to Tribunal's orders in PO 6, caused it to incur additional costs as it had to (i) contest Claimants' introduction of new documents and translations; and (ii) review with extra care all documents and translations to ensure that the materials in the joint bundle were in fact part of the existing record.1538\n\n(vi) Making unfounded assertions that Respondent engaged in bad faith when, on the contrary, Respondent acted in good faith.1539\n\nR-CS \u00b6 7.\n\nR-CS \u00b6 14; *citing* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 246-249; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 170-181, 398, 1068; R-PHB \u00b6\u00b6 59-62.\n\nR-CS \u00b6 15; *citing* **CD-01**, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 173; *see* Respondent's Closing Statement, Transcript (Day 9), 18 March 2022, 2080:1-2083:6; *see also* Rejoinder \u00a7 I.F.\n\nR-CS \u00b6 16; *citing* Claimants' Opening Statement, Transcript (Day 1), 7 March 2022, 31:2-6, 12-14; Respondent's Opening Statement, Transcript (Day 1), 7 March 2022, 236:13-21; **R-140/C-229**, Legal Report by J.C.

Reasonableness***\n-----------------------\n\n1346.\n\nRespondent submits that its costs are reasonable given the volume and complexity of issues presented.1541\n\nR-CS \u00b6 29.\n\nC. **T he T ribunal ' s D ecision ON C osts**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1347.\n\nThe Tribunal is deciding on the issue of costs relevant to all claims and all jurisdictional objections put forward in this arbitration proceeding. This includes claims and objections related to: (i) First Claimant's claims under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, on its own behalf and on behalf of Second Claimant; and (ii) Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract. The fact that these claims are brought under different legal instruments and by different parties means that the Tribunal must have regard to the legal instruments applicable to each for the determination of costs. The Tribunal will therefore first make a determination on the allocation of costs under the RER Contract, before proceeding to determine the allocation of costs under the TPA and the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal will then proceed to the quantification of costs. Noting that the Parties' respective costs submissions are provided globally for the arbitration proceedings, without breaking costs down between the two types of claims, the Tribunal will consider the implications of any divergence between its decisions at \u00b6 1384 below.\n\n**(1) Costs Under the RER Contract**\n------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Legal Standard***\n---------------------------\n\n1348.\n\nIn their costs submission, Claimants mention the Parties' agreement on costs under the RER Contract.1542 Respondent, on the other hand does not make reference to it, and therefore does not distinguish between costs in relation to the RER Contract and in relation to the TPA.\n\nC-CS \u00b6 4 fn 1.\n\n1349.\n\nPursuant to Clauses 11.7 and 11.8 of the RER Contract, Second Claimant and Respondent agreed to distinguish between two types of costs. Clause 11.7 of the RER Contract concerns \"[a]ll the expenses incurred as a result of the settlement of the \u2026 Non-Technical Dispute, including fees to be paid to the \u2026 Arbitrators\" (see \u00b6\u00b6 1324-1325 above). The Tribunal will refer to these costs as \"**Arbitration Costs**,\" which the Tribunal understands include ICSID's administrative fees, and the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal. Under Clause 11.7, Arbitration Costs are to be borne by \"the losing Party, unless the \u2026 Arbitrators decide otherwise.\"1543\n\n**C-002**, RER Contract, Clause 11.7.\n\n1350.\n\nClause 11.8 of the RER Contract refers to \"[c]osts and expenses such as advisors' fees, internal costs, or others that are attributable to a Party individually\" (see \u00b6 1325 above). The Tribunal will refer to these costs as \"**Legal and Other Costs**,\" which the Tribunal understands include legal fees and expenses, expert and witness fees and expenses, travel expenses, bank fees, delivery fees, photocopying, support services, translation, research and other internal expenses. Under Clause 11.8 of the RER Contract, Legal and Other Costs are excluded from the provisions of Clause 11. The Tribunal concurs with Claimants' interpretation1544 that the meaning of this provision is that each party will bear its own Legal and Other Costs with respect to an arbitration under the RER Contract.\n\nC-CS \u00b6 4 fn 1.\n\n1351.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to follow the parties' agreement reached in respect of the allocation of costs under the RER Contract and will apply the above provisions to the dispute between Second Claimant and Respondent under the RER Contract. While Respondent did not rely on these provisions in making its costs submissions, the Tribunal does not consider this approach to be inconsistent with Respondent's views, which emphasise the broad discretion of the Tribunal with respect to costs.1545\n\nR-CS \u00b6 4.\n\n***b. Allocation of Costs***\n----------------------------\n\n1352.\n\nIn accordance with Clause 11.8 of the RER Contract, the Tribunal finds that the Legal and Other Costs incurred in relation to this arbitration for Second Claimant's claims against Respondent under the RER Contract are to be borne by Second Claimant and Respondent respectively with respect to each of their individual internal costs.\n\n1353.\n\nUnder Clause 11.7 of the RER Contract, the losing party is to bear the Arbitration Costs, unless the Tribunal decides otherwise. In order to determine whether Second Claimant or Respondent is the losing party, the Tribunal will summarise the outcome of the various objections and claims put forward:\n\n(i) Respondent's jurisdictional objections (to the extent relevant to the RER Contract): Second Claimant is the successful Party (see \u00b6 568 above).\n\n(ii) Second Claimant's claim for breach of Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37, 2.2.1, 4.3, 6.3, 11.3 and Addenda 3-6 of the RER Contract: Respondent is the successful Party (see \u00b6 993> above).\n\n(iii) Second Claimant's claim for breach of the Peruvian law doctrines of good faith, *actos propios* and *confianza leg\u00edtima*: Respondent is the successful Party (see \u00b6 993 above).\n\n(iv) Second Claimant's claim for breach of the review periods under the GLAP and TUPA: Respondent is the successful Party (see \u00b6 993 above).\n\n(v) Second Claimant's claim for compensation in respect of any of the alleged breaches of the RER Contract: Respondent is the successful Party (see \u00b6 999 above).\n\n(vi) Second Claimant's requests for orders that Respondent must return the Performance Bond under the RER Contract, and may not call or collect it: Second Claimant is the successful Party (see \u00b6 996 above).\n\n1354.\n\nSince both Second Claimant and Respondent argued that the RER Contract has been terminated, for different reasons, the Tribunal does not consider either Party to be a losing Party on that point.\n\n1355.\n\nWith respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent relevant to the RER Contract, the Tribunal found that Respondent has breached the Agreement, but rejected Claimants' claims with respect to the consequences of that breach. The Tribunal does not consider either Party to be the losing Party with respect to that point.\n\n1356.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal considers Second Claimant to be the losing Party with respect to the dispute under the RER Contract. While it succeeded in establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the RER Contract, Second Claimant was not successful with respect to any of its claims, save for its request for an order that Respondent may not call or collect the Performance Bond. The value of that Performance Bond is USD 5 million, being less than 10% of the compensation sought by Second Claimant combined with the two bonds for which relief was sought. Moreover, the bulk of the Parties' submissions, evidence, and time at the Hearing in relation to Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract was dedicated to Second Claimant's other claims under the RER Contract.\n\n1357.\n\nHaving determined that Second Claimant is the losing Party under the RER Contract, the default provided under Clause 11.7 of the RER Contract is that Second Claimant will bear the Arbitration Costs. It remains to be considered whether there is any basis for the Tribunal to \"decide otherwise\", as provided in that Clause.\n\n1358.\n\nNeither Party has made submissions as to the basis, if any, upon which the Tribunal should deviate from the default provided by Clause 11.7 of the RER Contract. However, both sides have made reference in their respective submissions to the procedural conduct of the opposing Party in the course of the arbitration, as a basis for adjusting the \"costs follow the event\" principle (see \u00b6\u00b6 1330-1331, 1344 above). The Tribunal considers that the Parties' procedural conduct could potentially be relevant to its award on costs under the RER Contract, in particular with respect to any bad faith or abusive procedural conduct.\n\n1359.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed and takes note of the Parties' respective accounts of the proceedings. Many of the instances of procedural conduct invoked by one side against the other fall within the reasonable exercise of a party's right to pursue its legal claims and defences in the arbitration. In this respect, not every unsuccessful procedural application justifies an adverse award of costs. The Tribunal considers that each side conducted itself with due professionalism, and without bad faith or abusive procedural tactics.\n\n1360.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that it does not consider Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract to be frivolous.\n\n1361.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that any of the circumstances cited by the Parties justify an adjustment to the approach laid down in Clause 11.7 of the RER Contract, i.e., that the losing Party shall pay the Arbitration Costs.\n\n***c. Conclusion on Costs Under the RER Contract***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1362.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that as the losing Party with respect to the claims made under the RER Contract, Second Claimant is responsible for the Arbitration Costs in relation to that dispute. Second Claimant and Respondent are to bear their respective individual Legal and Other Costs incurred.\n\n***(2)*** **Costs Under the TPA and the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Legal Standard***\n---------------------------\n\n1363.\n\nTPA Article 10.26(1) provides that the Tribunal may award costs and legal fees in accordance with Section A of Chapter 10 of the TPA and the applicable arbitration rules, which in this case are the ICSID Arbitration Rules (see \u00b6 1322 above).\n\n1364.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal has wide discretion in the exercise of its power to order costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 28 (see \u00b6\u00b6 1319-1321 above).1546 Neither provision contains a rule to be followed according to which a party should bear or be awarded costs. The \"loser pays\" or \"costs follow the event\" principle is routinely applied as the starting point for the allocation of costs in investment arbitration proceedings.\n\nC-CS \u00b6 4; R-CS \u00b6 4.\n\n1365.\n\nIn relation to the dispute under the TPA, the Parties agree that it is appropriate to apply the principle of \"costs follow the event\" in this case,1547 although they disagree on its application.\n\nC-CS \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; R-CS \u00b6 8.\n\n1366.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees, in general, that the successful party in an investment arbitration may be awarded costs, subject to the specific circumstances of the case. The Parties have each referred to adjustments that may be made to the \"costs follow the event\" standard to account for relevant factors such as: (i) the reasonableness of costs claimed by the successful party; (ii) the relative success of the parties; and (iii) the reasonableness of the parties' conduct and positions (including any frivolous claims, any abuse of the system, and any particularly serious allegations made without substantiation).1548 The Tribunal endorses these factors as potentially relevant considerations to take into account when awarding costs.\n\nC-CS \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; *citing* **CL-011**, *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

Relative Success and Failure***\n-------------------------------------\n\n1369.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out the successful Party for each of the jurisdictional objections and claims made below:\n\n(i) Respondent's jurisdictional objections under the TPA and the ICSID Convention: First Claimant is the successful Party, aside from the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of the Upstream Projects, for which Respondent was successful (see \u00b6 568 above).\n\n(ii) First Claimant's claims on behalf of Second Claimant under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(C), in relation to alleged breach of the RER Contract as an \"investment agreement\" thereunder: Respondent is the successful Party (see \u00b6 998 above).\n\n(iii) First Claimant's claims on its own behalf (under TPA Article 10.16(1)(a)) and on behalf of Second Claimant (under TPA Article 10.16(1)(b)(i)(A)) for breach of TPA Articles 10.4, 10.5 and 10.7: Respondent is the successful Party (see \u00b6 1279 above).\n\n1370.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the same observations as it recorded at \u00b6\u00b6 1354-1355 -above, i.e., that it does not consider either Party to be the losing Party with respect to: (i) the argument that the RER Contract had terminated; and (ii) the breach of the Confidentiality Agreement.\n\n1371.\n\nIn light of the above determinations made under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal considers Respondent to be the successful Party in relation to the claims under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, since First Claimant failed to successfully make out any of its claims. The Tribunal acknowledges, however, that it rejected all except one of Respondent's jurisdictional objections under the TPA and the ICSID Convention. These objections were multiple and required significant time and costs to address.\n\n1372.\n\nSimilarly to the conclusion reached at \u00b6 1360 with respect to the Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract, while the Tribunal has rejected First Claimant's claims under the TPA, including those filed on behalf of Second Claimant, the Tribunal does not consider those claims under the TPA to be frivolous. The Tribunal takes due account of this factor in reaching its decision on costs.\n\n***c. Procedural Conduct***\n---------------------------\n\n1373.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its findings at \u00b6 1359 above in relation to the Parties' procedural conduct for the purposes of the claims under the RER Contract. Those observations apply equally to the claims made under the TPA and the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal considers that each side has conducted itself with due professionalism, and without bad faith or abusive procedural tactics. The Tribunal does not find that any of the circumstances of procedural conduct cited by the Parties justify an adjustment to the \"costs follow the event\" principle.\n\n***d. Reasonableness***\n-----------------------\n\n1374.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the reasonableness of costs under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2) may take into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of proceedings, and their length, among other relevant factors. This assessment may be nuanced, and the Tribunal does not necessarily equate reasonableness with \"not manifestly excessive\" as Claimants have proposed.1549\n\nC-CS \u00b6 6; *citing* **CL-282**, Micha B\u00fchler, \"Awarding Costs in International Commercial Arbitration: An Overview\", ASA Bulletin 22, (2/2004), p. 273.\n\n1375.\n\nWhere there are disparities in legal costs between the Parties, the Tribunal notes that Parties are free to choose their legal representatives. This may lead to differences in costs, and such a difference alone does not deem those costs unreasonable. It may still be necessary to consider whether the amount of costs and any fee arrangement is justified in all the circumstances of a case.\n\n1376.\n\nIn the present case, Claimants' claimed costs range from USD 17,522,014.25 to USD 23,318,729.25, depending on a success fee uplift agreed with its counsel. Respondent's claimed costs amount to USD 4,804,833.80, representing some 27% of Claimants' lower claim. The disparity is increased in respect of Claimants' \"uplifted\" costs claim.\n\n1377.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the complex nature of this proceeding which has involved multiple claims under different legal instruments, also requiring coordination with other legal proceedings. Also taking into account the amount in dispute and the duration of the proceedings, the Tribunal understands that significant costs were incurred by the Parties. The Tribunal is not persuaded, on the other hand, that the disparity in costs between the Parties can be attributed to the points raised by Claimants, i.e., that (i) Claimants' counsel represented two parties; (ii) they bore the burden of proof on all merits-related and quantum-related issues; (iii) they drafted two more pleadings than Respondent, i.e., the Notice of Intent and Request for Arbitration; and (iv) Respondent's conduct increased costs.1550 The Tribunal attributes the disparity to the Parties' respective choices in legal counsel and case management. Even so, the Tribunal considers First Claimant's costs to exceed what is reasonable in this case.\n\nC-CS \u00b6 10; *see* C-CS Annex A, Table B(1)(b); *citing* **CL-280**, *Hydro S.r.l. and others v.

Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21, Award, 30 November 2017, \u00b6 734.\n\n1378.\n\nIn all the circumstances, the Tribunal confirms the reasonability of Respondent's costs, while being unable to confirm the reasonability of the totality of First Claimant's costs.\n\n***e. Conclusion on Allocation of Costs***\n------------------------------------------\n\n1379.\n\nTaking into account the Tribunal's conclusions above regarding (i) the relative success and failure of First Claimant and Respondent in respect of the claims and objections under the TPA and the ICSID Convention; (ii) their procedural conduct; and (iii) the reasonableness of costs claimed, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to distinguish between the Arbitration Costs and the Legal and Other Costs.\n\n1380.\n\nIn respect of the Arbitration Costs for the TPA and ICSID Convention claims and objections, the Tribunal decides that these shall be borne by First Claimant, on the basis that it was unsuccessful in establishing any of its claims, reflecting the principle of \"costs follow the event.\"\n\n1381.\n\nIn respect of the Legal and Other Costs, the Tribunal decides that each side shall bear its own respective costs. This determination adjusts the principle of \"costs follow the event\" in respect of these costs, in recognition of the conclusions above that (i) while First Claimant was unsuccessful in its claims, it succeeded in defending all but one of Respondent's jurisdictional objections; (ii) while First Claimant was unsuccessful in its claims, those claims were not frivolous. Since there is no order for Respondent to pay any part of First Claimant's Legal and Other Costs, there is no cost implication of the Tribunal's conclusion that it was unable to confirm the reasonability of First Claimant's costs.\n\n**(3) Overall Conclusion on the Allocation of Costs**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1382.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it has reached the same conclusion with respect to the allocation of costs under both the RER Contract and the TPA and ICSID Convention claims. First Claimant shall be responsible for the Arbitration Costs under the TPA and the ICSID Convention, and Second Claimant shall be responsible for the Arbitration Costs under the RER Contract. Each Party will bear its own individual Legal and Other Costs with respect to both claims.\n\n1383.\n\nSince Claimants made joint submissions and joint payments towards the Arbitration Costs and, as requested by Claimants, ICSID has jointly administered both claims, the Tribunal considers it appropriate for Claimants to be jointly responsible for the Arbitration Costs.\n\n1384.\n\nThere being no discrepancy between the Tribunal's determinations between the two types of claims, the Tribunal does not need to give further consideration to any implications that would have arisen from such a difference.\n\n**(4) Quantification of Costs**\n-------------------------------\n\n1385.\n\nTaking into account the Tribunal's decision at \u00b6\u00b6 1382-1384 above, the Tribunal quantifies the amount of the Arbitration Costs to be borne by Claimants.\n\n1386.\n\nSince each side will pay its own Legal and Other Costs in relation to both the TPA claims and the RER Contract claims, the Tribunal does not need to determine the amount of such costs.\n\n1387.\n\nThe Arbitration Costs, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' Fees and Expenses |  |\n| Prof. Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg | USD 602,662.97 |\n| Prof. Dr. Guido Tawil | USD 239,353.60 |\n| Prof. Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa | USD 227,148.51 |\n| ICSID's Administrative Fees | USD 220,000.00 |\n| Direct Expenses | USD 219,139.33 |\n| **Total** | **USD 1,508,304.41** |\n\n1388.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.1551 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 754,152.21.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a Final Financial Statement of the case fund. The remaining balance shall be reimbursed to the Parties based on the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n1389.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders Claimants to pay Respondent USD 754,152.21 for the expended portion of Respondent's advances to ICSID.\n\n1390.\n\nThe Tribunal further considers it appropriate for post-award interest to accrue on the amount awarded to Respondent as sought by Respondent, calculated at 3% per annum, compounded annually, until the date of full payment.\n\n**XII. CONCLUSIONS**\n--------------------\n\n1391.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal summarises its decisions with respect to each of the Parties' relief sought in this arbitration. The Tribunal considers the most recent requests for relief to be the Parties' respective current relief sought, and therefore bases its conclusions on the requests made in Claimants' Reply and Respondent's Rejoinder. To the extent these mirror requests made in their earlier submissions, cross-references are provided.\n\nA. **C laimants**\n-----------------\n\n1392.\n\nThe Tribunal reached the following conclusions with respect to the requests for relief set out in Claimants' Reply (see \u00b6 236 above). Where these requests also substantially mirror requests made in the Memorial, the Memorial reference is also provided.\n\n1393.\n\nRequest (a) for a declaration \"that Peru has breached Articles 10.4, 10.5 and 10.7 of the TPA\" (see Reply \u00b6 1045(a)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(a)). This request is rejected (see \u00b6 1279 above).\n\n1394.\n\nRequest (b) for a declaration as follows (see Reply \u00b6 1045(b)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(b)):\n\nthat Peru has breached its obligations under the RER Contract, including Peru's obligations: (i) under Clauses 1.4.26, 1.4.37, 2.2.1, 4.3, 6.3, 11.3, and Addenda 3-6 of the RER Contract; (ii) to execute the RER Contract in accordance with the Peruvian law doctrines of good faith, *actos propios*, and *confianza leg\u00edtima*; and (iii) to adhere to the review periods under the GLAP and TUPA, which form part of the governing law under the RER Contract[\u2026]\n\nThis request is rejected (see \u00b6\u00b6 993-994 above).\n\n1395.\n\nRequest (c) for a declaration \"that the RER Contract is terminated and, with it, all of CHM's obligations and duties owed thereunder\" (see Reply \u00b6 1045(c)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(c)): This request is partially granted, in respect of the declaration that the RER Contract is terminated, and the remaining language is rejected (see \u00b6 995 above).\n\n1396.\n\nRequest (d) for a declaration \"that the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated and, with it, all of CHM's obligations and duties owed thereunder\" (see Reply \u00b6 1045(d)): This request is rejected (see \u00b6 1317 above).\n\n1397.\n\nRequest (e) for an order for Respondent (see Reply \u00b6 1045(e)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(e)):\n\n\u2026to compensate Claimants for their losses resulting from Peru's breaches under the TPA, the RER Contract, Peruvian law, and international law, which, as of the date of this Memorial, amount to at least **US $45,620,000** but continue to increase due to the ongoing nature of Peru's unlawful breaches[\u2026]\n\nThis request is rejected (see \u00b6\u00b6 999, 1280 above).\n\n1398.\n\nRequest (f) for an order for Respondent (see Reply \u00b6 1045(f)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(f)):\n\n\u2026to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including Claimants' legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID's other costs[\u2026]\n\nThis request is rejected (see \u00b6 1389 above).\n\n1399.\n\nRequest (g) for a recommendation that Respondent (see Reply \u00b6 1045 (g)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(g)):\n\n\u2026cease and desist its harassment of CHM and its lawyer, [Second Claimant's External Counsel], by terminating the AEP's criminal proceeding concerning CHM's environmental permit for the Mamacocha Project[\u2026]\n\nThis request is rejected (see \u00b6\u00b6 1143 and 1280 above).\n\n1400.\n\nRequest (h) to order the Parties \"to protect the *status quo* and not aggravate the dispute pending resolution of the ICSID arbitration\" (see Reply \u00b6 1045(h) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(h)): The Tribunal did not consider such an order to be necessary in the course of these proceedings, and finds no basis to issue such an order in this Award. This request is rejected.\n\n1401.\n\nRequest (i) for an order that Respondent (see Reply \u00b6 1045(i)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(j)):\n\n\u2026may not call or collect any bond put up by either Claimant in relation to the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects, including the US $5 million bond under the RER Contract and the US $71,500 bond that CHM put up to obtain the final concession for the transmission line[\u2026]\n\nThis request is partially granted insofar as Respondent may not call or collect the USD 5 million Performance Bond put up under the RER Contract, and rejected in respect of the remaining requests (see \u00b6 996 above).\n\n1402.\n\nRequest (j) for an order for \"further relief as counsel may advise or the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate\" and request (k) for an award of \"such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate\" (see Reply \u00b6 1045(j) and (k)) (see also Memorial \u00b6 547(k)-(l)): No argument or particularised request has been made in relation to these requests. The Tribunal considers that it would violate its mandate if it were to grant relief outside the pleaded cases of the Parties. In the absence of further substantiation, these requests for relief are in the Tribunal's view meaningless legal recitations and are rejected.\n\n1403.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal partially grants the request at Memorial \u00b6 547(d) for a declaration that \"all bonds put up by either Claimants as part of the Mamacocha and Upstream Projects be returned to CHM, including the US $5 million performance bond under the RER Contract\" (see also Reply \u00b6 25). This request is granted with respect to the USD 5 million Performance Bond under the RER Contract to be returned to Second Claimant, and rejected in respect of the remaining requests (see \u00b6 996 above).\n\n1404.\n\nWith respect to the request at Memorial \u00b6 547(i) for an order for \"Peru to cease its pursuit of the Lima Arbitration pending resolution of the ICSID arbitration,\" the Tribunal considers this request to be moot, noting that the Lima Arbitration has terminated with an award in which the tribunal declined jurisdiction (see \u00b6 216 above).\n\n1405.\n\nTaking into account the Tribunal's conclusions reached in this Award and summarised above regarding Claimants' claims, Claimants' request to present updates to their damages figures at the end of the case, should they prevail on any of their claims, does not arise.\n\n**B. R espondent**\n------------------\n\n1406.\n\nThe Tribunal reached the following conclusions with respect to the requests for relief set out in Respondent's Rejoinder (see \u00b6 238 above). These mirror Respondent's requests for relief set out in its Counter-Memorial, which are expressed in slightly different terms but are not different in substance and are enumerated in the same subparagraph numbers (see \u00b6 237 above).\n\n1407.\n\nRequest (a) for the Tribunal to \"*declare con lugar las objeciones jurisdiccionales presentadas por el Per\u00fa*\" (see Rejoinder \u00b6 1390(a)): This request is granted with respect to the objection that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over First Claimant's claims with respect to the Upstream Projects under the TPA, and denied in all other respects (see \u00b6 568 above).\n\n1408.\n\nRequest (b) for the Tribunal to \"*rechace las reclamaciones de las Demandantes por falta de m\u00e9rito*,\" to the extent that it finds that it has jurisdiction with respect to one or more of those claims (see Rejoinder \u00b6 1390(b)): This request is granted consistent with the conclusions set out at \u00b6\u00b6 1393, 1394, 1396, 1397 and 1399 above, subject to the conclusions reached in relation to the declarations at \u00b6\u00b6 1395 and 1401 above.\n\n1409.\n\nRequest (c) for the Tribunal to: \"*rechace todas las dem\u00e1s peticiones accesorias de las Demandantes, incluyendo aquella relativa a la ejecuci\u00f3n de la Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento*\" (see Rejoinder \u00b6 1390(c)): This request is rejected in respect of the declaration on the Performance Bond as set out at \u00b6 1401 above. In respect of Claimants' other requests see \u00b6\u00b6 1395, 1396, 1399, 1400 and 1402 above.\n\n1410.\n\nRequest (d) that \"*en caso de que el Tribunal considere total o parcialmente improcedentes los petitorios (a), (b) y (c) arriba, rechace la solicitud de compensaci\u00f3n de las Demandantes*\" (see Rejoinder \u00b6 1390 (d)): Claimants' claims for compensation are rejected, as set out at \u00b6 1397 above.\n\n1411.\n\nRequest (e) to (see Rejoinder \u00b6 1390(e)):\n\n*condene a las Demandantes al pago de la totalidad de las costas procesales, as\u00ed como de la totalidad de los honorarios profesionales y gastos de abogados del Per\u00fa, y cualquier otro gasto incurrido por el Per\u00fa en el presente arbitraje, m\u00e1s un inter\u00e9s compuesto sobre esos montos antes y despu\u00e9s de emitido el laudo, hasta la fecha de pago, calculado con base en una tasa de inter\u00e9s razonable.*\n\nThis request is partially granted (see \u00b6\u00b6 1389-1390 above).\n\n**XIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n1412.\n\nFOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, the Tribunal renders the following decisions:\n\n(A) DECLARES that it has jurisdiction over First Claimant's claims under the TPA on its own behalf and on behalf of Second Claimant, with the exception that it has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over First Claimant's claims with respect to the Upstream Projects;\n\n(B) DECLARES that it has jurisdiction over Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract;\n\n(C) DECLARES that the RER Contract is terminated;\n\n(D) ORDERS that the USD 5 million Performance Bond under the RER Contract is to be returned to Second Claimant;\n\n(E) ORDERS that Respondent may not call or collect the USD 5 million Performance Bond under the RER Contract;\n\n(F) REJECTS, by majority, Second Claimant's claims under the RER Contract, subject to the declarations in Recitals (C), (D) and (E) above;\n\n(G) REJECTS, by majority, First Claimant's claims under the TPA on its own behalf and on behalf of Second Claimant;\n\n(H) ORDERS, by majority, that Claimants shall jointly bear the Arbitration Costs in an amount of USD 1,508,304.41, and accordingly shall reimburse Respondent USD 754,152.21 in respect of such costs;\n\n(I) ORDERS, by majority, that post-award interest shall accrue on the amount awarded to Respondent, calculated at 3% per annum, compounded annually, until the date of full payment;\n\n(J) DECLARES that each side shall bear its Legal and Other Costs;\n\n(K) REJECTS all other claims and requests.\n\nDate: [December 20, 2023]"}]}
